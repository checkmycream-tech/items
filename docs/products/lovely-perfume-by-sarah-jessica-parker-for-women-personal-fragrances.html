            <li>I think this one was made popular because of Orpah (shame on you..</li>
            <li>I just thought I was probably going to be doomed to be without that kind of enthusiasm over a perfume again.</li>
            <li>But each woman is her own, as for me I like to smell my perfume.</li>
            <li>I SMELLED LOVELY ON A LADY WALKING BY ONCE IN THE GROCERY STORE AND LOVED IT</li>
            <li>COMPLIMENTS AND LOVING THE WAY</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of this product and liked it, but the jury was still out as to how much I liked it.</li>
            <li>and she really liked the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice flowery scent.</li>

            <li>Product lived up to the expectation and my wife liked what I got for her.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I think that this fragrance is suited for the 50+ crowd.</li>

            <li>Ordered this for my daughter as I knew she liked the perfume.</li>

            <li>It smelt so nice</li>

            <li>When I tried it in the store I thought it was very strong.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>I always get so many compliments and I am glad I can still find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Thank you, Love, Love!</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li>I purchased Lovely for myself and i must admit it smells LOVELY!</li>
            <li>I love Lovely!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very pleasant and has good lasting qualities.</li>
            <li>I was just looking at popular scents and Lovely</li>
            <li>It has a bit of an \\&quot;old-world\\&quot;-ness to it...but as far as I am concerned, that is a wonderful thing.  </li>
            <li>I have worn BEAUTIFUL only by Estee Lauder for years, but am now alternating between LOVELY and BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li>bought it because it was cheap and had good reviews.</li>
            <li>Smells so nice :)</li>
            <li>So when ordering be sure your item is not classified as hazardous (perfume?)</li>
            <li>it is light and airy and I folks always say I smell good...</li>
            <li>She had looked for it retail and was thrilled when I was able to find it for her.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to be able to purchase it with you.</li>
            <li>This perfume is overwhelming with the strong scent of powder and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>Lovely is among the best celeb fragrances to-date, very wearable, not offensive, sample-worthy for most, and full-bottle-worthy for many.</li>
            <li>This smells just as good and is budget friendly.</li>
            <li>This is a very good, high quality product.</li>
            <li>The Elizabeth Taylor “White Diamonds” perfume would make a nice gift for a family member or friend at a very attractive and competitive price.</li>
            <li>Perfect blend of spicy, sophisticated, and soft.</li>
            <li>I  always get the most amazing compliments from both  men and women alike, when I wear Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker</li>
            <li>Huge bottle perfect for summer time light and very pretty scent</li>
            <li>I have had many people tell me it smells great, and it was the right scent for me.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Never fails to get me comments on how great I smell, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Great perfume, First time purchasing Sarah Jessica Parker.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this one would be ideal for anyone under the age of 35 unless you just have a particular love for this type of scent.</li>
            <li>The description of the perfume might not be very accurate.</li>
            <li>It is very light and does not overwhelm when wearing.  </li>
            <li>This eau de parfum has the very light odor can where for any ocassion I give this to my wife</li>
            <li>It has a very light smell.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light not over powering smell.  </li>
            <li>Many times what you like at first becomes not so great after about an hour.</li>
            <li>Nice purchase and easy use.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>good price, delivered quickly.</li>

            <li>Very light but noticeable and sexy...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s presented in a very classic bottle, and is a great gift idea</li>
            <li>Nice fine mist.</li>

            <li>I have purchased another SJP fragrance \\&quot;Covet\\&quot; and decided to take a chance on \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot;, so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic to boot!</li>
            <li>The best way to describe it is to put on a powder deoderant, go outside and sweat all day, and then, smell yourself....  </li>
            <li>This is the smell Lovely captures in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is so lovely it makes people call me lovely.</li>

            <li>alone or layer with LOVELY body lotion</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift many years ago</li>
            <li>Received my order quickly and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Normally I am a sweet, fruit, clean or citrusy person, but this is a great floral/clean and if you are looking for a new type of scent to try this is a great one to bridge to.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when i ordered it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the smell because I liked how it smelled in the evening...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, but not overpowering, and I just love it!</li>
            <li>Keeps me Happy, Thanks and Happy New Year.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it another try because I tend to like the more sweet smelling scents and this was not that kind of scent.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>It is such a beautiful, unique scent!!  </li>
            <li>When I opened the box and removed the bottle, my wife’s expression was WOW!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Very clean smell.</li>
            <li>it is a very clean, somewhat powdery fragrance ..</li>
            <li>It is a very clean scent with a hint of lavender.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for a fun yet elegant lunch date or any time you want to feel sexy and carefree!</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t like floral scents, but this is great.</li>
            <li>and I could still smell it so softly and beautifully on my hand.</li>
            <li>...a beautiful young lady leaned over me and asked what I was wearing.  </li>
            <li>It smells good on me, first of all.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell at first, when I saw the sampler in a magazine.</li>
            <li>I decided from the get go that I would wear it consistently and give it a fair chance, so after about 2 weeks or so of wear now</li>
            <li>This Parfum is very nice, particularly for the Summer.</li>
            <li>I wore Clinique Happy for 10 years and decided to try something new after the birth of my twins.</li>
            <li>So thanks to SJPs Lovely, I have a new favorite that is just perfect for anytime and every day.</li>
            <li>The scent is great - not too strong, not too sweet, just right for summer.</li>
            <li>This is a nice size to keep on my dresser for a quick touch-up at any time.</li>
            <li>it and let it dry, on your skin, see how it changes and truns into a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>Item rec&#x27;d quickly and pkg&#x27;d nicely.</li>
            <li>Sure makes buying for her easy.</li>
            <li>he has never been a fan of perfumes because of how strong most of them are.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my wife without smelling it based on good price and positive reviews online.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a rare scent that does not give me a sinus headache, so I also love it!</li>
            <li>This product received great reviews, and does smell when it&#x27;s not past</li>
            <li>I love this perfume because it can feel (smell) sophisticated and fun all at once!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the super fast delivery !!!  </li>
            <li>This is a great perfume and an excellent value, it lasts long like a very high end bottle is also very pretty to look at.</li>
            <li>It is full and rich and warm and elegant</li>
            <li>To me, there are strong floral notes top and end notes that feel very fresh, sophisticated, and feminine.</li>
            <li>Not overly strong, very clean scent.</li>
            <li>It has a very sweet smell but is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance, light and clean!</li>
            <li>I have purchased SJP fragances, they are not over powering nor very sweet smelling, so if you have expericed her fragances you are SAFE AND ENJOY.</li>
            <li>A more accurate name for this perfume could never have been found!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Favorite... please send coupon or free samples...</li>
            <li>And, more importantly, so does my husband.  </li>
            <li>I tried SJP&#x27;s \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; and fell instantly in love with the light, flowery fragrance.  </li>

            <li>Very elegant and pretty.</li>
            <li>My reacquaintance with Lovely confirmed that there was no need to purchase liquid sugar and walk around smelling like 45-year-old cotton candy.</li>
            <li>but i felt the perfume was more fit for a maore matured woman.</li>
            <li>Most of the times they smell tacky or cheap or smells like there&#x27;s nothing</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy this parfum, I have purchased this item many times through Amazon.com until now</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift and it arrived safe and sound and on time.  </li>
            <li>In Love&amp;#34; by Philosophy, and while it&#x27;s a lovely, light scent, it seems to disappear after a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, slightly exotic, day-or-night, layers of light, refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this light, playful fragrance...</li>
            <li>I always liked the fragrance Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker when it first came out.  </li>

            <li>Amazon made it easy to make my sister&#x27;s birthday &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean, elegant scent</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering or strong so it wears well at the office.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who wears it to work (even though we&#x27;re not supposed to wear perfume) and she gets away with it, because it&#x27;s not overly strong.  </li>
            <li>It is one scent I can wear without fear of offending others because of too strong of an aroma.  </li>
            <li>This is a good classic scent.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent</li>
            <li>this perfume has a strong smell and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>Smells great...not too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li>Not too strong at all.</li>
            <li>strongly urge against buying  this product.</li>
            <li>It has a strong apple martini flair to me.</li>
            <li>This particular scent is very clean, fresh, light and wonderful for a hot summer day.</li>
            <li>The smell is giving you impression as sweet, elegant, innocent but brave and strong woman in the same time.</li>
            <li>My wife asked me to buy her this perfume because she used it before and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>So I tried it and fell in love with it right away!  </li>
            <li>If it helps to know what I love which does not smell right on me, I can name Pheromone - love it</li>
            <li>And my closet also has that sweet fragrance. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, feminine scent designed for the female that desires an aura of sophistication and beauty.  </li>
            <li>It is a beautiful scent just the same.</li>
            <li>There is something beautifully comforting yet altogether mysterious.</li>
            <li>the problem was but this was NOT the true Lovely.  </li>
            <li>Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker is a light, clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I like trying new perfumes when a good deal rolls around, but this will always be my go-to perfume.</li>
            <li>Over the course of the day, it&#x27;s just less impressive to me.</li>
            <li>I normally like to have my own \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot;, but the smell of Lovely was so mezmerizing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lovely for since the product first came out, and I love it -</li>
            <li>Ive used Lovely since it first came out and love it.  </li>
            <li>It may be worth noting that I&#x27;ve dropped the bottle a fair number of times and it&#x27;s never broken!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fine if you plan to stay home and can re-spritz, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Love it quick delivery</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick too!</li>
            <li>Anyway I tried on and it just smells like &amp;#34;dollar tree cheap scents&amp;#34; along with strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>It is a super deal - can&#x27;t find it any cheaper than on Amazon - I looked everywhere!</li>
            <li>Love it, Quick delivery</li>
            <li>This is a very nice classic fresh and floral scent that lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li>but i feel like the perfume would be more suitable for more mature women.  </li>

            <li>Hope u will keep it available.</li>
            <li>I see now that the seller did not guarantee 100% genuine.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I re-ordered this one because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly cheap</li>
            <li>It smells too wonderful to waste on days that I&#x27;m not dressed to the nines.</li>

            <li>I guess, it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is a powdery, flowery almost a light musk in scent.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the ease of which it is to shop Amazon.</li>
            <li>SJP&#x27;s &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; is light and floral.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to over-apply it, just a light dab/or spray</li>
            <li>The scent is light and alluring.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s light and fun!</li>
            <li>Sarah Jessica and Coty have down a wonderful thing here - a scent that is feminine without being overly floral, and sweet without being too sweet.</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Taylor “White Diamonds” perfume would be great for special occasions as well as for every day use.</li>
            <li>It smells great right out of the bottle and settles in for a soft, sweet scent that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>Light, clean scent</li>
            <li>Light, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great scent that&#x27;s sweet but not too teen</li>
            <li>I was looking for something soft, elegant, and suitable for both day and evening wear.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance because it is light and smells pretty.  </li>
            <li>I bought this perfume for my wife , this is a lovely fragrance and the price was very reasonable. .</li>
            <li>Overall, I think its one of the best new perfumes out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells exactly as it is named: Lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and slightly sweet smelling to me.</li>
            <li>I first decided to purchase Lovely because I just wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed it on I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it.</li>
            <li>Perfume is unique to each person and their body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Lovely is exactly what this perfume is about.</li>
            <li>I received this product, unopened and in original packaging, within a week from the time i had placed the order.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original box still wrapped.  </li>
            <li>Smell lasts and its soon pretty. :)</li>
            <li>I ordered and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume sooo much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has an original scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rich and soft, and sexy and most importantly</li>
            <li>This is a fragrance that is perfect for a formal dress affair, a small spritz for going to work or anytime you are looking for an anywhere, anytime perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Love love love this scent I have actually been followed around in stores before and asked what I was wearing one man</li>
            <li>unique</li>
            <li>I got it originally for my girlfriend who is 32</li>
            <li>I found that the fragrance did not stay with me as the original one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh scent!  </li>
            <li>but Lovely is exactly what it says...</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell like it smell in the original department stores.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because I hoped I would get an original Eau de Parfum</li>
            <li>first time trying Lovely</li>
            <li>At first, I was between getting the $83 Narciso Rodriguez&#x27;s for her or the $38 SJP&#x27;s Lovely.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this SJP fragrance because I&#x27;m a fan</li>
            <li>The perfume smelled exactly the way it&#x27;s suppose to, it is authentic.</li>
            <li>Totally worth!</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and different from most of the overly sweet pungent odors out so often.</li>
            <li>I remember first smelling it, spraying some on myself, and not being able to stop sniffing my wrist.  </li>
            <li>Unique fragrance...</li>
            <li>I am finding that I do like the scent much better than I did at first.</li>
            <li>My two great Aunts&#x27; apartment had this very same scent throughout each room, except the kitchen with the aroma of good Italian cooking.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product.  </li>
            <li>I doubt that is this original?</li>
            <li>Musk and Lavender give this fragrance a warm confidence while the mingling of precious essential oils creates a classically poetic blend of refined nuances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d been looking for a new perfume for awhile, and just couldn&#x27;t find anything I really liked.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells beautiful, when you first spray it it does have that traditional &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This parfum has a clean, feminine, day-to-evening scent.  </li>
            <li>The most elegant, classy perfume out there.  </li>
            <li>but I really have no idea how it smells, baut knowing this actress it has to be light and lovely.</li>
            <li>It has a clean scent to it.</li>
            <li>When I change our sheets I lightly spray the mattress pads with it and it makes the fresh bedding smell fantastic and always impresses our guests.</li>
            <li>Lovely smells like something soft, alluring, and sexy all at once.  </li>
            <li>I wear it everyday to work and since it was gifted by my husband its very very special to me.&lt;br /&gt;Its light and crisp and very refreshing :)&lt;</li>
            <li>&quot; the scent is so clean, soft and refreshing!  </li>
            <li>It had many positive reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft, feminine scent and lovely!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light with a musk undertone that is very feminine.  </li>
            <li>It has this very light flowery smell, very soothing.</li>
            <li>only downside is that the scent does not last on me and have to reapply too often ..  if you don&#x27;t like the strong, overpowering scents, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Just right for me!</li>
            <li>So I went to the reviews and they were right!</li>
            <li>fragrance is hard to describe but there is something so feminine and wonderful about it.  </li>
            <li>Shipment was quick and I was excited about that.</li>
            <li>I saw it first introduced on Oprah and how much she liked it.</li>
            <li>Lovely is a bit romantic, suitable for date-nights, bedtime, weekends, but not the office imo.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light fresh</li>
            <li>This is one of my absolute favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>It is fresh and light but stays on for hours .  </li>
            <li>It has a sickly sweet smell.</li>
            <li>He kept saying throughout the entire evening how good I smelled.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get a good bottle, put everything in a box and ship it back</li>
            <li>A nice soft scent.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li>Sweet smelling scent.</li>
            <li>Lovely floral fragrance that is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I took a chance after reading several good reviews.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li>This definitely is one of the good ones.</li>
            <li>Initially, I knew I loved this perfume (before my Amazon purchase) from a sample ad in a magazine.  </li>
            <li>dunno, it had a deep scent feeling to me, nothing bright and fresh and light.</li>
            <li>I really had preferred the scent to most others I have.</li>
            <li>...the packaging, style of the bottle and definitely the price were quite good.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s sweet smelling not tangy.</li>
            <li>I was delighted by such scent!!!</li>
            <li>Very floral and feminine:).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like cloying sweet perfumes that can be overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I wear it all the time and people constantly tell me I smell good and want to know what I am wearing.  </li>
            <li>My true test is if anyone compliments my fragrance and that did not happen.  </li>
            <li>I just love the light  scent,  how fresh this perfume is and how it lasts so gently....</li>
            <li>I am very fussy about fragrances; so many are just stinky.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, floral and crisp, with a light citrus freshness and a hint of sweet.</li>
            <li>, it smells kind of old</li>
            <li>Light and fresh</li>
            <li>This is quite sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>Then the honey sweet scent mellows into an evocative warmth with hints of hugs and memories of corsages at weddings.</li>
            <li>I like that the scent is not overly powerful and is light and airy.</li>
            <li>This is my mother-in-laws absolute favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>This perfume has a sweet, seductive and alluring scent..</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because it smells good but not that lasting.</li>
            <li>The smell is really fresh and light.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Wife won&#x27;t wear it and the bottle is almost full</li>
            <li>Out of my whole perfume collection, and I have many....</li>
            <li>and it last eight plus hours Good stuff ..</li>
            <li>Modern Muse cost more than 4 times</li>

            <li>Recommend this perfume to anyone who wants to smell Lovely.</li>
            <li>Very affordable, lovely smell for the summer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li>I am a 37-year old man who first experienced this extraordinary fragrance on my wife 2 years ago, and it is the first scent that has ever caused me to sit in a chair for hours bundling up my shirt just to continue smelling it while she is away.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think her perfume would smell as good as it does, I figured it was just another celebrity hawking a new product.  </li>
            <li>Saved almost half off retail with free shipping &amp; no tax- great deal.</li>
            <li>When first opening the bottle the fragrance seems sweet and strong.</li>
            <li>If you like a strong flowery smell (old lady) then you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite scents not too strong but strong enough</li>
            <li>Exactly the gift I wanted to give  -- Thank goodness could find it so easily</li>
            <li>Amazon is a great deal compared to U1ta and other retail stores which is about twice the price.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am happy with the items I order from amazon</li>
            <li>We love how the smell stays and it smells good even if she is has already sweat a little or exposed to the heat.</li>
            <li>Not a very bold scent, but smells great.</li>
            <li>Seriously, it is the perfect scent for any occasion.</li>
            <li>it does settled into a clean, fresh scent that you can&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li>A CLEAN FRESH SCENT, NOT OVERPOWERING.</li>
            <li>It was like a fresh clean just out of the shower smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle but wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I prefer something fresh, floral and clean.  </li>

            <li>like you&#x27;d have to be a pregnant version of whoever shot Bambi&#x27;s mom to be put off by this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I would consider Lovely my all time classic scent that I wear.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a budget-friendly perfume that doesn&#x27;t smell budget-friendly, I highly recommend checking out Lovely.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after reading so many rave reviews, with high hopes.</li>
            <li>I usually give this to my wife because it has a very good smell.</li>
            <li>It was light and disappeared quickly the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I suggest for any scent, if it&#x27;s available in the dept. store, to try it first.</li>
            <li>Amazing, very romantic and unique.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Amazon has by far a better deal price wise,  compared to the local stores.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, A new and different product to be used personally, highly recommended to buy again in this store.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed right out of the bottle is this stuff is strong.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is getting harder to find than other Sarah Jessica Parker scents, so Amazon has been a great venue to get it at a good price point.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought any new perfume for myself in many years because I am so picky.</li>
            <li>I love trying new fragrances</li>
            <li>The perfume itself came brand new which I enjoyed.</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>My favorite new signiture scent.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overly sweet or flowery, just the right amount.</li>
            <li>Everything was easy, fast and a pleasure.</li>
            <li>The sweet fragrance could be enjoyed by both teens and adult women.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a nice, clean, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>It is not too strong, yet leaves a very indelible impression.</li>
            <li>purchased it without testing, only because it was the first perfume in the collection, and it must be good since people are still buying</li>
            <li>A very nice, subtle and sophisticated floral fragrance.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>Very prompt shipping too!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different an most hand my husband loves it!</li>
            <li>This perfume really lives up to it&#x27;s name!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended perfume. !!!</li>
            <li>This perfume has such a lovely scent!</li>
            <li>This is my current favorite scent (since 2005!).</li>
            <li>My second FAVORITE perfume!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last all day, but can always spray more on!</li>
            <li>The delivary time was exactly as it was stated on my invoice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I have something new and makes me feel very &#x27;womanly&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Lovely has such strong flowery and citrusy notes.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts all day and after the initial spray the scent is not overpowering but very feminine and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Its not my absolute favorite, but its pleasant for everyday.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and priced right.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!!</li>
            <li>I was actually reminded quite a bit of my great aunt when I sprayed it the first time, which was nice, but not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found a large bottle for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyhow, my bad manners came in handy since it smells wonderful on her.</li>
            <li>I thought, just another celebrity-endorsed cheap smelling thing, and with Jessica Parker&#x27;s name to boot, someone whose taste in clothes I don&#x27;t much admire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came real fast</li>
            <li>He is sensitive to a lot of smells &amp; most perfumes give him headaches.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t worth for the money</li>
            <li>Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker is a soft, long-lasting fragrance that does not seem to bother those around me that are prone to migraine headaches and/or allergies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that has something to do with my natural body oil and how it affects the perfume&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
            <li>I like this perfum because it smells feminine and fresh.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s different from what I already own, and 3) it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li>(well worth the price).</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d just wasted $20 instead of spending just $10 more in a local store for the REAL fragrance I really loved!!</li>
            <li>i didnt get one for myself because i rarely use perfume</li>
            <li>the perfume, i like its smile</li>
            <li>I love the soft scent.  </li>
            <li>But nice enough to gift.</li>
            <li>It could last me a year or so to be honest.</li>
            <li>It takes sometime getting used to the smell because I was into Estee Lauder and Donna Karan line of pefume, more of the soft &amp; flowery scent,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; from a department store when it was first introduced and I loved it even though it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>Worth trying.</li>
            <li>Fresh but not too</li>
            <li>I mostly wear Light Blue and wanted to try others.</li>
            <li>It charges you almost 4 dollars and my two year old son did even better than Amazon.</li>
            <li>I order this perfume often and this is so old that the scent is more like alcohol.</li>
            <li>My young siser like the Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker for Women.  </li>
            <li>irritated me further was when I found out the fragrances are considered hazardous material and are not returnable.</li>
            <li>retrospect, I feel it would be age appropriate for anyone looking for a mature smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li>Like a lady fresh out of the shower on a summers day.</li>
            <li>Soft, lovely, feminine scent.</li>
            <li>Worth buying it .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Lovely, is light, with multiple layers of scent.</li>
            <li>While it smells fresh and floral (with a hint of spice)</li>
            <li>This fragrance smells nice and is moderately priced.</li>
            <li>one of my all-time favorite fragrances in my adult life to date.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely quite nice and</li>
            <li>Such a nice fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>Or else you&#x27;ll be stuck with a full bottle that will probably be passed down to your great grandchildren, like I most likely will be.</li>
            <li>fragrance is just perfect for day wear, not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t make others around you feel like they&#x27;re being choaked like so many other flowery scents do.</li>
            <li>The Lovely cologne (Sarah Jessica Parker) was a favorite, but this particular bottle is not the same scent.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of Mademoiselle Coco Chanel, but obviously a lot more budget friendly.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the original Lovely by SJP scent.</li>
            <li>found this scent several years ago, i really love it, it&#x27;s light and smells wonderful, although its getting harder to find i will keep buying it as long as i can.</li>
            <li>came quickly and was exactly like the perfume I have always used.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good price for this perfume and it&#x27;s pretty hard to find in stores, so</li>
            <li>The first couple bottles I ordered were fine, seemed to be the real thing</li>
            <li>It just seemed to smell like everything else out there right now.</li>
            <li>I doused myself with it and got right in his face....</li>
            <li>, that makes the right amount of presence.</li>
            <li>and i got it right away thank you</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>but this perfume is just right for me.</li>
            <li>the price was definitely right too.  </li>
            <li>The price is right too.  </li>
            <li>Just right for all occasions.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of floral fragrance.</li>
            <li>Soft and fresh always get a lot so compliments on what I&#x27;m wearing, used this since it 1st came out wished they made a powder!!</li>
            <li>I have been using Lovely perfume as long as it has been available.  </li>
            <li>Nice size i got the same size in macys much higher cost.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised when I smelled this for the first time;  just fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Sweet and soft and light.  </li>
            <li>It is nice but not young or fresh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but I think next time I will go for something slightly more floral, or citrus-y</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you want a light scent.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase Lovely perfume from Amazon at half the price of retail stores.</li>
            <li>If you like a light fragrance but one that last all day without being too strong</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any woman who likes clean, fresh fragrances that can be worn day or night.</li>
            <li>I do not like overly strong floral or fruity fragrances, and Lovely is certainly not one of those obnoxious scents that overwhelms the room.</li>
            <li>Well if he loves it, my 25 year old daughter loves it and of course I love it, then I would say it&#x27;s likely you will like it or maybe love it yourself.</li>
            <li>Spray lightly for intimate settings, more heavy-handed for public gatherings &amp; wide-open</li>
            <li>Really not sure if I am reviewing the product or Amazon, but completely happy with both.</li>
            <li>must say nice fragrance and stay is also long lasting&lt;br /&gt;nice packing by amazon and timely delivery of the product&lt;</li>
            <li>The fragrance is really nice and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Everyone said this smells so fresh and clean, but I smell too much chemical mixed in for me to love it</li>
            <li>The good thing about it is the price keeps going steadily down</li>
            <li>she is relatively new to wearing fragrance and was looking for something \\&quot;light and feminine...a scent that would make an impression upon leaving or entering a room\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This smells fine however, I dont feel it suit young as it is kind of flat!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far too strong( Hit you over the head</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or strong smelling.  </li>
            <li>It smells good on me, although I&#x27;m realizing that I like the scent less as the day moves on.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000C1ZDTU Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker for Women, Eau de Parfum, 3.4-Ounce Spray Bottle]]This is a wonderfully light, refreshing and subtle scent.</li>

            <li>.....thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast despite all the snow and ice that was falling.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t even as strong as the Lovely body spray for half the cost.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery and exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This was my second purchase of Lovely.</li>
            <li>got this Lovely perfume by SJP as a gift, after months of raving about it after I tested it in a department store, and use it regularly for everyday/office wear.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this since I first saved my allowance to buy.</li>
            <li>and if I had read them first I probably would not have bought it.</li>
            <li>I have used Lovely for several bottles.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that the perfume does not stay on.</li>
            <li>and this is exactly how she&#x27;d smell\\&quot;--no way.</li>
            <li>Pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Lovely for several years and defiantly feel I have found my signature scent.</li>
            <li>it smells exactly as the name...</li>
            <li>My favorite daily one!</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Lovely Eau de Parfum for several years.</li>
            <li>Even though I can often not smell it on myself everybody around me seems to because they always ask what scent I&#x27;m wearing and how much they like it!</li>
            <li>The description told me exactly what I needed to know concerning size and type.</li>
            <li>This fragrance has been a favorite of mine for several years.  </li>
            <li>:) Overall I would do this again.</li>
            <li>Aside from the lightening fast shipping, I must rave over this scent!  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t seem interested at the time, so I delayed making a purchase.  </li>
            <li>When I got it, it smelled exactly like what my mom likes to smell like.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I do not have expertise in scents</li>
            <li>I hope this product is not fake</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this one  (Lovely), is definitely a winner!  </li>
            <li>I give this a one star because my husband hates it on me and it would Most likely give my co-workers a headache...</li>
            <li>The box and bottle are both pretty if gift giving.  </li>
            <li>Just enough balance of romance plus sexy.  </li>
            <li>she love it the only problem with!!!!!.  </li>
            <li>this is the first review I have ever written about anything I have ordered through amazon.  </li>
            <li>My latest bottle should last for quite some time</li>
            <li>so I can apply as much as I want!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, but just enough to enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The seller \\&quot;Pretty Princess\\&quot; DID NOT SEND what I ordered, they subsistuted my order without informing me of the change, they are unavailable for emails and never responded to my repeated requests for a review of my order</li>
            <li>My second go to perfume:).</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering fragrance from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The only fragrance I&#x27;ve ever finished completely is Lovely.</li>
            <li>Bought it several years ago and received many compliments.</li>
            <li>I took it home and out of frustration tried a couple more times and it finally sprayed for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The same perfume can smell differently in many people -it</li>
            <li>Lesson learned: if you want a real thing, buy it from a department store!</li>
            <li>This is the first perfume I bought that I did not like.</li>
            <li>Finally, I deciding to purchase Lovely, untried, based on a majority of rave reviews of how wearable and \\&quot;lovely\\</li>
            <li>because omg I almost followed her around like a creepy person cause she smelled amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Most perfumes give me such headaches but this one did not.</li>
            <li>Use this perfum since first on market.</li>
            <li>It lasts a very longtime while not having to use alot, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Funny story:</li>
            <li>So many different perfumes give me a headache, but this one does not.  </li>
            <li>First sniff</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and fast!  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and always go back after trying others.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just one girl&#x27;s opinion; I&#x27;m sure there are others who might feel differently....</li>
            <li>I will admit that when i first sprayed it, i did not like it but within 5 minutes after it sunk in</li>
            <li>I first learned of this frangrance from a co-worker.  </li>
            <li>, funny I realized the reason I always buy the knock off version of this</li>
            <li>This year she wasn&#x27;t expecting it, but did not buy any more after hers ran out last year.</li>
            <li>I have to reapply mid day but it is really lovely.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>can be worn to work or as an enticing fragrance for a first date.</li>
            <li>Women really like it!</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it has one scent , but as the day goes by the smell changes.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re still interested in trying it, you might consider getting the smaller size until you&#x27;re sure this is what you want to spend your money on.</li>
            <li>Pretty container.</li>
            <li>Really like it a lot!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t return it because of shipping issues, but this is the first defective product that I&#x27;ve received from Amazon.</li>
            <li>there are top notes of floral, with a basic musk and amber underlayer.</li>
            <li>, although I do recommend you try it out first before buying.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice perfume -- not too sweet or heavy.  </li>
            <li>Will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>Unless you are famliliar with the scent first.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what it was supposed to be and the shipper was handled the order post haste.</li>
            <li>stores only carry the latest tweeny fragrances.  </li>
            <li>and it came to me exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>plan on ordering from this vendor again in the future as i was 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>An item that is not returnable be aware</li>
            <li>My first time ordering perfume on the internet.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is actually lovely like the name and it last longer evn aftr hours of having it on you</li>
            <li>The perfumes I priced were smaller for more money.  </li>
            <li>It smells \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; because its not heavy or too light.</li>
            <li>Very fast..love this perfume!</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been wearing it since 2005 when it first came out.</li>
            <li>More upsetting is that it arrived open (without the sealed wrapping), looks like as if it was a return of another costumer which they resent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for an everyday scent.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for casual events and to be worn during the day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for those looking for something that&#x27;s not too bold but will still set you aside from the crowd.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new scent that wasn&#x27;t too sweet or fruity.  </li>
            <li>Arrived right on time not broken...</li>
            <li>This scent is for a more mature woman, I instantly felt like a sophisticated 47 year old woman, I began knitting and talking about the stocks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lovely, on the other hand, is aptly named.  </li>
            <li>Love it, it smells so good, get a lot of compliments but not sure about it last effects.</li>
            <li>:) With that being said it was really hard to find a perfume that wasn&#x27;t overwhelming in it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly musky scent but mostly floral and a clean scents.</li>
            <li>This is a clean, clear, and mellow scent.</li>
            <li>This is a soft clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Soft and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It is a light floral with distinct undertones of white pepper.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to describe it, just soft and so feminine, like beautiful smelling soap.  </li>
            <li>It came nicely wrapped in its original box, and it&#x27;s a pretty large bottle so it will last for a long time!</li>
            <li>Loved your Endless too!!!</li>
            <li>Only takes a couple spritzes because its  strong at first</li>
            <li>very true that individual results vary.</li>
            <li>and I saw lots of positive reviews about this product and ordered it.</li>
            <li>This perfume had been my favorite for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is a lovely scent, only not for a woman in her 20&#x27;s, unless you need yarn and knitting needles which magically appear when spritzed on.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much when I first tried this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a scent like Lovely for a long time.</li>
            <li>After about 4hrs it&#x27;s pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li>This was my first real splurge on &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; perfume, but I guess I needed to keep looking.</li>
            <li>When the perfume was worn in public several friends said complimentary words about the fragrance and asked what was it, they liked it.</li>
            <li>just a small spray will leaving you smelling gorgeous all day.</li>
            <li>smells of soft sweet wood.</li>
            <li>THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFUMES, SOFT ENOUGH TO BE JUST RIGHT.....</li>
            <li>I find Lovely to be a beautiful, complex, slightly unisex perfume with floral and woody accords.</li>
            <li>the bottle seems real the smell seems genuine however it seems to be watered down because the scent wesrs off very quickly.</li>
            <li>I hope you continue to carry Lovely for as long!</li>
            <li>I was kind of wary about buying this because I hadn&#x27;t actually smelled it before, but I needed a new perfume and this one was reasonably priced with good reviews!</li>
            <li>&quot; If cost is no issue in purchasing body sprays, I would recommend buying this particular bottle, because it was a very simple yet sophisticated scent and could be kept on one&#x27;s person without too much difficulty.</li>
            <li>There was a problem at first because only one bottle of a two bottle order was shipped, but it was corrected immediately and everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s delicate and pleasant and has become their trademark scent.</li>
            <li>They all seem to smell strong and about the same.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong which I personally like --</li>
            <li>This size is large.  </li>
            <li>One thing I do know for certain, I will not be purchasing this perfume again.</li>
            <li>And, I will positively purchase this item again from Amazon, since the price was so reasonable.</li>
            <li>Perfume is a very personal product and looking at the reviews, I&#x27;m surprised so many women order perfume without seeing how the perfume works with their body chemistry first.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found Lovely at a &amp;#34;perfume store&amp;#34; and purchased a few.</li>
            <li>The smell is womanly sophisticated, soft, sweet, and classy.</li>
            <li>guess anyone wanting a beautiful delicate fragrance that is not strong will love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try to be considerate of co-workers that may be allergic to perfumes, so maybe I don&#x27;t apply enough for it to last all day, but I really love to wear this perfume!</li>
            <li>It was very strong, loud, with a dry down of rose??</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great from first spray all the way to the dry down.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing on my girlfriend...was a little hesitant to buy it not knowing what it smelled like</li>
            <li>It is a soft, pleasant smell and not strong smelling ----and</li>
            <li>Not most favorite but like at night after ready for bed and clean smelling smell.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended, and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced that if you don&#x27;t like it on you, you aren&#x27;t out a lot of money.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little bit for an older age, but very fresh, light, and pretty.</li>
            <li>Initially upon receiving this perfume I was madly in love with it; however, after a little over a month of owning it, the lovely floral scent has vanished and taken on an offensive rubbing alcohol scent.</li>
            <li>My sister was very surprised!!</li>
            <li>The is my favorite perfume, not too strong but not too subtle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34;, a light feminine scent that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>This perfume is just light enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother him</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just light enough to smell</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a delicate, soft scent, then definitely try this awesome perfume.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and received it without any damage.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t blow too much $$$.  </li>
            <li>face telling her to smell it now because it was really changing every minute that I had it on</li>
            <li>It really lasts.</li>
            <li>But I say you really should take the chance and get it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon.com</li>
            <li>and I really wanted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know I will get the real thing, not a knock-off.  </li>
            <li>It has made me very cautious about where I shop.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to sell the $40 bottle I got.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Obviously being newly in love, and the perfume one that &#x27;worked&#x27; with her body chemistry are always the foundation of such a statement, but this perfume to this day is just as powerfully alluring, and I am still immobilized by it.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated the sealed box as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to perfume and body sprays.</li>
            <li>Lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>A light sample to ones wrist leads to a totally different conclusion.</li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced and shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>I received my product extremley fast, there was no damage.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>expected more:</li>
            <li>-The One, Light Blue...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very feminine.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that it&#x27;s reasonably priced and the bottle is &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; too?</li>
            <li>I gave it as a gift, and it was much</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>since one does not need to spray much on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m on my way to finishing the whole bottle already.</li>
            <li>Very Sarah Jessica Parker (or what I would think she was like).</li>
            <li>so I really wanted to try it..</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not romantic and it&#x27;s not what a young person wants to be smelling like, but I am glad I got to purchase</li>
            <li>Never again will I purchase this perfume but the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>but I really hope I can always find it here on Amazon when I run out.</li>
            <li>Classy but fun scent.  </li>
            <li>much appreciated bonus: my husband loves it.</li>
            <li>ONCE PAID MUCH MONEY</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very affordable  </li>
            <li>This is such a light scent you can wear it</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t as crazy about the scent as I thought I&#x27;d be, but I got a huge bottle of perfum for a low price, that shipped quickly, so really it was a very fair experience!</li>
            <li>Gently.</li>
            <li>the shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>I really wonder why would anyone on this planet like a scent like this?</li>
            <li>Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, J&#x27;Adore by DIOR.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her absolute fave.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon.com for carrying it.</li>
            <li>My order arrived fast.</li>
            <li>then I thought it would (and said it would) and was packaged really well.</li>
            <li>this is very close.</li>
            <li>Very feminine</li>
            <li>Of course, items held in inventory are always fast and expeditious in delivery</li>
            <li>Watered-down - doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real thing;</li>
            <li>I like light scents that last.  </li>
            <li>This is a very feminine  body fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect fragrance to use if you have allergy suffers around you.</li>
            <li>It came packaged very well</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Very feminine and always catches the attention of others.</li>
            <li>was fast</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this fragrance to one and all!  </li>
            <li>You really have to smell it for yourself.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I only wish the lotion was still available.  </li>
            <li>Its like a knock off of the real thing.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m assuming it doesn&#x27;t stand out too much either way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While at the mall, I tried Modern Muse and to me, these smell a lot alike.  </li>
            <li>definitely I would say this is cheap quality and duplicate one...</li>
            <li>Very feminine</li>
            <li>but yet you can&#x27;t really put it into words...  </li>
            <li>I do not believe this is the real product.</li>
            <li>; even really likes it and</li>
            <li>I thought this perfume was the real thing.</li>
            <li>this perfume has very musky smell to it.</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t beat how fast shipping is with Amazon prime.</li>
            <li>This is a classy scent that is fresh yet feminine.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Pair that with fast shipping</li>
            <li>I do not like heavy perfumes, or women who choose to overdo their own perfume application and</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not a huge SJP fan, there is something feminine, fun and confident about this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Soft, refreshing fragrance but definitely detectable.</li>
            <li>what kind of gift she would want, when she casually mentioned that she had just run out of her #1 favorite perfume, \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; by Sarah Jessica Parker.</li>
            <li>This is floral without being too heavy, feminine without smelling like an English rose garden, and has just the right hints of woman and fresh youth.  </li>
            <li>I first purhased this perfume at a well-known dept. store in New York and they no longer carry it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive in terms of perfume, so I bought a bottle on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This scent is &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s a new favorite for a long time to come!  </li>
            <li>Love the way it is light and subtle.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping for something really different and unique.</li>
            <li>After a rough and tumble week sampling a number of sweet scents du jour (WD With Love, Escada Moon Sparkle, BS Fantasy, JS Fancy, Halle, Angel), I starting wondering if I ought to go out an get me a bottle of liquid confection.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like floral type perfumes (I like more spicier ones), but this perfume is an exception!</li>
            <li>received this and while it smelled identical to the fragrance (a lot more than I can say for some other &amp;#34;haute&amp;#34; designer fragrance assortments I&#x27;ve tried), so I was hopeful.</li>
            <li>It does last a significant amount of hours during the day.  </li>
            <li>Its a classy yet flirty scent, a little spicy and sweet and very unique.</li>
            <li>I had very high expectation from this perfume because of the high rating.</li>
            <li>When I first used this scent I really dislike the smell of it (Old lady scent)I thought to myself.</li>
            <li>Lovely has an active, jaunty fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell old or too sweet (young).</li>
            <li>LOVELY usually has a wonderful, fresh fragrance - this particular bottle of LOVELY is  very disappointing - not the same at all.  </li>
            <li>im not bog into super strong smells, and this one is pretty delicate, but def noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying several to share with my special friends.</li>
            <li>It has the delicate flowery scent that I love without fading quickly like B&amp;BW perfumes do.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, just that it does not long enough to think that it is an eau de parfum.</li>
            <li>I am a 31 year old professional, I wear it daily and out at night, and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I had received a sample by mail from a local retailer, but I found I could get the same item through Amazon.com at a more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I generally opt out for fresh scented body wash</li>
            <li>But its a bit too mature smelling for me, seems like something women over 30, or maybe over 35 would like to wear, I&#x27;m 27yrs old, I love feminine scents, I like White Diamond, and Xclamation, and some Elizabeth Taylor ones, but this one was just</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I sprayed it on was the musky old lady smell.  </li>
            <li>Came on the right day plus it was cheap almost like half off.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this over and over again and glad the price has gone down</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh and has a little bit of a soapy scent.  </li>
            <li>I think I found my new go to scent!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance, very delicate and light.</li>
            <li>She had such a hard time finding it in the stores and it was a great price.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and delivered right on time!</li>
            <li>It is a light scent that I can wear all summer long!</li>
            <li>I really knew better, fell in love with this scent at a local store, just a little dab on my wrist held the scent for several hours.</li>
            <li>keep in mind, less is more.</li>
            <li>The parfum is an older ladies&#x27; scent.  </li>
            <li>Men buy this for your main lady, mistress, or chick on the side and you too will experience the temptation to pounce.</li>
            <li>Its definitely a classic style rather than contemporary - think Chanel rather than J Lo or Brittney.  </li>
            <li>I have worn Chanel Chance, RL Romance, RL Turquoise and Especially Escada most recently.</li>
            <li>This is a classic fragrance, not your overpowering J-Lo, B&#x27;Spears, etc.  </li>
            <li>There are some fruity notes listed that don&#x27;t quite come out on my skin, so the whole scent smells dry rather than sweet on me, which is definitely a plus: sweet perfumes intesify on my skin and lead to headaches and sneezing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is over rated and for an older crowd,</li>
            <li>Wondering if it is an older product???</li>
            <li>This scent is really soft and fresh, but mature.</li>
            <li>It is bold without being ostentatious, with several floral notes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn much more expensive scents, but I never get as many compliments and questions about what I&#x27;m wearing as I do when I wear this one.</li>
            <li>I think this is a smell that fits an older person</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it was as enjoyable to smell as I could have expected.</li>
            <li>Coming down from this olfactory sugar high, I clearly detect sweetness in Lovely at a reasonable level, just enough to satisfy my taste for sweet scents.</li>
            <li>I love it, my husband loves it, my friends, coworkers, and people I have randomly encountered in social situations love it and have commented on it!</li>
            <li>I was really satisfied with my previous orders, but on my last purchase I feel that there is smell of alcohol a bit more than it actually should be, therefore if I apply more than 2 sprays it gives me a little headache.</li>
            <li>Smell is not too strong and is a good mix of flowery with a little stronger undertone, maybe spicy or musky, it&#x27;s hard to say.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent when I first put it on, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments on it because it doesn&#x27;t last, even when I spray extra.</li>
            <li>So when SJP came out with Lovely and first tried it this brought me back to those days spent in SoHo.</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>All I can say is my wife loves this perfume , I&amp;#34;ve been buying for years on amazon because it beats the high end retail stores prices &amp; bottle size in oz&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I know that this fragrance is made with high quality oils..and</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I would purchase again and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>This came highly recommded by amazon folks</li>
            <li>I wonder why people give it so high rating.</li>
            <li>recommend this highly</li>
            <li>Very long lasting, light and fresh smelling like you&#x27;ve just taken a shower.</li>
            <li>An ADULT, contemporary &amp; classic fragrance for a WOMAN who has BTDT and knows what SHE wants out of life.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it didn&#x27;t mix well with my body chemistry, but the scent did remind me, like it had so many other reviewers, of the dated, old lady smell.</li>
            <li>I am the kind of person who loves perfume above any other \\&quot;must have\\&quot; item, and \\&quot;Lovely\\</li>
            <li>Smells sort of like Lovely, but it&#x27;s clear that other chemicals have been added.</li>
            <li>But if you wear Lovely, I paid a small price for it , better than TJ Maxx and other stores.</li>
            <li>The perfume arrived early!!  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it and it certainly won&#x27;t be the last!</li>
            <li>not heavy, very cleanr refreshing and a little herbal.</li>
            <li>It is such a loud very very mature strong scent,maybe because I&#x27;m in my early 20s</li>
            <li>In all honesty, the first experience with this perfume brought me back to my great grandmother&#x27;s house, where everything smelled like &amp;#34;Navy&amp;#34; by Dana, which she wore for years and always gave me the same dull headache from being overwhelmed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i read all the great reviews about this perfume and thought i would blindly buy it for myself.</li>
            <li>And its really reminds me of old women or a bingo hall.  </li>
            <li>Lol im bored.</li>
            <li>you really captured the scent of an old women’s dressing room with this one…</li>
            <li>Very feminine and soft, is a fragrance that is one of those you can&#x27;t put your finger on - like</li>
            <li>Buying Lovely on the internet saved me from making a 40-mile round trip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Lovely almost everyday and for any occasion.</li>
            <li>but I saw this and wanted to go back to it because it&#x27;s so sweet and young but not tween its for everyone over 15</li>
            <li>I wanna say that this is one of the few perfumes I love that a celebrity came out with.</li>
            <li>I normally use another online fragrance Co. for all my fragrance and cosmetic purchases.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This perfume is so delicate, and pretty, and feminine, without being overwhelmingly floral.</li>
            <li>Lovely is at first spicy with hints of delicate orchid and paper whites.</li>
            <li>She said it was not to heavy or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, my vanity favorites are currently Juicy Couture, Chanel no 5</li>
            <li>My sisters favorite for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Not a great one, but a good one.</li>
            <li>My criteria for buying great perfumes is a little less discriminating (on some counts)</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended for a young girl who is starting with her first bottle!</li>
            <li>more mature perfume that has a subtle fresh scent.</li>
            <li>The full amount, a big bottle, taste like toilet water started before the transfer relatively pungent, slowly easing in some of the tune after tune I fell in love, and now every day use, holding incense time is not too long, but the price has made me very satisfied</li>
            <li>Fresh clean scent, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>also always buy this on Amazon because it’s free shipping and always cheaper than other places.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and airy and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like other perfumes do.</li>
            <li>I live in England and my Daughter and family live in Michigan so on her birthday I log on to Amazon (USA) to buy her a gift.</li>
            <li>Was hoping this would live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered &amp; got it delivered (sealed &amp; brand new in the box)</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new here...</li>
            <li>New wife or purfume needed</li>
            <li>New life, new perfume.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new lighter parfum to wear to work.</li>
            <li>The perfume came brand new</li>
            <li>It says new, but it looks like its been handled a lot.</li>
            <li>and once I ran out, I new</li>
            <li>It is a nice light scent that just drives me crazy.</li>
            <li>I go back and forth between this and Light Blue by</li>
            <li>older 38 year old sister</li>
            <li>Among my favorites are Ralph Lauren Blue and Dolce And Gabbana Light Blue.</li>
            <li>I finally found a fragrance I love after years and years of time and money spent searching..</li>
            <li>I am almost 52 years old and have worn perfume most every single day of my life since 3rd grade.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume because it is long lasting at least more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>This has a very soft smell to it.</li>
            <li>Soft yet the right amount to stay on you even til the next morning.</li>
            <li>Was not sure of this scent for the first 20 minutes after the initial spray - but as the perfume dried down it became more pleasant the longer</li>
            <li>In smelling I noticed that the one recently ordered had a definite alcohol smell, whereas the original I had did not.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Such a pretty scent.  </li>
            <li>I can say that because I am an old lady!</li>
            <li>I used CK one in the past but this smells so much better.</li>
            <li>I usually wear Lovely during the day.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Now, two weeks later there is literally no scent when it first comes out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You save a lot of money for the exact same perfume.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s sold in this small size.</li>
            <li>It has actually grown on me since I first got this perfume.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a nice scent to stay with you all day long that doesn&#x27;t break the bank, I would suggest looking elsewhere, because this \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; perfume does not last long.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this perfume to all women, no matter how young or old.</li>
            <li>WOW - thought I would try something new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent, really memorable - soft, not overwhelming, but not too weak at the same time.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and will keep purchasing it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>Saved almost half off retail with free shipping &amp; no tax-</li>
            <li>Enjoy wearing the cologne and will continue to purchase it as long as possible.  </li>
            <li>I like this scent for every day, it&#x27;s light and not sweet.</li>
            <li>Color was different from previous bottles--not sure if it was the bottle or the formula of the cologne.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume, and recently ran out and turns out every place that I had previously purchased it from</li>
            <li>then other days I notice it more often all day long and even into the evening.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll smell like sophistication, easily dodging the old-lady musk smell or something super sugary or over-the-top like you&#x27;d image roaming a high school hallway.</li>
            <li>If you like any of the J Lo fragrances, you will enjoy this little addition to your fragrance wardrobe.</li>
            <li>I figured it had been somewhat diluted with alcohol or something, tried spraying a little more on , the same thing.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and its hard to find now.</li>
            <li>Very light and not overwhelming!</li>
            <li>That is, unless the perfume has just been applied...be sure to apply at least 1/2 hour before being around others if they are sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>However, after I opened it, I saw that the bottle was not pink-tinted; it was clear with no color.  </li>
            <li>the so called perfume is clear.  </li>
            <li>Well, after wearing the product for about a month, I can really say that the department store smell and the one I get from Amazon are different.</li>
            <li>I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>and i was so surprised to receive it as a mother&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li>For upwards of 15 years I wore Liz Claiborne nearly exclusively until they changed it</li>
            <li>Of those, I think I would say this is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>Literally, it gave me severe headache all day long on my first try, and I throw it away.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is soft yet stays with you thru-out the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is comparable to a sort of wild honeysuckle or wildflower scent.</li>
            <li>you actually could have have a whole room smelling like this scent.</li>
            <li>Like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like a teenager nor an old biddie.  </li>
            <li>completely* vanished, not a trace.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early thirtys and like another reviewer said if you are under 35 do not wear this.</li>
            <li>maybe I will give it to my 62 yr old mother.</li>
            <li>It came completely packaged and it didn&#x27;t break or crack.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough.</li>
            <li>I would not suggest this to any early teens though or children.</li>
            <li>so I can enjoy it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I saw some reviews here that it&#x27;s not for young girls.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my 56 year old mom</li>
            <li>It is very layered, and different notes will surface over the course of the day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tend to put too much on, just enough for me to smell it and anyone that might be close to me.</li>
            <li>I had ordered a small bottle the first time, and this time ordered a larger one as that&#x27;s all that was available.</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>Have been busy using  it since it came out.</li>
            <li>Not because of the fragance itself but because it was an old bottle.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it near my wrist.</li>
            <li>Not the classy old lady either.</li>
            <li>Even now, I&#x27;m smelling my wrist as I write this review with the tiniest hope that it turns out it isn&#x27;t a headache-inducing old lady mothball</li>
            <li>It is old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>Possibly old stock...</li>
            <li>Like an old woman who lives in a cabin.</li>
            <li>I sprayed so much all over my body, my clothes and the back of my hair -</li>
            <li>For you 30 something&#x27;s that find yourself to mature for your old go-to perfumes.</li>
            <li>So, my husband surprised with a gift set for mother&#x27;s day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use &#x27;Lovely&#x27; from time-to-time but it loses it scent early &amp; just doesn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li>The difference doesn&#x27;t amount to that much, maybe 10 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of buying perfume on the net.</li>
            <li>Knowing that I wasn&#x27;t buying it directly from a trusted retailer, I almost worried I&#x27;d be getting a knockoff or watered-down version, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous for girls&#x27; night out as well as a job interview (especially with a potential female boss)!</li>
            <li>I will splurge on the real thing next time.</li>
            <li>Seeing as how I ordered it directly through Amazon, I will go out on a limb and give them the benefit of the doubt and say no.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely a &#x27;mature scent&#x27;.</li>
            <li>My life has changed and it was time to throw out my old perfume.</li>
            <li>and it never gets old.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to a lot of smells, but this one got lots of reviews and now I can give it a thumbs up also.  </li>
            <li>This perfume was a gift the scent it so pleasantly soft and alluring.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife who is a mother of 5 and in her early 30s</li>
            <li>Not so overwhelming that it is offensive, or too mature, but the scent has enough weight to work year round.</li>
            <li>this on my wedding day back in 2005 which is my husband&#x27;s favorite and my signature perfume that I wear everyday</li>
            <li>This perfume is pretty musky, not very sharp, but definite.</li>
            <li>She has tried other scents but keeps going back to Lovely because it is an all round nice everyday scent.  </li>
            <li>D &amp; G Light Blue is my other.</li>
            <li>I love this frgarance, not only is it long lasting , but it&#x27;s different , It doesn&#x27;t smell like everything that everyone wears lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a subtle, sexy scent.  </li>
            <li>I thought at first it was different, but I have a lot of allergies and my husband finally had to say mention.</li>
            <li>I still have some left in a older bottle and compared with what I received.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that this bottle smelled a bit differently than past Lovely&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>When you first spray it smells the same but that last probably 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>It was interesting to note that there was a identifiable difference between the aroma on each individual after a little time was allowed for “White Diamonds” to mellow and be warmed by the body.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes of liking this perfume, especially since Oprah raved about it and it is represented by SJP.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this as an everyday perfume but instead for special occasions.</li>
            <li>some people have commented that the scent doesn&#x27;t wear very well for long periods of time, However I find that the scent payoff on this perfume lasts well over 8 hours for me</li>
            <li>It has  a light smell which is not overwhelming to the senses.  </li>
            <li>This perfume suits very well and lasts really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>it smells to peppery when you first spray it for one.</li>
            <li>the scent is peppery when first applied.</li>
            <li>I just received this today and within a few minutes of spraying it, I boxed it right back up and ready to ship out of here.</li>
            <li>This is my new daily perfume.</li>
            <li>My favorite and so hard to find!</li>
            <li>And I finally found a reasonably priced big bottle of it!</li>
            <li>well, needless to say, it was accomplished with &#x27;lovely&#x27;.</li>
            <li>My husband said it smelled like a fake rose smell and something an old lady would wear.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to strong perfumes, but this one is subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>is that the real one has a lot of white flower in it which gives me a total headache.</li>
            <li>It is really strong so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>but this one was a  major flop.</li>
            <li>Since I had worked for a major cosmetic and fragrance company for over 12 years....</li>
            <li>First hints are pepper followed by extreme stench.</li>
            <li>But for me, in the hot humid summer, I need something stronger and that will last so that I can at least smell fresh even if I don&#x27;t feel like</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a couple of compliments but nothing too major.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how many people use this perfume, but these days it is very hard to find this perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and delicate, others have mentioned that it smells unique -</li>
            <li>Everything that was indicted towards this product was 100% , was a gift for a long time friend , look forward to mainly purchase this item again for my friend...</li>
            <li>And we are not able to return the product due to: &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.&amp;#34; Overall, I would not recommend or buy this product again.</li>
            <li>Some fakes are obvious but other ones are very clever and you can only detect the imitation if you are already familiar with the product.</li>
            <li>It is delicate, elegant, subtle and just a touch sweet.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, so this perfume I obviously purchased as a Holiday gift for a \\&quot;lovely\\&quot; young lady.  </li>
            <li>Im a 22 year old female.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soft enough to re-apply.</li>
            <li>I think this bottle was old and starting to turn rancid.</li>
            <li>Searched around at the retail stores and apparently it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping item exactly as expected</li>
            <li>In all that time, I&#x27;ve developed several favorites but could never find a signature smell.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect the bottle to be that big which is only a big plus, as for the scent...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product as expected.</li>
            <li>I ordered a few bottles of perfume and 1 was not filled, probably leaked out, when I massaged them they were very accommodating and will definitely order my favorite perfumes from them in the future.  </li>
            <li>This smells exactly like the hung-over sour breath.</li>
            <li>Heard a lot of hype on this fragrance, and I like the new (pink) fragrances which are lighter and not heavy scents.  </li>
            <li>My current favorites are Noa &amp; Burberry Brit but always looking for something new &amp; different.  </li>
            <li>I had to spray a whole lot and the scent still did not last very long.</li>
            <li>You will love this perfume SERIOUSLY!</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT WAS LESS EXPENSIVE AND THE SAME ORIGINAL LOVELY</li>
            <li>The box it came in looked exactly the same as other &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; boxes.  </li>
            <li>i really can&#x27;t describe the scent other than to say that it is both ethereal, mood lifting and dare i say, yummy?</li>
            <li>Compared to other perfumes, there really is a very ample supply provided in each bottle as well.</li>
            <li>The scent is very distinctive in that it doesn&#x27;t remind me of any other scent.  </li>
            <li>When my other ones are over which i don&#x27;t like that much I will buy this again.</li>
            <li>It was sweet without being sickly and it was fresh while still very feminine.</li>
            <li>The main problem I have is that it just does not last very long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too expensive for me in the few department stores that carry it, so this was a great deal.</li>
            <li>Not too old or too young, but seems as though it would work for a wide array of women.</li>
            <li>She said it was lovely and very subtle.  </li>
            <li>Actually the name IS &amp;#34;Lovely,&amp;#34; and I haven&#x27;t had a positive response to a perfume in a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>So, I racked up major boyfriend points for actually listening to her and giving this gift to her for Christmas.</li>
            <li>when it first came I sprayed a little bit on my hand then when I washed my hands with soap</li>
            <li>but as many reviews it doesn&#x27;t last and after a few months the smell itself changed , vs higher end perfume its not great.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com, not second hand sellers, sells lots of fake cologne as real, but this one served my purposes just fine.  </li>
            <li>right to home a few days later.</li>
            <li>Really I did not like my wife very much and focus weak</li>
            <li>I noticed it was a different color than one I had, e.g. slightly orange like and not the pink tinge of the original one.  </li>
            <li>All these colognes are fake, the bottles looks nothing like the real thing, smells absolutely nothing like the real thing</li>
            <li>Not long after putting on the perfume, I brought my wrist to my nose to take a sniff, and I could detect no sign of the scent.</li>
            <li>Prior to the nauseating scent switch, the perfume&#x27;s scent barely lasted for an hour.</li>
            <li>and I barely wear it anymore (too commercial).</li>
            <li>Apparently it smells very different depending on what environment you are in.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume, and the only one I can really wear without my allergies going crazy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm and cozy and subtle.</li>
            <li>It is very watered down and</li>
            <li>The first smell is great and does smell like “lovely,&amp;#34; but a second later it leaves a terrible after smell of a french old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>Buyer beware, buy this from a department store, I am not sure this is the real thing, or it&#x27;s just old.</li>
            <li>only complaint might be that it&#x27;s a bit TOO subtle, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
            <li>I think there&#x27;s just a subtle hint of patchouli which I love, and other spicy hints</li>
            <li>A new fragrance for my wife I wanted to contrast with her other perfumes.</li>
            <li>Wife has been always a die hard fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, When she found this perfume and started wearing it since a few years ago, it became her favorite.</li>
            <li>I am very disappointed  because I am loyal amazon shopper and did not expected to get this kind of product from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This gives it an intimate feel in my mind, making it cozy and feminine.  </li>

            <li> people says thats like Narcizo Rodrigues for her, but the price is so different.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my wife and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> One clerk commiserated with me because she loved this fragrance also and had difficulty finding it.  </li>
            <li> Seller was spot on and the deal was good too.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this fragrance to be good and to me it was not.</li>
            <li> The most incredible thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled on a woman.</li>
            <li> This pefume has a wonderful light smell.</li>

            <li> but I do expect the perfume to: 1) smell good and 2)</li>

            <li> I immediately went to Amazon.com and was so happy to see that you have it available.  </li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing.</li>

            <li> It is a great light fragrance, not overpowering and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent...</li>
            <li> I liked the smell</li>
            <li> I think this one was made popular because of Orpah (shame on you..</li>
            <li> I just thought I was probably going to be doomed to be without that kind of enthusiasm over a perfume again.</li>
            <li> But each woman is her own, as for me I like to smell my perfume.</li>
            <li> I SMELLED LOVELY ON A LADY WALKING BY ONCE IN THE GROCERY STORE AND LOVED IT</li>
            <li> COMPLIMENTS AND LOVING THE WAY</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this product and liked it, but the jury was still out as to how much I liked it.</li>
            <li> and she really liked the scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice flowery scent.</li>
            <li> Smells nice from the bottle but not so nice on me.</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is a nice size for taking along when traveling.</li>
            <li> Smells nice from the bottle but not so nice on me.</li>
            <li> Product lived up to the expectation and my wife liked what I got for her.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I think that this fragrance is suited for the 50+ crowd.</li>
            <li> I added it to my own wishlist.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter as I knew she liked the perfume.</li>
            <li> It has a nice floral scent that&#x27;s not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It was packed nicely.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Sara Jessica Parker, great job!</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular.....</li>
            <li> I tried this once in a department store, really liked it.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> but amazon site states that is hazardous material and cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for years and used to pay much more for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she liked it</li>
            <li> nice my wife loves it</li>
            <li> I gifted this perfume to my wife and she loved it.</li>
            <li> She liked the fragrance and shape of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Another nice SJP scent.</li>
            <li> this scent is so nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost like aroma therapy to waken the senses as if you are surrounded by rose pedals and honey dew .</li>
            <li> this price beat both of those with fast delivery and arrived in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> It smelt so nice</li>
            <li> I also purchase the body spray and body cream which is equally as nice.</li>

            <li> Very nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find it on Amazon.com!!  </li>
            <li> It smells like a woman 20+ years older than I. Great for a grandma though!</li>
            <li> For me, that makes Lovely an exceptional fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not to strong &amp; it smells like fresh flowers after the rain :D</li>
            <li> Happy medium between floral, sweet, and savory.  </li>
            <li> Lovely as always (no pun intended) and fabulous delivery time Great price, too.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive my perfume -- delivered quickly and was just want I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Most women love perfume and anything endorsed or named after Sarah Jessica Parker has to be good.</li>

            <li> Thank you, Love, Love!</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li> I purchased Lovely for myself and i must admit it smells LOVELY!</li>
            <li> I love Lovely!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is very pleasant and has good lasting qualities.</li>
            <li> I was just looking at popular scents and Lovely</li>
            <li> It has a bit of an \\&quot;old-world\\&quot;-ness to it...but as far as I am concerned, that is a wonderful thing.  </li>
            <li> I have worn BEAUTIFUL only by Estee Lauder for years, but am now alternating between LOVELY and BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li> bought it because it was cheap and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> Smells so nice :)</li>
            <li> So when ordering be sure your item is not classified as hazardous (perfume?)</li>
            <li> it is light and airy and I folks always say I smell good...</li>
            <li> She had looked for it retail and was thrilled when I was able to find it for her.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled to be able to purchase it with you.</li>
            <li> This perfume is overwhelming with the strong scent of powder and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> Lovely is among the best celeb fragrances to-date, very wearable, not offensive, sample-worthy for most, and full-bottle-worthy for many.</li>
            <li> This smells just as good and is budget friendly.</li>
            <li> This is a very good, high quality product.</li>
            <li> The Elizabeth Taylor “White Diamonds” perfume would make a nice gift for a family member or friend at a very attractive and competitive price.</li>
            <li> Perfect blend of spicy, sophisticated, and soft.</li>
            <li> I  always get the most amazing compliments from both  men and women alike, when I wear Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker</li>
            <li> Huge bottle perfect for summer time light and very pretty scent</li>
            <li> I have had many people tell me it smells great, and it was the right scent for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Never fails to get me comments on how great I smell, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great perfume, First time purchasing Sarah Jessica Parker.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this one would be ideal for anyone under the age of 35 unless you just have a particular love for this type of scent.</li>
            <li> The description of the perfume might not be very accurate.</li>
            <li> It is very light and does not overwhelm when wearing.  </li>
            <li> This eau de parfum has the very light odor can where for any ocassion I give this to my wife</li>
            <li> It has a very light smell.  </li>

            <li> I have purchased another SJP fragrance \\&quot;Covet\\&quot; and decided to take a chance on \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot;, so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic to boot!</li>
            <li> The best way to describe it is to put on a powder deoderant, go outside and sweat all day, and then, smell yourself....  </li>
            <li> This is the smell Lovely captures in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is so lovely it makes people call me lovely.</li>
            <li> This perfume is fabulous!  </li>

            <li> and I could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> alone or layer with LOVELY body lotion</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift many years ago</li>
            <li> Received my order quickly and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Normally I am a sweet, fruit, clean or citrusy person, but this is a great floral/clean and if you are looking for a new type of scent to try this is a great one to bridge to.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when i ordered it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the smell because I liked how it smelled in the evening...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet, but not overpowering, and I just love it!</li>
            <li> Keeps me Happy, Thanks and Happy New Year.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it another try because I tend to like the more sweet smelling scents and this was not that kind of scent.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li> It is such a beautiful, unique scent!!  </li>
            <li> When I opened the box and removed the bottle, my wife’s expression was WOW!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very clean smell.</li>
            <li> it is a very clean, somewhat powdery fragrance ..</li>
            <li> It is a very clean scent with a hint of lavender.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for a fun yet elegant lunch date or any time you want to feel sexy and carefree!</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t like floral scents, but this is great.</li>
            <li> and I could still smell it so softly and beautifully on my hand.</li>
            <li> ...a beautiful young lady leaned over me and asked what I was wearing.  </li>
            <li> It smells good on me, first of all.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell at first, when I saw the sampler in a magazine.</li>
            <li> I decided from the get go that I would wear it consistently and give it a fair chance, so after about 2 weeks or so of wear now</li>
            <li> This Parfum is very nice, particularly for the Summer.</li>
            <li> I wore Clinique Happy for 10 years and decided to try something new after the birth of my twins.</li>
            <li> So thanks to SJPs Lovely, I have a new favorite that is just perfect for anytime and every day.</li>
            <li> The scent is great - not too strong, not too sweet, just right for summer.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size to keep on my dresser for a quick touch-up at any time.</li>
            <li> it and let it dry, on your skin, see how it changes and truns into a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> Item rec&#x27;d quickly and pkg&#x27;d nicely.</li>
            <li> Sure makes buying for her easy.</li>
            <li> he has never been a fan of perfumes because of how strong most of them are.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my wife without smelling it based on good price and positive reviews online.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a rare scent that does not give me a sinus headache, so I also love it!</li>
            <li> This product received great reviews, and does smell when it&#x27;s not past</li>
            <li> I love this perfume because it can feel (smell) sophisticated and fun all at once!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the super fast delivery !!!  </li>
            <li> This is a great perfume and an excellent value, it lasts long like a very high end bottle is also very pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> It is full and rich and warm and elegant</li>
            <li> To me, there are strong floral notes top and end notes that feel very fresh, sophisticated, and feminine.</li>
            <li> Not overly strong, very clean scent.</li>
            <li> It has a very sweet smell but is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, light and clean!</li>
            <li> I have purchased SJP fragances, they are not over powering nor very sweet smelling, so if you have expericed her fragances you are SAFE AND ENJOY.</li>
            <li> A more accurate name for this perfume could never have been found!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Favorite... please send coupon or free samples...</li>
            <li> And, more importantly, so does my husband.  </li>
            <li> I tried SJP&#x27;s \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; and fell instantly in love with the light, flowery fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Item was perfect and expected.</li>
            <li> have tried this in stores and liked it, so I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>

            <li> Very elegant and pretty.</li>
            <li> My reacquaintance with Lovely confirmed that there was no need to purchase liquid sugar and walk around smelling like 45-year-old cotton candy.</li>
            <li> but i felt the perfume was more fit for a maore matured woman.</li>
            <li> Most of the times they smell tacky or cheap or smells like there&#x27;s nothing</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy this parfum, I have purchased this item many times through Amazon.com until now</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and it arrived safe and sound and on time.  </li>
            <li> In Love&amp;#34; by Philosophy, and while it&#x27;s a lovely, light scent, it seems to disappear after a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, slightly exotic, day-or-night, layers of light, refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this light, playful fragrance...</li>
            <li> I always liked the fragrance Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker when it first came out.  </li>

            <li> Amazon made it easy to make my sister&#x27;s birthday &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean, elegant scent</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering or strong so it wears well at the office.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who wears it to work (even though we&#x27;re not supposed to wear perfume) and she gets away with it, because it&#x27;s not overly strong.  </li>
            <li> It is one scent I can wear without fear of offending others because of too strong of an aroma.  </li>
            <li> This is a good classic scent.</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent</li>
            <li> this perfume has a strong smell and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> Smells great...not too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li> Not too strong at all.</li>
            <li> strongly urge against buying  this product.</li>
            <li> It has a strong apple martini flair to me.</li>
            <li> This particular scent is very clean, fresh, light and wonderful for a hot summer day.</li>
            <li> The smell is giving you impression as sweet, elegant, innocent but brave and strong woman in the same time.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to buy her this perfume because she used it before and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> So I tried it and fell in love with it right away!  </li>
            <li> If it helps to know what I love which does not smell right on me, I can name Pheromone - love it</li>
            <li> And my closet also has that sweet fragrance. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful, feminine scent designed for the female that desires an aura of sophistication and beauty.  </li>
            <li> It is a beautiful scent just the same.</li>
            <li> There is something beautifully comforting yet altogether mysterious.</li>
            <li> the problem was but this was NOT the true Lovely.  </li>
            <li> Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker is a light, clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I like trying new perfumes when a good deal rolls around, but this will always be my go-to perfume.</li>
            <li> Over the course of the day, it&#x27;s just less impressive to me.</li>
            <li> I normally like to have my own \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot;, but the smell of Lovely was so mezmerizing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lovely for since the product first came out, and I love it -</li>
            <li> Ive used Lovely since it first came out and love it.  </li>
            <li> It may be worth noting that I&#x27;ve dropped the bottle a fair number of times and it&#x27;s never broken!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s fine if you plan to stay home and can re-spritz, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love it quick delivery</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick too!</li>
            <li> Anyway I tried on and it just smells like &amp;#34;dollar tree cheap scents&amp;#34; along with strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> It is a super deal - can&#x27;t find it any cheaper than on Amazon - I looked everywhere!</li>
            <li> Love it, Quick delivery</li>
            <li> This is a very nice classic fresh and floral scent that lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> but i feel like the perfume would be more suitable for more mature women.  </li>
            <li> This scent is very well-named - it&#x27;s lovely!</li>
            <li> really smells lovely!</li>
            <li> It is my absolute favorite!</li>

            <li> What a nice surprise to find it at a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a cheaply made perfume and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Hope u will keep it available.</li>
            <li> I see now that the seller did not guarantee 100% genuine.</li>
            <li> So light and got this spicy blend to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I re-ordered this one because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly cheap</li>
            <li> It smells too wonderful to waste on days that I&#x27;m not dressed to the nines.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a hassle free way to get your perfume gifts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more fitting for more a mature woman.</li>
            <li> I am always told that people enjoy this perfume on me when i wear it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom for Christmas and wasn&#x27;t a cheap knock off version as I have seen to be a problem on Amazon.</li>
            <li> , I get multiple compliments when I wear this and the price was great, I have yet to find this in the stores for what I paid for this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is light and &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; just as the name says.  </li>
            <li> Light.</li>

            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s a light fragrance and lasts the day.  </li>
            <li> This is light, feminine, and playful.</li>
            <li> I guess, it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This is a powdery, flowery almost a light musk in scent.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the ease of which it is to shop Amazon.</li>
            <li> SJP&#x27;s &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; is light and floral.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to over-apply it, just a light dab/or spray</li>
            <li> The scent is light and alluring.</li>
            <li> This perfume is really light and feminine.</li>
            <li> It goes on light, but the scent does stay with you throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the perfume and the fact that it is no longer being made is a shame.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but not that much like Narcisso Rodriguez as some have said.</li>
            <li> Great to finally find this.</li>
            <li> This was a great birthday present.  </li>
            <li> It is light and floral.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t over-power me or people around me.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is lightly layered with flowers and hint of chocolate.</li>
            <li> It is light and engaging but not at all cloying.  </li>
            <li> A light scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower those around you like some.</li>
            <li> This is not Amazon&#x27;s problem, as I received the same great service from Amazaon.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a cheap, dollar store version of something.</li>
            <li> This perfume really smells nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my absolute most favorite fragrance</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s light and fun!</li>
            <li> Sarah Jessica and Coty have down a wonderful thing here - a scent that is feminine without being overly floral, and sweet without being too sweet.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Taylor “White Diamonds” perfume would be great for special occasions as well as for every day use.</li>
            <li> It smells great right out of the bottle and settles in for a soft, sweet scent that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> Light, clean scent</li>
            <li> Light, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great scent that&#x27;s sweet but not too teen</li>
            <li> I was looking for something soft, elegant, and suitable for both day and evening wear.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance because it is light and smells pretty.  </li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife , this is a lovely fragrance and the price was very reasonable. .</li>
            <li> Overall, I think its one of the best new perfumes out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells exactly as it is named: Lovely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and slightly sweet smelling to me.</li>
            <li> I first decided to purchase Lovely because I just wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> When I first sprayed it on I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it.</li>
            <li> Perfume is unique to each person and their body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Lovely is exactly what this perfume is about.</li>
            <li> I received this product, unopened and in original packaging, within a week from the time i had placed the order.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original box still wrapped.  </li>
            <li> Smell lasts and its soon pretty. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume sooo much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an original scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so rich and soft, and sexy and most importantly</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance that is perfect for a formal dress affair, a small spritz for going to work or anytime you are looking for an anywhere, anytime perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent I have actually been followed around in stores before and asked what I was wearing one man</li>
            <li> unique</li>
            <li> I got it originally for my girlfriend who is 32</li>
            <li> I found that the fragrance did not stay with me as the original one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh scent!  </li>
            <li> but Lovely is exactly what it says...</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell like it smell in the original department stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I hoped I would get an original Eau de Parfum</li>
            <li> first time trying Lovely</li>
            <li> At first, I was between getting the $83 Narciso Rodriguez&#x27;s for her or the $38 SJP&#x27;s Lovely.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this SJP fragrance because I&#x27;m a fan</li>
            <li> The perfume smelled exactly the way it&#x27;s suppose to, it is authentic.</li>
            <li> Totally worth!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and different from most of the overly sweet pungent odors out so often.</li>
            <li> I remember first smelling it, spraying some on myself, and not being able to stop sniffing my wrist.  </li>
            <li> Unique fragrance...</li>
            <li> I am finding that I do like the scent much better than I did at first.</li>
            <li> My two great Aunts&#x27; apartment had this very same scent throughout each room, except the kitchen with the aroma of good Italian cooking.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product.  </li>
            <li> I doubt that is this original?</li>
            <li> Musk and Lavender give this fragrance a warm confidence while the mingling of precious essential oils creates a classically poetic blend of refined nuances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d been looking for a new perfume for awhile, and just couldn&#x27;t find anything I really liked.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells beautiful, when you first spray it it does have that traditional &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This parfum has a clean, feminine, day-to-evening scent.  </li>
            <li> The most elegant, classy perfume out there.  </li>
            <li> but I really have no idea how it smells, baut knowing this actress it has to be light and lovely.</li>
            <li> It has a clean scent to it.</li>
            <li> When I change our sheets I lightly spray the mattress pads with it and it makes the fresh bedding smell fantastic and always impresses our guests.</li>
            <li> Lovely smells like something soft, alluring, and sexy all at once.  </li>
            <li> I wear it everyday to work and since it was gifted by my husband its very very special to me.&lt;br /&gt;Its light and crisp and very refreshing :)&lt;</li>
            <li> &quot; the scent is so clean, soft and refreshing!  </li>
            <li> It had many positive reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft, feminine scent and lovely!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light with a musk undertone that is very feminine.  </li>
            <li> It has this very light flowery smell, very soothing.</li>
            <li> only downside is that the scent does not last on me and have to reapply too often ..  if you don&#x27;t like the strong, overpowering scents, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Just right for me!</li>
            <li> So I went to the reviews and they were right!</li>
            <li> fragrance is hard to describe but there is something so feminine and wonderful about it.  </li>
            <li> Shipment was quick and I was excited about that.</li>
            <li> I saw it first introduced on Oprah and how much she liked it.</li>
            <li> Lovely is a bit romantic, suitable for date-nights, bedtime, weekends, but not the office imo.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light fresh</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li> It is fresh and light but stays on for hours .  </li>
            <li> It has a sickly sweet smell.</li>
            <li> He kept saying throughout the entire evening how good I smelled.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get a good bottle, put everything in a box and ship it back</li>
            <li> A nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much.</li>

            <li> Love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li> This definitely is one of the good ones.</li>
            <li> Initially, I knew I loved this perfume (before my Amazon purchase) from a sample ad in a magazine.  </li>
            <li> dunno, it had a deep scent feeling to me, nothing bright and fresh and light.</li>
            <li> I really had preferred the scent to most others I have.</li>
            <li> ...the packaging, style of the bottle and definitely the price were quite good.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s sweet smelling not tangy.</li>
            <li> I was delighted by such scent!!!</li>
            <li> Very floral and feminine:).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like cloying sweet perfumes that can be overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I wear it all the time and people constantly tell me I smell good and want to know what I am wearing.  </li>
            <li> My true test is if anyone compliments my fragrance and that did not happen.  </li>
            <li> I just love the light  scent,  how fresh this perfume is and how it lasts so gently....</li>
            <li> I am very fussy about fragrances; so many are just stinky.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, floral and crisp, with a light citrus freshness and a hint of sweet.</li>
            <li> , it smells kind of old</li>
            <li> Light and fresh</li>
            <li> This is quite sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Then the honey sweet scent mellows into an evocative warmth with hints of hugs and memories of corsages at weddings.</li>
            <li> I like that the scent is not overly powerful and is light and airy.</li>
            <li> This is my mother-in-laws absolute favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> This perfume has a sweet, seductive and alluring scent..</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because it smells good but not that lasting.</li>
            <li> The smell is really fresh and light.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Wife won&#x27;t wear it and the bottle is almost full</li>
            <li> Out of my whole perfume collection, and I have many....</li>
            <li> and it last eight plus hours Good stuff ..</li>

            <li> Very affordable, lovely smell for the summer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li> I am a 37-year old man who first experienced this extraordinary fragrance on my wife 2 years ago, and it is the first scent that has ever caused me to sit in a chair for hours bundling up my shirt just to continue smelling it while she is away.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think her perfume would smell as good as it does, I figured it was just another celebrity hawking a new product.  </li>
            <li> Saved almost half off retail with free shipping &amp; no tax- great deal.</li>
            <li> When first opening the bottle the fragrance seems sweet and strong.</li>
            <li> If you like a strong flowery smell (old lady) then you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite scents not too strong but strong enough</li>
            <li> Exactly the gift I wanted to give  -- Thank goodness could find it so easily</li>
            <li> Amazon is a great deal compared to U1ta and other retail stores which is about twice the price.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am happy with the items I order from amazon</li>
            <li> We love how the smell stays and it smells good even if she is has already sweat a little or exposed to the heat.</li>
            <li> Not a very bold scent, but smells great.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it is the perfect scent for any occasion.</li>
            <li> it does settled into a clean, fresh scent that you can&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> A CLEAN FRESH SCENT, NOT OVERPOWERING.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but wonderful.  </li>

            <li> I have used Lovely for a few years and loved it.</li>
            <li> like you&#x27;d have to be a pregnant version of whoever shot Bambi&#x27;s mom to be put off by this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I would consider Lovely my all time classic scent that I wear.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a budget-friendly perfume that doesn&#x27;t smell budget-friendly, I highly recommend checking out Lovely.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading so many rave reviews, with high hopes.</li>
            <li> I usually give this to my wife because it has a very good smell.</li>
            <li> It was light and disappeared quickly the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I suggest for any scent, if it&#x27;s available in the dept. store, to try it first.</li>
            <li> Amazing, very romantic and unique.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Amazon has by far a better deal price wise,  compared to the local stores.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, A new and different product to be used personally, highly recommended to buy again in this store.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed right out of the bottle is this stuff is strong.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is getting harder to find than other Sarah Jessica Parker scents, so Amazon has been a great venue to get it at a good price point.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought any new perfume for myself in many years because I am so picky.</li>
            <li> I love trying new fragrances</li>
            <li> The perfume itself came brand new which I enjoyed.</li>
            <li> My new favorite.</li>
            <li> My favorite new signiture scent.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overly sweet or flowery, just the right amount.</li>
            <li> Everything was easy, fast and a pleasure.</li>
            <li> The sweet fragrance could be enjoyed by both teens and adult women.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a nice, clean, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> It is not too strong, yet leaves a very indelible impression.</li>
            <li> purchased it without testing, only because it was the first perfume in the collection, and it must be good since people are still buying</li>
            <li> A very nice, subtle and sophisticated floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Very prompt shipping too!!</li>

            <li> This perfume really lives up to it&#x27;s name!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended perfume. !!!</li>
            <li> This perfume has such a lovely scent!</li>
            <li> This is my current favorite scent (since 2005!).</li>
            <li> My second FAVORITE perfume!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day, but can always spray more on!</li>
            <li> The delivary time was exactly as it was stated on my invoice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I have something new and makes me feel very &#x27;womanly&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Lovely has such strong flowery and citrusy notes.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day and after the initial spray the scent is not overpowering but very feminine and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Its not my absolute favorite, but its pleasant for everyday.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty and priced right.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was actually reminded quite a bit of my great aunt when I sprayed it the first time, which was nice, but not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found a large bottle for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyhow, my bad manners came in handy since it smells wonderful on her.</li>
            <li> I thought, just another celebrity-endorsed cheap smelling thing, and with Jessica Parker&#x27;s name to boot, someone whose taste in clothes I don&#x27;t much admire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came real fast</li>
            <li> He is sensitive to a lot of smells &amp; most perfumes give him headaches.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t worth for the money</li>
            <li> Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker is a soft, long-lasting fragrance that does not seem to bother those around me that are prone to migraine headaches and/or allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that has something to do with my natural body oil and how it affects the perfume&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
            <li> I like this perfum because it smells feminine and fresh.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s different from what I already own, and 3) it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> (well worth the price).</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d just wasted $20 instead of spending just $10 more in a local store for the REAL fragrance I really loved!!</li>
            <li> i didnt get one for myself because i rarely use perfume</li>
            <li> the perfume, i like its smile</li>
            <li> I love the soft scent.  </li>
            <li> But nice enough to gift.</li>
            <li> It could last me a year or so to be honest.</li>
            <li> It takes sometime getting used to the smell because I was into Estee Lauder and Donna Karan line of pefume, more of the soft &amp; flowery scent,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; from a department store when it was first introduced and I loved it even though it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> Worth trying.</li>
            <li> Fresh but not too</li>
            <li> I mostly wear Light Blue and wanted to try others.</li>
            <li> It charges you almost 4 dollars and my two year old son did even better than Amazon.</li>
            <li> I order this perfume often and this is so old that the scent is more like alcohol.</li>
            <li> My young siser like the Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker for Women.  </li>
            <li> irritated me further was when I found out the fragrances are considered hazardous material and are not returnable.</li>
            <li> retrospect, I feel it would be age appropriate for anyone looking for a mature smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li> Like a lady fresh out of the shower on a summers day.</li>
            <li> Soft, lovely, feminine scent.</li>
            <li> Worth buying it .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Lovely, is light, with multiple layers of scent.</li>
            <li> While it smells fresh and floral (with a hint of spice)</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells nice and is moderately priced.</li>
            <li> one of my all-time favorite fragrances in my adult life to date.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely quite nice and</li>
            <li> Such a nice fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> Or else you&#x27;ll be stuck with a full bottle that will probably be passed down to your great grandchildren, like I most likely will be.</li>
            <li> fragrance is just perfect for day wear, not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t make others around you feel like they&#x27;re being choaked like so many other flowery scents do.</li>
            <li> The Lovely cologne (Sarah Jessica Parker) was a favorite, but this particular bottle is not the same scent.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of Mademoiselle Coco Chanel, but obviously a lot more budget friendly.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the original Lovely by SJP scent.</li>
            <li> found this scent several years ago, i really love it, it&#x27;s light and smells wonderful, although its getting harder to find i will keep buying it as long as i can.</li>
            <li> came quickly and was exactly like the perfume I have always used.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good price for this perfume and it&#x27;s pretty hard to find in stores, so</li>
            <li> The first couple bottles I ordered were fine, seemed to be the real thing</li>
            <li> It just seemed to smell like everything else out there right now.</li>
            <li> I doused myself with it and got right in his face....</li>
            <li> , that makes the right amount of presence.</li>
            <li> and i got it right away thank you</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> but this perfume is just right for me.</li>
            <li> the price was definitely right too.  </li>
            <li> The price is right too.  </li>
            <li> Just right for all occasions.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> Soft and fresh always get a lot so compliments on what I&#x27;m wearing, used this since it 1st came out wished they made a powder!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Lovely perfume as long as it has been available.  </li>
            <li> Nice size i got the same size in macys much higher cost.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised when I smelled this for the first time;  just fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Sweet and soft and light.  </li>
            <li> It is nice but not young or fresh.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but I think next time I will go for something slightly more floral, or citrus-y</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you want a light scent.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase Lovely perfume from Amazon at half the price of retail stores.</li>
            <li> If you like a light fragrance but one that last all day without being too strong</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any woman who likes clean, fresh fragrances that can be worn day or night.</li>
            <li> I do not like overly strong floral or fruity fragrances, and Lovely is certainly not one of those obnoxious scents that overwhelms the room.</li>
            <li> Well if he loves it, my 25 year old daughter loves it and of course I love it, then I would say it&#x27;s likely you will like it or maybe love it yourself.</li>
            <li> Spray lightly for intimate settings, more heavy-handed for public gatherings &amp; wide-open</li>
            <li> Really not sure if I am reviewing the product or Amazon, but completely happy with both.</li>
            <li> must say nice fragrance and stay is also long lasting&lt;br /&gt;nice packing by amazon and timely delivery of the product&lt;</li>
            <li> The fragrance is really nice and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Everyone said this smells so fresh and clean, but I smell too much chemical mixed in for me to love it</li>
            <li> The good thing about it is the price keeps going steadily down</li>
            <li> she is relatively new to wearing fragrance and was looking for something \\&quot;light and feminine...a scent that would make an impression upon leaving or entering a room\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This smells fine however, I dont feel it suit young as it is kind of flat!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far too strong( Hit you over the head</li>
            <li> It is not heavy or strong smelling.  </li>
            <li> It smells good on me, although I&#x27;m realizing that I like the scent less as the day moves on.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000C1ZDTU Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker for Women, Eau de Parfum, 3.4-Ounce Spray Bottle]]This is a wonderfully light, refreshing and subtle scent.</li>

            <li> .....thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast despite all the snow and ice that was falling.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even as strong as the Lovely body spray for half the cost.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of Lovely.</li>
            <li> got this Lovely perfume by SJP as a gift, after months of raving about it after I tested it in a department store, and use it regularly for everyday/office wear.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this since I first saved my allowance to buy.</li>
            <li> and if I had read them first I probably would not have bought it.</li>
            <li> I have used Lovely for several bottles.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that the perfume does not stay on.</li>
            <li> and this is exactly how she&#x27;d smell\\&quot;--no way.</li>
            <li> Pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Lovely for several years and defiantly feel I have found my signature scent.</li>
            <li> it smells exactly as the name...</li>
            <li> My favorite daily one!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Lovely Eau de Parfum for several years.</li>
            <li> Even though I can often not smell it on myself everybody around me seems to because they always ask what scent I&#x27;m wearing and how much they like it!</li>
            <li> The description told me exactly what I needed to know concerning size and type.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has been a favorite of mine for several years.  </li>
            <li> :) Overall I would do this again.</li>
            <li> Aside from the lightening fast shipping, I must rave over this scent!  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t seem interested at the time, so I delayed making a purchase.  </li>
            <li> When I got it, it smelled exactly like what my mom likes to smell like.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I do not have expertise in scents</li>
            <li> I hope this product is not fake</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this one  (Lovely), is definitely a winner!  </li>
            <li> I give this a one star because my husband hates it on me and it would Most likely give my co-workers a headache...</li>
            <li> The box and bottle are both pretty if gift giving.  </li>
            <li> Just enough balance of romance plus sexy.  </li>
            <li> she love it the only problem with!!!!!.  </li>
            <li> this is the first review I have ever written about anything I have ordered through amazon.  </li>
            <li> My latest bottle should last for quite some time</li>
            <li> so I can apply as much as I want!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, but just enough to enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seller \\&quot;Pretty Princess\\&quot; DID NOT SEND what I ordered, they subsistuted my order without informing me of the change, they are unavailable for emails and never responded to my repeated requests for a review of my order</li>
            <li> My second go to perfume:).</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering fragrance from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The only fragrance I&#x27;ve ever finished completely is Lovely.</li>
            <li> Bought it several years ago and received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I took it home and out of frustration tried a couple more times and it finally sprayed for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The same perfume can smell differently in many people -it</li>
            <li> Lesson learned: if you want a real thing, buy it from a department store!</li>
            <li> This is the first perfume I bought that I did not like.</li>
            <li> Finally, I deciding to purchase Lovely, untried, based on a majority of rave reviews of how wearable and \\&quot;lovely\\</li>
            <li> because omg I almost followed her around like a creepy person cause she smelled amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Most perfumes give me such headaches but this one did not.</li>
            <li> Use this perfum since first on market.</li>
            <li> It lasts a very longtime while not having to use alot, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Funny story:</li>
            <li> So many different perfumes give me a headache, but this one does not.  </li>
            <li> First sniff</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and fast!  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and always go back after trying others.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just one girl&#x27;s opinion; I&#x27;m sure there are others who might feel differently....</li>
            <li> I will admit that when i first sprayed it, i did not like it but within 5 minutes after it sunk in</li>
            <li> I first learned of this frangrance from a co-worker.  </li>
            <li> , funny I realized the reason I always buy the knock off version of this</li>
            <li> This year she wasn&#x27;t expecting it, but did not buy any more after hers ran out last year.</li>
            <li> I have to reapply mid day but it is really lovely.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> can be worn to work or as an enticing fragrance for a first date.</li>
            <li> Women really like it!</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it has one scent , but as the day goes by the smell changes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still interested in trying it, you might consider getting the smaller size until you&#x27;re sure this is what you want to spend your money on.</li>
            <li> Pretty container.</li>
            <li> Really like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t return it because of shipping issues, but this is the first defective product that I&#x27;ve received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> there are top notes of floral, with a basic musk and amber underlayer.</li>
            <li> , although I do recommend you try it out first before buying.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice perfume -- not too sweet or heavy.  </li>
            <li> Will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> Unless you are famliliar with the scent first.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what it was supposed to be and the shipper was handled the order post haste.</li>
            <li> stores only carry the latest tweeny fragrances.  </li>
            <li> and it came to me exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> plan on ordering from this vendor again in the future as i was 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> An item that is not returnable be aware</li>
            <li> My first time ordering perfume on the internet.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is actually lovely like the name and it last longer evn aftr hours of having it on you</li>
            <li> The perfumes I priced were smaller for more money.  </li>
            <li> It smells \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; because its not heavy or too light.</li>
            <li> Very fast..love this perfume!</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been wearing it since 2005 when it first came out.</li>
            <li> More upsetting is that it arrived open (without the sealed wrapping), looks like as if it was a return of another costumer which they resent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for an everyday scent.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for casual events and to be worn during the day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for those looking for something that&#x27;s not too bold but will still set you aside from the crowd.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new scent that wasn&#x27;t too sweet or fruity.  </li>
            <li> Arrived right on time not broken...</li>
            <li> This scent is for a more mature woman, I instantly felt like a sophisticated 47 year old woman, I began knitting and talking about the stocks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lovely, on the other hand, is aptly named.  </li>
            <li> Love it, it smells so good, get a lot of compliments but not sure about it last effects.</li>
            <li> :) With that being said it was really hard to find a perfume that wasn&#x27;t overwhelming in it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly musky scent but mostly floral and a clean scents.</li>
            <li> This is a clean, clear, and mellow scent.</li>
            <li> This is a soft clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Soft and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It is a light floral with distinct undertones of white pepper.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to describe it, just soft and so feminine, like beautiful smelling soap.  </li>
            <li> It came nicely wrapped in its original box, and it&#x27;s a pretty large bottle so it will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> Loved your Endless too!!!</li>
            <li> Only takes a couple spritzes because its  strong at first</li>
            <li> very true that individual results vary.</li>
            <li> and I saw lots of positive reviews about this product and ordered it.</li>
            <li> This perfume had been my favorite for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is a lovely scent, only not for a woman in her 20&#x27;s, unless you need yarn and knitting needles which magically appear when spritzed on.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much when I first tried this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a scent like Lovely for a long time.</li>
            <li> After about 4hrs it&#x27;s pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li> This was my first real splurge on &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; perfume, but I guess I needed to keep looking.</li>
            <li> When the perfume was worn in public several friends said complimentary words about the fragrance and asked what was it, they liked it.</li>
            <li> just a small spray will leaving you smelling gorgeous all day.</li>
            <li> smells of soft sweet wood.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFUMES, SOFT ENOUGH TO BE JUST RIGHT.....</li>
            <li> I find Lovely to be a beautiful, complex, slightly unisex perfume with floral and woody accords.</li>
            <li> the bottle seems real the smell seems genuine however it seems to be watered down because the scent wesrs off very quickly.</li>
            <li> I hope you continue to carry Lovely for as long!</li>
            <li> I was kind of wary about buying this because I hadn&#x27;t actually smelled it before, but I needed a new perfume and this one was reasonably priced with good reviews!</li>
            <li> &quot; If cost is no issue in purchasing body sprays, I would recommend buying this particular bottle, because it was a very simple yet sophisticated scent and could be kept on one&#x27;s person without too much difficulty.</li>
            <li> There was a problem at first because only one bottle of a two bottle order was shipped, but it was corrected immediately and everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delicate and pleasant and has become their trademark scent.</li>
            <li> They all seem to smell strong and about the same.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong which I personally like --</li>
            <li> This size is large.  </li>
            <li> One thing I do know for certain, I will not be purchasing this perfume again.</li>
            <li> And, I will positively purchase this item again from Amazon, since the price was so reasonable.</li>
            <li> Perfume is a very personal product and looking at the reviews, I&#x27;m surprised so many women order perfume without seeing how the perfume works with their body chemistry first.</li>
            <li> Luckily I found Lovely at a &amp;#34;perfume store&amp;#34; and purchased a few.</li>
            <li> The smell is womanly sophisticated, soft, sweet, and classy.</li>
            <li> guess anyone wanting a beautiful delicate fragrance that is not strong will love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to be considerate of co-workers that may be allergic to perfumes, so maybe I don&#x27;t apply enough for it to last all day, but I really love to wear this perfume!</li>
            <li> It was very strong, loud, with a dry down of rose??</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great from first spray all the way to the dry down.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing on my girlfriend...was a little hesitant to buy it not knowing what it smelled like</li>
            <li> It is a soft, pleasant smell and not strong smelling ----and</li>
            <li> Not most favorite but like at night after ready for bed and clean smelling smell.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended, and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced that if you don&#x27;t like it on you, you aren&#x27;t out a lot of money.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little bit for an older age, but very fresh, light, and pretty.</li>
            <li> Initially upon receiving this perfume I was madly in love with it; however, after a little over a month of owning it, the lovely floral scent has vanished and taken on an offensive rubbing alcohol scent.</li>
            <li> My sister was very surprised!!</li>
            <li> The is my favorite perfume, not too strong but not too subtle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34;, a light feminine scent that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> This perfume is just light enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother him</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just light enough to smell</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a delicate, soft scent, then definitely try this awesome perfume.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast and received it without any damage.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t blow too much $$$.  </li>
            <li> face telling her to smell it now because it was really changing every minute that I had it on</li>
            <li> It really lasts.</li>
            <li> But I say you really should take the chance and get it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon.com</li>
            <li> and I really wanted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know I will get the real thing, not a knock-off.  </li>
            <li> It has made me very cautious about where I shop.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to sell the $40 bottle I got.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Obviously being newly in love, and the perfume one that &#x27;worked&#x27; with her body chemistry are always the foundation of such a statement, but this perfume to this day is just as powerfully alluring, and I am still immobilized by it.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated the sealed box as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to perfume and body sprays.</li>
            <li> Lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> A light sample to ones wrist leads to a totally different conclusion.</li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced and shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I received my product extremley fast, there was no damage.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> expected more:</li>
            <li> -The One, Light Blue...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very feminine.</li>
            <li> Did I mention that it&#x27;s reasonably priced and the bottle is &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; too?</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift, and it was much</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> since one does not need to spray much on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m on my way to finishing the whole bottle already.</li>
            <li> Very Sarah Jessica Parker (or what I would think she was like).</li>
            <li> so I really wanted to try it..</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not romantic and it&#x27;s not what a young person wants to be smelling like, but I am glad I got to purchase</li>
            <li> Never again will I purchase this perfume but the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> but I really hope I can always find it here on Amazon when I run out.</li>
            <li> Classy but fun scent.  </li>
            <li> much appreciated bonus: my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> ONCE PAID MUCH MONEY</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very affordable  </li>
            <li> This is such a light scent you can wear it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t as crazy about the scent as I thought I&#x27;d be, but I got a huge bottle of perfum for a low price, that shipped quickly, so really it was a very fair experience!</li>
            <li> Gently.</li>
            <li> the shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> I really wonder why would anyone on this planet like a scent like this?</li>
            <li> Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, J&#x27;Adore by DIOR.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s her absolute fave.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon.com for carrying it.</li>
            <li> My order arrived fast.</li>
            <li> then I thought it would (and said it would) and was packaged really well.</li>
            <li> this is very close.</li>
            <li> Very feminine</li>
            <li> Of course, items held in inventory are always fast and expeditious in delivery</li>
            <li> Watered-down - doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real thing;</li>
            <li> I like light scents that last.  </li>
            <li> This is a very feminine  body fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect fragrance to use if you have allergy suffers around you.</li>
            <li> It came packaged very well</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Very feminine and always catches the attention of others.</li>
            <li> was fast</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this fragrance to one and all!  </li>
            <li> You really have to smell it for yourself.</li>
            <li> thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I only wish the lotion was still available.  </li>
            <li> Its like a knock off of the real thing.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m assuming it doesn&#x27;t stand out too much either way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While at the mall, I tried Modern Muse and to me, these smell a lot alike.  </li>
            <li> definitely I would say this is cheap quality and duplicate one...</li>
            <li> Very feminine</li>
            <li> but yet you can&#x27;t really put it into words...  </li>
            <li> I do not believe this is the real product.</li>
            <li> ; even really likes it and</li>
            <li> I thought this perfume was the real thing.</li>
            <li> this perfume has very musky smell to it.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t beat how fast shipping is with Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> This is a classy scent that is fresh yet feminine.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Pair that with fast shipping</li>
            <li> I do not like heavy perfumes, or women who choose to overdo their own perfume application and</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not a huge SJP fan, there is something feminine, fun and confident about this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Soft, refreshing fragrance but definitely detectable.</li>
            <li> what kind of gift she would want, when she casually mentioned that she had just run out of her #1 favorite perfume, \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; by Sarah Jessica Parker.</li>
            <li> This is floral without being too heavy, feminine without smelling like an English rose garden, and has just the right hints of woman and fresh youth.  </li>
            <li> I first purhased this perfume at a well-known dept. store in New York and they no longer carry it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very expensive in terms of perfume, so I bought a bottle on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This scent is &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s a new favorite for a long time to come!  </li>
            <li> Love the way it is light and subtle.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping for something really different and unique.</li>
            <li> After a rough and tumble week sampling a number of sweet scents du jour (WD With Love, Escada Moon Sparkle, BS Fantasy, JS Fancy, Halle, Angel), I starting wondering if I ought to go out an get me a bottle of liquid confection.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like floral type perfumes (I like more spicier ones), but this perfume is an exception!</li>
            <li> received this and while it smelled identical to the fragrance (a lot more than I can say for some other &amp;#34;haute&amp;#34; designer fragrance assortments I&#x27;ve tried), so I was hopeful.</li>
            <li> It does last a significant amount of hours during the day.  </li>
            <li> Its a classy yet flirty scent, a little spicy and sweet and very unique.</li>
            <li> I had very high expectation from this perfume because of the high rating.</li>
            <li> When I first used this scent I really dislike the smell of it (Old lady scent)I thought to myself.</li>
            <li> Lovely has an active, jaunty fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell old or too sweet (young).</li>
            <li> LOVELY usually has a wonderful, fresh fragrance - this particular bottle of LOVELY is  very disappointing - not the same at all.  </li>
            <li> im not bog into super strong smells, and this one is pretty delicate, but def noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying several to share with my special friends.</li>
            <li> It has the delicate flowery scent that I love without fading quickly like B&amp;BW perfumes do.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, just that it does not long enough to think that it is an eau de parfum.</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old professional, I wear it daily and out at night, and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample by mail from a local retailer, but I found I could get the same item through Amazon.com at a more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I generally opt out for fresh scented body wash</li>
            <li> But its a bit too mature smelling for me, seems like something women over 30, or maybe over 35 would like to wear, I&#x27;m 27yrs old, I love feminine scents, I like White Diamond, and Xclamation, and some Elizabeth Taylor ones, but this one was just</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I sprayed it on was the musky old lady smell.  </li>
            <li> Came on the right day plus it was cheap almost like half off.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this over and over again and glad the price has gone down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and fresh and has a little bit of a soapy scent.  </li>
            <li> I think I found my new go to scent!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance, very delicate and light.</li>
            <li> She had such a hard time finding it in the stores and it was a great price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and delivered right on time!</li>
            <li> It is a light scent that I can wear all summer long!</li>
            <li> I really knew better, fell in love with this scent at a local store, just a little dab on my wrist held the scent for several hours.</li>
            <li> keep in mind, less is more.</li>
            <li> The parfum is an older ladies&#x27; scent.  </li>
            <li> Men buy this for your main lady, mistress, or chick on the side and you too will experience the temptation to pounce.</li>
            <li> Its definitely a classic style rather than contemporary - think Chanel rather than J Lo or Brittney.  </li>
            <li> I have worn Chanel Chance, RL Romance, RL Turquoise and Especially Escada most recently.</li>
            <li> This is a classic fragrance, not your overpowering J-Lo, B&#x27;Spears, etc.  </li>
            <li> There are some fruity notes listed that don&#x27;t quite come out on my skin, so the whole scent smells dry rather than sweet on me, which is definitely a plus: sweet perfumes intesify on my skin and lead to headaches and sneezing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is over rated and for an older crowd,</li>
            <li> Wondering if it is an older product???</li>
            <li> This scent is really soft and fresh, but mature.</li>
            <li> It is bold without being ostentatious, with several floral notes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn much more expensive scents, but I never get as many compliments and questions about what I&#x27;m wearing as I do when I wear this one.</li>
            <li> I think this is a smell that fits an older person</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it was as enjoyable to smell as I could have expected.</li>
            <li> Coming down from this olfactory sugar high, I clearly detect sweetness in Lovely at a reasonable level, just enough to satisfy my taste for sweet scents.</li>
            <li> I love it, my husband loves it, my friends, coworkers, and people I have randomly encountered in social situations love it and have commented on it!</li>
            <li> I was really satisfied with my previous orders, but on my last purchase I feel that there is smell of alcohol a bit more than it actually should be, therefore if I apply more than 2 sprays it gives me a little headache.</li>
            <li> Smell is not too strong and is a good mix of flowery with a little stronger undertone, maybe spicy or musky, it&#x27;s hard to say.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent when I first put it on, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments on it because it doesn&#x27;t last, even when I spray extra.</li>
            <li> So when SJP came out with Lovely and first tried it this brought me back to those days spent in SoHo.</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is my wife loves this perfume , I&amp;#34;ve been buying for years on amazon because it beats the high end retail stores prices &amp; bottle size in oz&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I know that this fragrance is made with high quality oils..and</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I would purchase again and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This came highly recommded by amazon folks</li>
            <li> I wonder why people give it so high rating.</li>
            <li> recommend this highly</li>
            <li> Very long lasting, light and fresh smelling like you&#x27;ve just taken a shower.</li>
            <li> An ADULT, contemporary &amp; classic fragrance for a WOMAN who has BTDT and knows what SHE wants out of life.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it didn&#x27;t mix well with my body chemistry, but the scent did remind me, like it had so many other reviewers, of the dated, old lady smell.</li>
            <li> I am the kind of person who loves perfume above any other \\&quot;must have\\&quot; item, and \\&quot;Lovely\\</li>
            <li> Smells sort of like Lovely, but it&#x27;s clear that other chemicals have been added.</li>
            <li> But if you wear Lovely, I paid a small price for it , better than TJ Maxx and other stores.</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived early!!  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it and it certainly won&#x27;t be the last!</li>
            <li> not heavy, very cleanr refreshing and a little herbal.</li>
            <li> It is such a loud very very mature strong scent,maybe because I&#x27;m in my early 20s</li>
            <li> In all honesty, the first experience with this perfume brought me back to my great grandmother&#x27;s house, where everything smelled like &amp;#34;Navy&amp;#34; by Dana, which she wore for years and always gave me the same dull headache from being overwhelmed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i read all the great reviews about this perfume and thought i would blindly buy it for myself.</li>
            <li> And its really reminds me of old women or a bingo hall.  </li>
            <li> Lol im bored.</li>
            <li> you really captured the scent of an old women’s dressing room with this one…</li>
            <li> Very feminine and soft, is a fragrance that is one of those you can&#x27;t put your finger on - like</li>
            <li> Buying Lovely on the internet saved me from making a 40-mile round trip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Lovely almost everyday and for any occasion.</li>
            <li> but I saw this and wanted to go back to it because it&#x27;s so sweet and young but not tween its for everyone over 15</li>
            <li> I wanna say that this is one of the few perfumes I love that a celebrity came out with.</li>
            <li> I normally use another online fragrance Co. for all my fragrance and cosmetic purchases.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This perfume is so delicate, and pretty, and feminine, without being overwhelmingly floral.</li>
            <li> Lovely is at first spicy with hints of delicate orchid and paper whites.</li>
            <li> She said it was not to heavy or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, my vanity favorites are currently Juicy Couture, Chanel no 5</li>
            <li> My sisters favorite for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Not a great one, but a good one.</li>
            <li> My criteria for buying great perfumes is a little less discriminating (on some counts)</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended for a young girl who is starting with her first bottle!</li>
            <li> more mature perfume that has a subtle fresh scent.</li>
            <li> The full amount, a big bottle, taste like toilet water started before the transfer relatively pungent, slowly easing in some of the tune after tune I fell in love, and now every day use, holding incense time is not too long, but the price has made me very satisfied</li>
            <li> Fresh clean scent, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> also always buy this on Amazon because it’s free shipping and always cheaper than other places.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and airy and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like other perfumes do.</li>
            <li> I live in England and my Daughter and family live in Michigan so on her birthday I log on to Amazon (USA) to buy her a gift.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered &amp; got it delivered (sealed &amp; brand new in the box)</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new here...</li>
            <li> New wife or purfume needed</li>
            <li> New life, new perfume.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new lighter parfum to wear to work.</li>
            <li> The perfume came brand new</li>
            <li> It says new, but it looks like its been handled a lot.</li>
            <li> and once I ran out, I new</li>
            <li> It is a nice light scent that just drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between this and Light Blue by</li>
            <li> older 38 year old sister</li>
            <li> Among my favorites are Ralph Lauren Blue and Dolce And Gabbana Light Blue.</li>
            <li> I finally found a fragrance I love after years and years of time and money spent searching..</li>
            <li> I am almost 52 years old and have worn perfume most every single day of my life since 3rd grade.  </li>
            <li> I love this perfume because it is long lasting at least more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This has a very soft smell to it.</li>
            <li> Soft yet the right amount to stay on you even til the next morning.</li>
            <li> Was not sure of this scent for the first 20 minutes after the initial spray - but as the perfume dried down it became more pleasant the longer</li>
            <li> In smelling I noticed that the one recently ordered had a definite alcohol smell, whereas the original I had did not.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Such a pretty scent.  </li>
            <li> I can say that because I am an old lady!</li>
            <li> I used CK one in the past but this smells so much better.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Lovely during the day.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Now, two weeks later there is literally no scent when it first comes out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You save a lot of money for the exact same perfume.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s sold in this small size.</li>
            <li> It has actually grown on me since I first got this perfume.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for a nice scent to stay with you all day long that doesn&#x27;t break the bank, I would suggest looking elsewhere, because this \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; perfume does not last long.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this perfume to all women, no matter how young or old.</li>
            <li> WOW - thought I would try something new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent, really memorable - soft, not overwhelming, but not too weak at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and will keep purchasing it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Saved almost half off retail with free shipping &amp; no tax-</li>
            <li> Enjoy wearing the cologne and will continue to purchase it as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> I like this scent for every day, it&#x27;s light and not sweet.</li>
            <li> Color was different from previous bottles--not sure if it was the bottle or the formula of the cologne.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume, and recently ran out and turns out every place that I had previously purchased it from</li>
            <li> then other days I notice it more often all day long and even into the evening.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll smell like sophistication, easily dodging the old-lady musk smell or something super sugary or over-the-top like you&#x27;d image roaming a high school hallway.</li>
            <li> If you like any of the J Lo fragrances, you will enjoy this little addition to your fragrance wardrobe.</li>
            <li> I figured it had been somewhat diluted with alcohol or something, tried spraying a little more on , the same thing.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and its hard to find now.</li>
            <li> Very light and not overwhelming!</li>
            <li> That is, unless the perfume has just been applied...be sure to apply at least 1/2 hour before being around others if they are sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> However, after I opened it, I saw that the bottle was not pink-tinted; it was clear with no color.  </li>
            <li> the so called perfume is clear.  </li>
            <li> Well, after wearing the product for about a month, I can really say that the department store smell and the one I get from Amazon are different.</li>
            <li> I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> and i was so surprised to receive it as a mother&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li> For upwards of 15 years I wore Liz Claiborne nearly exclusively until they changed it</li>
            <li> Of those, I think I would say this is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> Literally, it gave me severe headache all day long on my first try, and I throw it away.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is soft yet stays with you thru-out the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is comparable to a sort of wild honeysuckle or wildflower scent.</li>
            <li> you actually could have have a whole room smelling like this scent.</li>
            <li> Like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like a teenager nor an old biddie.  </li>
            <li> completely* vanished, not a trace.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy, and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early thirtys and like another reviewer said if you are under 35 do not wear this.</li>
            <li> maybe I will give it to my 62 yr old mother.</li>
            <li> It came completely packaged and it didn&#x27;t break or crack.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough.</li>
            <li> I would not suggest this to any early teens though or children.</li>
            <li> so I can enjoy it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews here that it&#x27;s not for young girls.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my 56 year old mom</li>
            <li> It is very layered, and different notes will surface over the course of the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to put too much on, just enough for me to smell it and anyone that might be close to me.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a small bottle the first time, and this time ordered a larger one as that&#x27;s all that was available.</li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> Have been busy using  it since it came out.</li>
            <li> Not because of the fragance itself but because it was an old bottle.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it near my wrist.</li>
            <li> Not the classy old lady either.</li>
            <li> Even now, I&#x27;m smelling my wrist as I write this review with the tiniest hope that it turns out it isn&#x27;t a headache-inducing old lady mothball</li>
            <li> It is old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> Possibly old stock...</li>
            <li> Like an old woman who lives in a cabin.</li>
            <li> I sprayed so much all over my body, my clothes and the back of my hair -</li>
            <li> For you 30 something&#x27;s that find yourself to mature for your old go-to perfumes.</li>
            <li> So, my husband surprised with a gift set for mother&#x27;s day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use &#x27;Lovely&#x27; from time-to-time but it loses it scent early &amp; just doesn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li> The difference doesn&#x27;t amount to that much, maybe 10 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of buying perfume on the net.</li>
            <li> Knowing that I wasn&#x27;t buying it directly from a trusted retailer, I almost worried I&#x27;d be getting a knockoff or watered-down version, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous for girls&#x27; night out as well as a job interview (especially with a potential female boss)!</li>
            <li> I will splurge on the real thing next time.</li>
            <li> Seeing as how I ordered it directly through Amazon, I will go out on a limb and give them the benefit of the doubt and say no.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely a &#x27;mature scent&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My life has changed and it was time to throw out my old perfume.</li>
            <li> and it never gets old.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to a lot of smells, but this one got lots of reviews and now I can give it a thumbs up also.  </li>
            <li> This perfume was a gift the scent it so pleasantly soft and alluring.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who is a mother of 5 and in her early 30s</li>
            <li> Not so overwhelming that it is offensive, or too mature, but the scent has enough weight to work year round.</li>
            <li> this on my wedding day back in 2005 which is my husband&#x27;s favorite and my signature perfume that I wear everyday</li>
            <li> This perfume is pretty musky, not very sharp, but definite.</li>
            <li> She has tried other scents but keeps going back to Lovely because it is an all round nice everyday scent.  </li>
            <li> D &amp; G Light Blue is my other.</li>
            <li> I love this frgarance, not only is it long lasting , but it&#x27;s different , It doesn&#x27;t smell like everything that everyone wears lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a subtle, sexy scent.  </li>
            <li> I thought at first it was different, but I have a lot of allergies and my husband finally had to say mention.</li>
            <li> I still have some left in a older bottle and compared with what I received.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that this bottle smelled a bit differently than past Lovely&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> When you first spray it smells the same but that last probably 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It was interesting to note that there was a identifiable difference between the aroma on each individual after a little time was allowed for “White Diamonds” to mellow and be warmed by the body.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes of liking this perfume, especially since Oprah raved about it and it is represented by SJP.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as an everyday perfume but instead for special occasions.</li>
            <li> some people have commented that the scent doesn&#x27;t wear very well for long periods of time, However I find that the scent payoff on this perfume lasts well over 8 hours for me</li>
            <li> It has  a light smell which is not overwhelming to the senses.  </li>
            <li> This perfume suits very well and lasts really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> it smells to peppery when you first spray it for one.</li>
            <li> the scent is peppery when first applied.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and within a few minutes of spraying it, I boxed it right back up and ready to ship out of here.</li>
            <li> This is my new daily perfume.</li>
            <li> My favorite and so hard to find!</li>
            <li> And I finally found a reasonably priced big bottle of it!</li>
            <li> well, needless to say, it was accomplished with &#x27;lovely&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My husband said it smelled like a fake rose smell and something an old lady would wear.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to strong perfumes, but this one is subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> is that the real one has a lot of white flower in it which gives me a total headache.</li>
            <li> It is really strong so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> but this one was a  major flop.</li>
            <li> Since I had worked for a major cosmetic and fragrance company for over 12 years....</li>
            <li> First hints are pepper followed by extreme stench.</li>
            <li> But for me, in the hot humid summer, I need something stronger and that will last so that I can at least smell fresh even if I don&#x27;t feel like</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a couple of compliments but nothing too major.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how many people use this perfume, but these days it is very hard to find this perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and delicate, others have mentioned that it smells unique -</li>
            <li> Everything that was indicted towards this product was 100% , was a gift for a long time friend , look forward to mainly purchase this item again for my friend...</li>
            <li> And we are not able to return the product due to: &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.&amp;#34; Overall, I would not recommend or buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Some fakes are obvious but other ones are very clever and you can only detect the imitation if you are already familiar with the product.</li>
            <li> It is delicate, elegant, subtle and just a touch sweet.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, so this perfume I obviously purchased as a Holiday gift for a \\&quot;lovely\\&quot; young lady.  </li>
            <li> Im a 22 year old female.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soft enough to re-apply.</li>
            <li> I think this bottle was old and starting to turn rancid.</li>
            <li> Searched around at the retail stores and apparently it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping item exactly as expected</li>
            <li> In all that time, I&#x27;ve developed several favorites but could never find a signature smell.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect the bottle to be that big which is only a big plus, as for the scent...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few bottles of perfume and 1 was not filled, probably leaked out, when I massaged them they were very accommodating and will definitely order my favorite perfumes from them in the future.  </li>
            <li> This smells exactly like the hung-over sour breath.</li>
            <li> Heard a lot of hype on this fragrance, and I like the new (pink) fragrances which are lighter and not heavy scents.  </li>
            <li> My current favorites are Noa &amp; Burberry Brit but always looking for something new &amp; different.  </li>
            <li> I had to spray a whole lot and the scent still did not last very long.</li>
            <li> You will love this perfume SERIOUSLY!</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT WAS LESS EXPENSIVE AND THE SAME ORIGINAL LOVELY</li>
            <li> The box it came in looked exactly the same as other &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; boxes.  </li>
            <li> i really can&#x27;t describe the scent other than to say that it is both ethereal, mood lifting and dare i say, yummy?</li>
            <li> Compared to other perfumes, there really is a very ample supply provided in each bottle as well.</li>
            <li> The scent is very distinctive in that it doesn&#x27;t remind me of any other scent.  </li>
            <li> When my other ones are over which i don&#x27;t like that much I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> It was sweet without being sickly and it was fresh while still very feminine.</li>
            <li> The main problem I have is that it just does not last very long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive for me in the few department stores that carry it, so this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Not too old or too young, but seems as though it would work for a wide array of women.</li>
            <li> She said it was lovely and very subtle.  </li>
            <li> Actually the name IS &amp;#34;Lovely,&amp;#34; and I haven&#x27;t had a positive response to a perfume in a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> So, I racked up major boyfriend points for actually listening to her and giving this gift to her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> when it first came I sprayed a little bit on my hand then when I washed my hands with soap</li>
            <li> but as many reviews it doesn&#x27;t last and after a few months the smell itself changed , vs higher end perfume its not great.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com, not second hand sellers, sells lots of fake cologne as real, but this one served my purposes just fine.  </li>
            <li> right to home a few days later.</li>
            <li> Really I did not like my wife very much and focus weak</li>
            <li> I noticed it was a different color than one I had, e.g. slightly orange like and not the pink tinge of the original one.  </li>
            <li> All these colognes are fake, the bottles looks nothing like the real thing, smells absolutely nothing like the real thing</li>
            <li> Not long after putting on the perfume, I brought my wrist to my nose to take a sniff, and I could detect no sign of the scent.</li>
            <li> Prior to the nauseating scent switch, the perfume&#x27;s scent barely lasted for an hour.</li>
            <li> and I barely wear it anymore (too commercial).</li>
            <li> Apparently it smells very different depending on what environment you are in.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, and the only one I can really wear without my allergies going crazy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s warm and cozy and subtle.</li>
            <li> It is very watered down and</li>
            <li> The first smell is great and does smell like “lovely,&amp;#34; but a second later it leaves a terrible after smell of a french old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware, buy this from a department store, I am not sure this is the real thing, or it&#x27;s just old.</li>
            <li> only complaint might be that it&#x27;s a bit TOO subtle, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s just a subtle hint of patchouli which I love, and other spicy hints</li>
            <li> A new fragrance for my wife I wanted to contrast with her other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Wife has been always a die hard fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, When she found this perfume and started wearing it since a few years ago, it became her favorite.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed  because I am loyal amazon shopper and did not expected to get this kind of product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This gives it an intimate feel in my mind, making it cozy and feminine.  </li>
            <li> You can wear it for any occasion, from something casual to more formal, dressier events.  </li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long and it even smells very watered down.  </li>
            <li> She says that the smell/perfume goes away in less than an hour and is highly displeased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely soft floral, with a clean amber base (Note, it&#x27;s definitely neither a fruity nor a green scent) .</li>
            <li> The professional 20 something just entering the corporate scene and realizing &amp;#34;OMG I need to smell like a lady around these people if I ever want to make decent money and get a damn office!&amp;#34; but not wanting/being able to realistically shell out on niche fragrances or that Jo malone crap...</li>
            <li> If anyone was familiar with Basic Instinct from Victoria&#x27;s Secret</li>
            <li> this perfume is amazing and smells so expensive!</li>
            <li> Well...no way are they getting anywhere near it other than to smell it.</li>
            <li> This product changed its smell - i believe it must be old and now the alcohol smell or some smell other than what it should be.  </li>
            <li> It definitely will last you long,</li>
            <li> Smells cheap and to me its not good!</li>
            <li> The only downside is, for her, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> However, it definitely doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers a couple different bottles with a slight difference in price.  </li>
            <li> This is my sister&#x27;s favorite perfuma and it is near impossible to find anymore.</li>
            <li> think this is my first negative review.</li>
            <li> She was very dissapointed, $37.50 wasted!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering, yet it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This sized bottle should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd bottle and will continue to buy as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like that the scent doesn&#x27;t last for long</li>
            <li> so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27; doesn&#x27;t last as long when I spray it.  </li>
            <li> smell doesn&#x27;t last for a long time</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been very keen to Paris Hilton&#x27;s scents, (particularly Pixie Dust and Paris Hilton) and was looking to branch out a little bit.</li>
            <li> It is sold by Amazon.com LLC, so I do not know if that has any influence on whether the product is original or a fake, but i purchased another perfume at the same time and have the same issue with it.</li>
            <li> exactly what we ordered........gets no better than that!......</li>
            <li> THIS SMELLS LIKE ALCOHOL, SO CAN BE EASILY CONCLUDED ITS FAKE.</li>
            <li> Sorry SJP maybe the other fragrances are better?</li>
            <li> Seller should be ashamed selling this toilet water!</li>
            <li> I tried to wear this several times, all of which resulted in a headache due to the strength at first, and a disappointment for the smell not lasting very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find scents that really do it, too.</li>
            <li> i was shocked on how the perfume became so nice on her.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, this was not a good indicator of what the real scent of the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> what a fake as it is nothing but lightly colored water or maybe the bottle is colored and</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I could still smell it when I woke up the next, while the one from Amazon doesn&#x27;t stay on throughout the day, and the smell never really changes.</li>
            <li> I do wonder if the difference is because I bought on line and not directly in a store.  </li>
            <li> Have worn this perfume for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering but lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t wear perfume because it will usually gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> was impress that you have it because it been discontinue a long time ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &#x27;old lady&#x27; and not something my teenagers would wear either.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Wish the review came to my attention in time for me to tell people how long it took for me to receive the shipment.</li>
            <li> I received the product several days before expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li> it was delivered earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I believe that perfume should last all day without having to reapply and that is certainly not the case with Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s \\&quot;Lovely.\\</li>
            <li> Perhaps one could chalk it up to my nose &amp;#34;getting used&amp;#34; to the scent and therefore no longer smelling it; however, with other perfumes I could always catch the lingering scent on my wrists after several long hours into the day.</li>
            <li> This parfum lasts so long!  </li>
            <li> , I think this scent has universal appeal, unless the lady in mind is extremely picky about her scents.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the same confidence in other online stores, whether they sell through Amazon or not.  </li>
            <li> To find out how Elizabeth Taylor “White Diamonds” perfume reacted with different body chemistries, I sprayed a small sample on the wrist of several friends.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not smell like the original.  </li>
            <li> I find myslef sniffing my wrists all day long!</li>
            <li> This smells very sexy and mature, yet still casual and everyday, which is a very hard combination to find.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a present and was a huge disappointment both for me and my mom.</li>
            <li> truly recommend it if you like dry not flowery</li>
            <li> This scent is not a new one</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mean to sound rude but it smells like something my grandma would wear.</li>
            <li> I am using it every single day to go to work.</li>
            <li> My purchase was based off of the amazing reviews, I was disappointed in the scent.</li>
            <li> I have bought from some well-known online perfume stores in the past and been sent imitations or old stock - ugh.</li>
            <li> Is the more expensive the real stuff and the cheaper the fake.  </li>
            <li> Not something to wear to a military formal or some other conservative male event.&lt;br</li>
            <li> worst of all the scent doesn&#x27;t even last for a good ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Even when it dries down I still think it smells gross.  </li>
            <li> i tracked down a lady in a dept store to ask what her perfume is and promptly bot it the next day.  </li>
            <li> hize the complaint and sent me a new package but with an order that I had arrived.</li>
            <li> Typical of Amazon - total satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Stores quit carrying my scent so just for a whim I looked on Amazon and not only did they have it but about $50.00 less.  </li>
            <li> I am truly disappointed because I only use Lovely.  </li>
            <li> so I know when I last ordered it and also the previous price I paid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 5 years and have just recently noticed less places carrying it.</li>
            <li> is half the price of the aforementioned.  </li>
            <li> however, the box wasn&#x27;t sealed and the glass bottle appears slightly smudged/dirty as if it was sitting out or handled frequently prior to being boxed and sold.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that she says the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that the scent does not last as long as a stronger scent might.</li>
            <li> Every single time I wear this I get compliments!  </li>
            <li> It seems to me that the reviews are either \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; positive or \\&quot;I hate it\\&quot; negative.</li>
            <li> Tried it twice, even spraying some on a shirt, then smelling it a little later, no difference.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about ordering it after  reading some of the reviews about perfumes smelling different than they should.  </li>
            <li> A little like big spray...</li>
            <li> smells very strong and more like for old people, hated the smell, couldn&#x27;t return :(</li>
            <li> Too bad this truly lovely scent has no staying power.  </li>
            <li> This was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> shocked when she said it was SJP Lovely.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten everything each year in no more than 9 days, and only one of those took that long.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m stuck with scent #1 until the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Shipping quicker than expected</li>
            <li> This was not the fragrance I expected.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I simply decided to throw the rest of the bottle</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell it five minutes after spraying, such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i expected her to.</li>
            <li> Getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> not sure why I could barely smell the perfume.</li>
            <li> After 2 spays it start to deliver rubbing alcohol without even distant hint of scent</li>
            <li> only smells for a few hours.</li>
            <li> but it is always out of stock the last few months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected and what was promised</li>
            <li> Perfume was as expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected and on time.</li>
            <li> It lasts throughout the day and not much is required.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is getting harder and harder to find in stores</li>
            <li> not really my thing.</li>
            <li> not much to say</li>
            <li> but in reality y&#x27;all deserve a jail cell cause</li>
            <li> Be careful ordering things that can not be returned this stuff is awful.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a total waste.</li>
            <li> She wears it almost everyday and hasn&#x27;t made a dent in the amount left.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Love the scent but hate the time that it last!!</li>
            <li> I mean &amp;#34;really&amp;#34;, you&#x27;d have to be blind not to see the better deal.</li>
            <li> Still, I reserved my judgment until the perfume had a chance to dry down and settle.</li>
            <li> Although the shipping was super fast for this perfume, something smells bad!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t think it lasts too long.  </li>
            <li> It is soft, feminine and subtle.</li>
            <li> so soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> It is subtle, classy, and understated.  </li>
            <li> After it dries, it is really a subtle, young fragrance.  </li>
            <li> it is soft, subtle, and almost a bit seductive.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I finally broke down and ordered it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Boy did I score some points with this stuff , She likes it because a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> As I read on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I seldom use perfume and usually stick to the same brand, Amarige.  </li>
            <li> This does not smell like the real Lovely, very disappointing !!!</li>
            <li> Why shop any other way?</li>
            <li> I was looking for an everyday perfume for a long time.</li>
            <li> and yeah this one cost me cheaper than other place</li>
            <li> Wish I could find other products in this fragrance line--shower gel, body lotion.</li>
            <li> I even have had sarah jessica parkers other scent dawn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found other perfumes I quit wearing because I thought they quit making them.  </li>
            <li> I have some other perfumes with Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s brand and I like them all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear an y other fragrance.</li>
            <li> shake my head in regret in not heeding the warnings of other reviewers.</li>
            <li> She has 3 choices now, as the other two perfumes where for her also.</li>
            <li> I bought this item due to the rave reviews....</li>
            <li> Love SJP but was disappointed in her Parfum.  </li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning and by mid-day, I need to put on more.  :(</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume based on other rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> This imitation we bought on Amazone did not even come close.  </li>
            <li> But with all the &amp;#34;scratch and sniff&amp;#34; pullouts from magazines that she carelessly left all over my computer desk, it wasn&#x27;t hard to take the hint.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it especially now during these late Fall and upcoming Winter days.  </li>
            <li> I must have purchased at least 100 times in the last 5 years.</li>
            <li> The only time it was late, I did call Amazon and you people tried to resolve.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent and as of late, I can only find it online.  </li>
            <li> last for at least 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rather sour breathery</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m pretty sensitive to perfumes and hate anything too flowery...</li>
            <li> Watered down, too much alcohol , something is terribly wrong here.</li>
            <li> i was not very happy with it as it just did not smell the same</li>
            <li> After the dry down, the sharpness faded into something slightly more powdery, but still I hated the scent on me.</li>
            <li> Perfume is watered down...</li>
            <li> After wearing for a couple of hours the scent does tone down and fade.</li>
            <li> the perfume I purchased- has been watered down-</li>
            <li> I think that it was watered down.</li>
            <li> The gift message is upside down, and it looks like it was done by someone who never wrapped before.</li>
            <li> This little bottle goes fast unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The department bottle smells the same going on, but throughout the day, the department one lasted longer and it turned into a subtle amber smell at the end of the day</li>
            <li> bottle was almost half what it was in the store.</li>
            <li> Well I purchased this based on previous reviews by others.</li>
            <li> Was half the price on Amazon as it was in the department store.</li>
            <li> The price at Amazon.com is almost half</li>
            <li> I am now stuck with over half a bottle of a not so &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; scent and out the money.</li>
            <li> Typically, I wear  Flowerbomb, Burberry, Dolce Gabana</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume as a gift for my girlfriend less than a week before Christmas.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price - less than half what it costs in department stores.</li>
            <li> and it was  substantially less than department store ( $68 vs $21).</li>
            <li> Wasted my $30 on this crap, will invest a bit more and buy one of my favorites:</li>
            <li> The fragrance in all of the previous bottles I have purchased from stores lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Flowery scent, but not sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sweet and girly, but</li>
            <li> Fragrance seems a little less in strength but that could just be my perception.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not last long.  </li>
            <li> Probably its not original.</li>
            <li> And as time passed, little by little within and hour</li>
            <li> I spray a little perfume on myself before bedtime every night and that has become the scent I use every evening.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little tricky to hold</li>
            <li> The moth ball scent does go away after it&#x27;s been on my skin for a little while.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a little knock-offish.</li>
            <li> Musky and woody without being heavy handed.  </li>
            <li> Even if your heavy handed with this scent</li>
            <li> She wears it everyday and gets compliments from her coworkers on it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to smell like bubble gum or heavy musk.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes, the scent had *</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch, but there wasn&#x27;t a perfume that I wanted myself to smell like it everyday and make it &#x27;my fragrance&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It has become a family tradition to purchase a few bottle every Christmas.</li>
            <li> But for crying out I&#x27;m 18</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to shortlist few and then try it out in a store and then buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> year round</li>
            <li> Something was missing like it been cut or something</li>
            <li> Wasted $38.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I definitely wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Total rip-off.</li>
            <li> I also saw you can order online at a few stores like Walmart.</li>
            <li> I don’t like really heavy scents, so if you want something that’s going to stay on you with 1 spray, this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend in Spain a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I dont know if its a fake, or if its really old and &#x27;went</li>
            <li> was debating between one or two stars, but decided on one star because this purchase was a 100% waste of money.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like and old lady like the expensive over priced prestigious brands do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear heavy fragrances because they give me a headache, this is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Waste of money...</li>
            <li> The reviews were not accurate at all.</li>
            <li> Not a huge bottle of perfume but for the price</li>
            <li> I bought several other scents that are expensive, she said not to waste my money.</li>
            <li> Super unhappy!</li>
            <li> Other reviews were really negative</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not strong, does not repel.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned because I have bought this for my Mom for her Birthday, when she opened the box and tried to pump some out, it was very difficult to get it primed, tried probably twenty times to get it to work, finally giving up telling my Mom I would send it back.</li>
            <li> This may be my first bad review on Amazon, but I just had to write this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delicate, not too sweet (I hate smelling like a candy wrapper), and has a slight floral scent.</li>
            <li> She tells me that this bottle has very little fragrance...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to other consumers!!!</li>
            <li> , I TOOK THE PRODUCT TO STORE AND COMPARED THIS SMELL AND THE REAL PRODUCT SMELL AND SHOCKED THAT</li>
            <li> when i got it and tried it i was not pleased.</li>
            <li> One bottle usually lasts about 3 months for me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small fortune to buy the smallest bottle</li>
            <li> There are not many reasons why the perfume does not stay.</li>
            <li> However, the bottle I just purchased will sadly be the last.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had destroyed all the packaging in the labor to get it open, or I&#x27;d have returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the formula was changed or if this was somehow damaged, but the lasting scent is not pleasant!!</li>
            <li> then she would usually wear, but it has grown on me.</li>
            <li> I had it before then switch to Alien</li>
            <li> I could even smell a faint whiff the next day before my shower.</li>
            <li> &quot; fragrance for my birthday this past</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one doesn&#x27;t smell quite the same</li>
            <li> stinks like old woman perfume.</li>
            <li> The only problem was, it&#x27;s fairly expensive in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but I find that some days the scent has disappeared after a couple hours and</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy this one again.</li>
            <li> also got a small purse size, to go with it</li>
            <li> Usually I have to switch my perfume after about a year as it starts to bother me</li>
            <li> The initial spray was unpleasant and sharp  to the nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very good smelling perfume to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m particular about stuff I like especially scents and this is one of the worst smells I&#x27;ve collected.</li>
            <li> This has a strong horrible smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So hard to find...</li>
            <li> I had a hard time washing it off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so hard to come by.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Hard to critique a perfume.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites scents and it is so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I find it hard to keep my wrist off my nose after applying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent on and off since it came out, but was having a hard time finding it in stores now.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had told me that she wanted this fragrance for Christmas because she was having a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> My favorite....and hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;Dept</li>
            <li> the scent is hardly noticeable - it appears to be water.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s hardly even a scent to it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find perfume.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this hard to find perfume</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This is a well-blended, complex, layered fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Seller - I apologize for writing so late -</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20s</li>
            <li> Not in the least overpowering.</li>
            <li> Delicate powdery sweetness with a musky undertone overlaid with spice.</li>
            <li> I guess it was not hazardous to sell and ship to me</li>
            <li> I gave one start because it is no option for zero or negative one.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to spend at least $60 on a perfume, shopping on amazon.com is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> Not nice smell.</li>
            <li> Was afraid it might be a knockoff because of the price, but it appears to be just the same as the retailers sell.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m 3/4 through the bottle, and wear this at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> musk at the base of this fragrance seemed too much for me, resulting in what me and my mom always referred to as &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I have worn it now for the past 3 years!  </li>
            <li> &amp; I do mean &amp;#34;NOTHING&amp;#34; &amp;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very small</li>
            <li> it smells like an old woman&#x27;s perfume:-(</li>
            <li> Was old smelled like vinegar when sprayed on disappointed</li>
            <li> It lasts in a subtle way.  </li>
            <li> Try to open it gently (impossible), and KEEP everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle fragrance and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, unless applied in unreasonable amount of course.</li>
            <li> I found your price to be much less expensive than the department stores.</li>
            <li> It was next to impossible to find this fragrance in any chain retail, drug, or department store.</li>
            <li> The scent smells vaguely like the &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; I&#x27;d been using for years, though I can detect a slight essence of moth balls.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find it subtle and couldn&#x27;t wait to shower it off.  </li>
            <li> The scent is delicate yet stays with your throughout the day - two sprays is all you need!  </li>
            <li> it last 5 min :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the scent is so weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to have to say I agree with those who declared this was not lovely at all.</li>
            <li> I will never order perfume on line again, I am afraid that it was watered down on purpose.</li>
            <li> but it is tough to describe.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift online as this is getting tough to find at retailers.  </li>
            <li> Very common and one dimmensional; lacks sophistication and complexity.  </li>
            <li> (I mean have you SMELLED ramon monegal?!).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s from poor packaging or something else.</li>
            <li> BUT this time this perfume does not stay long time :(.</li>
            <li> I never wear perfume because I have a terrible sense of smell and fear I will use too much without realizing it.  </li>
            <li> I guess I would say it&#x27;s like sort of a dusty orchid smell.</li>
            <li> so confused as to why they discontinued it,</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift for my girlfriend that is 23 years old and she hated it.  </li>
            <li> But not great either.</li>
            <li> Poor shipping experience,</li>
            <li> not robust, very faint and smelled weird because it was so watered down.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful, old lady scent--no offense.</li>
            <li> However, this perfume smells horrible and old.</li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t we all just a little sick of smelling like a grocery store?  </li>
            <li> Watered down really disappointed with this purchase</li>
            <li> My fave and it&#x27;s hard to find!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually wary of things Oprah raves about (I&#x27;ve read several of her book club recommendations and hated every one,)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ware it anymore which makes me sad because I always got a million compliments from everyone.</li>
            <li> If floral is ur thing, you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Received as a gift and not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who claims that it has to be a fake product.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly ordered the wrong item for my wife&#x27;s Christmas gift and wanted to return it.  </li>
            <li> , THIS PRODUCT&#x27;S SMELL IS INDEED A FAKE ONE.</li>
            <li> I ordinarily shy away from celebrity scents, but this one is an exception.</li>
            <li> and I find it difficult to find it in retail stores</li>
            <li> This product is a fake.</li>
            <li> bottles of expensive water.</li>
            <li> Went out to a department store and bought another bottle unfortunately.</li>
            <li> doesnt even last for a minute and the smell disgusting!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that it just wasn&#x27;t for me..</li>
            <li> I was unable to find it in a store nearby.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t stand the scent.  </li>
            <li> perfume failed the test.  </li>
            <li> Can,&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, Amazon will let not let you return it!</li>
            <li> This must be fake.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten on comment on it at all, not good or bad</li>
            <li> probably not my smell.. would use it if i am in the sad cold mood</li>
            <li> Bad scent  &amp; fake cologne.</li>
            <li> and now it just stinks.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> This stinks like the cheapest dollar store garbage.</li>
            <li> This just stinks.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> really stinks</li>
            <li> Sorry it is not for me!</li>
            <li> Sorry Sarah!</li>
            <li> had to give away and it was expensive :(</li>
            <li> I bought this \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; perfume in the hopes that it would eliminate any unpleasant scents I might have in spite of my cleanliness.</li>
            <li> It smells very faint after 5 hours or so.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> felt sooooo bad</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it will be that bad</li>
            <li> also it was unreturnable which i did not know so - what a bad deal.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> I felt bad for copying her</li>
            <li> I even tried to give it the benefit of the doubt after reading a minority of bad reviews.</li>
            <li> bad&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> bad organization</li>
            <li> This is a bad knock-off.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to find out that it was not being sold in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> I put on two sprays in the morning before school and two sprays at night just after dinner, and it was with my frugal spraying that I became disappointed.</li>
            <li> Yikes!! :-(</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; &#x3D;(</li>

            <li> She loved getting it and loves wearing it!</li>
            <li> This is my smell.  Always and forever will be recognized for how beautiful it smells.  Just my favorite of all time.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!! And I finally found a reasonably priced big bottle of it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love lovely&lt;br /&gt;So hard to find...very satisfied with order&lt;br /&gt;Received in 2 days!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SCENT!  Prompt service....</li>
            <li> Favorite... please send coupon or free samples...&lt;br /&gt;BEST SMELL ever!</li>
            <li> Musky and woody without being heavy handed.  I wish it lasted longer, but I get lots of compliments in the hours after I&#x27;ve applied it.  I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter.  It is a light but fragrant scent.  Very refreshing!</li>
            <li> Great perfume for my daughter. She loved it!</li>
            <li> This is my go to cologne .&lt;br /&gt;I love it&#x27;s light fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments when I wear it</li>
            <li> must say nice fragrance and stay is also long lasting&lt;br /&gt;nice packing by amazon and timely delivery of the product&lt;br /&gt;really happy,,....worth buying product.......</li>
            <li> I had very high expectation from this perfume because of the high rating. I liked the smell but it does not stay for even one hour. Probably its not original. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This perfume is great. It has a nice, scent that would make any woman feel confident, loving, feminine, attractive. Seriously, it is the perfect scent for any occasion. It&#x27;s not overpowering, yet it is long lasting. Everyone around you will love the scent.</li>
            <li> As I read on other reviews.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last long and it even smells very watered down.  just like a knock-off</li>
            <li> This is a great perfum and I loved it. I am using it every single day to go to work.</li>
            <li> i read all the great reviews about this perfume and thought i would blindly buy it for myself. when i got it and tried it i was not pleased. it did not smell good on me. i would have kept it if it were OK on me. but since i was disgusted with the smell i did what any daughter would do...give it to her mother! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyhow, my bad manners came in handy since it smells wonderful on her. i was shocked on how the perfume became so nice on her.  so my advice is try the perfume on (at a store with a tester) before you buy it because the smell changes according to body chemistry. if it had not worked out for my mom i would have had to dump it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and the shipping and all was great.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lovely perfume as long as it has been available.  I hope this perfume is never discontinued.  I absolutely love the way this perfume smells!  And, more importantly, so does my husband.  He is sensitive to a lot of smells &amp; most perfumes give him headaches.  This perfume is just light enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother him but we both think that it smells &amp;#34;lovely.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful that a perfume like this is available.  I love being able to wear perfume.  I receive a lot of compliments about this perfume &amp; I feel confident when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I am constantly complimented on this fragrance.  Very soft and light.</li>
            <li> I seldom use perfume and usually stick to the same brand, Amarige.  But one day out shopping I tried SJP&#x27;s \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; and fell instantly in love with the light, flowery fragrance.  It&#x27;s not overpowering or strong so it wears well at the office. It&#x27;s just light enough to smell simply lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the gift sets for both of my daughters and they, too, love the fragrance.  One of my daughters has allergies and she said the perfume doesn&#x27;t affect her allergies at all.  If you&#x27;re looking for a delicate, soft scent, then definitely try this awesome perfume.  You&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> I tried this fragrance at a department store in our mall and wore it around for a day or so, never faded and smelled wonderful. I bought the same stuff from Amazon because hey, it was cheaper. Well, after wearing the product for about a month, I can really say that the department store smell and the one I get from Amazon are different. The department bottle smells the same going on, but throughout the day, the department one lasted longer and it turned into a subtle amber smell at the end of the day and I could still smell it when I woke up the next, while the one from Amazon doesn&#x27;t stay on throughout the day, and the smell never really changes. I originally bought the smell because I liked how it smelled in the evening... I guess I&#x27;m stuck with scent #1 until the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> My best friend since I was 16 and I am 40 now recieved this from me as a birthday gift. She absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I just received this today and I was really excited,especially from the great reviews i read. It is such a loud very very mature strong scent,maybe because I&#x27;m in my early 20s I hate it.</li>
            <li> You know Like may others I got this because of everyone saying how much they loved it. And I was looking for a more grown up smell.  Sadly I HATED IT! it smells to peppery when you first spray it for one. And its really reminds me of old women or a bingo hall.  Even when it dries down I still think it smells gross.  I own the new SJP NYC perfume and love that one.  I think this one was made popular because of Orpah (shame on you..lol)  Now Im stuck with a smell I wont be able to wear til im 70.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. Fewer stores in my area (Salt Lake City) are carrying Lovely.  The price I paid for this 3.4 oz. bottle was almost half what it was in the store.</li>
            <li> When I got the spray (Jessica Parker&#x27;s \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; perfume spray, [[ASIN:B000H70PZG Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker for Women 3.4 Eau De Parfume Spray]] I noticed it was a different color than one I had, e.g. slightly orange like and not the pink tinge of the original one.  In smelling I noticed that the one recently ordered had a definite alcohol smell, whereas the original I had did not.  What a shame.  I am sure this was to cut costs and hoping customers woulod not notice.  Well I did and will not buy again...what a shame because it HAS BEEN my favorite.  I do wonder if the difference is because I bought on line and not directly in a store.  In the meantime, Buyers Beware.  Jonina Weeks</li>
            <li> Nice one at good price.</li>
            <li> found this scent several years ago, i really love it, it&#x27;s light and smells wonderful, although its getting harder to find i will keep buying it as long as i can.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife likes it so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells wonderful!!. I bought this as a gift for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. Not a very bold scent, but smells great. Definitely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Love it quick delivery</li>
            <li> Watered down really disappointed with this purchase</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time and in good shape.  The product was acceptable...I have been using this product for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as expected. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, undamaged and as described</li>
            <li> This does not smell like the real Lovely, very disappointing !!!</li>
            <li> My wife loved this perfume and I got it quick and at a great price! I would recommend  Lovely and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product had great reviews so I got it for my wife and she loves it. Shipped fast and received it without any damage.</li>
            <li> Typical of Amazon - total satisfaction.  Everything was easy, fast and a pleasure. Great prices and great service. Why shop any other way?</li>
            <li> What a gorgeous, gorgeous scent!  This parfum lasts so long!  I was surprised.  Like the Lovely Lotion, I heard this product is also to be discontinued.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> OPRAH LIED TO ME AND SAID ON TV THAT THIS IS  THE BEST. I FELL FOR IT AND I BROUGHT IT AND THE SMELLS STINK. IT DONT LAST ALL DAY SO NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY IT . THE WORST PERFUME EVER.</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorite perfumes.  I love the sweetness and lightness of it.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  One bottle usually lasts about 3 months for me.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all-time favorite scents.  I have been wearing it ever since it came out.  I have a friend who wears it to work (even though we&#x27;re not supposed to wear perfume) and she gets away with it, because it&#x27;s not overly strong.  It smells exactly as it is named: Lovely.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon about a week ago! I&#x27;m sure this came from a merchant through Amazon! Well I purchased this based on previous reviews by others. Well, when I sprayed this on, it reminded of a floor cleaner? It was very strong, loud, with a dry down of rose?? Eeeewwww! I had a hard time washing it off. Never again will I buy a fragrance from here!! Buyer beware! In the trash can it went!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as an everyday perfume but instead for special occasions. I like it. It&#x27;s fairly cheap so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it...as do I.  It isn&#x27;t too &#x27;perfume-y&#x27; and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> purchased this as a christmas gift for my younger sister last year---who sighed and moaned everytime she saw an advertisment for the fragrance or passed the fragrance counter. she is relatively new to wearing fragrance and was looking for something \\&quot;light and feminine...a scent that would make an impression upon leaving or entering a room\\&quot;. well, needless to say, it was accomplished with &#x27;lovely&#x27;. i really can&#x27;t describe the scent other than to say that it is both ethereal, mood lifting and dare i say, yummy?</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased with the product (which was to be a gift) and the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;timely manner in which it arrived.  I will not hesitate to order such&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;items through Amazon.com again.  Considering the price of the item (well below retail pricing) and the speed in which it arrived, this purchase was a bargain!!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and was glad to find the large bottle at such a great price. Very prompt shipping too!!</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of Lovely. I just love the fresh scent. Amazon is the greatest way to shop!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  It has a very sweet smell but is not overpowering.  I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the biggest SJP fan, but my wife loves this perfume. Amazon is a great deal compared to U1ta and other retail stores which is about twice the price.</li>
            <li> This is a perfume I wear day and night and get so many compliments.  It lasts in a subtle way.  Great price compared to stores.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and lasts all day</li>
            <li> A more accurate name for this perfume could never have been found!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this Lovely perfume by SJP as a gift, after months of raving about it after I tested it in a department store, and use it regularly for everyday/office wear. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect, very nice, not too mild, but not over-powering. I&#x27;ve also gotten tons of compliments while wearing this scent from both guys and girls, and always refer them to this fabulous perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s presented in a very classic bottle, and is a great gift idea, I think this scent has universal appeal, unless the lady in mind is extremely picky about her scents. It&#x27;s a lovely soft floral, with a clean amber base (Note, it&#x27;s definitely neither a fruity nor a green scent) . It&#x27;s not an overpowering perfume (no smell-you-before-I-see-you!) rather it \\&quot;hugs\\&quot; your skin, making it wearable for almost ocassion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also some people have commented that the scent doesn&#x27;t wear very well for long periods of time, However I find that the scent payoff on this perfume lasts well over 8 hours for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> The price I paid for this is exceptional!!! I recommend ordering from this site, my merchandise arrived quickly and was just what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new scent that wasn&#x27;t too sweet or fruity.  This is a subtle, sexy scent.  My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t think it lasts too long.  I would still buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am not too pleased with this purchase. After all the great reviews, I was expecting more. But may be ok for the price</li>
            <li> Lovely the perfume from Sarah Jessica Parker is just that; lovely.  It has  a light smell which is not overwhelming to the senses.  It is fresh and light but stays on for hours .  It is one scent I can wear without fear of offending others because of too strong of an aroma.  I love it and it is ny signature perfume.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3.4 oz. spray only but instead I received the entire gift set! Shipping was quick too!</li>
            <li> I love Lovely. It&#x27;s light and slightly sweet smelling to me. I always get complimentswhen I use it.</li>
            <li> Was half the price on Amazon as it was in the department store. I give it 5 stars for that reason alone. I bought this for my wife and she likes it. I don&#x27;t like the smell of any perfume so can&#x27;t comment on smell just price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my absolute most favorite fragrance and i was so surprised to receive it as a mother&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li> I sampled this in a store while traveling and decided to order a bottle online. I have been wearing it for about a month now, and it is wonderful. I have had many people tell me it smells great, and it was the right scent for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t worth for the money</li>
            <li> Smells soooooo good. I have been wearing this since I first saved my allowance to buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the great reviews. It has a sickly sweet smell. Reminds me of the perfume, White Shoulders, my grandmother wore. I won&#x27;t even give it away because my mother told me to never give someone something that you don&#x27;t want yourself. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Item was perfect and expected.</li>
            <li> The parfum is an older ladies&#x27; scent.  It is nice but not young or fresh.  The price at Amazon.com is almost half so I didn&#x27;t blow too much $$$.  KIM</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume. I get a lot of compliments on its scent. And ya can&#x27;t beat the price. Great price for the size of the bottle. Delivery is always quick.</li>
            <li> I first decided to purchase Lovely because I just wanted to try it. Then after I bought it I actually read others opinions on it. I thought \\&quot;Oh darn it! Well if I don&#x27;t like it, one of my two daughters would take it off of my hands.\\&quot; Well...no way are they getting anywhere near it other than to smell it. I loved it. When I first sprayed it on I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it. It just seemed to smell like everything else out there right now. I didn&#x27;t dislike it but I was hoping for something really different and unique. Within 10 minutes on me I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing the back of my hand where I had sprayed it. And as time passed, little by little within and hour or so I couldn&#x27;t stop saying \\&quot;I love this\\&quot; and sticking my hand in my daughters face telling her to smell it now because it was really changing every minute that I had it on and it had turned into something truly lovely.&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I sprayed the back of my hand and later the back of my neck. I washed my hands about twenty times during the evening and I could still smell it so softly and beautifully on my hand. It really lasts. Several hours later my husband of 26 years walked in the door and couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off of me. He kept saying throughout the entire evening how good I smelled. Well if he loves it, my 25 year old daughter loves it and of course I love it, then I would say it&#x27;s likely you will like it or maybe love it yourself. It&#x27;s worth a shot at that price for sure. Other reviews were really negative and if I had read them first I probably would not have bought it. It seems to me that the reviews are either \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; positive or \\&quot;I hate it\\&quot; negative. But I say you really should take the chance and get it. I don&#x27;t believe you will regret it. I love it. I can&#x27;t stress that enough. I haven&#x27;t bought any new perfume for myself in many years because I am so picky. For upwards of 15 years I wore Liz Claiborne nearly exclusively until they changed it and now it just stinks. I can&#x27;t ware it anymore which makes me sad because I always got a million compliments from everyone. I love Hypnotic Poison but it&#x27;s a small fortune to buy the smallest bottle and it&#x27;s not a perfume you would want to ware all the time. And then there is my favorite since I was a teenager, Heaven Sent. And since the company changed hands and decided to \\&quot;reformulate\\&quot; it and ruined it I just thought I was probably going to be doomed to be without that kind of enthusiasm over a perfume again. So thanks to SJPs Lovely, I have a new favorite that is just perfect for anytime and every day. It really is a very nice fragrance. Did I mention that I really love it?</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume! It&#x27;s the only scent I wear.</li>
            <li> Mmmmm, smells so nice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this fragrance.  Too bad it&#x27;s so hard to come by.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mistress for valentine&#x27;s day and let me tell you, it turns me all the way on. Whenever she sprays this perfume on, I just want to pounce on her like a lion jumping on a gazelle. Yes it has that affect on me, and I can&#x27;t help it. I tried to resist the temptation to pounce, but my body won&#x27;t let me. This review is getting out of control, so to sum it up im just going to say great shipping and A+ seller. Men buy this for your main lady, mistress, or chick on the side and you too will experience the temptation to pounce. Lol im bored.</li>
            <li> All I can say is my wife loves this perfume , I&amp;#34;ve been buying for years on amazon because it beats the high end retail stores prices &amp; bottle size in oz&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Light, refreshing, clean, not too sweet</li>
            <li> Lovely has such strong flowery and citrusy notes. It&#x27;s the type of fragrance that gives you an instant headache. I didn&#x27;t like it at all.It&#x27;s far too strong( Hit you over the head strong!!).It arrived at my place of work, and my co- workers were also turned off by it.I love trying new fragrances but this one was a  major flop.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  It is girly and romantic but not clingy.</li>
            <li> I have used Lovely for several bottles. This is the first one that the perfume does not stay on. There are not many reasons why the perfume does not stay.</li>
            <li> When I first used this scent I really dislike the smell of it (Old lady scent)I thought to myself. I decided to give it another try because I tend to like the more sweet smelling scents and this was not that kind of scent. I bought this based on the great reviews and mostly everyone of them said they repeated the purchase. This perfume had to grow on me. I am begining to really enjoy this scent, It has to settle in for me than I really sniff away and say to myself I love this! As always Amazon shipped super-fast and the packaging was secure....Try it you just may like it, It&#x27;s a grown woman scent</li>
            <li> bought it for the wife for xmas she likes it cant find in stores</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and exactly as advertised I am very pleased</li>
            <li> Was delivered promptly and in tactm</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and perfect</li>
            <li> was expecting something more lovely .. it s rather sour breathery ( like somebody mentioned) // probably not my smell.. would use it if i am in the sad cold mood</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive my perfume -- delivered quickly and was just want I wanted.  I would definitely order from here again.</li>
            <li> The name says it all!&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is just perfect for day wear, not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t make others around you feel like they&#x27;re being choaked like so many other flowery scents do. I get many comments when I wear it \\&quot;what are you wearing? it smells so nice!\\&quot; I also enjoyed having it delivered to my door. I suggest for any scent, if it&#x27;s available in the dept. store, to try it first. Many times what you like at first becomes not so great after about an hour.</li>
            <li> Sent to my daughter for Xmas present. Bottle from last year had run out. Loves Lovely.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite perfume and its my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Nice purchase and easy use.</li>
            <li> Came on time and just as pictured.</li>
            <li> Sarah Jessica Parker parfum is one of my favorites and I was able to purchase at such a great price. I would recommend this to other consumers!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance, very delicate and light. However, the bottle I just purchased will sadly be the last. I just bought the Eau de Parfum but the scent just fades in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess anyone wanting a beautiful delicate fragrance that is not strong will love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is &#x27;Lovely&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I first purhased this perfume at a well-known dept. store in New York and they no longer carry it. I immediately went to Amazon.com and was so happy to see that you have it available.  I always get compliments when using this perfume. Thanks to Amazon.com I now have my perfume.</li>
            <li> WOW - thought I would try something new. The reviews were not accurate at all. So light that I cant smell it. But each woman is her own, as for me I like to smell my perfume. Wouldn&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li> Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker is a light, clean fragrance.  It is not heavy or strong smelling.  The best part of buying it on Amazon is the price.  The same size bottle at the mall was $62.00.  I paid $24.25.  Wow!  What a savings!</li>
            <li> This was a huge disappointment. I needed something that would last beyond 20 minutes, and this not only didn&#x27;t last 5 minutes, but I didn&#x27;t like the aroma and my husband couldn&#x27;t smell it at ALL. I doused myself with it and got right in his face....NOTHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried layering another perfume on top of it, but it seemed to kill that perfume, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this in stores and liked it, so I&#x27;m pretty sure the bottle I got was beyond it&#x27;s shelf life. Unfortunately, I had destroyed all the packaging in the labor to get it open, or I&#x27;d have returned it immediately. Lessons learned. Try to open it gently (impossible), and KEEP everything. If you don&#x27;t get a good bottle, put everything in a box and ship it back IMMEDIATELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is my first negative review.</li>
            <li> Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker is a soft, long-lasting fragrance that does not seem to bother those around me that are prone to migraine headaches and/or allergies. That is, unless the perfume has just been applied...be sure to apply at least 1/2 hour before being around others if they are sensitive to fragrances. The perfume has always arrived in a timely manner and has been packaged well so there was never any breakage.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it and the scent lasts all day!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is so delightful. It is light and flowery without being over powering. When people come into my work place they ask what smells so good and of course it&#x27;s my Lovely Parfum. If you like a light fragrance but one that last all day without being too strong this is the parfum for you!</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments wearing this!</li>
            <li> It came just before I was to go on a trip and I really wanted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheri</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years - I&#x27;ve received many comments on the fresh smell.  It is definitely not an overbearing perfume.  I saw it first introduced on Oprah and how much she liked it.</li>
            <li> I live in England and my Daughter and family live in Michigan so on her birthday I log on to Amazon (USA) to buy her a gift. Most women love perfume and anything endorsed or named after Sarah Jessica Parker has to be good. Incidently the service between the UK and the USA using Amazon is excellant. Goods always delivered on time and currency conversion done on ones credit card is at a fair rate. Thank you once again for delivering the goods.&lt;br /&gt;Regards John</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this perfume.  Arrived on time</li>
            <li> I SMELLED LOVELY ON A LADY WALKING BY ONCE IN THE GROCERY STORE AND LOVED IT SO I BOUGHT THE 1.7 OZ ON FRAGRANCENET.COM AFTER WEARING LOVELY AND GETTING COMPLIMENTS AND LOVING THE WAY MY CLOTHES SMELLED AFTER WEARING LOVELY I BOUGHT THE 3.4 OZ BOTTLE ON AMAZON BECAUSE IT WAS LESS EXPENSIVE AND THE SAME ORIGINAL LOVELY I LOVE. GREAT SERVICE, GREAT GREAT PERFUME!!!</li>
            <li> This is a well-blended, complex, layered fragrance.  It is quite heady going on, and you only need to use a very light spritz. It lasted all day without changing character.  This is probably because its a parfum spray, not eau de toilette. This sized bottle should last a long time.  Perfumes are very subjective, but I really liked the scent. You can still smell a lingering fragrance on your skin after having a shower. Its definitely a classic style rather than contemporary - think Chanel rather than J Lo or Brittney.  Overall, I think its one of the best new perfumes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this direct from Amazon  -  great price, and buying direct from Amazon I know I will get the real thing, not a knock-off.  I don&#x27;t have the same confidence in other online stores, whether they sell through Amazon or not.  I have bought from some well-known online perfume stores in the past and been sent imitations or old stock - ugh. It has made me very cautious about where I shop.  Some fakes are obvious but other ones are very clever and you can only detect the imitation if you are already familiar with the product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, and the only one I can really wear without my allergies going crazy. I&#x27;m so glad it is available online (since it&#x27;s no longer in stores). My order arrived quickly and was just as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly as discribed, wonderful aroma, my wife loved it. Shipping quicker than expected</li>
            <li> This scent is one of my all time favorites.  It&#x27;s very light with a musk undertone that is very feminine.  I haven&#x27;t met one person who doesn&#x27;t like the scent, although one of my friends said it gives her a headache when she wears it.  I highly recommend this to any woman who likes clean, fresh fragrances that can be worn day or night.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would live up to the hype. Read a lot of women say, \\&quot;imagine Sarah in sex in the city and this is exactly how she&#x27;d smell\\&quot;--no way. I&#x27;d really like to sell the $40 bottle I got. The smell is awful, old lady scent--no offense. I&#x27;m particular about stuff I like especially scents and this is one of the worst smells I&#x27;ve collected.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this product and liked it, but the jury was still out as to how much I liked it. It&#x27;s not very expensive in terms of perfume, so I bought a bottle on Amazon. I do like the perfume. It smells good on me, although I&#x27;m realizing that I like the scent less as the day moves on. I&#x27;m sure that has something to do with my natural body oil and how it affects the perfume&#x27;s chemistry. It&#x27;s a lovely bottle. Very elegant and pretty. Compared to other perfumes, there really is a very ample supply provided in each bottle as well. I have worn Chanel Chance, RL Romance, RL Turquoise and Especially Escada most recently. Of those, I think I would say this is my least favorite. But again...the smell is very nice. Over the course of the day, it&#x27;s just less impressive to me. With that said, I do still use it regularly. I spray a little perfume on myself before bedtime every night and that has become the scent I use every evening. Sometimes stick with Escada during the day time though. Try out a sample and see what you think. Perfume is unique to each person and their body chemistry. This is a good classic scent. Not too old or too young, but seems as though it would work for a wide array of women.</li>
            <li> As a full-time student and part-time employee, I move around a lot. I shower regularly and never forget deodorant. I bought this \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; perfume in the hopes that it would eliminate any unpleasant scents I might have in spite of my cleanliness. For the $42 I paid for it, I was somewhat pleased. The bottle was adorable and the scent was wonderful. It was sweet without being sickly and it was fresh while still very feminine. I put on two sprays in the morning before school and two sprays at night just after dinner, and it was with my frugal spraying that I became disappointed. Not long after putting on the perfume, I brought my wrist to my nose to take a sniff, and I could detect no sign of the scent. Every trace had faded away within ten minutes of putting it on. I believe that perfume should last all day without having to reapply and that is certainly not the case with Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s \\&quot;Lovely.\\&quot; If cost is no issue in purchasing body sprays, I would recommend buying this particular bottle, because it was a very simple yet sophisticated scent and could be kept on one&#x27;s person without too much difficulty. However, if you are looking for a nice scent to stay with you all day long that doesn&#x27;t break the bank, I would suggest looking elsewhere, because this \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; perfume does not last long.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift and she really liked the scent.</li>
            <li> I had sampled this perfume in a Macy&#x27;s store and it was lovely, but the price expensive.  I saw it on Amazon and ordered it.  It wasn&#x27;t the same fragrance.  Other than that I am happy with the items I order from amazon</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Nice fine mist. Pretty bottle. Smell is not too strong and is a good mix of flowery with a little stronger undertone, maybe spicy or musky, it&#x27;s hard to say. Of course it may smell different on you but I guess with my \\&quot;chemistry\\&quot; it&#x27;s wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t smell old or too sweet (young). It&#x27;s different an most hand my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used probably 3 perfumes in my lifetime? I was just looking at popular scents and Lovely was one of the top ones. I trusted the reviews on this and bought it. And Lovely is certainly lovely. It&#x27;s a nice flowery scent. I love it. I wear it all the time everywhere!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Buying Lovely on the internet saved me from making a 40-mile round trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the prompt service, and well-packaged box.</li>
            <li> I would suggest anyone to try perfumes in a store before buying it online. The description of the perfume might not be very accurate. I tried it in a store and bought it here. The packaging was good and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Lovely is exactly what this perfume is about. A nice soft scent. reece@roadrunner.com This is my second bottle and will keep purchasing it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> This perfume I bought was for my mother on mother&#x27;s day and she likes it, in which she has been usinf for years.</li>
            <li> Sarah Jessica and Coty have down a wonderful thing here - a scent that is feminine without being overly floral, and sweet without being too sweet. The scent is delicate yet stays with your throughout the day - two sprays is all you need!  I have been wearing Lovely for several years and defiantly feel I have found my signature scent.</li>
            <li> LOVELY SATIN For Women By SARAH JESSICA PARKER eau de parfum]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this parfum. The parfum was received fast and in good condition. It was packed very good. I would recommend that if you have a chance to get this parfum go ahead and treat yourself.</li>
            <li> No smell what so ever. I wont be buying this perfume from Amazon any more. Very disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Everything that was indicted towards this product was 100% , was a gift for a long time friend , look forward to mainly purchase this item again for my friend...</li>
            <li> Smells nice from the bottle but not so nice on me. And the fragrance does not last. I am actually using it as an air freshener in my bedroom.</li>
            <li> my favorite fragrence....it smells exactly as the name...LOVELY</li>
            <li> I was thinking it&#x27;s time to change my perfume and I saw lots of positive reviews about this product and ordered it. Package was crumpled and outside of bottle has so many scratches. I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s from poor packaging or something else. Anyway I tried on and it just smells like &amp;#34;dollar tree cheap scents&amp;#34; along with strong alcohol smell. Literally, it gave me severe headache all day long on my first try, and I throw it away. I cannot give it to any  of my friend, I know they will hate it. I don&#x27;t know how it supposed to be, but the one that I got from here, it was awful.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much. Ever since my husband brought this home I haven&#x27;t stopped wearing it. Would fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love when my wife wears this stuff. It is a nice light scent that just drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to SJP.Love it.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty scent.  I love it even if my husband doesn&#x27;t so I wear it when he isn&#x27;t around.</li>
            <li> This perfume truly is \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; the scent is so clean, soft and refreshing!  I get so many positive comments when I wear this lovely scent.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Color was different from previous bottles--not sure if it was the bottle or the formula of the cologne. Fragrance seems a little less in strength but that could just be my perception. Although the bottle was wrapped in a box with cellophane, the bottle is scuffed.  Odd.</li>
            <li> I received this product, unopened and in original packaging, within a week from the time i had placed the order.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent I ordered 2 bottles in 2013 and just ordered 2 more,I love it so much. .</li>
            <li> I just love this perfum! My favorite daily one!</li>
            <li> This perfume really lives up to it&#x27;s name!! Really glad I made this purchase! Smells like a million bucks! Yaaay</li>
            <li> Was perfect and exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> LOVE this perfume!  Very light but noticeable and sexy... I get many compliments when I wear it.  It&#x27;s not overpowering but still is noticed by men and women alike.  I think I found my new go to scent!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S THE ONLY PERFUME MY WIFE WILL WEAR. PLEASANT, BUT NOT OVERPOWERING.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I get sooo many complaints when I wear this fragrance! I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an outdoor &amp; an evening woman...This fragrance is soft yet stays with you thru-out the day. (I get compliments from both sexes &amp; all ages)</li>
            <li> i was not very happy with it as it just did not smell the same</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Lovely Eau de Parfum for several years. I also use the shower gel and body lotion.  My only wish is that this fragrance lasted longer. When I first apply it, it smells wonderful which is why I continue to use it. So..if it could be made in a stronger version, I would be even more happy using it.</li>
            <li> Started wearing this when it came out years ago, and I still love it&#x27;s unique scent. It&#x27;s subtle fragrance and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, unless applied in unreasonable amount of course.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the good reviews. This was not the fragrance I expected. I did not think this was lovely.</li>
            <li> After a rough and tumble week sampling a number of sweet scents du jour (WD With Love, Escada Moon Sparkle, BS Fantasy, JS Fancy, Halle, Angel), I starting wondering if I ought to go out an get me a bottle of liquid confection. OMG!!! What was I thinking? I searched through my fragrance cabinet looking for something to snap me out of this twilight-zone sugar-rush, and I pulled out ... SJP Lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Lovely it is. An ADULT, contemporary &amp; classic fragrance for a WOMAN who has BTDT and knows what SHE wants out of life. Coming down from this olfactory sugar high, I clearly detect sweetness in Lovely at a reasonable level, just enough to satisfy my taste for sweet scents. My reacquaintance with Lovely confirmed that there was no need to purchase liquid sugar and walk around smelling like 45-year-old cotton candy. Thank you, SJP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say about Lovely that hasn&#x27;t been said before? Lovely is among the best celeb fragrances to-date, very wearable, not offensive, sample-worthy for most, and full-bottle-worthy for many. It could have been called Beautiful, but that was already taken. Lovely is a bit romantic, suitable for date-nights, bedtime, weekends, but not the office imo. Spray lightly for intimate settings, more heavy-handed for public gatherings &amp; wide-open spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for Lovely. Pull it out of your closet and rediscover its sweetness.</li>
            <li> Lovely is just what the name implies it&#x27;s \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s light and not overpowering.  I like this perfum because it smells feminine and fresh. I want to wear a fragrance that people notice. I get lots of compliments when I wear Lovely. The fragrance last all day.</li>
            <li> Excellent, delicious and original, 5/5</li>
            <li> The perfume came perfectly packaged in a timely matter.  Really not sure if I am reviewing the product or Amazon, but completely happy with both.</li>
            <li> If you like Musky smells, you&#x27;ll like this. I Hate it but that&#x27;s me.Gave it to my Mom she loved it. If you like floral/ powder/ fruity smells you wont like this.</li>
            <li> This is a classic fragrance, not your overpowering J-Lo, B&#x27;Spears, etc.  I wish I could explain the scent...but it is tough to describe.  It isn&#x27;t fruity or flowery.  Perhaps a bit of lavendar though?  Basically, you don&#x27;t overpower a room with it.  It has a bit of an \\&quot;old-world\\&quot;-ness to it...but as far as I am concerned, that is a wonderful thing.  I am a 31 year old professional, I wear it daily and out at night, and I just love it.</li>
            <li> Wherever I go people ask me what&#x27;s my scent. They are in love with it as I am. Makes me feel gorgeous when I put it on!</li>
            <li> I use Lovely almost everyday and for any occasion. Even if your heavy handed with this scent it&#x27;s never over powering. I get compliments every time I wear Lovely and it&#x27;s a scent that stays on and lasts a day without the need to re-apply. Even though I can often not smell it on myself everybody around me seems to because they always ask what scent I&#x27;m wearing and how much they like it! It is definitely my signature scent. There is absolutely nothing that isn&#x27;t great about Lovely. I just love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am not a \\&quot;perfumista\\&quot;. I do not have hundreds (or even dozens) of bottles of perfume. Therefore, I&#x27;m not looking for \\&quot;innovative\\&quot; or \\&quot;unique\\&quot; fragrances. My criteria for buying great perfumes is a little less discriminating (on some counts): 1) I can afford it, 2) it&#x27;s different from what I already own, and 3) it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache. For me, that makes Lovely an exceptional fragrance. I find Lovely to be a beautiful, complex, slightly unisex perfume with floral and woody accords. There are some fruity notes listed that don&#x27;t quite come out on my skin, so the whole scent smells dry rather than sweet on me, which is definitely a plus: sweet perfumes intesify on my skin and lead to headaches and sneezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sillage for Lovely stays quite close (another thing I look for in perfumes, but I realize others may not). This gives it an intimate feel in my mind, making it cozy and feminine.  It&#x27;s office-friendly, but also date-worthy, depending on what your date likes (my fiance loves this perfume on me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a budget-friendly perfume that doesn&#x27;t smell budget-friendly, I highly recommend checking out Lovely.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like floral type perfumes (I like more spicier ones), but this perfume is an exception! It is really strong so a little goes a long way (well worth the price). A perfect scent for spring &amp; into summer.. :)</li>
            <li> I was kind of wary about buying this because I hadn&#x27;t actually smelled it before, but I needed a new perfume and this one was reasonably priced with good reviews! This perfume smells beautiful, when you first spray it it does have that traditional &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34; smell which I don&#x27;t love but after a minute or two of being on your skin it indeed smells lovely! It has the delicate flowery scent that I love without fading quickly like B&amp;BW perfumes do. It&#x27;s scent is comparable to a sort of wild honeysuckle or wildflower scent. It&#x27;s perfect! It came nicely wrapped in its original box, and it&#x27;s a pretty large bottle so it will last for a long time! Yay!</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling scent. Lovely floral fragrance that is reasonably priced. A light scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li> Great! My mom loved it!</li>
            <li> The Lovely cologne (Sarah Jessica Parker) was a favorite, but this particular bottle is not the same scent. I don&#x27;t know if the formula was changed or if this was somehow damaged, but the lasting scent is not pleasant!! I thought at first it was different, but I have a lot of allergies and my husband finally had to say mention. Yikes!! :-( So buyer beware - I am now stuck with over half a bottle of a not so &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; scent and out the money. Seller - I apologize for writing so late - I hope if you still have this in inventory that you check it to make sure it is the original scent. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to say how much I love this sent it lasted all day. And even though I wash it off I could still smell it. I love this smell it&#x27;s so strong as in its just not an hour of smelling good you actually could have have a whole room smelling like this scent. I love it.</li>
            <li> best freagrance till date i use ..</li>
            <li> Great price.  My mom was paying double for the same thing.</li>
            <li> love this perfume--so fresh</li>
            <li> This is a very good, high quality product. The description told me exactly what I needed to know concerning size and type.</li>
            <li> The name says it all.  I love love love this perfume, it is a perfect scent without being overpowering.  I am on my 3rd bottle and will continue to buy as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> Perfume is watered down...container is damaged...&lt;br /&gt; &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to buy her this perfume because she used it before and liked it very much.  This imitation we bought on Amazone did not even come close.  She was very dissapointed, $37.50 wasted!</li>
            <li> I chose this scent for my wife as a gift. It&#x27;s a different smell then she would usually wear, but it has grown on me. She has worn Baby Phat, Happy, etc. I probably won&#x27;t purchase again unless she prefers it.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped very quickly and in it&#x27;s original box still wrapped.  It is a super deal - can&#x27;t find it any cheaper than on Amazon - I looked everywhere!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and I love it on her, a truly lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! ! It&#x27;s my signsture fragrance! It&#x27;s  Hard to find in stores but Amazon always comes through for me!  Thanks I smell delicious</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance... Its a must have!!!</li>
            <li> I am a 37-year old man who first experienced this extraordinary fragrance on my wife 2 years ago, and it is the first scent that has ever caused me to sit in a chair for hours bundling up my shirt just to continue smelling it while she is away.  Obviously being newly in love, and the perfume one that &#x27;worked&#x27; with her body chemistry are always the foundation of such a statement, but this perfume to this day is just as powerfully alluring, and I am still immobilized by it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good product and great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on this for some time because I love the scent.  No local stores could beat Amazon&#x27;s price, even when they had it on \\&quot;sale.\\&quot;  So, I ordered &amp; got it delivered (sealed &amp; brand new in the box) right to home a few days later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, so this perfume I obviously purchased as a Holiday gift for a \\&quot;lovely\\&quot; young lady.  &amp; she loved it !!!!  &amp; it smells great on her !!!  Very satisfied with the super fast delivery !!!  Thanx Amazon !!!  Regards, Joseph.  Scranton, PA.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; by Sarah Jessica Parker.  I had received a sample by mail from a local retailer, but I found I could get the same item through Amazon.com at a more reasonable price.  I appreciated the sealed box as well.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Very happy with this purchase. I think it was a good price.</li>
            <li> Both of my daughter&#x27;s love this perfume and request it for birthdays and Christmas.  It&#x27;s delicate and pleasant and has become their trademark scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume!! It&#x27;s sweet, but not overpowering, and I just love it! This is my third bottle.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned...the scent is peppery when first applied. it does settled into a clean, fresh scent that you can&#x27;t resist. I&#x27;ve received many compliments on this fragrance. It arrived on time. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance after researching several online. Online research of a fragrance is a risky endeavor. I took a chance after reading several good reviews. Glad I did. My wife loves it. She wears it everyday and gets compliments from her coworkers on it. I will purchase this fragrance again when she needs it, it smells.... well, lovely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to perfume and body sprays. I generally opt out for fresh scented body wash but I received Lovely as a gift and I fell in love. The perfume blends very well with my natural oils and leaves a fresh, clean, and slightly sweet fragrant, that makes the right amount of presence. I love the subtlety of Lovely. And the best part is that when I spray it on my clothes I can still smell it for days. And my closet also has that sweet fragrance. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Lovely is appropriate for any age. I&#x27;m 24 and I don&#x27;t want to smell like bubble gum or heavy musk. This is the perfect balance of feminine sweetness. I also purchased the Lovely Liquid Satin, which I pair with the perfume. Lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> loved it so much and i got it right away thank you</li>
            <li> Love this perfume so much. Have worn for many years. Sarah Jessica Parker made a fantastic smelling perfume. I would highly recommend this perfume to all women, no matter how young or old. And, I will positively purchase this item again from Amazon, since the price was so reasonable.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has been a favorite of mine for several years.  It is a light floral with distinct undertones of white pepper.  The scent is very distinctive in that it doesn&#x27;t remind me of any other scent.  It simply smells \\&quot;good.\\&quot;  This size is large.  The fragrance is getting harder to find than other Sarah Jessica Parker scents, so Amazon has been a great venue to get it at a good price point.</li>
            <li> Have worn this perfume for a long time. Love it! Fresh clean scent, not overwhelming. Received my order quickly and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great scent,  very pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It smells just beautiful.  I am really enjoying it!  Would love to layer it with the lotion too.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because I had to in order to write my review. Well it arrived in time but the smell isn&#x27;t too appealing along with the perfume look like it&#x27;s has particles floating around inside example pieces of hair dirt sand I don&#x27;t know along with bubbles like its a bottle of soda I will be sending this back!</li>
            <li> This came in , in good condition, in a good time and I love the perfume :) Overall I would do this again.</li>
            <li> The Elizabeth Taylor “White Diamonds” is a quality perfume. The fragrance is very pleasant and has good lasting qualities. When first opening the bottle the fragrance seems sweet and strong. A light sample to ones wrist leads to a totally different conclusion. The fragrance is pleasant and grows on you. As the perfume is warmed by the body the fragrance becomes lighter. The perfume has a good staying power. Twelve hours after application the fragrance of the perfume could still be noted. When applying the perfume, keep it light so that it is not overpowering. When the perfume was worn in public several friends said complimentary words about the fragrance and asked what was it, they liked it. To find out how Elizabeth Taylor “White Diamonds” perfume reacted with different body chemistries, I sprayed a small sample on the wrist of several friends. It was interesting to note that there was a identifiable difference between the aroma on each individual after a little time was allowed for “White Diamonds” to mellow and be warmed by the body. All of the variations were very pleasant. Elizabeth Taylor “White Diamonds” perfume would be great for special occasions as well as for every day use. The sweet fragrance could be enjoyed by both teens and adult women. When I opened the box and removed the bottle, my wife’s expression was WOW!!!!!!! The spray bottle is beautifully designed and decorative. The attractive bottle would look great on a perfume tray or dressing area counter top. The size of the bottle is a nice size for taking along when traveling. The Elizabeth Taylor “White Diamonds” perfume would make a nice gift for a family member or friend at a very attractive and competitive price. Elizabeth Taylor brand is well known for offering great products. This definitely is one of the good ones. I was provided this product at no cost for review.</li>
            <li> Smells too powdery. Like old lady perfume. I can say that because I am an old lady! Sorry it is not for me! I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> gave it away.  wasnt working with my skin</li>
            <li> Loved it.  This was a gift for my mother&#x27;s birthday and she was so happy to receive.  It was reasonably priced and shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I love it this is my favorite perfume ever! I have bought it five times from Amazon, never unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> Aside from the lightening fast shipping, I must rave over this scent!  Initially, I knew I loved this perfume (before my Amazon purchase) from a sample ad in a magazine.  In December, while walking through a department store with my boyfriend, I decided to test the fragrance and gather his opinion.  He didn&#x27;t seem interested at the time, so I delayed making a purchase.  A few weeks ago I finally broke down and ordered it through Amazon.  I have already run through 1/4 of the bottle, as my boyfriend LOVES it!  Yea!</li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t we all just a little sick of smelling like a grocery store?  I never could understand all the fruit and vegetable scents and then they came out with vanilla cookie, pumpkin pie, gingerbread...I&#x27;ve gained five pounds just smelling perfumes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovely, on the other hand, is aptly named.  It&#x27;s a beautiful, feminine scent designed for the female that desires an aura of sophistication and beauty.  And you won&#x27;t be mistaken for a fruit salad!</li>
            <li> I received an Amazon email reminding me of Mother&#x27;s Day which also featured this perfume.  I had not a clue about women&#x27;s fragrances but I figured if the Sex in the City gal was pushin it, it probably would be a hit.  I also looked at all the other reviews which were real good. So I ordered it and my sons and I gave it to mom for Mothers&#x27; Day.  Result:  Home Run.  Wife loved it.  She has seldom used perfume but she&#x27;s being using this one daily.  I like it, too (on her).  It doesn&#x27;t smell like a teenager nor an old biddie.  Just right.</li>
            <li> I received my product extremley fast, there was no damage. The correct charge was place on my credit card.I love ordering from Amazon,they are a company you can trust. Keep up the good work . Thanks</li>
            <li> This item was delivered in just a few days in perfect condition.  The scent is great - not too strong, not too sweet, just right for summer.</li>
            <li> Great product and price!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife without smelling it based on good price and positive reviews online. When I got it, it smelled exactly like what my mom likes to smell like. So I could not give it to my wife! But gave it to my mom as a gift and she really likes it. Unfortunately, I do not have expertise in scents so cannot describe the smell.</li>
            <li> it last 5 min :(&lt;br /&gt;I felt sooooo bad cuz I gifted to my mom and she said I don&#x27;t smell it after 5 min</li>
            <li> I really knew better, fell in love with this scent at a local store, just a little dab on my wrist held the scent for several hours. Of course being cheap me, decided to try to purchase online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this and while it smelled identical to the fragrance (a lot more than I can say for some other &amp;#34;haute&amp;#34; designer fragrance assortments I&#x27;ve tried), so I was hopeful. Within a few minutes, the scent had *completely* vanished, not a trace. I figured it had been somewhat diluted with alcohol or something, tried spraying a little more on , the same thing. I asked others, since I know that sometimes you can grow &amp;#34;immune&amp;#34; to the scent yourself, but they smelled nothing. After a few days, I simply decided to throw the rest of the bottle away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;d just wasted $20 instead of spending just $10 more in a local store for the REAL fragrance I really loved!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it will be that bad but it smells like a really cheap perfume...&lt;br /&gt;I expected more:(. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all!</li>
            <li> Great.  My wife loved it.  great value.</li>
            <li> Im a 22 year old female.  My purchase was based off of the amazing reviews, I was disappointed in the scent. Don&#x27;t mean to sound rude but it smells like something my grandma would wear. Typically, I wear  Flowerbomb, Burberry, Dolce Gabana -The One, Light Blue...I took a chance with this purchase and felt overall it is over rated and for an older crowd,</li>
            <li> Have used this perfume for several years.  I found your price to be much less expensive than the department stores.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this fragrance but it just doesn&#x27;t have any staying power (on me). I can&#x27;t smell it five minutes after spraying, such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume as a gift for my girlfriend less than a week before Christmas. It arrived just as they said it would on Christmas Eve, and she loved it! No complaints here.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my best friend and she was sooo thankful for it and she loves the smell!! i didnt get one for myself because i rarely use perfume but then this does smell sooo goood!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice size to keep on my dresser for a quick touch-up at any time. It is long-lasting, too!</li>
            <li> What an absolutely delightful scent!  I&#x27;m usually wary of things Oprah raves about (I&#x27;ve read several of her book club recommendations and hated every one,) but when she had SJP on the show and they were talking about this scent I was intrigued.  So I tried it and fell in love with it right away!  This is floral without being too heavy, feminine without smelling like an English rose garden, and has just the right hints of woman and fresh youth.  Best of all, it stays with me to the end of the day (one of only two scents that do.)  This perfume was aptly named -- it truly is lovely!</li>
            <li> so yummy! reminds me of my freshman year of college, wore this as I went through rush!</li>
            <li> BEST perfume ever made. Smell lasts and its soon pretty. :)</li>
            <li> MY absolute favorite perfume, I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and still continue to receive great compliments!</li>
            <li> the perfume, i like its smile BUT this time this perfume does not stay long time :(. I hope this product is not fake</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED ITEM WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS.  GREAT PRICE.  I AM MORE THAN HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE.  PLAN TO PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I saw on Oprah the intro of LOVELY with Sarah J. Parker. I ordered and was not disappointed. It&#x27;s very feminine. It&#x27;s a light scent, but it does leave one wanting another whiff. The bottle is a little tricky to hold but it&#x27;s a beautiful bottle. I have worn BEAUTIFUL only by Estee Lauder for years, but am now alternating between LOVELY and BEAUTIFUL. I don&#x27;t think one would be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really I did not like my wife very much and focus weak</li>
            <li> very light and clean fragrance</li>
            <li> My favorite ... I got it as a birthday gift .. now I can&#x27;t stop wearing it.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife , this is a lovely fragrance and the price was very reasonable. .</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; really fast shipping. Saved almost half off retail with free shipping &amp; no tax- great deal. But I&#x27;m very disappointed with the quality !Smells nice from the bottle but not so nice on me. And the fragrance does not last. Smell&#x27;s like an expired product. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> i cant leave the house without this scent on me. my friends also love the way it smells off of me. i&#x27;m pretty sensitive to perfumes and hate anything too flowery...but this perfume is just right for me.</li>
            <li> I like this scent. But its a bit too mature smelling for me, seems like something women over 30, or maybe over 35 would like to wear, I&#x27;m 27yrs old, I love feminine scents, I like White Diamond, and Xclamation, and some Elizabeth Taylor ones, but this one was just I dunno, it had a deep scent feeling to me, nothing bright and fresh and light. I wanna say it was like a women version of a guys deep musk cologne, but flowery for women. If that makes any sense. I might give it to my mom though, shes 53, and she might like this alot more than me.</li>
            <li> Very nice light fragrance. I will purchase again and it&#x27;s affordable. This is the kind of fragrance you can enjoy and not offend others.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect name for Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s scent Lovely.  It is not heavy, and lasts all day.  I have received numerous compliments when wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is really nice and lasts long. It is musky . Maybe its just me but i felt the perfume was more fit for a maore matured woman. I am in my late 20s and i felt the perfume would suit someone around my mm&#x27;s age. And she loves me.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great perfume.  I absolutely love the fragrance.  Every time  I wear it I think of Carrie Bradshaw on Sex &amp; the City.  Love Sarah Jessica Parker!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for my wife while I was on business travel to US. Product lived up to the expectation and my wife liked what I got for her.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an everyday perfume for a long time. I tried a bunch, but there wasn&#x27;t a perfume that I wanted myself to smell like it everyday and make it &#x27;my fragrance&#x27;. Then I got this. And this is it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for a year or so now.  Without question, this is one of the best deals I have found.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; really fast shipping. Saved almost half off retail with free shipping &amp; no tax- great deal.  will order again.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this product and distributor. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Seller is great, satisfied.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so great. It makes me feel fresh and lovely :)</li>
            <li> ...a beautiful young lady leaned over me and asked what I was wearing.  I couldn&#x27;t remember the name so I just said Sarah Jessica Parker perfume.  She said it was lovely and very subtle.  Actually the name IS &amp;#34;Lovely,&amp;#34; and I haven&#x27;t had a positive response to a perfume in a long, long time.  They all seem to smell strong and about the same.  But in the days of Chanel No. 5,  men used to ask me what I was wearing so they could buy it for their wives.  I&#x27;d say this one  (Lovely), is definitely a winner!  I don&#x27;t want to OVERPOWER people in an elevator and leave them gasping!  I just want them to think, &amp;#34;Wow, what IS that wonderful smell!&amp;#34;  Did I mention that it&#x27;s reasonably priced and the bottle is &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; too?</li>
            <li> Nice size i got the same size in macys much higher cost.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Mom-in-law for Mother&#x27;s Day. She really loved it! And it suits her personality perfectly as it&#x27;s so feminine. I especially like that it was delivered way ahead of the predicted delivery time and arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I received the boxes at the promised time. I gave it as a gift, and it was much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a rare scent that does not give me a sinus headache, so I also love it! It has woodsy and floral notes, but almost none of the fruity (grapefruit? Argh!) notes which dominate in today&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. One of my all time favorites!</li>
            <li> LOVELY usually has a wonderful, fresh fragrance - this particular bottle of LOVELY is  very disappointing - not the same at all.  Wondering if it is an older product???</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase Lovely perfume from Amazon at half the price of retail stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my grandmother. To be honest, I think that this fragrance is suited for the 50+ crowd. It is a beautiful scent just the same.</li>
            <li> I had to give this to Good Will.  The scent is too off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because it was cheap and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> I am in my early thirtys and like another reviewer said if you are under 35 do not wear this. The first thing I noticed right out of the bottle is this stuff is strong. My husband said it smelled like a fake rose smell and something an old lady would wear. After wearing for a couple of hours the scent does tone down and fade. I give this a one star because my husband hates it on me and it would Most likely give my co-workers a headache...maybe I will give it to my 62 yr old mother.</li>
            <li> Really love the scent - it is nice and light and definately not over powering.  Don&#x27;t like that the scent doesn&#x27;t last for long, that&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume sooo much! I had it before then switch to Alien but I saw this and wanted to go back to it because it&#x27;s so sweet and young but not tween its for everyone over 15 I would say. It came completely packaged and it didn&#x27;t break or crack. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> This product changed its smell - i believe it must be old and now the alcohol smell or some smell other than what it should be.  The product is no longer &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34;.  also it was unreturnable which i did not know so - what a bad deal.</li>
            <li> It was next to impossible to find this fragrance in any chain retail, drug, or department store. What a nice surprise to find it at a reasonable price on Amazon. There was a problem at first because only one bottle of a two bottle order was shipped, but it was corrected immediately and everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this and says she get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little bit for an older age, but very fresh, light, and pretty.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. It has been her favorite perfume for years. It has become a family tradition to purchase a few bottle every Christmas. From my point of view it has a pleasant sexy smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> That perfume it&#x27;s very small</li>
            <li> Smells great, arrived in a timely fashion, and a great value</li>
            <li> I have used it befote, but  the one I purchased thru Amazon the scent does not last. I don&#x27;t know why. I am checking with the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This scent is really soft and fresh, but mature. I bought it for my mom (60 yr old) and she loved it.  The scent lingered on her wrist and sweater all day. The box and bottle are both pretty if gift giving.  I added it to my own wishlist.</li>
            <li> i have this perfume and im using it but i cannot find in my store anymore thats why and yeah this one cost me cheaper than other place</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful light fragrance.  It&#x27;s good for all occasions from workouts to dining out. This is a very good price point.[[ASIN:B000EPHPTU LOVELY For Women By SARAH JESSICA PARKER eau de parfum]]</li>
            <li> I love the soft scent.  It doesn&#x27;t hang on all day but it&#x27;s soft enough to re-apply.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000BBF9A4 Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Parfum Spray]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful Scent, I gave this as a present. My sister-in-law loved it!</li>
            <li> I already have this brand, and couldn&#x27;t believe the price here on Amazon. I wear this stuff all the time, it has a great fragrance, and here it has a great price, as well!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I ordered from this distributor a year ago, and after a couple months of use, the sprayer on the bottle turned into a streamer. I  took it off, cleaned it, turned it--never could get it to spray properly. Will order from another distributor next time.  A very nice, subtle and sophisticated floral fragrance. Has become my &#x27;signature fragrance.&#x27; Wish I could find other products in this fragrance line--shower gel, body lotion.</li>
            <li> This smells divine, I love it!  It is very light, perfect for any time of the day.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter as I knew she liked the perfume. Was just what I ordered and am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> This parfum has a wonderful fragrance and I&#x27;ve received several compliments on it&#x27;s delightful smell.  It is very light and does not overwhelm when wearing.  I prefer a fragrance that one enjoys when hugging or &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; not one that can be acknowledged across the room, or two seats away in a theatre.</li>
            <li> Look I cannot complain that the scent is different. I really had preferred the scent to most others I have. That is why I ordered it again. I even have had sarah jessica parkers other scent dawn. BUT this time this perfume&#x27;s scent does not last. It may last 15 minutes tops. I do not know if it is the manufacturer nor do I have time to figure it out . I just will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fresh and airy, very pleasant.  The main problem I have is that it just does not last very long.</li>
            <li> This is a cheaply made perfume and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all. I was very dissappointed with this.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible smell.</li>
            <li> Stores quit carrying my scent so just for a whim I looked on Amazon and not only did they have it but about $50.00 less.  I&#x27;ve also found other perfumes I quit wearing because I thought they quit making them.  Just goes to show you that you can find anything you want on Amazon.  Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for about 2 1/2 yrs and not a week goes by where I don&#x27;t receive a compliment. Love the scent!</li>
            <li> I love this product. i will order a second one. It makes me feel sexier when II wear it. Luv, Luv ,Luv</li>
            <li> This perfume had been my favorite for a long time.  IT is a beautiful fragrance.  Was very happy to find it. Hope u will keep it available.</li>
            <li> Gave this as gift to my wife.. It is very mild, smells really good... packaged very beautifully.. My wife likes it..</li>
            <li> This is really lovely so its name fits perfectly. It&#x27;s a scent that stands out. I get compliments all the time when I use it. I love it!</li>
            <li> This scent is very well-named - it&#x27;s lovely! Perfect blend of spicy, sophisticated, and soft. Never fails to get me comments on how great I smell, and it lasts all day. Not in the least overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend, she said that she got a  &amp;#34; tester model &amp;#34; that was closed and unused, so she said it smells good and everyone compliments on her scent! :) that&#x27;s a plus!!!</li>
            <li> It has a nice floral scent that&#x27;s not overpowering.  Just enough balance of romance plus sexy.  I give it three stars.</li>
            <li> My mother has been using this parfum ever since this came out, so I purchased it for her birthday. She is in love with it. It came in great condition.</li>
            <li> This stinks like the cheapest dollar store garbage. Gave me a headache! I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough. Lesson learned:read the reviews. I see now that the seller did not guarantee 100% genuine. Yuck</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, I have tried others and just don&#x27;t like them. The best part was when i received it . It was packed nicely.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance and I am always complimented when I wear it.  I will purchase this fragrance again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not smell like the original.  i smell this perfume at the store one day and its not the same. But nice enough to gift.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, just that it does not long enough to think that it is an eau de parfum.</li>
            <li> Lovely by SJP was given to me as a gift and I have worn it now for the past 3 years!  I am a loyal perfume person. I have been wearing the same winter scent for 28 years!  I hope you continue to carry Lovely for as long!</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent.  Not overpowering but lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve used this perfume for years.</li>
            <li> Five Stars doesn&#x27;t do this fragrance justice. It is the most amazing scent, fresh, light, and clean.( In my opinion everything a fragrance should be) It is truly Lovely...</li>
            <li> I have loved this scent forever. It is light, and just (lovely)!  I always choose it as a gift when someone asks.</li>
            <li> A friend was wearing this recently and several of us asked her what it was. I normally don&#x27;t wear perfume because it will usually gives me a headache. I went to Dillards to try a sample to see if my body chemistry worked with it and I LOVE it. I could even smell a faint whiff the next day before my shower. Very long lasting, light and fresh smelling like you&#x27;ve just taken a shower. Hope my husband found some for me as most stores were sold out.</li>
            <li> My all time fav perfume.  I didn&#x27;t think they even made it anymore. Large bottle for a great price...I would buy again</li>
            <li> I love this frgarance, not only is it long lasting , but it&#x27;s different , It doesn&#x27;t smell like everything that everyone wears lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an original scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly recommend it if you like dry not flowery fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the body lotion is also very nice, a great complement to the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try it and let it dry, on your skin, see how it changes and truns into a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for years and still love it. I don&#x27;t find it overwhelming and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;My name is LuLu...and I treated myself to Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; fragrance for my birthday this past October.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the fragrance...I couldn&#x27;t wait to open and use it...but when I sprayed on me...I found it rather \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; in scent.  Somehow I thought it would be a lighter....fresher.....scent.  It does last a significant amount of hours during the day.  I wouldn&#x27;t wear this fragrance in the summertime...it is more suited for the Fall/Winter season.  Based on this I was a bit disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...the packaging, style of the bottle and definitely the price were quite good.  I would consider purchasing another fragrance from Sarah&#x27;s line...but I would use a \\&quot;tester\\&quot; at a dept. store rather than a scratch off strip.  Obviously, this was not a good indicator of what the real scent of the fragrance.  Since I had worked for a major cosmetic and fragrance company for over 12 years....I know that this fragrance is made with high quality oils..and ingredients...especially since the scent does stay with you for several hours.  And...with a 3.4 oz...bottle it will last awhile...since one does not need to spray much on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly glad I got it...and I have been using it especially now during these late Fall and upcoming Winter days.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Amazing fragrance! I Like it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so rich and soft, and sexy and most importantly it&#x27;s not overpowering. The bottle is very big. It could last me a year or so to be honest. I wanna say that this is one of the few perfumes I love that a celebrity came out with. Most of the times they smell tacky or cheap or smells like there&#x27;s nothing there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a flowery and citrus smell. But it&#x27;s sweet smelling not tangy. I love lovely. I would not suggest this to any early teens though or children. It&#x27;s a woman scent. But for crying out I&#x27;m 18 and I love it. So just try it out my opinion could be opposite of what you would think.</li>
            <li> Lovely is a wonderful, light scent for women who like to smell pretty (lovely) without being overpowered by strong scent.  The price for the product was the lowest I have ever seen fore I have been wearing Lovely for over three years now.</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance that is perfect for a formal dress affair, a small spritz for going to work or anytime you are looking for an anywhere, anytime perfume. It compliments every item in your wardrobe. Guarantee that someone will stop and ask what are you wearing..its that pleasing!</li>
            <li> Too bad this truly lovely scent has no staying power.  I use it as an after bath spray so I can enjoy it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I love Lovely.  It&#x27;s such a nice, clean, fresh scent.  It&#x27;s too expensive for me in the few department stores that carry it, so this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff....</li>
            <li> Sarah Jessica Parker proved me again that she is the best by all means. I saw some reviews here that it&#x27;s not for young girls. I would say that LOVELY is for any type of girl. It&#x27;s the best perfume, I am switching from Chanel Chance to SJP LOVELY. It&#x27;s my favorite now. I will keep purchasing for sure. Highly recommended perfume. !!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, good price and delivered in excellent time.</li>
            <li> So light and got this spicy blend to it. I wear it at night mostly.</li>
            <li> This eau de parfum has the very light odor can where for any ocassion I give this to my wife she love it the only problem with!!!!!.  Is my wife got two boifreinds. LOL</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it</li>
            <li> This was too floral for me...will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought it based on reviews. I like it....not in love with it. Good for an everyday scent.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom and she loved it as much i expected her to. If floral is ur thing, you cant go wrong. This is not over powering either, got a very pleasant note to it and Jamine smell can be noted the most in it.</li>
            <li> This is a soft clean fragrance.  Lasts all day. When I put it on in the morning, it smells the same by bedtime.</li>
            <li> It takes sometime getting used to the smell because I was into Estee Lauder and Donna Karan line of pefume, more of the soft &amp; flowery scent,&lt;br /&gt;even tried the J&#x27;Adore which is really a heavy scent and would last the whole day. Having said that, I just wear this one on regular days and had to put on lot so I&#x27;m on my way to finishing the whole bottle already.</li>
            <li> It was new, very good, I love this perfume and it&#x27;s not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> This was an anniversary present. My wife tried a couple of top brands and this one was great on her skin. Smells great and lasts long. Now she (me too) likes this perfume a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very true that individual results vary. You cannot buy this because my rating is 5. My suggestion is to shortlist few and then try it out in a store and then buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love love love SJP Lovely!!!!!</li>
            <li> A wonderful, light scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  This is my 3rd bottle - that says it all!  You can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price - less than half what it costs in department stores.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent to it. But the scent doesn&#x27;t last an hour. As soon as you spray it 20 minutes it&#x27;s gone and perfume don&#x27;t so disapprear  that quickly. Love the scent but hate the time that it last!!</li>
            <li> Like the name...It&#x27;s a soft, feminine scent and lovely!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mom.  This is her favorite.  She had such a hard time finding it in the stores and it was a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> After not being satisfied with the product the company reimburse me my money and  im very happy now thank you</li>
            <li> Its a classy yet flirty scent, a little spicy and sweet and very unique. Very Sarah Jessica Parker (or what I would think she was like). Delicate powdery sweetness with a musky undertone overlaid with spice. I would recommend for a fun yet elegant lunch date or any time you want to feel sexy and carefree!</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance based on the good reviews..not knowing how it would smelled...this is one of the most celebs top selling fragrances so I really wanted to try it..When I received my package on the mail I was a bit skeptic about it...since im so picky with perfumes..SURPRISE!!!!! I was delighted by such scent!!! To my disbelief this was the same fragrance that I had smelled on a friend a year ago and I regretted not having asked her what she was wearing back then..well here it is...the notes are lovely! It smells sensous, sexy, unique...I do believe a guy can wear this as well, but it s definitely more feminine than unisex....im in love...SOLD!! :-)</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent I have actually been followed around in stores before and asked what I was wearing one man told me I smelled absolutely delicious! Lol</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m 22 and I definitely did not like the smell, it&#x27;s not romantic and it&#x27;s not what a young person wants to be smelling like, but I am glad I got to purchase so I can see for myself and won&#x27;t buy it again. I gave it to my 56 year old mom and she didn&#x27;t even like the smell. Never again will I purchase this perfume but the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I  always get the most amazing compliments from both  men and women alike, when I wear Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker</li>
            <li> This perfume suits very well and lasts really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I re-ordered this one because I liked it so much. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this is the first review I have ever written about anything I have ordered through amazon.  I bought a bottle of &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; from a department store when it was first introduced and I loved it even though it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.  what I just received is not at all what I remembered.  this stuff smells like BUG SPRAY.  since I can&#x27;t send it back, I am throwing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in good condition. The is my favorite perfume, not too strong but not too subtle. Perfect. Recommended for everyone!</li>
            <li> Great scent. Getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. It smells really Lovely, in my opinion. It&#x27;s fairly cheap so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Enjoy wearing the cologne and will continue to purchase it as long as possible.  I will recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells so nice :)</li>
            <li> I have loved this fragrance since my husband gave it to me for my birthday 6 years ago. I only wear it on days that I&#x27;m not in jeans. It smells too wonderful to waste on days that I&#x27;m not dressed to the nines. My latest bottle should last for quite some time but I really hope I can always find it here on Amazon when I run out.</li>
            <li> Received as a gift and not impressed.  My husband doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad but I&#x27;m picky about smells.</li>
            <li> I think this bottle was old and starting to turn rancid.</li>
            <li> this perfume is amazing and smells so expensive! but i got it for only $30 and it lasts ALL DAY</li>
            <li> wife loves it, therefore, i love it. smell is ok, im not bog into super strong smells, and this one is pretty delicate, but def noticeable. unique</li>
            <li> Great Shipping!  The fragrance is wonderful, everyone loves this scent.  The cost of this item is very reasonable it would be more costly elsewhere!</li>
            <li> Happy medium between floral, sweet, and savory.  Classy but fun scent.  It has been my go-to perfume for day and night for almost a decade.</li>
            <li> My daily routine floral notes... got lots of  compliments.</li>
            <li> I never wear perfume because I have a terrible sense of smell and fear I will use too much without realizing it.  This is a beautiful perfume - not at all flowery so I can apply as much as I want!</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this perfume. I have some other perfumes with Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s brand and I like them all.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen this perfume before and always wanted to try it and finally bought it. I did not regret getting it. It is a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love it. It smells great.  I get compliments all the time I wear it. I would like to order more when I run out. Thank you amazon</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for years. I love it and t is my favorite. Smells beautiful and just a small spray will leaving you smelling gorgeous all day. I always receive tons of compliments whenever I wear it. Price seems fair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this perfume for ever!  It&#x27;s one of my favorite. I always try not to run out before I get another bottle.</li>
            <li> Hard to critique a perfume. A scent smells different on everyone. But if you wear Lovely, I paid a small price for it , better than TJ Maxx and other stores. It was shipped out by Amazon and received in 2 days from ordering. Worth trying.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who claims that it has to be a fake product. It is sold by Amazon.com LLC, so I do not know if that has any influence on whether the product is original or a fake, but i purchased another perfume at the same time and have the same issue with it. She says that the smell/perfume goes away in less than an hour and is highly displeased. And we are not able to return the product due to: &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.&amp;#34; Overall, I would not recommend or buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Lovely is just what I wanted. I&#x27;ve used this scent for years and love it. This was a great value compared to what i&#x27;ve found in store.</li>
            <li> This smells very sexy and mature, yet still casual and everyday, which is a very hard combination to find. The scent lingers well.</li>
            <li> the perfume I purchased- has been watered down- I was terribly disappointed- do you want theothers back-please advise me now</li>
            <li> perfume is a big holiday gift, and perfume counters can be crowded to deal with at this time of year....if you know the scent you are buying then I suggest using Amazon it&#x27;s a hassle free way to get your perfume gifts.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites scents and it is so hard to find.  Flowery scent, but not sweet smelling.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Nasty... I don&#x27;t like the smell. .not made for me</li>
            <li> Got this perfume as a gift for my sister&#x27;s birthday, she&#x27;s always wanted and I have to say it is an intoxicating scent! It&#x27;s a good perfume to have and the price is awesome!</li>
            <li> I wore Clinique Happy for 10 years and decided to try something new after the birth of my twins. This perfume is truly \\&quot;lovely\\&quot;. Lovely is soft and delicate, yet sexy and sophisticated. I have had many women ask me what scent I am wearing and comment on how wonderful it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot stand most perfume scents, as they are overwhelming and even nauseating. This perfume has the perfect amount of intensity. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, but just enough to enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A much appreciated bonus: my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents... I go back and forth between this and Light Blue by D&amp;G. Great size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been very keen to Paris Hilton&#x27;s scents, (particularly Pixie Dust and Paris Hilton) and was looking to branch out a little bit. This perfume is pretty musky, not very sharp, but definite. And I would classify it as probably a more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; scent. I was actually reminded quite a bit of my great aunt when I sprayed it the first time, which was nice, but not exactly what I was looking for. I guess I would say it&#x27;s like sort of a dusty orchid smell. It&#x27;s not bad, but I think next time I will go for something slightly more floral, or citrus-y</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. I got it originally for my girlfriend who is 32 but we end up giving it to her mother. It&#x27;s more fitting for more a mature woman.</li>
            <li> I love the sensual scent of the perfume - it is just right.  Sweet smell of freshness, very happy I got it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased SJP fragances, they are not over powering nor very sweet smelling, so if you have expericed her fragances you are SAFE AND ENJOY.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite perfume!  very light and fresh floral scent.</li>
            <li> MY favorite perfume and it is no longer sold at Macy&#x27;s, so I ordered it through here and am very happy I got it.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy this parfum, I have purchased this item many times through Amazon.com until now the product has always been what I have ordered until this current order.  The seller \\&quot;Pretty Princess\\&quot; DID NOT SEND what I ordered, they subsistuted my order without informing me of the change, they are unavailable for emails and never responded to my repeated requests for a review of my order so I could receive what I ordered.  Amazon issued a credit to me and I am very happy with this. This is an outstanding product and will be ordering it again but not from this seller.</li>
            <li> I ordered this parfume for my mom and my friend.It was the best price ever:)&lt;br /&gt;They loved It and I was happy:)</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing. It has a strong scent but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming, just irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a trip to a flower prairie on a breezy spring day.&lt;br /&gt;It has a sophisticated fruity scent. Fresh but not too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I find it hard to keep my wrist off my nose after applying it. It&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this perfume, as do I! Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I am always told that people enjoy this perfume on me when i wear it.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail today. I must say, it truly is just as it says. Lovely. It&#x27;s so feminine. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s a good price for a great scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  But for some reason this one that I ordered from Amazon was not the same.  I think that it was watered down.</li>
            <li> For a while I&#x27;d been looking for a perfume that sort of went with everything - and then I smelled this on someone at work and immediately loved it! Enough for me to send her an email to ask about it. It is very clean, fresh, and feminine. It isn&#x27;t overly sweet or flowery, just the right amount. It is very layered, and different notes will surface over the course of the day. I can smell the lavender, apple, amber, and orchid scents. Whenever I catch a whiff of it on myself, it makes me happy. I don&#x27;t tend to put too much on, just enough for me to smell it and anyone that might be close to me. Very highly recommended, and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced that if you don&#x27;t like it on you, you aren&#x27;t out a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this since Sex In The City was still on!  Very floral and feminine:). My second go to perfume:). Thanks to Sara Jessica Parker, great job!</li>
            <li> I used CK one in the past but this smells so much better. Sarah J has a good nose for scent lol.</li>
            <li> It was terrible experience. All the items i purchased are expired.</li>
            <li> Product was good but it did not arrive on time as promised.</li>
            <li> I adore SJP LOVELY fragrance. This was my first time ordering fragrance from Amazon. I normally use another online fragrance Co. for all my fragrance and cosmetic purchases.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why I could barely smell the perfume. It&#x27;s as if the bottle had been sitting on a shelf for an extended period of time, and lost its smell.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this based off reviews and let me just say this, the smell is ALRIGHT. Nothing spectacular.....</li>
            <li> Smells like alcohol not Sarah Jessica Parker cologne. Will not order from you again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  ONCE PAID MUCH MONEY FOR IT ON AN AIRPLANE, duty-free, AND NOW HAVE A YOU AS A MUCH BETTER SOURCE.  I LOVE THE LIGHTNESS OF THE FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> The only fragrance I&#x27;ve ever finished completely is Lovely. I had ordered a small bottle the first time, and this time ordered a larger one as that&#x27;s all that was available. Unfortunately, this one doesn&#x27;t smell quite the same and it&#x27; doesn&#x27;t last as long when I spray it.  I am very disappointed and probably won&#x27;t even finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume, and recently ran out and turns out every place that I had previously purchased it from doesn&#x27;t carry it any more! So after I panicked and hunted online I was VERY happy to find it on here and get it quickly! Smelling wonderful once again!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! Bought it several years ago and received many compliments. I was concerned because I have bought this for my Mom for her Birthday, when she opened the box and tried to pump some out, it was very difficult to get it primed, tried probably twenty times to get it to work, finally giving up telling my Mom I would send it back. I took it home and out of frustration tried a couple more times and it finally sprayed for me. I decided to keep the perfume for myself. Maybe the spray nozzle was just clogged, who knows? I love it and am thankful it started working, I&#x27;m going to keep it for myself and order my Mom something else, too embarrassed to tell her it started working after I got home.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!! Amazing, very romantic and unique.</li>
            <li> I have loved this heavenly fragrance for some time now. It is bold without being ostentatious, with several floral notes. I receive compliments whenever I wear it, so, it has become my signature fragrance.This was a gift and the recipient loved it as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SCENT AND PRICE IS VERY GOOD! WHAT MORE COULD I WISH FOR?</li>
            <li> I was happy with this .I got it for my mom for Xmas and she loved it it and I got it like 60% off</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Bought it for my mom for Christmas and wasn&#x27;t a cheap knock off version as I have seen to be a problem on Amazon. In perfect condition and arrived fast:)</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful user of this product for years.  I was shocked to find out that it was not being sold in the stores anymore.  I found this site and was pleased that I could purchase it online.  When I received the product, I opened one of the bottles to begin using.  I found that the product didn&#x27;t smell the same.  I still have some left in a older bottle and compared with what I received.  I found that the fragrance did not stay with me as the original one.  I am truly disappointed because I only use Lovely.  Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl Wielobob</li>
            <li> Very affordable  and I got it really fast good was impress that you have it because it been discontinue a long time ago</li>
            <li> I ordered this without knowing how it smelled, based on the fact I love Sara Jessica Parker!. It smells light and refreshing! I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I tried this once in a department store, really liked it. Although the shipping was super fast for this perfume, something smells bad! This just stinks. I wish I could describe the smell, but I cannot. Watered down, too much alcohol , something is terribly wrong here. Tried it twice, even spraying some on a shirt, then smelling it a little later, no difference. This may be my first bad review on Amazon, but I just had to write this. Buyer beware, buy this from a department store, I am not sure this is the real thing, or it&#x27;s just old. My mistake, but never again. Would rather Febreeze myself this use this.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  It&#x27;s light and fresh and has a little bit of a soapy scent.  I don&#x27;t like cloying sweet perfumes that can be overpowering.  This is well-named, it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> This is such a light scent you can wear it year round, I get multiple compliments when I wear this and the price was great, I have yet to find this in the stores for what I paid for this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A CLEAN FRESH SCENT, NOT OVERPOWERING. EVERY TIME I WEAR IT SOMEONE COMMENTS ON HOW &amp;#34;LOVELY&amp;#34; I SMELL. IT IS TRULY A &amp;#34;LOVELY&amp;#34; FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I WOULD EXPECT FROM SJP HOWEVER I WAS TAKING A CHANCE BECAUSE I WASNT TOO&lt;br /&gt;SURE WHAT IT SMELLED LIKE.&lt;br /&gt;LA VIE EST BELLE MUCH BETTER (ONLY MY OPINION!)</li>
            <li> Have used it before and wanted to use it again. I mostly wear Light Blue and wanted to try others. I am very happy!</li>
            <li> I like this scent for every day, it&#x27;s light and not sweet. It&#x27;s a fresh scent!  I got a great deal on Amazon and I&#x27;m really happy with it.  I get a lot of compliments on how good I smell and that&#x27;s always nice!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. It really is Lovely, in my opinion. I cant find it in stores anymore. I hope they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this fragrance.  It is light and &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; just as the name says.  I wear it all the time and people constantly tell me I smell good and want to know what I am wearing.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new here... I wasn&#x27;t as crazy about the scent as I thought I&#x27;d be, but I got a huge bottle of perfum for a low price, that shipped quickly, so really it was a very fair experience!</li>
            <li> ...but Lovely is exactly what it says...LOVELY!  A co-worker wears this fragrance and one day, when my scent had worn off, I used a spritz of her Lovely and was hooked!  I normally like to have my own \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot;, but the smell of Lovely was so mezmerizing I HAD to have it!  I felt bad for copying her so I actually asked her if she would mind if I started wearing HER scent. She just laughed and said \\&quot;of course not! I can&#x27;t blame you, it&#x27;s wonderful!\\&quot;  For me the scent lasts all day and into the night when I layer it with the lotion.  Now I&#x27;m getting the shower gel, too!</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this scent. I had a sample and received so many compliments. Searched around at the retail stores and apparently it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is my daughters favorite perfume.  She has tried other scents but keeps going back to Lovely because it is an all round nice everyday scent.  The good thing about it is the price keeps going steadily down and amazon keeps my purchases in the data base so I know when I last ordered it and also the previous price I paid.</li>
            <li> recommended. this is a great perfume. everyone comments when my sister-in-law wears it. people she doesnt even know comes up to her and says she smells great</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfum for about 4 years and I just get so many complaiments on it!! Men and Women love the smell!</li>
            <li> Thinking this would be a nice light floral scent was a big mistake. This has a strong horrible smell. There is nothing feminine about this perfume. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> Bad scent  &amp; fake cologne.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x27;m always getting compliments.</li>
            <li> I regretted buying this cologne before trying it at a store. It&#x27;s not a very good smelling perfume to me. Sorry Sarah!</li>
            <li> Love every thing about this.  Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I just love the aroma. Soft. Gently. Light. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Great price and uncompromised quality.</li>
            <li> for over 10 years I am using this and the only parfume I want to use till the end of my life. suppper supeer supeer</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Great price</li>
            <li> the shipping was incredibly fast. The perfume itself came brand new which I enjoyed. Such a great smelling scent at such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Heard a lot of hype on this fragrance, and I like the new (pink) fragrances which are lighter and not heavy scents.  Its not my absolute favorite, but its pleasant for everyday.  My true test is if anyone compliments my fragrance and that did not happen.  Still, I&#x27;m not disappointed.  Enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever purchased twice. If you could see my fragrance collection, you would see how big a deal that is for me.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for several years.  I am sensitive to strong perfumes, but this one is subtle and not overpowering.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This was my moms favorite perfume and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon since it has been discontinued in retail stores. (: Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent, A new and different product to be used personally, highly recommended to buy again in this store. Tankyou ok</li>
            <li> Have been busy using  it since it came out. I don&#x27;t wear an y other fragrance. It is just lovely.</li>
            <li> I get plenty of compliments when I wear this scent. I like that it is not overpowering, it&#x27;s just LOVELY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent on and off since it came out, but was having a hard time finding it in stores now. This bottle arrived in perfect condition in the original packaging and sealed, smelled as good as it always has, and will last me a long time. I&#x27;ve worn much more expensive scents, but I never get as many compliments and questions about what I&#x27;m wearing as I do when I wear this one. It smells great right out of the bottle and settles in for a soft, sweet scent that lasts for hours. It&#x27;s a favorite and I hope I&#x27;ll be able to wear it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  Wish I could find the body cream too.  Very light, perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it it is her favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the most EXQUISITE scent I have encountered in years!!! I love it, my husband loves it, my friends, coworkers, and people I have randomly encountered in social situations love it and have commented on it! It is not too strong, yet leaves a very indelible impression. I have been wearing this scent for six years now, and although I have tried on others, just to see if there is anything else out there that would make me switch......NOTHING has!! It&#x27;s too delicious to put into words!</li>
            <li> Nice. Just as I remember. Great summer scent and good for every day wear.</li>
            <li> the bottle seems real the smell seems genuine however it seems to be watered down because the scent wesrs off very quickly.</li>
            <li> Everyone always compliments me on how could I smell, all day ! I am very happy with the wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> packaging, color, bottle -okey&lt;br /&gt;scent -..........basically opinion about the smell of perfume should not be added&lt;br /&gt;because it is a very individual thing&lt;br /&gt;The same perfume can smell differently in many people -it is the body chemistry-depends of the pH of your skin&lt;br /&gt;but also the temperature of the body, diet and body lotion what you&#x27;re using.....therefore I found the perfume - is not for me</li>
            <li> It truly smells lovely.  I just bought it because it was suggested and affordable.  Smells great!  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> The perfume is good. Don&#x27;t choose the gift warp. It charges you almost 4 dollars and my two year old son did even better than Amazon. The gift message is upside down, and it looks like it was done by someone who never wrapped before. I was lucky because I mailed it to my house instead of my friend&#x27;s house, so I can wrap it again myself.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and it lasts awhile. I noticed that this bottle smelled a bit differently than past Lovely&#x27;s. It&#x27;s possible the formula has changed a bit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, great product and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> this perfume has a strong smell and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> i love smelling this on my girl.. this is her favorite perfume and i always get her one when it runs out. its very sexy..</li>
            <li> My daughter was happy to get it.</li>
            <li> This scent is for a more mature woman, I instantly felt like a sophisticated 47 year old woman, I began knitting and talking about the stocks. I asked my son when I would be a grandma. It is a lovely scent, only not for a woman in her 20&#x27;s, unless you need yarn and knitting needles which magically appear when spritzed on.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly ordered the wrong item for my wife&#x27;s Christmas gift and wanted to return it.  Amazon won&#x27;t let me return it because it is considered flammable. So when ordering be sure your item is not classified as hazardous (perfume?) or you will not be able to return it. There was no mention of this when ordering...so buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> Very good perfume, arrived on time to my home and it was the product I was looking for. My wife likes a lot!</li>
            <li> Lovely has an active, jaunty fragrance.  I usually wear Lovely during the day.  The fragrance is not strong, does not repel.  My husband has been buying Lovely for me for many many years.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Lovely from Amazon before and its been great.  This is MY perfume.  Everybody knows me by it, they love it on me.  This bottle I got was horrible.  It does not smell anything like the perfume I have come to know and love.</li>
            <li> This perfumes has a very elegant smell to it but you can wear it anytime of the day. Great gift.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell like it smell in the original department stores. Something was missing like it been cut or something</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I hoped I would get an original Eau de Parfum and it was  substantially less than department store ( $68 vs $21). After 2 spays it start to deliver rubbing alcohol without even distant hint of scent what is supposed to be. I am very disappointed  because I am loyal amazon shopper and did not expected to get this kind of product from Amazon. I attempted to return it... but amazon site states that is hazardous material and cannot be returned. I guess it was not hazardous to sell and ship to me but now it is a hazard for return. I gave one start because it is no option for zero or negative one. This is my last purchase from Amazon in fragrance department. Lesson learned: if you want a real thing, buy it from a department store!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for years and used to pay much more for it. Love getting it here for such a great price. It is soft, feminine and subtle. HIGHLY recommended for a young girl who is starting with her first bottle!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed. This is the first perfume I bought that I did not like. It is very watered down and the scent is so weak. I had to spray a whole lot and the scent still did not last very long. I will never order perfume on line again, I am afraid that it was watered down on purpose.</li>
            <li> Smell&#x27;s like an expired product. Very disappointed. This product received great reviews, and does smell when it&#x27;s not past it&#x27;s prime.</li>
            <li> This perfume has such a lovely scent! It is perfect for casual events and to be worn during the day. I would definitely buy it again. It is also a great price for the bottle, which will last for a while.</li>
            <li> This smells fine however, I dont feel it suit young as it is kind of flat!!! I bought this for my wife and she liked it however I would not opt this again for her.</li>
            <li> I just love the light  scent,  how fresh this perfume is and how it lasts so gently....one of my favorites thank you Sarah! Thank you Amazon you never disappoint me!!</li>
            <li> timely and  a good deal....</li>
            <li> old.....almost no scent.  I order this perfume often and this is so old that the scent is more like alcohol. Super unhappy!</li>
            <li> This is my current favorite scent (since 2005!). It smells good on me, first of all. It never smells off or too sweet or too strong. I think there&#x27;s just a subtle hint of patchouli which I love, and other spicy hints but it&#x27;s not too strong. I just love this one. If it helps to know what I love which does not smell right on me, I can name Pheromone - love it but it would turn just awful on my skin. If you love Destiny (as I do too), you may really love Lovely.</li>
            <li> first time trying Lovely I love it.....will order it again....</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this parfum</li>
            <li> I like trying new perfumes when a good deal rolls around, but this will always be my go-to perfume. It&#x27;s delicate, not too sweet (I hate smelling like a candy wrapper), and has a slight floral scent. You&#x27;ll smell like sophistication, easily dodging the old-lady musk smell or something super sugary or over-the-top like you&#x27;d image roaming a high school hallway.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews on Sarah Jessica Parker for Women and decided to order it. WOW! I have been getting so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt; I absolutely love the fragrance...so soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have invested in this owing to rave reviews. Buying perfume online without trying it at store, didn&#x27;t work out well for me. It&#x27;s sitting in my closet, will probably donate it. I really wonder why would anyone on this planet like a scent like this? This smells exactly like the hung-over sour breath. If you want it all over your beautiful garment, knock yourself out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume can never be in the league of pleasant smelling high end perfumes. Wasted my $30 on this crap, will invest a bit more and buy one of my favorites: Beautiful by Estee Lauder, Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, J&#x27;Adore by DIOR.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much when I first tried this fragrance.  I thought, just another celebrity-endorsed cheap smelling thing, and with Jessica Parker&#x27;s name to boot, someone whose taste in clothes I don&#x27;t much admire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But surprise, absolutely beautiful fragrance - I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to describe it, just soft and so feminine, like beautiful smelling soap.  It will never overpower.  It is subtle, classy, and understated.  It reminds me of something a sophisticated wealthy woman would wear.  I am very fussy about fragrances; so many are just stinky.  I was so surprised when I smelled this for the first time;  just fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> When I spray the scent from the bottle, it smell absolutely wonderful, but when I spray the scent on my body, it smells different.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the scent from bottle to my body would be the same and then I would truly love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for my mom, again.  It&#x27;s her absolute fave. It&#x27;s light, floral and crisp, with a light citrus freshness and a hint of sweet. It smells great on her. She&#x27;s been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> very good, congratulation,</li>
            <li> only smells for a few hours.</li>
            <li> The box it came in looked exactly the same as other &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; boxes.  However, after I opened it, I saw that the bottle was not pink-tinted; it was clear with no color.  The scent smells vaguely like the &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; I&#x27;d been using for years, though I can detect a slight essence of moth balls.  The moth ball scent does go away after it&#x27;s been on my skin for a little while.  However, so does any trace of the &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; scent.  The fragrance in all of the previous bottles I have purchased from stores lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell. Not because of the fragance itself but because it was an old bottle. Good knows from when. I gave it as a present and was a huge disappointment both for me and my mom.</li>
            <li> Very strong musky smell. I waisted my money.</li>
            <li> This Parfum is very nice, particularly for the Summer. It&#x27;s light and not overwhelming. A little goes a long way. It lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker is one of my favourite scents which comes at an affordable price!  This package was delivered to me on time - I had no problems at all!</li>
            <li> Not overbearing but a nice, fresh smell.  It was given to me as a gift and I loved it so much, I bought some when I ran out.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments when I wear this very light and just a beautiful scent. Arrived right on time not broken...yeah for me. Thanks</li>
            <li> My young siser like the Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker for Women.  I just order for her BD&#x27;s gift.  I hope she will happy when got it.</li>
            <li> At first, I was between getting the $83 Narciso Rodriguez&#x27;s for her or the $38 SJP&#x27;s Lovely. Finally, I deciding to purchase Lovely, untried, based on a majority of rave reviews of how wearable and \\&quot;lovely\\&quot; this perfume is. I had high hopes. I even tried to give it the benefit of the doubt after reading a minority of bad reviews. I got the perfume in the mail earlier today. I really wanted to like it. I sprayed it near my wrist. The initial spray was unpleasant and sharp  to the nose. Still, I reserved my judgment until the perfume had a chance to dry down and settle. After the dry down, the sharpness faded into something slightly more powdery, but still I hated the scent on me. Perhaps it didn&#x27;t mix well with my body chemistry, but the scent did remind me, like it had so many other reviewers, of the dated, old lady smell. Not the classy old lady either. As some time passed as I checked the skin where I applied the perfume periodically in hopes that it will develop into something \\&quot;lovely\\&quot;, I realized that this perfume started to give me a headache. It never did become something pleasant. This is not something I want to wear to represent me.&lt;br /&gt;What irritated me further was when I found out the fragrances are considered hazardous material and are not returnable. I&#x27;m stuck with a perfume I hate. Wasted $38. Wouldn&#x27;t even try to give this to a friend. What a disappointment! I&#x27;m sorry to have to say I agree with those who declared this was not lovely at all. Even now, I&#x27;m smelling my wrist as I write this review with the tiniest hope that it turns out it isn&#x27;t a headache-inducing old lady mothball perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I shake my head in regret in not heeding the warnings of other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I was walking thru a store when this woman passed me and yes I did I stopped her in her tracks and asked what she was wearing because omg I almost followed her around like a creepy person cause she smelled amazing!!! It was like a fresh clean just out of the shower smell and I&#x27;m sooo going out to get this perfume! Most perfumes give me such headaches but this one did not. Hope I find it.</li>
            <li> I must say that my friends and family already describe \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; as my personal scent, since they will never catch me not wearing it! I always have two or three bottles in my closet, just to make sure I am never out, and dread the idea of it ever being discontinued! I am the kind of person who loves perfume above any other \\&quot;must have\\&quot; item, and \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; is at the very top of my list. I get stopped by people asking what fragrance I have on all the time, and will gladly share the information, and even where to buy it!! Sarah Jessica Parker will always have my gratittude for having created what I consider the best fragrance ever!!</li>
            <li> It just seems to be way diluted from when I used to buy it from Macy&#x27;s. I won&#x27;t purchase it again unless I try it again from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Great scent that&#x27;s sweet but not too teen like.  The delivery was timely.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had told me that she wanted this fragrance for Christmas because she was having a hard time finding it in stores. So, I racked up major boyfriend points for actually listening to her and giving this gift to her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> favorite perfume, I bought this for all my friends and family for the holidays and everyone was very happy its such a great price!</li>
            <li> It is old lady perfume. It doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> This is a very good price for this perfume and it&#x27;s pretty hard to find in stores, so thanks Amazon.com for carrying it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this SJP fragrance because I&#x27;m a fan and I heard really good things about it.  I do not like the fragrance, it smells kind of old like it&#x27;s been sitting somewhere for years.  Sorry SJP maybe the other fragrances are better?</li>
            <li> Love the scent, the price was great!  Friend was happy with gift.  She has 3 choices now, as the other two perfumes where for her also. Expect the same review.</li>
            <li> Use this perfum since first on market. Light, inviting fragrance, just love it!</li>
            <li> THIS SMELLS LIKE ALCOHOL, SO CAN BE EASILY CONCLUDED ITS FAKE. TO DOUBLE CHECK THIS, I TOOK THE PRODUCT TO STORE AND COMPARED THIS SMELL AND THE REAL PRODUCT SMELL AND SHOCKED THAT, THIS PRODUCT&#x27;S SMELL IS INDEED A FAKE ONE.</li>
            <li> nice my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Great gift and awesome scent</li>
            <li> The perfume smelled exactly the way it&#x27;s suppose to, it is authentic. My order arrived fast. I will definitely order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Smells great...not too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lovely for since the product first came out, and I love it - the price was definitely right too.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for my mom for Christmas and it smells so wonderful! And it was such a good price too! It arrived way sooner then I thought it would (and said it would) and was packaged really well. Definitely would order again!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume because it is long lasting at least more than 24 hours. The smell is giving you impression as sweet, elegant, innocent but brave and strong woman in the same time. It is one of my celeb fragrance collections :) I recommend this with confident.</li>
            <li> Quick arrival time , With Lovely being my favorite&lt;br /&gt;Scent I will continue to order here , thank u for your&lt;br /&gt;great prices !!!!</li>
            <li> I gifted this perfume to my wife and she loved it. She liked the fragrance and shape of the bottle. Totally worth!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this fragrance! It does react to your body chemistry, so it does smell somewhat different on everyone. If anyone was familiar with Basic Instinct from Victoria&#x27;s Secret this is very close. When VS discontinued it(although sometimes you can find on internet) I was so upset, then I smelled Lovely on someone and it was so close I had to ask what it was. I&#x27;ve been hooked every since. It has a slightly musky scent but mostly floral and a clean scents. It lasts a very longtime while not having to use alot, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My wife has worn this scent for years. She tells me that this bottle has very little fragrance... Smells like mostly alcohol... Possibly old stock... Very disappointed! Box was discarded so we could not return.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent and has been using it from the last several years. Many people ask her what scent she uses. I bought several other scents that are expensive, she said not to waste my money. Just buy this whenever she is out of stock, I am good to go.</li>
            <li> This was a gift.  Very clean smell.</li>
            <li> Item rec&#x27;d quickly and pkg&#x27;d nicely. Product was just as described and price was good. Love the fragrance, light and clean!</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect!</li>
            <li> Does not cover up the funky smell that can haunt a woman.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume!!!!!! Don&#x27;t even remember how I stumbled upon it. Funny story: I walked into Walmart and the cashier I went to says &amp;#34; You smell lovely!&amp;#34;  I replied &amp;#34;funny you say that,because that&#x27;s the name of the perfume &amp;#34;lol. #Winning Im so confused as to why they discontinued it,but I found it on Amazon so Im happy.  You will love this perfume SERIOUSLY!</li>
            <li> really smells lovely!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I bought it.  Have had before.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The full amount, a big bottle, taste like toilet water started before the transfer relatively pungent, slowly easing in some of the tune after tune I fell in love, and now every day use, holding incense time is not too long, but the price has made me very satisfied</li>
            <li> Fast shipping item exactly as expected</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Everyone asks me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so delicate, and pretty, and feminine, without being overwhelmingly floral. It reminds me of Mademoiselle Coco Chanel, but obviously a lot more budget friendly. I always get complimented on it, wherever I go, and it lasts forever if you spray it on your pulse points. Now my mother and all of my sisters are wearing it, too, so its kind of become our family scent, lol.</li>
            <li> I love these colognes! Amazon is the only place I can find them, I have been using them for while and I don&#x27;t think I will change ny time soon, They are great! Not too heavy. Just right for me!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!  I get so many compliments,  it&#x27;s all I use!!!  Thank you SJP!!  It&#x27;s definitely my scent!!  Loved your Endless too!!!</li>
            <li> This does not smell like the Lovely by SJP that I know, it just smells like alcohol. I&#x27;m so disappointed with this order and it seems like I can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume ! Very feminine</li>
            <li> My fave and it&#x27;s hard to find!! Great price too!!</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s light and fun!</li>
            <li> Lovely is exactly that....Lovely!</li>
            <li> wife very pleased with the product.  Daughter thought it was a more expensive Parfum.</li>
            <li> Love love highly recommend a nice floral scent</li>
            <li> Great product.I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  So many different perfumes give me a headache, but this one does not.  It has a very light smell.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This scent is wonderful! I am very pleased! This came to my door this evening and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it on! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> Another nice SJP scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and was upset when retailers like Macy&#x27;s stopped selling it, Thank you Amazon! Light and fresh this scent is so nice. Packaging and product were has pictured.</li>
            <li> My daughter in laws favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell at first, when I saw the sampler in a magazine. When I wear the perfume, it feels good. Not a great one, but a good one. But, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay beyond couple of hours. When I used it for work place, by afternoon, no hint of Lovely!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a hater of this perfume. But nothing motivates me to buy this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this item due to the rave reviews.... Well it doesn&#x27;t smell so lovely- I literally hated the smell- grrrrr- it smells like an old woman&#x27;s perfume:-(</li>
            <li> I have been regular in buying from Amazon on line. Most of the time, my purchases have been Books; Kindle and connected accessories; Electronics and Cosmetics / perfumes. My experience have been outstanding. I must have purchased at least 100 times in the last 5 years. Only one time was my shipment delayed from the outside provider. Shipments have always been correct and delivered promptly. The only time it was late, I did call Amazon and you people tried to resolve. Of course, items held in inventory are always fast and expeditious in delivery but outsiders have become more efficient over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am of course a satisfied customer!&lt;br /&gt;paramoh@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;latest item purchased: Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker 2 bottles of 3.4 oz</li>
            <li> This perfume has a great smell. Wearing it makes you feel confident and sexy!! I would recommend it to all women.</li>
            <li> Great value. This is quite sweet smelling. Great for a teenager. Although I use it and I am in my 30&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> This ish stinks so bad!!!! First sniff and it gave me a headache. First hints are pepper followed by extreme stench. I agree with the user said they would rather wear fabreze. How can it be a #1 best seller when it smells so freaking noxious</li>
            <li> Do not buy this! It smells horrible! Like an old woman who lives in a cabin. It&#x27;s not flattering at all! in fact, I would recommend not buying any fragrance online unless you know what you like. I definitely wasted my money.</li>
            <li> met my wife&#x27;s desires</li>
            <li> Love the perfume but don&#x27;t like to and will not deal with the people that I ordered it from. I will never order from them again!</li>
            <li> The perfume was great, would recommend anyone to buy it</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and fast!  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I love  this perfume and this is an awesome price!</li>
            <li> smells very strong and more like for old people, hated the smell, couldn&#x27;t return :( had to give away and it was expensive :(</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when wearing this.  It&#x27;s my go to fragrance.  I keep a bottle at home, the office and my yacht.  It&#x27;s an inexpensive way to always smell great without being offensive.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I&#x27;m always smelling...lovely. :-))</li>
            <li> Price was good it is like two for one</li>
            <li> Love the smell....just wish the scent hung around longer.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent fragrance that last and doesn&#x27;t wear off like some after an hour that seem to just evaporate . I would highly recommend it it&#x27;s almost like aroma therapy to waken the senses as if you are surrounded by rose pedals and honey dew . It is one of my favorite scents not too strong but strong enough and I receive multiple compliments when I wear it .</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and always go back after trying others.  Have bought from Scentiments but it is always out of stock the last few months.  Bought from Fragrance.net&lt;br /&gt;but this price beat both of those with fast delivery and arrived in perfect condition.  Will definitely use this site again for this beautiful fragrance!</li>
            <li> came quickly and was exactly like the perfume I have always used.  good vendor.  i would recommend them.  Five stars.</li>
            <li> Watered-down - doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real thing; not robust, very faint and smelled weird because it was so watered down. I sprayed so much all over my body, my clothes and the back of my hair - 30 minutes later, you couldn&#x27;t smell a thing! Total rip-off. Seller should be ashamed selling this toilet water!</li>
            <li> I do not like this fragrance. Smells cheap and to me its not good! Test at a store before buying! It may smell good on some people I guess.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s a light fragrance and lasts the day.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> For you 30 something&#x27;s that find yourself to mature for your old go-to perfumes. This is light, feminine, and playful. I get a lot of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Perfume is to be discovered... Not introduced.</li>
            <li> My second FAVORITE perfume! I love the size, the smell, and of course the price!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how many people use this perfume, but these days it is very hard to find this perfume. It used to be everywhere, like Walmart, but not anymore. I am glad I found a large bottle for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love SJP but was disappointed in her Parfum.  Very common and one dimmensional; lacks sophistication and complexity.  Didn&#x27;t find it subtle and couldn&#x27;t wait to shower it off.  That&#x27;s just one girl&#x27;s opinion; I&#x27;m sure there are others who might feel differently....</li>
            <li> this is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. It is delicate, elegant, subtle and just a touch sweet. It is a shame that is has been discontinued. Hopefully, Sarah Jessica Parker will bring it back to the market.</li>
            <li> Perfect scent. I have gotten many compliments since I&#x27;ve been wearing it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! I always get so many compliments and I am glad I can still find it on Amazon! Can no longer find it in stores.</li>
            <li> This is my favor perfume</li>
            <li> Lovely is at first spicy with hints of delicate orchid and paper whites. Then the honey sweet scent mellows into an evocative warmth with hints of hugs and memories of corsages at weddings. There is something beautifully comforting yet altogether mysterious. Musk and Lavender give this fragrance a warm confidence while the mingling of precious essential oils creates a classically poetic blend of refined nuances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a scent like Lovely for a long time. It stays with me and seems to improve as the day wears on. I have never had so many compliments on a fragrance. I ordinarily shy away from celebrity scents, but this one is an exception.</li>
            <li> made my grl freind so very happy! she was impressed i had bought it. i my self love the smell.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume. I will admit that when i first sprayed it, i did not like it but within 5 minutes after it sunk in I guess, it was fantastic.  I find myslef sniffing my wrists all day long!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume~ The smell is womanly sophisticated, soft, sweet, and classy. Just putting it on makes me feel sexy. The scent lasts longer than other brands, making it the best perfume I ever had.</li>
            <li> Item was well-packaged, shipped quickly, and arrived before promised.  An altogether very nice transaction!</li>
            <li> I first learned of this frangrance from a co-worker.  It smelt so nice, I had to have it.  So, my husband surprised with a gift set for mother&#x27;s day.  This fragrance smells delightful.  Unfortunately, it does not last long.  I apply it in the morning and by mid-day, I need to put on more.  :(</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. So i will be ordering more of this as time goes by and i need it.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner.  Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume...it is light and airy and I folks always say I smell good...what&#x27;s not to like! v</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at a department store until one day they just discontinued it.bnever in my life have I ever worn a scent that people would fall over themselves to ask me what is that perfume you are wearing. I hope I can always get it here.</li>
            <li> Ever since a roommate of mine used to wear it all the time and it made everything she touched smell like it, I have wanted it. Some ppl dislike perfumes attached to all their belongings and clothes despite washing but I honestly love it. It&#x27;s hard to find scents that really do it, too. This is a powdery, flowery almost a light musk in scent. Very refreshing and different from most of the overly sweet pungent odors out so often.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances! And a very nice price!</li>
            <li> I love this scent and know just how it should smell.  I received my order and it smells just like it should.  I was a little hesitant about ordering it after  reading some of the reviews about perfumes smelling different than they should.  No problem here.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances and I find it difficult to find it in retail stores</li>
            <li> No Stars. I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 5 years and have just recently noticed less places carrying it. After thinking of every possible place, I ordered it through this retailer. It&#x27;s not real. A DEFINITE IMPOSTER. Smells like something you would get from the dollar store. Luckily I found Lovely at a &amp;#34;perfume store&amp;#34; and purchased a few. I also saw you can order online at a few stores like Walmart. Just google the perfume. I encourage you to. This product is a fake.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for years and just love it.  It just seems to work well with my skin as I always get complicates.  The price is right too.  I also purchase the body spray and body cream which is equally as nice.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes of liking this perfume, especially since Oprah raved about it and it is represented by SJP.  If you like a strong flowery smell (old lady) then you&#x27;ll love this.  Definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> Perfume is a very personal product and looking at the reviews, I&#x27;m surprised so many women order perfume without seeing how the perfume works with their body chemistry first. Trying the scent on in the store, then ordering from Amazon could save a lot of mistakes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been looking for a new perfume for awhile, and just couldn&#x27;t find anything I really liked. This was perfect! It&#x27;s not &#x27;old lady&#x27; and not something my teenagers would wear either. I&#x27;m so happy that I have something new and makes me feel very &#x27;womanly&#x27;.</li>
            <li> great perfume, funny I realized the reason I always buy the knock off version of this is that the real one has a lot of white flower in it which gives me a total headache. so even though this was a great purchase I can&#x27;t wear the perfume don&#x27;t know what to do with it</li>
            <li> Came on the right day plus it was cheap almost like half off. Came real fast Hope my bestie loves it</li>
            <li> Ive used Lovely since it first came out and love it.  I bought this before my last bottle ran out, following my &amp;#34;be prepared&amp;#34; rule.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and it arrived safe and sound and on time.  My wife was delighted.  She has used this fragrance before so we knew she would like it.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this perfume. It is my second bottle and certainly not my last. The scent lasts a long time and the price can&#x27;t be beat. Try it! You will love it!</li>
            <li> Once again, I win the title of The Best Brother In Law, for giving the perfect gift.This is the second year I have bought this on Amazon for my sister-in-law.This year she wasn&#x27;t expecting it, but did not buy any more after hers ran out last year.She probably will not buy anymore this year either.Sure makes buying for her easy.I do enjoy the ease of which it is to shop Amazon.I do not have to fight the crowds, get into parking wars, or deal with stressed out cashiers.I have gotten everything each year in no more than 9 days, and only one of those took that long.I am a devoted Amazon shopper.Keeps me Happy, Thanks and Happy New Year.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume and so do all of my friends and family. Every time I wear it out I get compliments. This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it and it certainly won&#x27;t be the last!</li>
            <li> I do not like heavy perfumes, or women who choose to overdo their own perfume application and then &amp;#34;crop dust&amp;#34; the public as they walk by.  I like light scents that last.  One of my favorite scents is &amp;#34;Falling In Love&amp;#34; by Philosophy, and while it&#x27;s a lovely, light scent, it seems to disappear after a couple of hours.  SJP&#x27;s &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; is light and floral.  It lasts!  You don&#x27;t need to over-apply it, just a light dab/or spray and you&#x27;re good to go.  It has become my favorite over time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad...just not the knock-out scent that I was looking for.  My current favorites are Noa &amp; Burberry Brit but always looking for something new &amp; different.  I&#x27;ll use &#x27;Lovely&#x27; from time-to-time but it loses it scent early &amp; just doesn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 5 star rating because that&#x27;s what I got from my wife when I gave it to her for her birthday.  She loved it!  I could say she wasn&#x27;t expecting it, too.  But with all the &amp;#34;scratch and sniff&amp;#34; pullouts from magazines that she carelessly left all over my computer desk, it wasn&#x27;t hard to take the hint. lol</li>
            <li> Love it, it smells so good, get a lot of compliments but not sure about it last effects. Its is a must try ladies</li>
            <li> Nothing left to say! An amazing fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is a very feminine  body fragrance. It goes with whatever you&#x27;re wearing, any time of day. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> My dad loves this perfume. Always tell my mom to wear this, especially when we are going to a party. Love it!</li>
            <li> Got this for ex wife and she loves it!  The scent is light and alluring. The only downside is, for her, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  After about 4hrs it&#x27;s pretty much gone.  The price you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> i tracked down a lady in a dept store to ask what her perfume is and promptly bot it the next day.  it is a very clean, somewhat powdery fragrance .. only downside is that the scent does not last on me and have to reapply too often ..  if you don&#x27;t like the strong, overpowering scents, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the worst perfume I have ever smelled!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Wow!!!!! Sarah Jessica parker you really captured the scent of an old women’s dressing room with this one…..Bravo!</li>
            <li> Many many compliments on the fragrance.... Love it</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas gift, and it wass a hit. My lady loved the smell. It has a &amp;#34;Rich woman Smell&amp;#34; thats what she called it.lol</li>
            <li> This perfume is really light and feminine. I have received many compliments when wearing it.  I do wish it lasted longer before the scent fades. I have to reapply mid day but it is really lovely.</li>
            <li> I’ve been wearing Lovely for years now, and I always get compliments on the scent. I like that the scent is not overly powerful and is light and airy. It goes on light, but the scent does stay with you throughout the day. I don’t like really heavy scents, so if you want something that’s going to stay on you with 1 spray, this might not be for you. Do try the perfume before you buy though because it does smell differently on different people. When I smelled it on my sister, it wasn’t the same as it was on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also always buy this on Amazon because it’s free shipping and always cheaper than other places. Amazon never disappoints me with the quality!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume. I really enjoy the perfume and the fact that it is no longer being made is a shame.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect fragrance to use if you have allergy suffers around you. Or anyone with asthma I have found out. This doesn&#x27;t trigger my boss&#x27; asthma or trigger my allergies. Plus you can use it all year around. I think this is going to be my all season fragrance.</li>
            <li> Got this for my cousin and she loves it! awesome buy at a great price and its original . that&#x27;s the thing I like about amazon! AWESOME BUY! thanks!</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for my birthday one year and I loved it, I get so many compliments. I recently purchased this for my mother for her birthday and she loved it so much she practically wears it every day. It has this very light flowery smell, very soothing.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and quick 2 day shipping with Prime.</li>
            <li> I truly believe every woman should have a &amp;#34;signature scent.&amp;#34;  This is mine.  It&#x27;s light, slightly exotic, day-or-night, layers of light, refreshing scent.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> This parfum arrived today.  It smells delightful!  I have favorites and this one smells a lot like narciso rodriguez for her which is yummy and lovely is half the price of the aforementioned.  This parfum has a clean, feminine, day-to-evening scent.  I love it and am prepared for all of the compliments I will get.  :-)  Happy (good-smelling) camper!</li>
            <li> Wife has been always a die hard fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, When she found this perfume and started wearing it since a few years ago, it became her favorite. She loves it!!!&lt;br /&gt;And I as a man and husband lloooovvveee the fragrance and how it smells on her.&lt;br /&gt;Simply Lovely</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend in Spain a few years ago. Now she call me to ask for it because she  can not find it there.</li>
            <li> This is my new daily perfume. Just right for all occasions.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It has just the right amount of floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a rip off...what a fake as it is nothing but lightly colored water or maybe the bottle is colored and the so called perfume is clear.  The first couple bottles I ordered were fine, seemed to be the real thing and I only ordered because I could no longer get it in department stores.  I bought for myself and daughter and we have 2 bottles left........bottles of expensive water. When you first spray it smells the same but that last probably 30 seconds. We saturated  a tissue and put in our pocket and after several minutes there was no fragrance.  Amazon offers a couple different bottles with a slight difference in price.  Is the more expensive the real stuff and the cheaper the fake.  The difference doesn&#x27;t amount to that much, maybe 10 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of buying perfume on the net.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;My friend loved it.</li>
            <li> The most elegant, classy perfume out there.  I get so many compliments!  I cannot find anything like it and am so glad that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Bummed that it&#x27;s no longer sold in stores</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Everyone said this smells so fresh and clean, but I smell too much chemical mixed in for me to love it</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and its hard to find now. The price was great as well!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom, as it&#x27;s been her favorite perfume for years. Knowing that I wasn&#x27;t buying it directly from a trusted retailer, I almost worried I&#x27;d be getting a knockoff or watered-down version, but nope-same quality product she&#x27;d been purchasing for years at a discounted price. Very glad to have found it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  It came packaged very well and I was very happy .</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not a huge SJP fan, there is something feminine, fun and confident about this fragrance. I&#x27;ve used it for years whenever I want to project myself confidently among women. There are some scents that make you feel like Marilyn Monroe, but this isn&#x27;t one of them. It&#x27;s fabulous for girls&#x27; night out as well as a job interview (especially with a potential female boss)! Women love this fragrance, men like it as well! Give it a try...you deserve it!</li>
            <li> beautiful fragrance. smells of soft sweet wood. very pleasant. can be worn to work or as an enticing fragrance for a first date. keep in mind, less is more. i found that the lighter the application the better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this perfume.  It is such a beautiful, unique scent!!  It&#x27;s addicting, I wish it lasted longer!</li>
            <li> she loves it. good deal for the price.  I don&#x27;t know what else to write about this.  It&#x27;s okay is all I have to say.</li>
            <li> Women really like it!</li>
            <li> Last time I will buy perfume from Amazon!  It does not smell at all! I dont know if its a fake, or if its really old and &#x27;went bad&#x27;.  Since Amazon has a no return policy on perfume, im stuck with the defective product. Went out to a department store and bought another bottle unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I just looooooveeee ittt. That&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> delivered as expected and what was promised</li>
            <li> The best fragrance., so light and beautiful .</li>
            <li> This is my mother-in-laws absolute favorite perfume.  She had looked for it retail and was thrilled when I was able to find it for her.  As always Amazon came through for me. :)</li>
            <li> if i gotten to read these 1 star reviews i might end up of not ordering this perfume.  dissappointed!!! doesnt even last for a minute and the smell disgusting!!! the shipment so slowwwwww!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchase. Perfume was as expected. Arrived in a timely fashion. Shared my experience with friends. Thanks</li>
            <li> This was a gift and I received it promptly and it was packaged beautiful, but I really have no idea how it smells, baut knowing this actress it has to be light and lovely.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this perfume and they stopped selling it in stores. So happy we can still get it online!</li>
            <li> It smells like men&#x27;s cologne.  I&#x27;m so disappointed.  When I used it at my friend&#x27;s it was amazing. When I received the purchase and sprayed it on me I couldn&#x27;t believe it was the same stuff.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing scent, loved the scent, priced prefect.</li>
            <li> I cant stand the smell of it though.  I tried to tell her that, but she told me it was for her and not for me.  New wife or purfume needed</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for 3 years. It is my &amp;#34;work perfume&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not too strong or overpowering. It has a clean scent to it. Its like it has different layers of scent. When you first put it on it has one scent , but as the day goes by the smell changes. I have received many compliments on the perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading so many rave reviews, with high hopes. I&#x27;m sorry to say that it just wasn&#x27;t for me.. I know they say perfume smells differently on everyone, but I don&#x27;t think this one would be ideal for anyone under the age of 35 unless you just have a particular love for this type of scent. I tried to wear this several times, all of which resulted in a headache due to the strength at first, and a disappointment for the smell not lasting very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The musk at the base of this fragrance seemed too much for me, resulting in what me and my mom always referred to as &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34;. In all honesty, the first experience with this perfume brought me back to my great grandmother&#x27;s house, where everything smelled like &amp;#34;Navy&amp;#34; by Dana, which she wore for years and always gave me the same dull headache from being overwhelmed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, I feel it would be age appropriate for anyone looking for a mature smelling fragrance. This was my first real splurge on &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; perfume, but I guess I needed to keep looking. If you&#x27;re still interested in trying it, you might consider getting the smaller size until you&#x27;re sure this is what you want to spend your money on. Or else you&#x27;ll be stuck with a full bottle that will probably be passed down to your great grandchildren, like I most likely will be.</li>
            <li> came on time, and price was fair</li>
            <li> That is what my Aunt said. This was a gift for her and she absolutely loves it. She said it was not to heavy or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  It&#x27;s subtle but wonderful.  It may be worth noting that I&#x27;ve dropped the bottle a fair number of times and it&#x27;s never broken!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. And the price too.&lt;br /&gt;Many people says thats like Narcizo Rodrigues for her, but the price is so different.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect scent for me. It works perfect with my chemistry and is not over powering. The smell matches the name to a &#x27;t&#x27;. I wore Issey by Miyake for years but couldn&#x27;t keep up with the cost. This smells just as good and is budget friendly.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my mom</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife.  We have not viewed it yet.  It arrived in great shape.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love Lovely.  It is a great light fragrance, not overpowering and lasts all day. A nice evening fragrance too.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but not that much like Narcisso Rodriguez as some have said. I will splurge on the real thing next time.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a sweet, seductive and alluring scent..everyone around you notices and compliments you on it! It was shipped in a timely manner and the price was great! i would Definitely Recommend this to every lady!!</li>
            <li> Love the way it is light and subtle. Pretty container. I use this one for every day use, just spritz on after shower. I get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I like the smell. It is a very clean scent with a hint of lavender. Normally I don&#x27;t like floral scents, but this is great.</li>
            <li> I love this!  Haven&#x27;t been this into a perfume in a while!  It smells great and lasts all day!  Already want more!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and the transaction was great</li>
            <li> My favorite and so hard to find! Feel like I won on this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great buy, always get compliment when i wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the scent...always get good comments</li>
            <li> The name fits the product perfectly.  This scent is &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s a new favorite for a long time to come!  I try to be considerate of co-workers that may be allergic to perfumes, so maybe I don&#x27;t apply enough for it to last all day, but I really love to wear this perfume!</li>
            <li> Great, prompt as advertised</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d prior to Christmas,.. excellent service and cost,.....thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Love it, Quick delivery</li>
            <li> stinks like old woman perfume.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but I like it. I wore this to school and I was approached by classmates asking me what&#x27;s the name of the perfume I&#x27;m wearing. I give it 4 stars because it smells good but not that lasting.</li>
            <li> Very feminine and always catches the attention of others. My all time favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for the girlfriend, it&#x27;s her favorite, and even though I don&#x27;t have a sense of smell, she does get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume by SJP</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful fragrance. Soft and clean smelling. Like a lady fresh out of the shower on a summers day. Really like it a lot!</li>
            <li> The one and only criteria for perfume--it smells good!  Also, the bottle and packaging are lovely, like the name! Kudos!</li>
            <li> This perfume has been my favorite for over an year now. The smell is really fresh and light. I was really satisfied with my previous orders, but on my last purchase I feel that there is smell of alcohol a bit more than it actually should be, therefore if I apply more than 2 sprays it gives me a little headache.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day ,Price was great and the reviews are great on it .shipping was fast so Im happy .  Hope she likes it .</li>
            <li> Best perfume I&#x27;ve ever gotten!</li>
            <li> Dunno what it is, but I melt when my gf wears this. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I just tried to purchase this locally and couldn&#x27;t find it so ordered on line. I sampled just about everything at Macy&#x27;s counter and nothing came close to this. It really is &#x27;Lovely&#x27;! When I change our sheets I lightly spray the mattress pads with it and it makes the fresh bedding smell fantastic and always impresses our guests.</li>
            <li> Just received my fragrance order 1.5 days after placing the order! I have purchased another SJP fragrance \\&quot;Covet\\&quot; and decided to take a chance on \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot;, so glad that I did. It is a light scent that I can wear all summer long! The price was fantastic to boot! I just love my Amazon!</li>
            <li> One of my favourite sents! Love it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is overwhelming with the strong scent of powder and not in a good way.  The best way to describe it is to put on a powder deoderant, go outside and sweat all day, and then, smell yourself....  This is the smell Lovely captures in a bottle.  I wish it would fade.  I wish I could get this off my skin!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife for Christmas. She loved it! It has a pleasant fragrance, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Wish the review came to my attention in time for me to tell people how long it took for me to receive the shipment. It was timely,nevertheless I think it would be helpful. This fragrance is so lovely it makes people call me lovely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful smell !! I bought this for Christmas for my mother and she loves it !! Wish I could find the lotion still!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the problem is with the bottle I just got, but there is close to no scent. It was light and disappeared quickly the first time I used it. Disappointing. Now, two weeks later there is literally no scent when it first comes out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was debating between one or two stars, but decided on one star because this purchase was a 100% waste of money. It can&#x27;t even be used to build a layered scent because there is nothing there. I can&#x27;t return it because of shipping issues, but this is the first defective product that I&#x27;ve received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a store and it smells great came to amazon because I know I could get a better price. Very light and not over powering sweet clean smell. Does not smell like and old lady like the expensive over priced prestigious brands do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume!  I have been wearing it now for about 3 years or so and will continue to do so.  I always get compliments on it from others.</li>
            <li> This perfume is fabulous!  When I tried it in the store I thought it was very strong. After it dries, it is really a subtle, young fragrance.  The price on Amazon was much better than the one that I was given at the department store.  I would highly recommend this fragrance to one and all!  Great Mother&#x27;s Day gift!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this light, playful fragrance...I bought it for myself, wrapped it, and Santa gave it to me!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000C1ZDTU Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker for Women, Eau de Parfum, 3.4-Ounce Spray Bottle]]This is a wonderfully light, refreshing and subtle scent. there are top notes of floral, with a basic musk and amber underlayer. perfect for daytime wear or evening, although I do recommend you try it out first before buying. If you like any of the J Lo fragrances, you will enjoy this little addition to your fragrance wardrobe. Prices here are so much better than at any mall!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice perfume -- not too sweet or heavy.  Long-lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  I was unable to find it in a store nearby.  I received the product several days before expected delivery date.  Looking forward to using Amazon.com for my holiday shopping.</li>
            <li> I always liked the fragrance Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker when it first came out.  I remember first smelling it, spraying some on myself, and not being able to stop sniffing my wrist.  It&#x27;s THAT good!  The only problem was, it&#x27;s fairly expensive in the stores.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend at least $60 on a perfume, shopping on amazon.com is the way to go.  You save a lot of money for the exact same perfume.  How to describe the fragrance?  Lovely smells like something soft, alluring, and sexy all at once.  You can wear it for any occasion, from something casual to more formal, dressier events.  It&#x27;s a light, fresh scent with a lovely, lingering aura.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something soft, elegant, and suitable for both day and evening wear. This fragrance is perfect! It&#x27;s warm and cozy and subtle. I do not like overly strong floral or fruity fragrances, and Lovely is certainly not one of those obnoxious scents that overwhelms the room. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint might be that it&#x27;s a bit TOO subtle, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing. I&#x27;ll just reapply if I&#x27;m going out again in the evening.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and refreshing. I have ordered this over and over again and glad the price has gone down</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift for my girlfriend that is 23 years old and she hated it.  She tried to give it to her older 38 year old sister and she didn&#x27;t like it either.  The first thing I noticed when I sprayed it on was the musky old lady smell.  I decided to just buy another sweeter smelling perfume like Katy Perry at a Ross dept. store.</li>
            <li> As the name of Parfum....lovely packaging, lovely smell and makes you feel lovely all round. I would purchase again and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THIS PERFUME &amp; THE PRICE WAS THE BEST I HAVE FOUND ANYWHERE&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE FOUND THIS FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my wife and she loved it.  Very nice, not overpowering fragrance.  Very pretty and priced right.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Shipping was very fast despite all the snow and ice that was falling.</li>
            <li> Great perfume, First time purchasing Sarah Jessica Parker. It is a nice gift. Very nice aroma and not over powering. Will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my sister&#x27;s favorite perfuma and it is near impossible to find anymore. Amazon made it easy to make my sister&#x27;s birthday &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work - how do i return it ?</li>
            <li> Soft, lovely, feminine scent. Very pleased with the product, packaging and speed of delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34;, a light feminine scent that doesn&#x27;t last. Simple fix: respray yourself. This little bottle goes fast unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! It is my absolute favorite! I wish I could find the lotion, and soap. Great to finally find this. For some reason only Macy&#x27;s carry this, and it is $75.oo, plus tax @ 16% here in Washington State. Thank you, Love, Love! I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected and on time.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Great product</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, can&#x27;t get enough of it.  It tastes awful though, is there anyway you could make it strawberry flavored?</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fast delivery, I love this perfume!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed to learn this had been discontinued, as it is one of my two signature scents. D &amp; G Light Blue is my other. So, I was really pleased to find it on amazon. I do hope that I&#x27;ll be able to buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Very Nice and Excellent Shipping</li>
            <li> Initially upon receiving this perfume I was madly in love with it; however, after a little over a month of owning it, the lovely floral scent has vanished and taken on an offensive rubbing alcohol scent. Prior to the nauseating scent switch, the perfume&#x27;s scent barely lasted for an hour. Perhaps one could chalk it up to my nose &amp;#34;getting used&amp;#34; to the scent and therefore no longer smelling it; however, with other perfumes I could always catch the lingering scent on my wrists after several long hours into the day. Do I think the &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; perfume I received was counterfeit? Seeing as how I ordered it directly through Amazon, I will go out on a limb and give them the benefit of the doubt and say no. Perhaps the ingredients were changed, and that has led to the cause of the perfume no longer living up to its name in my eyes (or nose in this case). One thing I do know for certain, I will not be purchasing this perfume again.</li>
            <li> Unless you are famliliar with the scent first. This came highly recommded by amazon folks so I purchansed it but I am not a fan. It smells like a woman 20+ years older than I. Great for a grandma though!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  I tried to buy it at several stores but was unsuccessful.  One clerk commiserated with me because she loved this fragrance also and had difficulty finding it.  Glad to find it at a reasonable price.  It was delivered in a more than timely fashion.  Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Exactly the gift I wanted to give  -- Thank goodness could find it so easily</li>
            <li> Definitely a little knock-offish. Smells sort of like Lovely, but it&#x27;s clear that other chemicals have been added. Definitely not the original Lovely by SJP scent.</li>
            <li> This scent is not a new one but it never disappoints... even my neighbor has asked what the scent is.</li>
            <li> This was a great birthday present.  Seller was spot on and the deal was good too. The product was exactly what it was supposed to be and the shipper was handled the order post haste.</li>
            <li> Mom loved it, great price!</li>
            <li> My favorite....and hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;Dept. stores only carry the latest tweeny fragrances.  I found what I like and that&#x27;s Lovely.</li>
            <li> Awesome  , very light smell , perfect perfume for women. Worth buying it . I am going to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Smelled great and came in a very fashionable amount of time without doing express mail. Gave it as a gift and the person loved it!</li>
            <li> I always make sure I have a bottle of this around. I love it for all occasions. It&#x27;s great from first spray all the way to the dry down. I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. She loves it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume.</li>
            <li> Great price for a perfume, smells a lot more &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; than what it costs....I get compliments on it all the time and my mom steals some every time she&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li> excellent. I purchased it for my mother. it was delivered earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFUMES, SOFT ENOUGH TO BE JUST RIGHT.....AWESOME PERFUME.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this fragrance to be good and to me it was not. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not nice smell. I wonder why people give it so high rating.</li>
            <li> Smells great for an hour or so but as many reviews it doesn&#x27;t last and after a few months the smell itself changed , vs higher end perfume its not great. Wife won&#x27;t wear it and the bottle is almost full</li>
            <li> The most incredible thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled on a woman.</li>
            <li> Admired this on a stranger...shocked when she said it was SJP Lovely.  Difficult to find.  Unique fragrance...reminiscent of French scents not found in the US.  My new favorite.</li>
            <li> Got it for mom, she loves the scent.  Only complaint is that she says the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Out of my whole perfume collection, and I have many....this is my favorite. This fragrance is super light and smells so lovely. You really have to smell it for yourself. It is what a woman should smell like. Not too strong at all. I have Daisy by Marc Jacobs and I barely wear it anymore (too commercial). Among my favorites are Ralph Lauren Blue and Dolce And Gabbana Light Blue. My favorite new signiture scent. I don&#x27;t think I will ever switch. I finally found a fragrance I love after years and years of time and money spent searching..</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents. Very light and not overwhelming! I have allergies and some scents cause me to have asthma attack. I haven&#x27;t had any problems wearing Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker.</li>
            <li> This pefume has a wonderful light smell. I like the way it last and last almost all day.</li>
            <li> i was struggling for a vday gift, i bought one at a local dept store for $80, amazon couldn&#x27;t 2nd day this b/c it&#x27;s liquid.  I returned this one to the store and the barcodes matched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there were two barcoes and while the UPC was the same the second barcode was a different color and differnet number of numeric digits.  Amazon.com, not second hand sellers, sells lots of fake cologne as real, but this one served my purposes just fine.  thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> Great every day fragrance, perfect for spring.</li>
            <li> Beautiful light fragrance, not overwhelming. I can&#x27;t wear heavy fragrances because they give me a headache, this is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much,&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift online as this is getting tough to find at retailers.  Was afraid it might be a knockoff because of the price, but it appears to be just the same as the retailers sell.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and delivered right on time!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  Light, clean scent and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.  Lots of people have asked what I&#x27;m wearing...in a god way.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews. I think this is a smell that fits an older person maybe 50&#x27;s or so. The posts didn&#x27;t imply that but it is definitely a &#x27;mature scent&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Boy did I score some points with this stuff , She likes it because a little goes a long way and it last eight plus hours Good stuff .. I am now out of the Dog house</li>
            <li> Love the scent , so fresh! Been spraying it on for over a decade.  Doesn&#x27;t last all day, but can always spray more on!</li>
            <li> I was trying to be sneaky and asking my mom what kind of gift she would want, when she casually mentioned that she had just run out of her #1 favorite perfume, \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; by Sarah Jessica Parker. I went ahead and ordered some on Amazon for her for Christmas. She was *so* happy! Then I actually SMELLED the stuff and I get it! Haha. It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent, really memorable - soft, not overwhelming, but not too weak at the same time. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it was okay.  Not the best.</li>
            <li> good price, delivered quickly. very happy with my purchase. this is the second time I ordered this and I am happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Mother because she can&#x27;t find it anywhere (it&#x27;s discontinued).  It came in a sealed box (without the SJP seal).  There was no fabric ring around the neck of the bottle and the color of the perfume appeared a different color.  The scent is quite close.  Though, I do question if this is an authentic product or a knock-off.</li>
            <li> Have worn this fragrance for years and always get lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Soft and Lovely scent!.  Best price EVER on Amazon!</li>
            <li> i dont no wat the problem was but this was NOT the true Lovely.  the scent is hardly noticeable - it appears to be water.</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is really nice. It is light and floral. However, it definitely doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. I enjoy the scent when I first put it on, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments on it because it doesn&#x27;t last, even when I spray extra.</li>
            <li> Everyone compliments me when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Sarah Jessica Parker did a great job at labeling this perfume, it literally smells lovely.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a couple of years and it is my go to perfume.  It is a soft, pleasant smell and not strong smelling ----and it lasts a long time.  I also like her Covet perfume too.  I really didn&#x27;t think her perfume would smell as good as it does, I figured it was just another celebrity hawking a new product.  I would buy this even if it were not associated with her.</li>
            <li> this perfume has a nice floral fragrance. not heavy, very cleanr refreshing and a little herbal. i get copliments a lot</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift for mother&#x27;s day and my wife loves it.  The gift that gives back as I like the way my wife smells when she wears it.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing on my girlfriend...was a little hesitant to buy it not knowing what it smelled like but now its her favorite perfume</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t over-power me or people around me.  I am often asked what I am wearing.  People love it too! I was purchasing it at Macy&#x27;s and then Kohl&#x27;s and they both have discontinued it.  I then went to Amazon.com and I was thrilled to be able to purchase it with you.</li>
            <li> not fan of smell. smell doesn&#x27;t last for a long time</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent and as of late, I can only find it online.  I was pleased with the speed in which the item was shipped and it came to me exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on ordering from this vendor again in the future as i was 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice classic fresh and floral scent that lasts and lasts. To me, there are strong floral notes top and end notes that feel very fresh, sophisticated, and feminine. Not so overwhelming that it is offensive, or too mature, but the scent has enough weight to work year round. Normally I am a sweet, fruit, clean or citrusy person, but this is a great floral/clean and if you are looking for a new type of scent to try this is a great one to bridge to. For what it&#x27;s worth, my vanity favorites are currently Juicy Couture, Chanel no 5 Premeire, Coco Chanel, Miss Dior, and J&#x27;Adore. This is a great perfume and an excellent value, it lasts long like a very high end bottle is also very pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance because it is light and smells pretty.  It is a favorite of mine that fits with who I am.  Sweet and soft and light.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it!  I only wish the lotion was still available.  If you can ever locate that, get it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favority pefumes.  It has a very light not over powering smell.  I love it .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for close to 10 years now. I don&#x27;t plan on stopping anytime soon. My fiancee LOVES this smell on me so much, he is always happy with purchasing me a new bottle when I run out! I just LOVE it! Fragrance is lightly layered with flowers and hint of chocolate.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances. It lasts throughout the day and not much is required. I also love that it&#x27;s sold in this small size. I&#x27;m buying several to share with my special friends.Not a huge bottle of perfume but for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> smells great she realy loves it thank you</li>
            <li> I got soap in a bottle of what is supposted to be Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker&lt;br /&gt;This is a rip off. An item that is not returnable be aware</li>
            <li> Lovely smells great, my friends say I smell great. My dad says he smells patchouli undertones. I only wish it would last a bit longer. It smells very faint after 5 hours or so. I didnt care for the smell out of the bottle, but when its on for more than five minutes its great! This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I have used Lovely for a few years and loved it. This purchase is awful, there is no snell. The packaging and bottle look the same but contents not the same. Its like a knock off of the real thing.</li>
            <li> But not great either. It has actually grown on me since I first got this perfume. I decided from the get go that I would wear it consistently and give it a fair chance, so after about 2 weeks or so of wear now I am finding that I do like the scent much better than I did at first. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I find that some days the scent has disappeared after a couple hours and then other days I notice it more often all day long and even into the evening. I haven&#x27;t gotten on comment on it at all, not good or bad so I&#x27;m assuming it doesn&#x27;t stand out too much either way. For the amount and the price, I&#x27;d say overall it was a good purchase. However, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Great price and great perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time we have ordered from this perfume.  Never been disappointed!  Smells great and what a great price!</li>
            <li> My Mom&#x27;s favorite.  Was thrilled to find it on Amazon after searching the department stores.  Light, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> The scent is ok. I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again though. I brought the Dawn by SJP and I like that one better</li>
            <li> This has a very soft smell to it. It&#x27;s not over powering and it tends to linger in the air just a bit to let you know she was there. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume because it can feel (smell) sophisticated and fun all at once!</li>
            <li> I ordered a few bottles of perfume and 1 was not filled, probably leaked out, when I massaged them they were very accommodating and will definitely order my favorite perfumes from them in the future.  They had good prices on my favorites. Great Company!  Delivery was Great, too!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle perfect for summer time light and very pretty scent</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even as strong as the Lovely body spray for half the cost. I feel like its an irregular item.  There&#x27;s hardly even a scent to it. Might as well wear nothing at all!!!</li>
            <li> Love it my daughter had and I had it have it Love it</li>
            <li> I usually give this to my wife because it has a very good smell. We love how the smell stays and it smells good even if she is has already sweat a little or exposed to the heat.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is absolutely wonderful! It is full and rich and warm and elegant</li>
            <li> Lovely! That&#x27;s the perfect name for this fragrance. So glad I tried it! I Have recieved numerous compliments when I wear &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34;. Not to strong &amp; it smells like fresh flowers after the rain :D</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived early!!  My sister was very surprised!!</li>
            <li> My life has changed and it was time to throw out my old perfume. New life, new perfume.:) With that being said it was really hard to find a perfume that wasn&#x27;t overwhelming in it&#x27;s scent. Lovely is the perfect choice.  I hesitated buying perfume online without smelling it. So I went to the reviews and they were right! Lovely, is light, with multiple layers of scent. It can be worn anytime. The best confirmation? EVERYONE has asked what I am wearing. This is perfect for me &amp; anyone who chooses to wear this. Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> It was a birthday gift for my sister and she is very pleased. I had it shipped to her home in Florida.</li>
            <li> Love It!!&lt;br /&gt;I got compliments all the time for this one. When my other ones are over which i don&#x27;t like that much I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Gift for daughter-in-law for Christmas.</li>
            <li> My first time ordering perfume on the internet. It came very quickly, got a large bottle for a great cost, and I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this pefume, this is the second time I am buying it. Great value for money. Just picked at 24 USD.</li>
            <li> I love it! It smells good and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I am almost 52 years old and have worn perfume most every single day of my life since 3rd grade.  In all that time, I&#x27;ve developed several favorites but could never find a signature smell.  Ever.  I&#x27;ve tried but I could never tie myself to just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But today I received my bottle of Lovely.  omg.  I love it.  Immediately I became worried that they will stop making it and feel like I need to order about 5 of these and just keep them in the refrigerator!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is hard to describe but there is something so feminine and wonderful about it.  Makes me want to keep smelling my hand where I sprayed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While at the mall, I tried Modern Muse and to me, these smell a lot alike.  Modern Muse cost more than 4 times what Lovely does, so I think I&#x27;ll stick with Lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Jessica Parker, please do not stop making this!!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is actually lovely like the name and it last longer evn aftr hours of having it on you</li>
            <li> My two great Aunts&#x27; apartment had this very same scent throughout each room, except the kitchen with the aroma of good Italian cooking. So when SJP came out with Lovely and first tried it this brought me back to those days spent in SoHo. Love love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wore this on my wedding day back in 2005 which is my husband&#x27;s favorite and my signature perfume that I wear everyday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is getting harder and harder to find in stores so whenever I can I purchase a bottle or two.</li>
            <li> Waste of money...I&#x27;m disappointed with this product....definitely I would say this is cheap quality and duplicate one...really I hate this product</li>
            <li> I never get the perfume, not if it was the fault of the seller or amazon, but never get the perfume. I get a box with the order number and some things were coming dog inside. something completely different to what I had ordered. hize the complaint and sent me a new package but with an order that I had arrived. bad organization</li>
            <li> Not most favorite but like at night after ready for bed and clean smelling smell. I just may never order again</li>
            <li> I have had this item before and my wife loves it&lt;br /&gt;So I bought it for her She was appreciative</li>
            <li> A little like big spray...</li>
            <li> One of favorite fragrances for years!  I get so many compliments when I wear this and I always keep an extra bottle on hand.  Soft, refreshing fragrance but definitely detectable.</li>
            <li> This smells AMAZING. Very feminine and i fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was not sure of this scent for the first 20 minutes after the initial spray - but as the perfume dried down it became more pleasant the longer I had it on.  Now I am sold on this scent.  Very feminine and soft, is a fragrance that is one of those you can&#x27;t put your finger on - like what is that great smell but yet you can&#x27;t really put it into words...  Will buy this fragrance again, it really grows on you... received my items on time and in perfect condition!!  mo911</li>
            <li> It meet my expectations. It&#x27;s a great perfume with a spring freshness. Great service and delivered on time. Just for Mother&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> This is huge! My favorite purfume</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SCENT.  IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t stand the scent.  It smells like bubble bath that we used as kids many years ago.  Beware that if you do not like a perfume product, there is no return to Amazon.  They dub it as a &amp;#34;hazardous material.&amp;#34;  Wonder how they shipped it through the mail????</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Have worn it for years. It&#x27;s clean and soft. People always tell me I smell &amp;#34;really good&amp;#34;, not &amp;#34;what perfume are you wearing?&amp;#34;  I am I nurse and I can even wear it to work. Love it SJP!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and what a great deal!  I&#x27;ve used it for several years now and would recommend it to friends</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter-in-law for her birthday&lt;br /&gt;She loves this perfume, it was a great deal and match&lt;br /&gt;I also got a small purse size, to go with it</li>
            <li> Shipment was quick and I was excited about that. However, this perfume smells horrible and old. I do not believe this is the real product. All I want to do is trade-in for something else. I am completely disappointed. I just received this today and within a few minutes of spraying it, I boxed it right back up and ready to ship out of here. Hopefully, I can replace with something else.</li>
            <li> I thing is not the originaly</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect the bottle to be that big which is only a big plus, as for the scent... not really my thing. It&#x27;s not sweet and girly, but more mature perfume that has a subtle fresh scent. It definitely will last you long, when it first came I sprayed a little bit on my hand then when I washed my hands with soap I still could smell it.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite fragrance! I love how it smells on me and you can&#x27;t get it any cheaper anywhere else!</li>
            <li> My husband gifted this. Me no like.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite perfume.  It is light and engaging but not at all cloying.  I think this would be appealing to many age groups.  It does not smell like candy, nor is it &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Luv it!! Last all day.</li>
            <li> Love it, one of my favorites!!  Excellent pricing and service, thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased Lovely for myself and i must admit it smells LOVELY! What makes it even better it stays on until u wash it off.I love it</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great on my woman.  Mmmmmmm.....</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s just lovely!  Tried to buy it again at a department store, and they didn&#x27;t offer it.  This is a clean, clear, and mellow scent.</li>
            <li> As a non-perfume wearer that decided to take a chance after reading all the reviews, I can tell you that I am 100% satisfied with my purchase!  The scent lasts all day and after the initial spray the scent is not overpowering but very feminine and pleasant.  My fianc&amp;eacute; even really likes it and he has never been a fan of perfumes because of how strong most of them are.  I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Soft and fresh always get a lot so compliments on what I&#x27;m wearing, used this since it 1st came out wished they made a powder!!</li>
            <li> Tis truly lovely. Only negative is that the scent does not last as long as a stronger scent might.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 and I love this scent. I&#x27;ve used it off and on since I was 20 and it never gets old. It smells so good and it lasts all day without respraying. It&#x27;s a clean, elegant scent and I always get compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it. Plus the price is affordable!</li>
            <li> Love it. Amazon has by far a better deal price wise,  compared to the local stores.  The perfumes I priced were smaller for more money.  I mean &amp;#34;really&amp;#34;, you&#x27;d have to be blind not to see the better deal.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when i ordered it. It had many positive reviews and i thought i&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed with the perfume. It smelled like grass and alcohol and vomit, all at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly urge against buying  this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly. &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; scent!</li>
            <li> Thank you. Super fast shipping. Great price!</li>
            <li> I love it smells great,my order was prompt and packaged great</li>
            <li> not much to say but i like how it smells on her and she really likes it too, said its her favorite parfume now.</li>
            <li> everething was excelent, the product is very good&lt;br /&gt;its good smell and good quality&lt;br /&gt;the price was  very good&lt;br /&gt;is Sara Jessica</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and the smell is so light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I honestly find this perfume too strong and it&#x27;s ment for older women. This perfume reminds me of a grandma&#x27;s perfume it&#x27;s not mentioned for younger girls i gave it to my mom in law.</li>
            <li> Timeless scent.  Hard to find perfume.  Hope it&#x27;s not discontinued.  Bought six.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite scent!! I wear it all the time!</li>
            <li> I love Lovely!  Have used it for several years. A light scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower those around you like some. Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite go to perfume and the price was great</li>
            <li> All these colognes are fake, the bottles looks nothing like the real thing, smells absolutely nothing like the real thing &amp; I do mean &amp;#34;NOTHING&amp;#34; &amp; worst of all the scent doesn&#x27;t even last for a good ten minutes. All they do is take your money &amp; rip u off by deceiving customers telling them their stuff is authentic when it&#x27;s all fakes &amp; knock offs. DO NOT BUY cause ur gonna be so pissed off. I had to give this a 1 star rating just to post my review but in reality y&#x27;all deserve a jail cell cause that&#x27;s where y&#x27;all should be.</li>
            <li> My favorite on the one i LOVE.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent... Soft yet the right amount to stay on you even til the next morning.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume based on other rave reviews.  Let me just clarify, I&#x27;m not a perfume snob but I do expect the perfume to: 1) smell good and 2) last for at least 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume failed the test.  While it smells fresh and floral (with a hint of spice) the scent disappears after 15 minutes.  For some, that may suit them perfectly.  But for me, in the hot humid summer, I need something stronger and that will last so that I can at least smell fresh even if I don&#x27;t feel like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fine if you plan to stay home and can re-spritz, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and had never even smelled it. It was a wonderful hit with the wife. I was surprised that it was as enjoyable to smell as I could have expected.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells nice and is moderately priced. It&#x27;s a great addition to perfume collection, or a nice inexpensive gift.</li>
            <li> The delivary time was exactly as it was stated on my invoice!</li>
            <li> I thought this perfume was the real thing. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m very disappointed. This is a bad knock-off.</li>
            <li> EXCELLANT, LOVELY PURFUME!</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to a lot of smells, but this one got lots of reviews and now I can give it a thumbs up also.  It does smell nice and my wife and I both like it.</li>
            <li> I doubt that is this original? Persist for some minutes I guess.</li>
            <li> Be careful ordering things that can not be returned this stuff is awful.&lt;br /&gt;It really stinks and I couldn&#x27;t even scrub it off my arm where I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I washed with soap and still smelt if for hours it was making me nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am stuck with two bottles of this stuff. &#x3D;( Very unhappy shopper</li>
            <li> Once I started using Lovely I couldn&#x27;t stop.  I adore it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new lighter parfum to wear to work. After reading several reviews I ordered this to try. It smells \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; because its not heavy or too light. This scent last all day on me and I love the bottle.</li>
            <li> one of my all-time favorite fragrances in my adult life to date. i love this scent. when i use it it combines well my skin and lasts for many hours. it is soft, subtle, and almost a bit seductive.</li>
            <li> this perfume has very musky smell to it. I personally don&#x27;t like the way it smells. No offense to the elderly but i feel like the perfume would be more suitable for more mature women.  I prefer something fresh, floral and clean.  I might re-gift this since i can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> This perfume was a gift the scent it so pleasantly soft and alluring. My sisters favorite for everyday wear. Highly recommend this for those looking for something that&#x27;s not too bold but will still set you aside from the crowd. The perfume came brand new and you can&#x27;t beat how fast shipping is with Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> Although I received this item ahead of schedule, it seems diluted.  The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last after the initial minute or two and I never receive comments from anyone saying they can smell any fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> product is as advertised...however, the box wasn&#x27;t sealed and the glass bottle appears slightly smudged/dirty as if it was sitting out or handled frequently prior to being boxed and sold. Otherwise, the product is acceptable and smells authentic.</li>
            <li> This is not Amazon&#x27;s problem, as I received the same great service from Amazaon.  However, I have been wearing this fragrance for years.  I don&#x27;t believe they are making the same formula.  It has a different smell from before...</li>
            <li> Love! My second purchase of this!</li>
            <li> Only takes a couple spritzes because its  strong at first but when it settles it&#x27;s very nice!! Pleased with this purchase &amp; would  order it again!</li>
            <li> 1 of 2 colognes my wife wears.Can,&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Not too strong which I personally like -- but the scent stays -- which I also like!</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fast delivery, I love this perfume! This stuff smells great on my woman. My fave and it&#x27;s hard to find!! Great price too!! Fast shipping, product as expected. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, the bottle is all scratched up. It says new, but it looks like its been handled a lot. The perfume smells NOTHING like I remember. It smells like a cheap, dollar store version of something. It gave me a headache just wearing it! Very disappointed that I can&#x27;t return this. I guess I&#x27;ve learned my lesson on buying perfume from Amazon. Hopefully, I can give it to someone so it&#x27;s not a total waste.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I have been using it for about 4 years and get many compliments on it. I use only this.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this hard to find perfume</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and priced fairly good</li>
            <li> Lovely as always (no pun intended) and fabulous delivery time Great price, too.</li>
            <li> Always an awesome scent while transitioning from summer to fall!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS PERFUME... I wear it everyday to work and since it was gifted by my husband its very very special to me.&lt;br /&gt;Its light and crisp and very refreshing :)&lt;br /&gt;A must buy.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my lovely purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother and she loved it. She wears it almost everyday and hasn&#x27;t made a dent in the amount left.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent! Light &amp; refreshing. Every time I wear it I get compliments.</li>
            <li> It was nice. Poor shipping experience, but I made this purchase a year ago and situations may have changed. This is definitely not a unisex fragrance at all. It has a strong apple martini flair to me. I feel like a man can wear this as men and women can make any choices they like but it&#x27;s definitely going to have a fruity flair to it. Not something to wear to a military formal or some other conservative male event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For women, this is a LOVELY work fragrance! It&#x27;s entirely unoffensive... like you&#x27;d have to be a pregnant version of whoever shot Bambi&#x27;s mom to be put off by this fragrance. It&#x27;s not as if it&#x27;s the best smelling thing EVER (Dior EDP in the blue bottle is) but it&#x27;s ... it&#x27;s definitely quite nice and polite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a date night scent at all. Tbh a man probably won&#x27;t smell this on you unless you bathe in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a couple of compliments but nothing too major. Lasting power is alright, nothing to be worried about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price? The professional 20 something just entering the corporate scene and realizing &amp;#34;OMG I need to smell like a lady around these people if I ever want to make decent money and get a damn office!&amp;#34; but not wanting/being able to realistically shell out on niche fragrances or that Jo malone crap... you can&#x27;t beat this stuff. The BEST you can get for this amount of money. It&#x27;s just not the BEST out there (I mean have you SMELLED ramon monegal?!).</li>
            <li> Very fast..love this perfume! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Love this &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; fragrance and also the quickness of the shipping by this seller.  A+++++++</li>
            <li> Amazing fragrance !!  It&#x27;s my favorite perfume and it&#x27;s discontinued in the local department store ere in my city.  I was excited to find it on Amazon.com!!  Try it.........I think you&#x27;ll LOVE it....that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Lovely.&amp;#34;  :o)!</li>
            <li> simply great! got so so so many compliments. this is the best among lot of perfumes i have used.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this highly</li>
            <li> Get many compliments about this perfume. Not overly strong, very clean scent.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores. Wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Prompt service, great price, and exactly what we ordered........gets no better than that!......bw</li>
            <li> Lovely is always &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; to wear.  My go-to fragrance.</li>
            <li> Lovely indeed!!! This perfume really smells nice. I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> A new fragrance for my wife I wanted to contrast with her other perfumes.</li>
            <li> As expected. Very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a classy scent that is fresh yet feminine.  I bought this for my wife who is a mother of 5 and in her early 30s and she loves it.  She is now on her 2nd bottle.  The scent is not overpowering and can be worn both during the day or in the evenings.  It&#x27;s really a charming scent.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and that is all that matters to me!</li>
            <li> I adore this scent! It&#x27;s so light and airy and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like other perfumes do. Countless people stop and ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing and when I say, &amp;#34;Lovely,&amp;#34; they say, &amp;#34;Yes, it is!&amp;#34; No one has ever said they didn&#x27;t like it. Usually I have to switch my perfume after about a year as it starts to bother me but this one never has and I&#x27;ve been wearing it since 2005 when it first came out. I highly recommend it if you want a light scent.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price and very speedy service.  I will reorder this without a doubt.  I recomend this site and product.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This scent is not even close to what I thought I was purchasing. Apparently it smells very different depending on what environment you are in. At home, this scent is overpowering and gives me a headache. I don&#x27;t even want to think of wearing it again. To make matters worse, Amazon will let not let you return it! Try it out at many locations before purchasing from Amazon.</li>
            <li> gift for daughter and she enjoyed it</li>
            <li> nO BIG THRILL, TRY TAYLOR SWIFT&#x27;S SCENT.</li>
            <li> I have gotten tons of compliments when I&#x27;ve worn this to work and even over my boyfriends family&#x27;s house. It&#x27;s so soft and delicate, others have mentioned that it smells unique - and I totally agree. There are tons of perfumes that carry floral notes but none quite like this. It&#x27;s become one of my favorite perfumes! I&#x27;ve used this for about three months and i&#x27;m 3/4 through the bottle, and wear this at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> This particular scent is very clean, fresh, light and wonderful for a hot summer day. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume for all occasions.  It has a nice light scent, and I wear it often.  Bought it so my husband could give it too me for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter every year for Christmas.  Its her favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this for years online. My last two purchases through eBay were bogus and fraudulent.  My complaints to eBay went unresolved.  I received my LOVELY purchase today through Amazon and I could not be more pleased.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Was old smelled like vinegar when sprayed on disappointed</li>
            <li> I love the clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Such a nice fresh fragrance. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it again.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; fragrance for ages 18 to 100&lt;br /&gt;pleasant and lasts for several hours&lt;br /&gt;use alone or layer with LOVELY body lotion</li>
            <li> I would consider Lovely my all time classic scent that I wear.  I received this as a gift many years ago and once I ran out, I new I had to order it again!  The smell literally lasts all day.  This scent has nice, musky undertones that work well with your skin chemistry without smelling powdery.  Every single time I wear this I get compliments!  This is a nice, large bottle that prices about 25% lower than the department store asks.  Pair that with fast shipping and why would you bother with the department stores?  Recommend this perfume to anyone who wants to smell Lovely.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This must be fake. The first smell is great and does smell like “lovely,&amp;#34; but a second later it leaves a terrible after smell of a french old lady&#x27;s perfume. More upsetting is that it arrived open (without the sealed wrapping), looks like as if it was a return of another costumer which they resent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware!!</li>
            <li> Very affordable, lovely smell for the summer, bottle sprays a lot at once, and some gets on your finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it without testing, only because it was the first perfume in the collection, and it must be good since people are still buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to spend +$100 on a scent from the designers when they basically smell as good as \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot;.</li>
