            <li>need this in bubbles,soaking is a great way to relax and I so enjoy my baths ,salt will dry your skin</li>
            <li>MOST OF TIME.THEY GET PRETTY</li>
            <li>Great smell for a long evening bath before bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product smells clean not medicine like which makes it relaxing to use every night and not just when you are sore from working out.</li>
            <li>and you come out smelling sweet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see it as sensual, but the smell is amazing and very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I was wanting to like these salts due to the good reviews, but they aren&#x27;t pleasant smelling and have a pungent odor that smells synthetic and medical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is great, it is not overwhelming, just good enough!.</li>
            <li>I bought several of the Dr. Teal&#x27;s epson salt versions and this one is particularly nice.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft,  it has a lovely fragrance and bathing in it</li>
            <li>Price is right too..</li>
            <li>I bought it as an add-on, which was the right price.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing fragrance, just cannot get enough of this new kind.</li>
            <li>and it is nice to smell a soft scent while sitting back relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I love this Amber Vanilla Epsom Soaking Salt for a long bath before bed.  </li>
            <li>it really will knock you out before bed time if you have any achey muscles or cramps</li>
            <li>so the whole box reeked of it, including the groceries I had ordered too.</li>
            <li>(hope this is not too much information folks) and draws out some of his aches and pains in a cupful to 1 tub dilution.</li>
            <li>THESE EPSOM SALT ARE VERY FRAGRANT AND SOOTHING</li>
            <li>Reasonable buy with my Prime membership.</li>
            <li>When you actually soak for the recommended 20 minutes (which is actually quite a while), you do really feel better and your pains do too.</li>
            <li>I love it in my hot tub, but not sure I should be putting it in there??</li>
            <li>I tried the Epsom Salt Soaking solution using 1 cup of the scented plus 1 cup of the plain (also Dr. Teal&#x27;s) plus 1 cup of baking soda (for my hard water), and it is the perfect level of fragrance for me.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it~</li>
            <li>This product is such a reasonable price for such a high quality item!!!</li>
            <li>Really does give that sensual romantic feel.</li>
            <li>I found the no-name brand they sell at the local drugstores did not dissolve very well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first bag at a local retail store and used it in the bath, Ladies I can not use bubble bath so this is very different.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended especially for the stay at home mom.</li>
            <li>I like using them in a bath after a workout - it makes working out sore muscles seem a bit more \\&quot;spa\\&quot; and a little less \\&quot;physical therapy.\\&quot;</li>

            <li> The scent lasts a long time, even a day after a bath, and as always it works well for achy muscles.</li>

            <li> Plan on a long soak in the tub the aroma and the way your skin and body feels after a soak with this product will make you a believer, you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> I tried this scent just to have something a little different</li>
            <li> SO MUCH BETTER.GREAT FOR TIRED ACHY</li>
            <li> How well should a chemical mixture be expected to  perform?</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal has other fragranced epsom salts too.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, hate the price.</li>
            <li> Whatever it smelled like wasn&#x27;t anything I would subject myself to on purpose.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes in a soak, the smell does die down.</li>
            <li> It does amalgamate with conventional soap into small visible clumps, so soaping up after soaking a while is this reviewer&#x27;s suggestion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks because I read epson salt helps with sore muscles.</li>
            <li> It was recommended that I take Epsom Salt soaks after bodywork or for just plain achy muscles.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately between the regular cost and the shipping charge, I won&#x27;t be buying this again unless the it is an add-on again.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find an epson salt that doesn&#x27;t smell like it belongs in a gym locker.</li>
            <li> I use this after a hard workout at the gym</li>
            <li> The artificial fragrance is unbearable.  </li>

            <li> This product smells clean not medicine like which makes it relaxing to use every night and not just when you are sore from working out.</li>
            <li> The Dr. Teal&#x27;s epsom salts have always been a go-to brand for me for sore feet or back. I tried this scent just to have something a little different and it was really nice! The scent lasts a long time, even a day after a bath, and as always it works well for achy muscles.</li>
            <li> I love to take baths in epson salt. It is hard to find an epson salt that doesn&#x27;t smell like it belongs in a gym locker. I soak in this daily for a shoulder injury. Smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out. Dr. Teal has other fragranced epsom salts too. I like all of the scents. Price is right too..</li>
            <li> This is great for aches and pains you can just soak them away with a lovely fragrance!!! i love this stuff it really will knock you out before bed time if you have any achey muscles or cramps it will do a good job!!</li>
            <li> I have told my family and friends about this product. It is so aromatic and relaxing. I love Dr. Teal&#x27;s  products.</li>
            <li> So over-powering.  The artificial fragrance is unbearable.  It broke open in transit so the whole box reeked of it, including the groceries I had ordered too.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great, it is not overwhelming, just good enough!. The salt itself is relaxing. Love all the products of Dr. Teal&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this Amber Vanilla Epsom Soaking Salt for a long bath before bed.  Helps me relax, both physically and mentally.  I get out of the tub and into bed feeling all silky soft and sleeping delightful.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing aroma! Fabulous lingering scent on the skin. Really does give that sensual romantic feel. Highly recommended especially for the stay at home mom.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of all of these! I don&#x27;t really see it as sensual, but the smell is amazing and very relaxing. When you actually soak for the recommended 20 minutes (which is actually quite a while), you do really feel better and your pains do too. I&#x27;ve found that when I leave the tub before the 20 minutes are up, though I feel some relief it isn&#x27;t at it&#x27;s maximum.</li>
            <li> The greatest line of relaxing bath products ever.  Every flavor is awesome.  Good size and value.  Couldn&#x27;t be a bigger fan!</li>
            <li> The fragrance of these salts are just so relaxing.  It makes me take the 20 minutes to enjoy a nice bath.  Feel great when I get out too and smell so good.</li>
            <li> I  thought  id  try this  product  out .Its amazing .I like the AMBER VANILLA SCENT.I AM ON MY FEET MOST OF TIME.THEY GET PRETTY PAINFUL.AS SOON  I USED THIS PRODUCT MY FEET FELT SO MUCH BETTER.GREAT FOR TIRED ACHY FEET.I WOULD DEFIENTLY  RECONMEND THIS PRODUCT.I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY HOPEFULLY  THERE WILL BE MORE SCENTS AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li> this is a nice scent that I haven&#x27;t found in any store.  I bought it as an add-on, which was the right price.  Unfortunately between the regular cost and the shipping charge, I won&#x27;t be buying this again unless the it is an add-on again.  Love the scent, hate the price.</li>
            <li> need this in bubbles,soaking is a great way to relax and I so enjoy my baths ,salt will dry your skin</li>
            <li> It was recommended that I take Epsom Salt soaks after bodywork or for just plain achy muscles.  I found the no-name brand they sell at the local drugstores did not dissolve very well.  Then I saw Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution in an Amber and Vanilla scent here on Amazon, and thought I would give it a shot.  I ordered the unscented and this scented version.  I tried the Epsom Salt Soaking solution using 1 cup of the scented plus 1 cup of the plain (also Dr. Teal&#x27;s) plus 1 cup of baking soda (for my hard water), and it is the perfect level of fragrance for me.  I like the fact that it lingers in the room, even after all the soaking water has gone all away.  It also dissolved perfectly in my water.  I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks because I read epson salt helps with sore muscles. it seems to be working and smells nice in the tub.</li>
            <li> This product is such a reasonable price for such a high quality item!!! So many scents to choose from. All make for a wonderful bath!</li>
            <li> There was no vanilla smell I could detect.  Whatever it smelled like wasn&#x27;t anything I would subject myself to on purpose. Used it once in foot bath - sealed the rest away in a zip lock bag before putting it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I use Epsom salts nightly in my baths. The Amber and Vanilla was heavenly. I use Dr.Teals because it comes in different scents.&lt;br /&gt;Love it !!!</li>
            <li> I use this after a hard workout at the gym and I don&#x27;t get still muscles. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> We have this product at our grocery store. I highly recommend it~ it works well and it smells amazing! one of those that you wish they made a candle of the smell. Trust me, we girls tend to steal it from each others bathrooms. xD</li>
            <li> Using this to help unwind and relax made my baths pleasurable!  The scent perfumes the entire bathroom and you come out smelling sweet.</li>
            <li> How well should a chemical mixture be expected to  perform? This stuff does; makes this reviewer smell good (hope this is not too much information folks) and draws out some of his aches and pains in a cupful to 1 tub dilution. It does amalgamate with conventional soap into small visible clumps, so soaping up after soaking a while is this reviewer&#x27;s suggestion.</li>
            <li> I look forward to soaking my feet and it is nice to smell a soft scent while sitting back relaxing.  Very relaxing fragrance, just cannot get enough of this new kind.</li>
            <li> Pamper yourself, you&#x27;ll love it.  My skin is soft,  it has a lovely fragrance and bathing in it leaves me feeling relaxed.</li>
            <li> I was wanting to like these salts due to the good reviews, but they aren&#x27;t pleasant smelling and have a pungent odor that smells synthetic and medical.</li>

            <li> Fallen in love with Dr. Teal&#x27;s epson salt.  Not too over powering of a scent, the smell isn&#x27;t cheap, good for relaxing muscles.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself for Christmas.  It has an amazing vanilla and amber smell and like how smooth my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I got to find the HEAT switch for the foot massage unit. I love it in my hot tub, but not sure I should be putting it in there?? Any answers to this sort of dalemor?</li>
            <li> Used these an a softening additive to my homemade detergent. Strong smell, but nice. Reasonable buy with my Prime membership.</li>
