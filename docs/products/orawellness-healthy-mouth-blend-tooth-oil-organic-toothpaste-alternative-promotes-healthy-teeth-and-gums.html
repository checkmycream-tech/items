            <li>Leaves everything feeling fresh and clean--a great way to get bacteria out of the mouth and have it smelling great!</li>
            <li>He said the ingredients looked good and I should keep doing whatever I was doing because everything looked great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>taste good and works well to minimize plaque on teeth.</li>
            <li>I started using Orawell Brushing Blend about a year ago and instantly loved it.</li>
            <li>The taste is good</li>
            <li>and I feel good about using something organic.</li>
            <li>The company seems down-to-earth and proud of their product with a nice web site and good videos.</li>
            <li>and she claims it&#x27;s the best product in all of her 51 years of scrubbing and using hydrogen peroxide to clean her tongue</li>
            <li>This is  a really great product for so many reasons.</li>
            <li>Finally, a healthy mouth!</li>
            <li>Also the tongue cleaner works better than anyone I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>The results are wonderful, took a couple days for me to really notice a difference, stick with it!  </li>
            <li>, this product does the job waaaay better!</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice container made of recycled products, and the oil itself is organic.</li>
            <li>The investment was so worth it!!!  </li>
            <li>Also, the best part, with my teeth being so sensitive I mostly can&#x27;t whiten my teeth, but THIS STUFF WHITENED MY TEETH.  </li>
            <li>I am fortunate to have good health but oral health was an area I was not as strong in.</li>
            <li>This is much better from an aesthetic point of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I started using Healthy Mouth Blend mid-October 2014.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>You may have to buy more than one bottle though.</li>
            <li>It may require more time...</li>
            <li>Then I began to love the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>will for sure buy again.  </li>
            <li>It grows on you. :)</li>
            <li>Check out the book Cure Tooth Decay by Ramiel Nagel for more info.</li>
            <li>Ok so I put a drop in my hand and cover my floss with this.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>it healed 2 for sure.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels better already</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff right here.</li>
            <li>and I used it twice today and love how clean my mouth feels.</li>
            <li>My husband was an easy convert.  </li>
            <li>im gonna keep up with this, add in dr christophers tooth powder, continue oil pulling, and take more green pastures fermented cod liver oil with butter!&lt;br /&gt;im winning the war!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a huge deal for me as I have tetracycline stained teeth.  </li>
            <li>Of course, if I didn&#x27;t enjoy using it</li>
            <li>- I only know what I&#x27;ve experienced - it helps, and some decay issues have been stopped in their track.</li>
            <li>90% of reviews of this stuff sound written on order.</li>
            <li>They sound like testimonials on teleshoping programme that run in the night.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Good for your mouth and natural oils.</li>
            <li>Leaves a very fresh taste without the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Every time I brush, my mouth feels fresh, clean, and healthy.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel very clean and fresh too.  </li>
            <li>Super easy.</li>
            <li>Now that I add several drops of this delicious and healthy oil to my teaspoon of coconut oil, I actually look forward to it!  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels amazingly clean after using this to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>So as I clean the floss off I dip it into the oil in my palm.</li>
            <li>I love the clove zing in my mouth and I am certain that my teeth and gums are cleaner than before.  </li>
            <li>like I had a full cleaning</li>
            <li>It has a mildly sweet and minty flavor.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I found a dentist/hygienist that are working with me on this, rather than talking me into something I don’t need nor can afford.</li>
            <li>The bass toothbrush and the tongue scraper are great, too.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like the flavor very much but my teeth felt so clean!  </li>
            <li>I was not found of the taste at first, but my teeth felt so clean after using--</li>
            <li>Great minty flavor and cleans your teeth wonderfully, no stinging like tooth paste or sensitivity of any kind.</li>
            <li>Good Product, quality I expected.....</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive teeth and gums and this product helped me.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to make my own toothpaste</li>
            <li>and I love what it does for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so natural tooth remedies always sort of freak me out.</li>
            <li>Never before did my mouth feel so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>months ago after reading about the product on one of my favorite natural living blogs.  </li>
            <li>which is rare I eat it...</li>
            <li>The toothbrush really makes a big difference and the tongue scraper is kind of cool looking.  </li>
            <li>Really makes your breath fresh!</li>
            <li>But I had pain in my lower right portion of my mouth, nothing was helping.</li>
            <li>But for right now I am using with my Perio toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It fits right in with the changes I&#x27;ve made towards a healthier lifestyle for my family.  </li>
            <li>I like the product so much that I actually brush more often!</li>
            <li>taste was not very bad.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very knowledgeable about teeth &amp; gums and work with many professionals in the industry that also recommend natural remedies.</li>
            <li>I find it’s worth it because in the long-run, any dental procedure or deep cleanings will cost much more than using this product.</li>
            <li>Brush very gently.</li>
            <li>It takes up little space, even if you&#x27;re stocking up, &amp; you can bring it with you to ensure you&#x27;re always taking good care of your teeth.</li>
            <li>3rd, I love how portable it is.</li>
            <li>This was the first one like this that I have tried.</li>
            <li>imagine not using it any more, especially now</li>
            <li>I have a before/after picture if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li>The OraWellness company (hi Will &amp; Susan!!) provide some stellar customer service too.  </li>
            <li>At first it was just me, then I shared the oil with my husband.  </li>
            <li>I could tell the difference in my mouth with the first time use.</li>
            <li>and the doctor had trouble finding a plaque sample to analyze, which I figure has got to be a good sign.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the money to have clean teeth and fresh breath and not to have to use regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I liked how this made my mouth feel so refreshed but didn&#x27;t notice any other benefit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been stuck using toothpaste for sensitive teeth for years, but was looking for a more natural product.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that it can stain teeth for certain people and there&#x27;s no way of knowing if you are one of them, until you see the staining.</li>
            <li>Once I started using the OraWellness, I naturally started brushing for several minutes and very thoroughly, I guess because of the pleasant taste and cool feeling sensation it brings to my teeth, gums and entire mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soft bristles really get in between the teeth and around the gum line to keep teeth really really clean.</li>
            <li>I can only assume it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, as my mouth is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Today (mid-January 2015), my dental hygienist said the bleeding has been greatly reduced and that there is less plaque on my back teeth!</li>
            <li>This was fine enough for a month</li>
            <li>I like how the toothbrush really gets the gum line though</li>
            <li>I keep using the product and don&#x27;t really see a difference in my gums.  </li>
            <li>This product really works if you use it as directed.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try, without too much expectation.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t really said much about changing out my toothpaste</li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot from this product after watching the videos however, I didn&#x27;t like it very much&lt;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Really eye opening.</li>
            <li>This is from a company that really cares about people and the environment.</li>
            <li>So far , after a weeks use, i can say my gums are healthier and i will be repurchasing this roduct :) i totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have teeth problems for the first time in life and I have searched high and low for alternatives - something anything - that helps keep my teeth clean, doesn&#x27;t hurt (I had a peroxide toothpaste that made me teeth ache), doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals and so on.</li>
            <li>I have a few deep pockets, and using the applicator to get in there and clean them out makes my mouth feel amazing.</li>
            <li>OraWellness also has some tools that are very helpful &amp; some that are uniquely made such as their applicator.</li>
            <li>For those who are worried about the price, I’ve found that either through their website or other independent sellers, you can often get good deals.</li>
            <li>but I definitely think and hope it will be worth it!</li>
            <li>like that it is a small and tidy bottle, which is good because my bathroom tends toward clutter, and I&#x27;ve never liked the toothpaste spills in/around the sink.  </li>
            <li>using with dental floss to clean between teeth and as a second toothpaste brightens teeth like the taste helps with gum issues.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s completely natural &amp; organic, with nothing</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li>Went back to using it and just ordered several more bottles (found a deal where you can get three for the price of two).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So all together, I feel quite normal and I am amazed by this.</li>
            <li>you can also incorporate this into your normal regimen.</li>
            <li>The feeling after brushing with this alone isn&#x27;t as fresh as with regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Taste takes a little getting used to, it is not a bad flavor, just kind of odd.  </li>
            <li>I had very sensitive gums in one quadrant and this product was recommended by a friend.  </li>
            <li>However, after using for a month or two, it completely stained my teeth!  </li>
            <li>also follow a certain diet and receive normal medical treatment for these disorders as well.</li>
            <li>There are studies showing that people with periodontal disease have a greater risk for the above illnesses plus heart disease and diabetes 2 (which luckily, I do not</li>
            <li>I have found out about oralwellness through wellness mama a natural food blogger and count me as convinced.</li>
            <li>All natural, organic way to help ensure dental health.</li>
            <li>And they never had even one sensitive day during transition.  </li>
            <li>You can mix it with water for a mouthwash, I just use a drop directly in my mouth and swish.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by what  a difference it made.  </li>
            <li>and I like that it has natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I used a complete bottle and didn&#x27;t notice any gum improvements.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that my teeth are quite as sensitive as before either.  </li>
            <li>Good product just too expensive</li>
            <li>Maybe they prefer a simple mint flavor instead of the more complex flavor of this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference other than my whole mouth feels cleaner.</li>
            <li>If I ever miss, my pain and just general malaise become quite terrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One tip is to stick with using this a couple times a day and alternate with another natural product.</li>
            <li>Buy a Bass toothbrush or two (or a whole bunch) from them too.  </li>
            <li>When used regularly, this is the real deal - my teeth feel stronger, have less sensitivity</li>
            <li>Imagine, no more messy tubes and paste spots to clean off the counter or mirror!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Now that I add several drops of this delicious and healthy oil to my teaspoon of coconut oil, I actually look forward to it!  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels amazingly clean after using this to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> So as I clean the floss off I dip it into the oil in my palm.</li>
            <li> I love the clove zing in my mouth and I am certain that my teeth and gums are cleaner than before.  </li>
            <li> like I had a full cleaning</li>
            <li> It has a mildly sweet and minty flavor.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I found a dentist/hygienist that are working with me on this, rather than talking me into something I don’t need nor can afford.</li>
            <li> The bass toothbrush and the tongue scraper are great, too.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like the flavor very much but my teeth felt so clean!  </li>
            <li> I was not found of the taste at first, but my teeth felt so clean after using--</li>
            <li> Great minty flavor and cleans your teeth wonderfully, no stinging like tooth paste or sensitivity of any kind.</li>
            <li> Good Product, quality I expected.....</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive teeth and gums and this product helped me.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to make my own toothpaste</li>
            <li> and I love what it does for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so natural tooth remedies always sort of freak me out.</li>
            <li> Never before did my mouth feel so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> months ago after reading about the product on one of my favorite natural living blogs.  </li>
            <li> which is rare I eat it...</li>
            <li> The toothbrush really makes a big difference and the tongue scraper is kind of cool looking.  </li>
            <li> Really makes your breath fresh!</li>
            <li> But I had pain in my lower right portion of my mouth, nothing was helping.</li>
            <li> But for right now I am using with my Perio toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It fits right in with the changes I&#x27;ve made towards a healthier lifestyle for my family.  </li>
            <li> I like the product so much that I actually brush more often!</li>
            <li> taste was not very bad.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very knowledgeable about teeth &amp; gums and work with many professionals in the industry that also recommend natural remedies.</li>
            <li> I find it’s worth it because in the long-run, any dental procedure or deep cleanings will cost much more than using this product.</li>
            <li> Brush very gently.</li>
            <li> It takes up little space, even if you&#x27;re stocking up, &amp; you can bring it with you to ensure you&#x27;re always taking good care of your teeth.</li>
            <li> 3rd, I love how portable it is.</li>
            <li> This was the first one like this that I have tried.</li>
            <li> imagine not using it any more, especially now</li>
            <li> I have a before/after picture if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li> The OraWellness company (hi Will &amp; Susan!!) provide some stellar customer service too.  </li>
            <li> At first it was just me, then I shared the oil with my husband.  </li>
            <li> I could tell the difference in my mouth with the first time use.</li>
            <li> and the doctor had trouble finding a plaque sample to analyze, which I figure has got to be a good sign.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth the money to have clean teeth and fresh breath and not to have to use regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I liked how this made my mouth feel so refreshed but didn&#x27;t notice any other benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been stuck using toothpaste for sensitive teeth for years, but was looking for a more natural product.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that it can stain teeth for certain people and there&#x27;s no way of knowing if you are one of them, until you see the staining.</li>
            <li> Once I started using the OraWellness, I naturally started brushing for several minutes and very thoroughly, I guess because of the pleasant taste and cool feeling sensation it brings to my teeth, gums and entire mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soft bristles really get in between the teeth and around the gum line to keep teeth really really clean.</li>
            <li> I can only assume it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, as my mouth is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Today (mid-January 2015), my dental hygienist said the bleeding has been greatly reduced and that there is less plaque on my back teeth!</li>
            <li> This was fine enough for a month</li>
            <li> I like how the toothbrush really gets the gum line though</li>
            <li> I keep using the product and don&#x27;t really see a difference in my gums.  </li>
            <li> This product really works if you use it as directed.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try, without too much expectation.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t really said much about changing out my toothpaste</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot from this product after watching the videos however, I didn&#x27;t like it very much&lt;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really eye opening.</li>
            <li> This is from a company that really cares about people and the environment.</li>
            <li> So far , after a weeks use, i can say my gums are healthier and i will be repurchasing this roduct :) i totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have teeth problems for the first time in life and I have searched high and low for alternatives - something anything - that helps keep my teeth clean, doesn&#x27;t hurt (I had a peroxide toothpaste that made me teeth ache), doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals and so on.</li>
            <li> I have a few deep pockets, and using the applicator to get in there and clean them out makes my mouth feel amazing.</li>
            <li> OraWellness also has some tools that are very helpful &amp; some that are uniquely made such as their applicator.</li>
            <li> For those who are worried about the price, I’ve found that either through their website or other independent sellers, you can often get good deals.</li>
            <li> but I definitely think and hope it will be worth it!</li>
            <li> like that it is a small and tidy bottle, which is good because my bathroom tends toward clutter, and I&#x27;ve never liked the toothpaste spills in/around the sink.  </li>
            <li> using with dental floss to clean between teeth and as a second toothpaste brightens teeth like the taste helps with gum issues.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s completely natural &amp; organic, with nothing</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> Went back to using it and just ordered several more bottles (found a deal where you can get three for the price of two).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So all together, I feel quite normal and I am amazed by this.</li>
            <li> you can also incorporate this into your normal regimen.</li>
            <li> The feeling after brushing with this alone isn&#x27;t as fresh as with regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Taste takes a little getting used to, it is not a bad flavor, just kind of odd.  </li>
            <li> I had very sensitive gums in one quadrant and this product was recommended by a friend.  </li>
            <li> However, after using for a month or two, it completely stained my teeth!  </li>
            <li> also follow a certain diet and receive normal medical treatment for these disorders as well.</li>
            <li> There are studies showing that people with periodontal disease have a greater risk for the above illnesses plus heart disease and diabetes 2 (which luckily, I do not</li>
            <li> I have found out about oralwellness through wellness mama a natural food blogger and count me as convinced.</li>
            <li> All natural, organic way to help ensure dental health.</li>
            <li> And they never had even one sensitive day during transition.  </li>
            <li> You can mix it with water for a mouthwash, I just use a drop directly in my mouth and swish.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by what  a difference it made.  </li>
            <li> and I like that it has natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I used a complete bottle and didn&#x27;t notice any gum improvements.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that my teeth are quite as sensitive as before either.  </li>
            <li> Good product just too expensive</li>
            <li> Maybe they prefer a simple mint flavor instead of the more complex flavor of this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference other than my whole mouth feels cleaner.</li>
            <li> If I ever miss, my pain and just general malaise become quite terrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One tip is to stick with using this a couple times a day and alternate with another natural product.</li>
            <li> Buy a Bass toothbrush or two (or a whole bunch) from them too.  </li>
            <li> When used regularly, this is the real deal - my teeth feel stronger, have less sensitivity</li>
            <li> Imagine, no more messy tubes and paste spots to clean off the counter or mirror!  </li>
            <li> When that happens it is a BIG let down to have to switch back to toothpaste until I can get home and get my new supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only started using it last week, but plan to be a repeat customer for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is cleaner and much less sensitive, will be ordering this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product itself is the reason or if it is the toothpaste as a whole.</li>
            <li> My gums feel healthier and are less sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long one bottle will last so my only concern would be the cost if it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> 2nd, it functions as a multipurpose product-toothpaste, mouthwash, breath freshener, can even be used for oil pulling (alone or in addition to other oil).</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just weird to get used to using an oil to clean your mouth instead of a foamy tooth paste.</li>
            <li> It made my gums pink again within 3 applications.</li>
            <li> I also recommend taking Green Pasture&#x27;s Blue Ice Royal fermented cod liver oil and butter oil blend capsules or gel.</li>
            <li> This only lasted a few days, but it got me thinking.</li>
            <li> But....after using it a few times I could see a definite difference in my teeth &amp; mouth.  </li>
            <li> Traditional brushing wears down your gums!!</li>
            <li> I’d searched for other syringes/applicator which were quit ineffective in comparison.</li>
            <li> Maybe the dental infection is what is causing the other problems.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to what it is doing for my teeth from any other standpoint</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, at first I was skeptical at the claims it made.  </li>
            <li> have noticed that the periodontal disease is much less, and my general negative symptoms from the other diseases are much less than before I started this regime.</li>
            <li> I’d consulted with a couple other dentists previously where this wasn’t the case.</li>
            <li> this after noticing THREE teeth that hurt bad as hell with anything I ate (after having my son)&lt;br /&gt;I was going to get them filled</li>
            <li> use their Bass toothbrush too, and use their \\&quot;weird\\&quot; way of brushing I found on uTube.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Bass brushes.</li>
            <li> So watch the videos about how to use the Bass toothbrush method.</li>
            <li> but it does mean that until you can afford what needs to happen next this product helps.</li>
            <li> Just a slight touch by the dental hygienist and the bleeding would start.</li>
            <li> At first I bought the regular version made in an almond oil base, and my gums became inflamed because I&#x27;m allergic to almonds but didn&#x27;t realize this product contained them.  </li>
            <li> I also put a drop into a little water and rinse with it.</li>
            <li> I feel like they are a little whiter too.  </li>
            <li> He never had trouble finding one before.  </li>
            <li> It helped my sensitivity when sensodyne was actually making it worse.  </li>
            <li> I used this for a few months in addition to homemade tooth paste and powder, and I noticed my breath improved and</li>
            <li> use babyganics kid toothpaste with a few drops of this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I got a little lazy, and I stopped using some of the blend on my toothbrush for a little while.  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and really tight areas bt my teeth, so</li>
            <li> that lately im getting tartar on my teeth half way through the day.</li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s very possible to heal myself without having to resort to expensive and sometimes harmful, surgery.</li>
            <li> I have no more pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Historically, I have always been lazy with my teeth brushing and cleaning since childhood.</li>
            <li> I hated dealing with my teeth and pretty much hated my teeth, but they feel stronger, cleaner, healthier, and look prettier after 1 month of using OraWellness Healthy Mouth Blend.  </li>
            <li> Ummm....how about hardly anyone?  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least two years.</li>
            <li> also oil pull with coconut oil as of late and it helps a ton with stains and infections etc too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now that doesn&#x27;t mean she doesn&#x27;t need to go to the dentist, and it doesn&#x27;t mean the issue doesn&#x27;t still exist -</li>
            <li> I hate normal foamy toothpaste and was looking for a healthier alternative when i bought this.</li>
            <li> Skeptical, I bought it with no expectations.  </li>
            <li> Try a bottle and you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, the dentist put a time release antibiotic plug in the two worst pockets.</li>
            <li> Also eliminates bad breath.</li>

            <li> I have been using the OraWellness blend for about a month.  Last week I had my regular dental checkup and the doctor had trouble finding a plaque sample to analyze, which I figure has got to be a good sign.  He never had trouble finding one before.  I brought the bottle for the dentist to look at.  He said the ingredients looked good and I should keep doing whatever I was doing because everything looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is a small and tidy bottle, which is good because my bathroom tends toward clutter, and I&#x27;ve never liked the toothpaste spills in/around the sink.  This is much better from an aesthetic point of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the taste quite a lot.  But my husband and kids are not fans of the taste and I cannot for the life of me figure out why.  It&#x27;s great!  What&#x27;s not to like?  Maybe they prefer a simple mint flavor instead of the more complex flavor of this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.  The bass toothbrush and the tongue scraper are great, too.  The toothbrush really makes a big difference and the tongue scraper is kind of cool looking.  Probably any tongue scraper would get the job done.  But I do like this one.</li>
            <li> Great minty flavor and cleans your teeth wonderfully, no stinging like tooth paste or sensitivity of any kind. Also eliminates bad breath. I use this instead of toothpaste and I wonder why I ever used toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I just got back from the dentist. I have been on an every-4-months cleaning schedule for years. Nothing I tried seemed to help heal my bleeding gums or reduce the plaque. Just a slight touch by the dental hygienist and the bleeding would start. Until today! I started using Healthy Mouth Blend mid-October 2014. Today (mid-January 2015), my dental hygienist said the bleeding has been greatly reduced and that there is less plaque on my back teeth! This is amazing! The product is making a difference in the health of my teeth, gums, and mouth. Of course, if I didn&#x27;t enjoy using it I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it and then I&#x27;d be back where I started. I like the product so much that I actually brush more often! Brushing more often PLUS using this wonderful product is a win-win! I&#x27;m also going to start using a drop on my floss and work to improve my flossing habit! Finally, a healthy mouth!</li>
            <li> I just received mine in the mail today and I used it twice today and love how clean my mouth feels. I have a few deep pockets, and using the applicator to get in there and clean them out makes my mouth feel amazing. It tastes great, it&#x27;s just weird to get used to using an oil to clean your mouth instead of a foamy tooth paste. I like how the toothbrush really gets the gum line though and I cannot wait to see if it lessens the pocket levels. Also the tongue cleaner works better than anyone I&#x27;ve ever used! The product over all was pricey but I definitely think and hope it will be worth it! So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good product just too expensive</li>
            <li> Great product, my teeth and mouth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least two years. I have no pain in my mouth, no bleeding, nothing but cleaner, whiter teeth and fresher breath. I  have also purchased the toothbrushes.The soft bristles really get in between the teeth and around the gum line to keep teeth really really clean. Seriously,my teeth almost always feel like they used to feel after a cleaning at the dentist. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I keep using the product and don&#x27;t really see a difference in my gums.  This product is supposed to make them stronger.  I don&#x27;t see it at all.  I have an update:  it does lighten the teeth though!  That&#x27;s a great thing but the cost to do this!!!</li>
            <li> Good Product, quality I expected.....</li>
            <li> At first I bought the regular version made in an almond oil base, and my gums became inflamed because I&#x27;m allergic to almonds but didn&#x27;t realize this product contained them.  I bought the nut-free version and I love it.  It helped my sensitivity when sensodyne was actually making it worse.  It&#x27;s so worth the money to have clean teeth and fresh breath and not to have to use regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I have found out about oralwellness through wellness mama a natural food blogger and count me as convinced. The taste is something one has to get used to. It made my gums pink again within 3 applications. I have the most sensitive teeth and gums and this product helped me. I will update in the future to see if my progress continues.</li>
            <li> This is  a really great product for so many reasons. First, it&#x27;s completely natural &amp; organic, with nothing toxic added (provided you&#x27;re not allergic). 2nd, it functions as a multipurpose product-toothpaste, mouthwash, breath freshener, can even be used for oil pulling (alone or in addition to other oil). Plus it helps heal your mouth. 3rd, I love how portable it is. It takes up little space, even if you&#x27;re stocking up, &amp; you can bring it with you to ensure you&#x27;re always taking good care of your teeth. OraWellness has excellent customer service. Often the owners themselves reply to emails &amp; questions. They&#x27;re very knowledgeable about teeth &amp; gums and work with many professionals in the industry that also recommend natural remedies. I&#x27;ve been studying their website, youtube videos, etc. and am feeling like it&#x27;s very possible to heal myself without having to resort to expensive and sometimes harmful, surgery. Luckily I found a dentist/hygienist that are working with me on this, rather than talking me into something I don’t need nor can afford. I’d consulted with a couple other dentists previously where this wasn’t the case. OraWellness also has some tools that are very helpful &amp; some that are uniquely made such as their applicator. I’d searched for other syringes/applicator which were quit ineffective in comparison. For those who are worried about the price, I’ve found that either through their website or other independent sellers, you can often get good deals. You may have to buy more than one bottle though. I find it’s worth it because in the long-run, any dental procedure or deep cleanings will cost much more than using this product. One tip is to stick with using this a couple times a day and alternate with another natural product.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels amazingly clean after using this to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to make my own toothpaste and I used this as an ingredient. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference other than my whole mouth feels cleaner. I&#x27;m not sure if this product itself is the reason or if it is the toothpaste as a whole. Overall I like the product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very fresh taste without the chemicals. Not sure how long one bottle will last so my only concern would be the cost if it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Leaves everything feeling fresh and clean--a great way to get bacteria out of the mouth and have it smelling great!</li>
            <li> I was told I have gum disease two months ago. I immediately turned to Amazon and began reviewing products to try. This was the first one like this that I have tried. My dentists was impressed two days ago when she told me the gum disease has begun to lessen. She asked what I was using and I told her. This product really works if you use it as directed.</li>
            <li> All natural, organic way to help ensure dental health. The company seems down-to-earth and proud of their product with a nice web site and good videos. I use 2 drops on my toothbrush morning and night, as well as coat my dental floss with it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference. It may require more time...I had read that it helped gums, but have seen no difference in mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been stuck using toothpaste for sensitive teeth for years, but was looking for a more natural product.  I decided to give this a try, without too much expectation.  At first I didn&#x27;t like the flavor very much but my teeth felt so clean!  And they never had even one sensitive day during transition.  Then I began to love the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I use their Bass toothbrush too, and use their \\&quot;weird\\&quot; way of brushing I found on uTube.  Every morning and night (and sometimes middle of the day) I feel like I just had a cleaning at the dentist office just because I replaced my toothpaste with this.  I also use a drop on my floss.  You can mix it with water for a mouthwash, I just use a drop directly in my mouth and swish.  I do also like their tongue scraper.  The investment was so worth it!!!  Also, the best part, with my teeth being so sensitive I mostly can&#x27;t whiten my teeth, but THIS STUFF WHITENED MY TEETH.  With NO PAIN!  I hadn&#x27;t really said much about changing out my toothpaste and my friend was staring at me one day and finally asked why my teeth were whiter.  I hated dealing with my teeth and pretty much hated my teeth, but they feel stronger, cleaner, healthier, and look prettier after 1 month of using OraWellness Healthy Mouth Blend.  Wow.</li>
            <li> taste good and works well to minimize plaque on teeth. will for sure buy again.  use on my toothbrush when done brushing with toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was not found of the taste at first, but my teeth felt so clean after using--like I had a full cleaning--I stuck with it and now I like the taste. It grows on you. :)&lt;br /&gt; Great replacement over fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few months in addition to homemade tooth paste and powder, and I noticed my breath improved and my teeth, gums and tongue were looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a little lazy, and I stopped using some of the blend on my toothbrush for a little while.  I was surprised by what  a difference it made.  Went back to using it and just ordered several more bottles (found a deal where you can get three for the price of two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t imagine not using it any more, especially now that I know it made a big difference!</li>
            <li> I had very sensitive gums in one quadrant and this product was recommended by a friend.  Skeptical, I bought it with no expectations.  After only 2 days of use the sensitivity/pain went away 100%.  I cannot recommend this product enough</li>
            <li> Taste takes a little getting used to, it is not a bad flavor, just kind of odd.  The results are wonderful, took a couple days for me to really notice a difference, stick with it!  My mouth is cleaner and much less sensitive, will be ordering this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> This was fine enough for a month and I like that it has natural ingredients.  However, after using for a month or two, it completely stained my teeth!  Be aware that it can stain teeth for certain people and there&#x27;s no way of knowing if you are one of them, until you see the staining.</li>
            <li> I like the earthy, spicy taste and I love what it does for sensitive teeth.  Good for your mouth and natural oils.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot from this product after watching the videos however, I didn&#x27;t like it very much&lt;br /&gt;The taste was not very bad. I didn&#x27;t see or feel any difference.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, alleviates any gum soreness that I have immediately!</li>
            <li> I liked how this made my mouth feel so refreshed but didn&#x27;t notice any other benefit.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help with my oil pulling practice. (which I began for oral health and tooth sensitivity reasons)  The process used to nauseate me.  Now that I add several drops of this delicious and healthy oil to my teaspoon of coconut oil, I actually look forward to it!  It has a mildly sweet and minty flavor.  I notice that my gums are pinker and my teeth seem whiter too.  My mouth feels cleaner and healthier.  I only started using it last week, but plan to be a repeat customer for a long time.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I just purchased OraWellness about a week ago and already feel a difference.  My gums feel healthier and are less sensitive.  My teeth are also whiter and cleaner than when I used just regular toothpaste.  I will continue to use this as part of my regular morning and night routine.</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt cleaner! My mom uses it too and she claims it&#x27;s the best product in all of her 51 years of scrubbing and using hydrogen peroxide to clean her tongue, this product does the job waaaay better! Cleanest mouth ever after using this product. I also recommend oil pulling along with this product to eliminate tooth sensitivity! (You can heal your cavities, regrow enamel, and remineralize your teeth with NUTRITION!) I also recommend taking Green Pasture&#x27;s Blue Ice Royal fermented cod liver oil and butter oil blend capsules or gel. This is so very good for teeth health. Check out the book Cure Tooth Decay by Ramiel Nagel for more info. So great.</li>
            <li> I add it to my DIY toothpaste and it has great taste! I can only assume it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, as my mouth is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff. What I am going to say is just what has happened to me, but if it helps someone, I will be happy for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Fibromyalgia, Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis, Degenerative Spine Disease, and Spinal Stenosis. As you might imagine, there disorders cause me quite a lot of pain and some disability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have periodontal disease and some dental pockets. A few years ago, the dentist put a time release antibiotic plug in the two worst pockets. After he did that, I had no pain whatsoever. This only lasted a few days, but it got me thinking. Maybe the dental infection is what is causing the other problems. There are studies showing that people with periodontal disease have a greater risk for the above illnesses plus heart disease and diabetes 2 (which luckily, I do not have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began an all out war against my periodontal disease. I use oil pulling with coconut oil every morning for 15 minutes, and I have begun using the Orawellness blend. I brush with it, I use it as a mouthwash and I use a syringe with a curved tip to rinse the pockets out every day, several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that the periodontal disease is much less, and my general negative symptoms from the other diseases are much less than before I started this regime. If I ever miss, my pain and just general malaise become quite terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also follow a certain diet and receive normal medical treatment for these disorders as well. So all together, I feel quite normal and I am amazed by this. This product is wonderful, it works if you are a dedicated user and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have teeth problems for the first time in life and I have searched high and low for alternatives - something anything - that helps keep my teeth clean, doesn&#x27;t hurt (I had a peroxide toothpaste that made me teeth ache), doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals and so on. When used regularly, this is the real deal - my teeth feel stronger, have less sensitivity and I see a decline in issues overall. I suggested my best friend try it when she experienced a toothache (knowing she needs a root canal) and it cleared the pain. Now that doesn&#x27;t mean she doesn&#x27;t need to go to the dentist, and it doesn&#x27;t mean the issue doesn&#x27;t still exist - but it does mean that until you can afford what needs to happen next this product helps. I&#x27;m not scientific and I don&#x27;t know the chemistry - I only know what I&#x27;ve experienced - it helps, and some decay issues have been stopped in their track. Brushing twice a day with toothpaste did not help, brushing twice a day with this has.</li>
            <li> Ok, so natural tooth remedies always sort of freak me out. Because I am a product of traditional dentistry.  But I had pain in my lower right portion of my mouth, nothing was helping. So I took a chance after having a friend tell me about this. I have no more pain. I cannot speak to what it is doing for my teeth from any other standpoint bc I have not yet had my 6 month check up. But after I will update this. Ok so I put a drop in my hand and cover my floss with this. I use the prepackaged floss on a stick bc I have a small mouth and really tight areas bt my teeth, so a string of floss does not work for me. So as I clean the floss off I dip it into the oil in my palm. Super easy. Really makes your breath fresh! I also brush with this. Nothing else. Three drops onto my brush. I ordered the Bass brushes. But for right now I am using with my Perio toothbrush. Brush very gently. Traditional brushing wears down your gums!! And your tooth enamel. So watch the videos about how to use the Bass toothbrush method. Really eye opening. I also put a drop into a little water and rinse with it. you can also incorporate this into your normal regimen. Although after reading about teeth, you may want to do what I am doing.&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo I am giving this a college try! I promise to report what my dentist says after that spot.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that OraWellness went out of their way to help me with the purchase. I used a complete bottle and didn&#x27;t notice any gum improvements. I have a before/after picture if you&#x27;re interested. The feeling after brushing with this alone isn&#x27;t as fresh as with regular toothpaste. I use about 3-4 drops each time I brush morning and night. I contacted OraWellness and they said to use a chart to follow any changes. What I did is took a picture to get a before and after, and didn&#x27;t notice any changes.</li>
            <li> took a couple of weeks but can tell a differance</li>
            <li> 90% of reviews of this stuff sound written on order. They sound like testimonials on teleshoping programme that run in the night. I am thinking of buying this stuff but those fabricated infomercials put me off big time</li>
            <li> The essential oils in the OraWellness Heal Thy Mouth Blend are wonderful. Every time I brush, my mouth feels fresh, clean, and healthy.</li>
            <li> I started using Orawell Brushing Blend about a year ago and instantly loved it. Never before did my mouth feel so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historically, I have always been lazy with my teeth brushing and cleaning since childhood. I am fortunate to have good health but oral health was an area I was not as strong in. Once I started using the OraWellness, I naturally started brushing for several minutes and very thoroughly, I guess because of the pleasant taste and cool feeling sensation it brings to my teeth, gums and entire mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY drawback for me is that I travel all the time internationally, and so I will occasionally run out of supply of my OraWellness. When that happens it is a BIG let down to have to switch back to toothpaste until I can get home and get my new supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an excellent, excellent health product. I can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> I ordered several bottles of OraWellness Brushing Blend months ago after reading about the product on one of my favorite natural living blogs.  I&#x27;ll admit, at first I was skeptical at the claims it made.  But....after using it a few times I could see a definite difference in my teeth &amp; mouth.  My teeth are cleaner and stay that way for longer.  I feel like they are a little whiter too.  This is a huge deal for me as I have tetracycline stained teeth.  I don&#x27;t feel that my teeth are quite as sensitive as before either.  It makes my mouth feel very clean and fresh too.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  The OraWellness company (hi Will &amp; Susan!!) provide some stellar customer service too.  Who else does that these days?  Ummm....how about hardly anyone?  I&#x27;m very happy that I came across OraWellness.  It fits right in with the changes I&#x27;ve made towards a healthier lifestyle for my family.  Try a bottle and you won&#x27;t be sorry.  Buy a Bass toothbrush or two (or a whole bunch) from them too.  Double bonus!</li>
            <li> Yeowie zowie!  That is how your mouth feels with this tooth paste replacement.  Imagine, no more messy tubes and paste spots to clean off the counter or mirror!  I love the clove zing in my mouth and I am certain that my teeth and gums are cleaner than before.  At first it was just me, then I shared the oil with my husband.  Now I have to order the three pack every time!  My husband was an easy convert.  Do yourself a big favor.  Use the product.</li>
            <li> This is definitely different than using regular toothpaste but I like the transition.  The taste is good and I feel good about using something organic.</li>
            <li> An absolutely Great Product! I This product is absolutely amazingly awesome!  I could tell the difference in my mouth with the first time use. Got a good report at the dentist!</li>
            <li> I love this. I do notice (now that ive used for 2 months) that lately im getting tartar on my teeth half way through the day. I was using this by itself and nOT having this issue.&lt;br /&gt;so I searched out a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have glycerin in it or fluoride (glycerin coats teeth and prevents from healing and remineralizing. fluoride is garbage.)&lt;br /&gt;I use babyganics kid toothpaste with a few drops of this. works GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;I have some of my gums growing back after being receeded for years.&lt;br /&gt;I also oil pull with coconut oil as of late and it helps a ton with stains and infections etc too.&lt;br /&gt;I do oil pulling for 10 min once a day.&lt;br /&gt;started this after noticing THREE teeth that hurt bad as hell with anything I ate (after having my son)&lt;br /&gt;I was going to get them filled but thought id try healing them. it worked!! 2 months later and I only have one tooth that twinges after eating candy...which is rare I eat it...but sometimes I cave :(&lt;br /&gt;but it healed 2 for sure. sooooo...im gonna keep up with this, add in dr christophers tooth powder, continue oil pulling, and take more green pastures fermented cod liver oil with butter!&lt;br /&gt;im winning the war!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> using with dental floss to clean between teeth and as a second toothpaste brightens teeth like the taste helps with gum issues.</li>
            <li> Ora wellness heal thy mouth blend, what a wonderful product, i couldn&#x27;t wait to get it. I&#x27;ve had periodontal issues and have been looking for a product to help. This is from a company that really cares about people and the environment. It comes in a nice container made of recycled products, and the oil itself is organic. My mouth feels better already and i want to keep using it to heal my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff right here. I hate normal foamy toothpaste and was looking for a healthier alternative when i bought this. So far , after a weeks use, i can say my gums are healthier and i will be repurchasing this roduct :) i totally recommend it.</li>
