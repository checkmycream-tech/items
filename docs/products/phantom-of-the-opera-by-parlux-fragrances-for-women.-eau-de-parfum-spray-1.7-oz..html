            <li>It&#x27;s awesome!!!</li>

            <li>soft,feminine reminds me of estees beautiful</li>
            <li>And the bottle looks great on her vanity</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT, GOOD SERVICE...</li>
            <li>Thirty years ago I had to work overtime to buy her this scent, good stuff.</li>
            <li>The package drew me to look at it, and I loved the design of the bottle.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and of course she loved it...</li>
            <li>I was so glad to see that Amazon.com had Phathom of the Opera!  </li>
            <li>They love it!</li>
            <li>The perfume bottle and box was nice, very elegant.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents!</li>
            <li>I think my sister will love it!</li>
            <li>scent is good, but, the EDP is much better.</li>
            <li>Loved it then, still love it.</li>
            <li>but then I found it on Amazon and was thrilled to have found it .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was for one thrilled, because I wanted to buy it for her</li>
            <li>The scent is nice.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter had this years ago &amp; really liked it.</li>
            <li>The perfume itself smells good, but it smells familiar to me.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume on a whim because I love the Phantom of the Opera musical, the fragrance sounded good and the bottle is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>:) I love</li>
            <li>This was an interesting buy i got it for a friend</li>
            <li>i have so many compliments .i</li>
            <li>I do not like many perfumes, but my daughter bought me some Phantom Of The Opera,  many years ago</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her favorite perfume</li>
            <li>and i think that she is going to love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised markets are still selling it like it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li>The packaging was great, very well protected and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>Amazing i  am obsesed with any poto things so this was great the perfume does not smell like roses it smells like a vintage perfume someone back in the 1800s would use its sofisticated and elegent a must for any phan. :)</li>
            <li>Its&#x27; very light, but also very pretty!</li>
            <li>I had no problems with the seller - but if you are a fan of the original fragrance of Phantom of the Opera, the way it smelled over a decade ago - you will not be getting that fragrance any more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**If you get dizzy with strong perfume, think again.</li>
            <li>not too strong and one that you would have to get up close to appreciate the floral scent.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for a perfume that doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a smell that gives you a headache, this is the one.</li>
            <li>However, the only reason I&#x27;m keeping it is because the bottle looks great on a dresser.  </li>
            <li>this was a great birthday present for her</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smells like floral.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it is sexy.</li>
            <li>Best perfume in the whole wide world!!!!</li>
            <li>The company was right on schedule</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume for my daughter because I thought the bottle was pretty.  </li>
            <li>love this perfume and have been long time user.  </li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very picky about perfume, but she likes it</li>
            <li>The only ones available have been sitting on a shelf somewhere losing their freshness.</li>
            <li>It has a classic old time flowery scent like what you expect someone to weat when Phantom takes place.</li>
            <li>She has a red, black and white bedroom and the bottle looks gorgeous on her dresser.  </li>
            <li>This is the last bottle I will purchase because they are now so aged, the original fragrance is gone.</li>
            <li>they are obsessed with Phantom of the opera,  Definelty and older smell not something new and fresh but still a cool idea</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft, old-fashioned scent and reminds me of something that women in the 1800&#x27;s might have actually worn.</li>

            <li> I bought this perfume on a whim because I love the Phantom of the Opera musical, the fragrance sounded good and the bottle is beautiful.  However, the only reason I&#x27;m keeping it is because the bottle looks great on a dresser.  The perfume is awful.  It smells like medicine and men&#x27;s cologne.  Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I purchased this item, which states that it is Eau De Parfum, When I got the item, It stated it was Eau De Toilette.  Seller did not respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is good, but, the EDP is much better.</li>
            <li> love this perfume and have been long time user.  i have tried others but my husband and family only like phantom.  not too strong and one that you would have to get up close to appreciate the floral scent.  i am 50 but used it for over 15 years...</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent on me. Plus it gets this fella the goods. So I am very happy about that.</li>
            <li> i have used this perfume for 1 yrs now it is grt i have so many compliments .i have to order online because no dept stores have ever heard of it.it is soft,feminine reminds me of estees beautiful</li>
            <li> Best perfume in the whole wide world!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a perfume that I remembered wearing in the 80&#x27;s.  Loved it then, still love it. The packaging was great, very well protected and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> I do not like many perfumes, but my daughter bought me some Phantom Of The Opera,  many years ago and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it all the time since then , and I find it very hard to get now, as I guess the novelty name wore off,  but then I found it on Amazon and was thrilled to have found it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now know where I can purchace it without going to all stores and flee markets to try to obtain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redrocket</li>
            <li> All the women in my family have seen the Phantom in London and/or Las Vegas.  I give them this as a reminder!  They love it!</li>
            <li> inflated pricing because it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Well, I got this product as a Christmas gift for my sister last year. It&#x27;s her favorite perfume and it&#x27;s been hard to find and I just happened to look here and they had it. I was for one thrilled, because I wanted to buy it for her and of course she loved it...</li>
            <li> This fragrance has been discontinued for years. The only ones available have been sitting on a shelf somewhere losing their freshness. This is the last bottle I will purchase because they are now so aged, the original fragrance is gone. I&#x27;m surprised markets are still selling it like it&#x27;s good! I had no problems with the seller - but if you are a fan of the original fragrance of Phantom of the Opera, the way it smelled over a decade ago - you will not be getting that fragrance any more. I just don&#x27;t understand why they discontinued it!!!</li>
            <li> The perfume bottle and box was nice, very elegant. The perfume itself smells good, but it smells familiar to me. Nothing that will stimulate the senses. Overall, it&#x27;s a hood product it came in the amount of days expected and the shipping was on time. The company was right on schedule</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume and no stores carry it, in my local shops...I also helps keep he whining to a minimum..lol</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents!</li>
            <li> i would buy again for niece this was a great birthday present for her and i think that she is going to love it</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter because I thought the bottle was pretty.  She has a red, black and white bedroom and the bottle looks gorgeous on her dresser.  The scent is nice.  It&#x27;s a soft, old-fashioned scent and reminds me of something that women in the 1800&#x27;s might have actually worn.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a perfume that doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a smell that gives you a headache, this is the one. Its&#x27; very light, but also very pretty! I think my sister will love it!</li>
            <li> Our daughter had this years ago &amp; really liked it. Had been unable to find it. She was dlighted to unwrap Christmas!!</li>
