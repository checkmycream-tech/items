            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Great brush to put the Lactic Acid Gel Peel on smoothly.</li>
            <li>To each their own, I guess.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>however I would have liked it to be a bit softer.</li>
            <li>Nice fan brush .</li>
            <li>Was appreciative of the quality, although the product that I bought to use it with states using gauze pads to  spread on face.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice fan brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is so handy for applying my Lactic Acid peel.  </li>
            <li>Nice, easier to apply Glycolic with this brush.  </li>
            <li>arrived quickly and is great for glycolic peels</li>
            <li>Great product, quick delivery</li>
            <li>It cleans up very easily and no bristles have been lost.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the fan brush for expeditiously delivering the acid to your face in a safe and effective manner.</li>
            <li>This was so much more effective than what I had been applying them with before (my hands:).</li>
            <li>Went on very smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li>Very light touch .</li>
            <li>Otherwise a high quality, nice looking brush at a great price.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect and easy to manuever around sensitive areas on my face.</li>
            <li>Worked okay for about a month (with very light use)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it works with my glycolic acid peel.</li>
            <li>i love this brush.</li>
            <li>so I dnt knw if there is a better one ..</li>
            <li>ITS OKAY NOTHING TO WRITE ABOUT ITS A BRUSH</li>
            <li>but I use it twice a day with no nasty side effects to my skin and in 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Well made and safe when brushing on acid face peels.</li>
            <li>Not horrible</li>
            <li>sturdy, able to rinse off and reuse with no issues.</li>
            <li>Better than gauze.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Not the best quality brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Based on the photo, I thought the brush would have more bristles and collect more solution.  </li>
            <li>Recommend using a cotton ball applies much better.</li>
            <li>Fine for a brush - no problems and cheap price!</li>
            <li>Works good, you don&#x27;t lose as much product as using a cotton pad.</li>
            <li>Easy to use .</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and wash out when finished...  </li>
            <li>Works fine, none of the bristles have come out yet.</li>
            <li>this has been a fine brush for applying my glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>I have always love a fun brush, I think they can create art work so easily.</li>
            <li>Smooth as a babies butt.</li>
            <li>CHEAP  PRICE ,  </li>
            <li>This is an easy brush to keep clean too.</li>
            <li>More effort than it was worth in my opinion.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to rinse and clean.</li>
            <li>Cheap brush.</li>
            <li>but the stiffer bristles allow for precise application control.</li>
            <li>this keeps the bristles in good shape, and keeps them from falling out... wash the brush with your hair shampoo to keep it soft.</li>
            <li>It is full and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This brush is easy to clean and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to go with the lactic acid serum.</li>
            <li>This fun brush is easy to work with</li>
            <li>I thought it would be nice since it&#x27;s bigger, but the taklon fan mask is better after all...</li>
            <li>Do not forget to swish the brush in the baking soda solution to clean it when done.  </li>
            <li>Too large for fine detail work like eye lines (crows feet) or skin tag removal but great for larger areas.</li>
            <li>A few more would have been nice, though!</li>
            <li>Good brush, use for facial treatments.</li>
            <li>The brush is gentle on the skin and makes smooth application of my skincare products easy.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>but i loveeeed this one it spread my mask evenly and really quick</li>
            <li>The brush is very fine and soft.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>If you put too much on the brush your skin will end up saturated and all you need is a light application, like applying a toner.</li>
            <li>Just your basic brush, but does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>It is a nice brush overall.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>Fan brushes like this one are excellent for applying a thin, even layer of product to the face, which saves you from using excess product (and $$$) and improves the quality of the peel or mask.</li>
            <li>But other then that this is a good brush to start out with.</li>
            <li>It is what it says it is and does the job, the price is right too.</li>
            <li>does the job right</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>received it very fast</li>
            <li>I was fine during all stages of the serum except the last one when I was at full strength at which point it burned my face.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty sparse.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I love this one and will order another to have a back up brush.</li>
            <li>Did exactly what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li>I actually think it&#x27;ll work better.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and wanted.</li>
            <li>I will buy more of these, preferrably in different colors</li>
            <li>Far too cheap and scratchy - this is not something you want to be putting on your face.</li>
            <li>The handle is a light, strong, thick plastic, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Applies chemical peel easily and is not too coarse on skin</li>
            <li>There are large gaps between some of the bristles, I think because of the stiffness.</li>
            <li>Very cheap quality spend a few extra dollars for a better one.</li>
            <li>It can make work so much easier for me.</li>
            <li>Can get it much cheaper at the dollar store</li>
            <li>Doing so, I control how much solution I&#x27;m using and my skin doesn&#x27;t get over-saturated with solution.</li>
            <li>Very well made brush.</li>
            <li>They are very scratchy and fall out.</li>
            <li>It really did the job</li>
            <li>how much can you really say about a fan brush.</li>
            <li>and it is holding up really well.  </li>
            <li>Not too much pressure</li>
            <li>It  make work so much easier for me.</li>
            <li>Saves on peel as you won&#x27;t use as much with the brush.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush to apply my glycolic acid peel... and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the product has changed, but I don&#x27;t know how people say this brush is soft and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend shopping for another brush.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for the peels, and the taklon one is definitely softer and doesn&#x27;t dry out as much as this one.</li>
            <li>The metal on top scratch clients a little</li>
            <li>Many people using peels apply with a cotton ball, but I am certain that it would result in a complete waste of product.  </li>
            <li>Rinse clean and dry.</li>
            <li>doesnt drip as the bristles are not soft and super absorbent.</li>
            <li>I am certain that this is because the peel is so abrasive and not due to the brush itself.  </li>
            <li>The brush feel rough and scratchy on my skin especially when I do lactic peel, my skin is thinner and more sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still useable, but I&#x27;m not sure for how many uses.  </li>
            <li>Quick mailing and as expected.</li>
            <li>Brush hair is so soft it almost feels like feather is moving across the face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting my aesthetician friend to buy one for me from her catalogue, or I&#x27;ll be heading to the art store to find a high-quality, soft brush.</li>
            <li>Always swish a natural hair brush (like this one) in baking soda solution after using it to apply acid peels...</li>
            <li>I have to be very cautious when applying the facial peel</li>
            <li>The brush is really stiff, like a really cheap paintbrush.</li>
            <li>no mess</li>
            <li>This brush is not that small, it is kind of wide.  </li>
            <li>(the Jason brand is GMO free and has almond and avo oils in it) into a small dish and use the brush to spread it on evenly, just like I would have done with the chemical peel serum.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using a high number peel I would recommend getting a larger brush to prevent too much peel being left at the beginning of the brush stroke and not enough at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, a reasonable price for this product and has held up to multiple glycolic acid peel treatments.</li>
            <li>It Works really well for applying acid peels, just be careful around eye area</li>
            <li>So far I have used a total of 4xs with my Glycolic Lactic Acid 0.5oz I received with the Cellbone balancer.</li>
            <li>Not really an expensive item, but not worth wasting y</li>
            <li>This particular brush definitely gets the job done, though I find the bristles to be rather coarse and loosely packed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, perhaps a little small for my intended use.</li>
            <li>Stiff &amp; works exactly</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so I dnt knw if there is a better one ..</li>
            <li> ITS OKAY NOTHING TO WRITE ABOUT ITS A BRUSH</li>
            <li> but I use it twice a day with no nasty side effects to my skin and in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Well made and safe when brushing on acid face peels.</li>
            <li> Not horrible</li>
            <li> sturdy, able to rinse off and reuse with no issues.</li>
            <li> Better than gauze.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Not the best quality brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Based on the photo, I thought the brush would have more bristles and collect more solution.  </li>
            <li> Recommend using a cotton ball applies much better.</li>
            <li> Fine for a brush - no problems and cheap price!</li>
            <li> Works good, you don&#x27;t lose as much product as using a cotton pad.</li>
            <li> Easy to use .</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and wash out when finished...  </li>
            <li> Works fine, none of the bristles have come out yet.</li>
            <li> this has been a fine brush for applying my glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> I have always love a fun brush, I think they can create art work so easily.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a babies butt.</li>
            <li> CHEAP  PRICE ,  </li>
            <li> This is an easy brush to keep clean too.</li>
            <li> More effort than it was worth in my opinion.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to rinse and clean.</li>
            <li> Cheap brush.</li>
            <li> but the stiffer bristles allow for precise application control.</li>
            <li> this keeps the bristles in good shape, and keeps them from falling out... wash the brush with your hair shampoo to keep it soft.</li>
            <li> It is full and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to clean and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to go with the lactic acid serum.</li>
            <li> This fun brush is easy to work with</li>
            <li> I thought it would be nice since it&#x27;s bigger, but the taklon fan mask is better after all...</li>
            <li> Do not forget to swish the brush in the baking soda solution to clean it when done.  </li>
            <li> Too large for fine detail work like eye lines (crows feet) or skin tag removal but great for larger areas.</li>
            <li> A few more would have been nice, though!</li>
            <li> Good brush, use for facial treatments.</li>
            <li> The brush is gentle on the skin and makes smooth application of my skincare products easy.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> but i loveeeed this one it spread my mask evenly and really quick</li>
            <li> The brush is very fine and soft.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> If you put too much on the brush your skin will end up saturated and all you need is a light application, like applying a toner.</li>
            <li> Just your basic brush, but does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> It is a nice brush overall.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Fan brushes like this one are excellent for applying a thin, even layer of product to the face, which saves you from using excess product (and $$$) and improves the quality of the peel or mask.</li>
            <li> But other then that this is a good brush to start out with.</li>
            <li> It is what it says it is and does the job, the price is right too.</li>
            <li> does the job right</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> received it very fast</li>
            <li> I was fine during all stages of the serum except the last one when I was at full strength at which point it burned my face.</li>
            <li> It feels pretty sparse.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I love this one and will order another to have a back up brush.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I actually think it&#x27;ll work better.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and wanted.</li>
            <li> I will buy more of these, preferrably in different colors</li>
            <li> Far too cheap and scratchy - this is not something you want to be putting on your face.</li>
            <li> The handle is a light, strong, thick plastic, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Applies chemical peel easily and is not too coarse on skin</li>
            <li> There are large gaps between some of the bristles, I think because of the stiffness.</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality spend a few extra dollars for a better one.</li>
            <li> It can make work so much easier for me.</li>
            <li> Can get it much cheaper at the dollar store</li>
            <li> Doing so, I control how much solution I&#x27;m using and my skin doesn&#x27;t get over-saturated with solution.</li>
            <li> Very well made brush.</li>
            <li> They are very scratchy and fall out.</li>
            <li> It really did the job</li>
            <li> how much can you really say about a fan brush.</li>
            <li> and it is holding up really well.  </li>
            <li> Not too much pressure</li>
            <li> It  make work so much easier for me.</li>
            <li> Saves on peel as you won&#x27;t use as much with the brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to apply my glycolic acid peel... and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product has changed, but I don&#x27;t know how people say this brush is soft and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend shopping for another brush.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for the peels, and the taklon one is definitely softer and doesn&#x27;t dry out as much as this one.</li>
            <li> The metal on top scratch clients a little</li>
            <li> Many people using peels apply with a cotton ball, but I am certain that it would result in a complete waste of product.  </li>
            <li> Rinse clean and dry.</li>
            <li> doesnt drip as the bristles are not soft and super absorbent.</li>
            <li> I am certain that this is because the peel is so abrasive and not due to the brush itself.  </li>
            <li> The brush feel rough and scratchy on my skin especially when I do lactic peel, my skin is thinner and more sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still useable, but I&#x27;m not sure for how many uses.  </li>
            <li> Quick mailing and as expected.</li>
            <li> Brush hair is so soft it almost feels like feather is moving across the face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting my aesthetician friend to buy one for me from her catalogue, or I&#x27;ll be heading to the art store to find a high-quality, soft brush.</li>
            <li> Always swish a natural hair brush (like this one) in baking soda solution after using it to apply acid peels...</li>
            <li> I have to be very cautious when applying the facial peel</li>
            <li> The brush is really stiff, like a really cheap paintbrush.</li>
            <li> no mess</li>
            <li> This brush is not that small, it is kind of wide.  </li>
            <li> (the Jason brand is GMO free and has almond and avo oils in it) into a small dish and use the brush to spread it on evenly, just like I would have done with the chemical peel serum.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using a high number peel I would recommend getting a larger brush to prevent too much peel being left at the beginning of the brush stroke and not enough at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, a reasonable price for this product and has held up to multiple glycolic acid peel treatments.</li>
            <li> It Works really well for applying acid peels, just be careful around eye area</li>
            <li> So far I have used a total of 4xs with my Glycolic Lactic Acid 0.5oz I received with the Cellbone balancer.</li>
            <li> Not really an expensive item, but not worth wasting y</li>
            <li> This particular brush definitely gets the job done, though I find the bristles to be rather coarse and loosely packed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, perhaps a little small for my intended use.</li>
            <li> Stiff &amp; works exactly</li>
            <li> THAT FLAT..</li>
            <li> Had one in the past this item, still haven&#x27;t used this particular item, but it&#x27;s the same.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that when it arrived the bristles were bent, but a wash in hot water, then pressing in flat again under a heavy book, quickly fixed that.</li>
            <li> I recommend you practice on your face with water prior to using the actual peel chemical, you certainly do not want your eyes to come in contact with the solution!  </li>
            <li> Should not be for the face, rough enough to scrub floors.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel soft enough against my fingers when dry, but I will say that when I am applying the peel, the bristles feel a little scratchy and rough.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully my three stars won&#x27;t prevent anybody from buying this brush if they are buying for purposes other than applying a facial masque.  </li>
            <li> Some products can be mixed with water for easier application and other can be mixed products that resolve skin issues such as: anti aging, aromatherapy oils that reuce redness and irritation,  Hyaluronic acid for added moisturizing to name a few,  </li>
            <li> my skin is really dry, I will use this to do an oil cleaning routine on my face.</li>
            <li> It brushes on well and does not have loose hairs that sptter without control.</li>
            <li> I pour the peel solution into its tiny little cap and then dip this brush in the cap.  </li>
            <li> It is a little short on the bristles, but does the job.</li>
            <li> Only thing is can get a little streaky.</li>
            <li> However the brush/bristles are a bit rough for my liking.</li>
            <li> I would of given it four stars if the bristles was fuller, but for the price I don&#x27;t know what I expected.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little firm, I also had some minimum bristle shedding but nothing too major.  </li>
            <li> This product is poor quality - I used it twice very carefully and the bristles are falling out and coming off on my face as I gently wipe the chemical peel on.  </li>
            <li> but i have it 3 stars because while applying the serum, some of it comes out of the other side</li>
            <li> I use these brushes to apply masks and other products on my clients.</li>
            <li> Very rough bristles.</li>
            <li> which kind of sucks when you&#x27;re applying an already painful skin peel.</li>
            <li> The bristles are also slightly on the rough side.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality and does not last.</li>
            <li> Only four stars because it&#x27;s a very stiff brush</li>
            <li> By using brush one can control how much product is used and reduce wasting expensive producs and ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be stiff and rough -</li>
            <li> The bristles were a bit stiff, but this is to be expected with boar bristle hairs...</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount of the peel on the brush because of the way it applies it to your skin.  </li>
            <li> is I wish there were less bristles.</li>
            <li> The metal piece at the top of the brush sticks out and scratches badly if you press a little too hard.</li>
            <li> I used to do it with a cotton ball but kept finding the cotton getting stuck to my face, especially around my eyes, which was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t let the skin peels drip down my face the other brush I purchased from another company was too thick and it made the skin peels run down my face</li>
            <li> Brush is a little scratchy, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little scratchy.</li>
            <li> No real opinion!!!</li>
            <li> Does not fit bottles.</li>
            <li> This fan brush allows for even application of the product without any excess waste.  </li>
            <li> firm brush.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t use up a lot of product to be left behind in the brush.  </li>
            <li> THE TIP OF BRUSH MAY BE A LITTLE STIFF SCATCHY...</li>
            <li> It wastes the least amount of peel solution.  </li>
            <li> It is a small brush.</li>
            <li> I do use it for my peels, because I&#x27;m too lazy to purchase anything else</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are from a boar i believe, the bristles are very firm.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to put the acid around my eye area.</li>
            <li> Spreads TCA evenly but no good after a one-time use.</li>
            <li> After washing them and sanitizing them, the hair gets HARD AS ROCK!</li>
            <li> it is  thin and  </li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> I have to update this review because after about 2 uses, the bristles are falling out like crazy!  </li>
            <li> Worthless product</li>
            <li> The bristles are awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The brush feel rough and scratchy on my skin especially when I do lactic peel, my skin is thinner and more sensitive.</li>
            <li> It does the work well.</li>
            <li> Had one in the past this item, still haven&#x27;t used this particular item, but it&#x27;s the same. And it&#x27;s great for applying glycolic peels to your own skin if you do treatments at home like I do. Saves you lots of money and time.</li>
            <li> The metal piece at the top of the brush sticks out and scratches badly if you press a little too hard. Also, one use and the bristles are done for.</li>
            <li> Fine for a brush - no problems and cheap price!</li>
            <li> Good brush spread evenly</li>
            <li> Works fine, none of the bristles have come out yet. A few more would have been nice, though! It feels pretty sparse.</li>
            <li> The brush broke off into pieces after a couple of uses...</li>
            <li> Worked great, no drips!</li>
            <li> I have always love a fun brush, I think they can create art work so easily. This fun brush is easy to work with and I love it. It can make work so much easier for me.</li>
            <li> too coarse for acids.</li>
            <li> Love it works with my glycolic acid peel.</li>
            <li> Not that great of a brush for the price. Can get it much cheaper at the dollar store</li>
            <li> Great price...does the job</li>
            <li> This brush is ideal for putting serum on my face.  It is just like the brush my facialist uses.</li>
            <li> Good brush - served it&#x27;s purpose well</li>
            <li> i love this brush. i use it for my chemical peels</li>
            <li> Good for what it&#x27;s needed like applying something on your face .</li>
            <li> Brush is a little scratchy, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Should not be for the face, rough enough to scrub floors.</li>
            <li> purchased as a add on, great for the price !</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for use with lactic acid. Did the job well.</li>
            <li> Good company with Very good quality product, Nice-Soft on the skin!  I recommend you practice on your face with water prior to using the actual peel chemical, you certainly do not want your eyes to come in contact with the solution!  I am ordering a second one to apply the neutralizer!</li>
            <li> Very rough bristles. I did not dare using it. If I do, and I can still put up with the quality, and change my mind, I will revise my review. Until then, I only give it 2 stars... sorry.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and is great for glycolic peels</li>
            <li> Works great, peeled in a flash.  Glowing complexion, fades wrinkles and good for acne prone skin.  Smooth as a babies butt.</li>
            <li> It wastes the least amount of peel solution.  I pour the peel solution into its tiny little cap and then dip this brush in the cap.  Doing so, I control how much solution I&#x27;m using and my skin doesn&#x27;t get over-saturated with solution.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. I bought it to put my peel on with. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> used with lactic acid serum that was viscous causing brush to wipe on globs, used vinyl gloves next time to apply  and no problem</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for applying a chemical peel. Well definitely buy another one when it&#x27;s time to replace this one.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality and does not last.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be nice since it&#x27;s bigger, but the taklon fan mask is better after all... I use it mostly for the peels, and the taklon one is definitely softer and doesn&#x27;t dry out as much as this one.</li>
            <li> Works great, just make sure you tap it to get all the acid thats drips off, or it will run into your eyes. I tried gauze an nothing happened, so I prefer the brush. To each their own, I guess.</li>
            <li> love it! love it! love it! love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing for when i contour ! Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> Does not fit bottles.</li>
            <li> Applies product with ease.</li>
            <li> CHEAP  PRICE ,  AND  I LIKE  IT.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Nice product.</li>
            <li> It is perfect, thanks!</li>
            <li> I like the shape of this brush however I would have liked it to be a bit softer.</li>
            <li> Very well made brush. I bought this to apply glycolic acid to my face. Went on very smooth and evenly. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> The bristles are awful! They are very scratchy and fall out. My kitchen broom would be nicer to use that this.</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying my glycolic acid. The brush actually soaks up quite a bit of acid so I don&#x27;t use too much or let it go to waste. The size is perfect and easy to manuever around sensitive areas on my face.</li>
            <li> Basic brush works as described.</li>
            <li> the feathers of the fan brush were falling out of the brush core (shedding) this does not help me if I am losing the material I need to do the job</li>
            <li> Just your basic brush, but does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> Fan brush is as described and is suited to Serum and not more liquid type (as per the title &amp;#34;Fan Brush Boar 8&amp;#34; Glycolic Lactic TCA Serum Mask&amp;#34;).  Well made and will suit my needs.</li>
            <li> Nice fan brush . Easy to use .</li>
            <li> Great brush to put the Lactic Acid Gel Peel on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Just a brush to use with acid peels.  Works good, you don&#x27;t lose as much product as using a cotton pad.</li>
            <li> It helps with the products</li>
            <li> Good brush, use for facial treatments.</li>
            <li> this brush is amazing, great for applying chemical peels</li>
            <li> It is what it says it is and does the job, the price is right too. Spreads evenly , I like it</li>
            <li> I use with all mascarilla</li>
            <li> I love! this brush it is  thin and  doesn&#x27;t let the skin peels drip down my face the other brush I purchased from another company was too thick and it made the skin peels run down my face I love this one and will order another to have a back up brush.</li>
            <li> I havent use any fan brushes before so I dnt knw if there is a better one .. but i loveeeed this one it spread my mask evenly and really quick</li>
            <li> The brush is gentle on the skin and makes smooth application of my skincare products easy.  This is an easy brush to keep clean too.</li>
            <li> Worthless product it came with the peel.</li>
            <li> Works great for applying my Skin Laboratory&#x27;s Glyco-Lac/60 Level 2 Peel and my HQ+ Level 4 Peel.  You only need a very small amount of the peel on the brush because of the way it applies it to your skin.  If you put too much on the brush your skin will end up saturated and all you need is a light application, like applying a toner.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it was suppose to do. However the brush/bristles are a bit rough for my liking.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Argh!!  I have to update this review because after about 2 uses, the bristles are falling out like crazy!  I use it with glycolic peels and I wash it thoroughly after each use, then store it bristle side up.  It&#x27;s still useable, but I&#x27;m not sure for how many uses.  Be prepared to replace this after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this fan brush to apply a glycol peel.  It was offered at a great price and I am so glad I purchased it.  Many people using peels apply with a cotton ball, but I am certain that it would result in a complete waste of product.  This fan brush allows for even application of the product without any excess waste.  The bristles feel soft enough against my fingers when dry, but I will say that when I am applying the peel, the bristles feel a little scratchy and rough.  I am certain that this is because the peel is so abrasive and not due to the brush itself.  It cleans up very easily and no bristles have been lost.  Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are from a boar i believe, the bristles are very firm. It is a nice brush overall.</li>
            <li> Perfect tool for the job plus it can be used for applying make up</li>
            <li> Applies chemical peel easily and is not too coarse on skin</li>
            <li> Was appreciative of the quality, although the product that I bought to use it with states using gauze pads to  spread on face.  Haven&#x27;t used the brush since the pads were included.  I&#x27;m going to use the brush next time.  I actually think it&#x27;ll work better.</li>
            <li> Worked great for applying my peel. I also used it to apply a mask. No complaints. Will order again when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> It Works really well for applying acid peels, just be careful around eye area cause it can splat off brush.</li>
            <li> Very nice sturdy brush for brushing on TCA acids for skin peels. Too large for fine detail work like eye lines (crows feet) or skin tag removal but great for larger areas.</li>
            <li> So far I have used a total of 4xs with my Glycolic Lactic Acid 0.5oz I received with the Cellbone balancer. Feels good on the skin. Applies product evenly on your skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and wanted. received it very fast</li>
            <li> Works great would buy again</li>
            <li> ITS OKAY NOTHING TO WRITE ABOUT ITS A BRUSH THAT FLAT..I GUESS THE TIP OF BRUSH MAY BE A LITTLE STIFF SCATCHY...</li>
            <li> Works well on any type of serum.  I love it!</li>
            <li> It is a little short on the bristles, but does the job. I would of given it four stars if the bristles was fuller, but for the price I don&#x27;t know what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is great for putting on peach and yougart facials.</li>
            <li> The metal on top scratch clients a little</li>
            <li> Good quality. I originally bought this to go with the lactic acid serum. I was fine during all stages of the serum except the last one when I was at full strength at which point it burned my face. It took a week to heal and I didn&#x27;t notice any scar fading at all...but I know it takes a while to work. More effort than it was worth in my opinion. I have stopped using it and have gone to a prescribed ointment for my scarring in lieu of the chemical peel route. It was the same price as one bottle of the serum but I use it twice a day with no nasty side effects to my skin and in 2 weeks, I have noticed a substantial difference in the scarring. BUT, I found another great use for this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my skin is really dry, I will use this to do an oil cleaning routine on my face. I pour some almond, avocado, or vitamin E oil (the Jason brand is GMO free and has almond and avo oils in it) into a small dish and use the brush to spread it on evenly, just like I would have done with the chemical peel serum. I used to do it with a cotton ball but kept finding the cotton getting stuck to my face, especially around my eyes, which was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> It really did the job no mess</li>
            <li> It is a nice fan brush. how much can you really say about a fan brush.</li>
            <li> Quick mailing and as expected.</li>
            <li> I use fan brushes to apply cosmetic products to the skin.  Some products can be mixed with water for easier application and other can be mixed products that resolve skin issues such as: anti aging, aromatherapy oils that reuce redness and irritation,  Hyaluronic acid for added moisturizing to name a few,  By using brush one can control how much product is used and reduce wasting expensive producs and ingredients.  Brush hair is so soft it almost feels like feather is moving across the face.  I will buy more of these, preferrably in different colors so I can use them for face treatments and body treatments by color coding brushes for each purpose.</li>
            <li> I used it last night. It brushes on well and does not have loose hairs that sptter without control. Well made and safe when brushing on acid face peels.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little scratchy.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect and arrived on time..</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality spend a few extra dollars for a better one.</li>
            <li> This brush is not that small, it is kind of wide.  I use it to apply acid peels and serum and it is holding up really well.  The bristles are a little firm, I also had some minimum bristle shedding but nothing too major.  It seems to be a quality brush, the handle is made of wood and the construction seems to be sturdy.</li>
            <li> Works well for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, perhaps a little small for my intended use.</li>
            <li> Perfect use for cleaning my face</li>
            <li> very good bristles to this brush. doesnt drip as the bristles are not soft and super absorbent. no splashing either. firm brush. does the job right</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> This brush is natural and does what it says but it&#x27;s really rough which kind of sucks when you&#x27;re applying an already painful skin peel. Not horrible but it could definitely be smaller.</li>
            <li> This brush holds up well! I use it for my 20% TCA Peels the only problem I have with it is I wish there were less bristles. But other then that this is a good brush to start out with.</li>
            <li> using for a glycolic acid peel, just what I needed. sturdy, able to rinse off and reuse with no issues.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness someone explained (in an Amazon review) that you use this to apply stronger Alpha Hydroxy peels.  This was so much more effective than what I had been applying them with before (my hands:).</li>
            <li> Works great. Only thing is can get a little streaky. Better than gauze.  Great for the price!</li>
            <li> This product is poor quality - I used it twice very carefully and the bristles are falling out and coming off on my face as I gently wipe the chemical peel on.  So I end up having to put my hands in the peel to pull the bristles off every time I use it.  I threw this product away after 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush. I have used them for some time for facials.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product has changed, but I don&#x27;t know how people say this brush is soft and feels good on the skin. I found it to be stiff and rough - I prefer to just use my finger to put on the product.</li>
            <li> This brush is so handy for applying my Lactic Acid peel.  Not too much pressure and it doesn&#x27;t use up a lot of product to be left behind in the brush.  Very light touch . Easy to handle and wash out when finished...  Loved it...</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to apply my glycolic peel to my face. The brush did just that and has held up well. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> No real opinion!!! It&#x27;s just the brush to apply product</li>
            <li> Great product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> It  make work so much easier for me.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for peel application</li>
            <li> this has been a fine brush for applying my glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> Saves on peel as you won&#x27;t use as much with the brush. Do not forget to swish the brush in the baking soda solution to clean it when done.  Rinse clean and dry.</li>
            <li> It is a small brush. If you&#x27;re using a high number peel I would recommend getting a larger brush to prevent too much peel being left at the beginning of the brush stroke and not enough at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality however is excellent. I highly recommend. You want the best when putting a peel on your face, this is it. The handle is a light, strong, thick plastic, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. The brush is very fine and soft. The medal connector (you can see in photo) is sturdy. It doesn&#x27;t wiggle or move like cheaper brushes.&lt;br /&gt;It came packaged in a cushioned envelope.</li>
            <li> Great brush, works well with serums and facisl masks., it&#x27;s easy to rinse and clean.</li>
            <li> I recommend the fan brush for expeditiously delivering the acid to your face in a safe and effective manner. It is full and easy to use.</li>
            <li> GREAT WITH THE GLYCOLIC PEEL, NO DRIP, PERFECT APPLICATION, BEATS THE COTTON SWAB BY A MILE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. Cheap brush. Some of the bristle falls off every time I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush to apply serum masks.</li>
            <li> its okay but i have it 3 stars because while applying the serum, some of it comes out of the other side</li>
            <li> Bristles feel a bit stiffer than I would prefer.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes to apply masks and other products on my clients. These brushes seem to hold up well.</li>
            <li> does not distribute the product equally.</li>
            <li> This works good. Stiff &amp; works exactly like I needed it. I&#x27;ve seen others for a lot more $, but happy I went with this choice.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for chemical peel.</li>
            <li> Great fan brush!  Using it to apply 50% Lactic Acid and it applies the acid evenly over the skin.  Only four stars because it&#x27;s a very stiff brush and it&#x27;s hard to put the acid around my eye area.</li>
            <li> after one use it doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy. guess that&#x27;s what I get for 5 bucks</li>
            <li> Not really an expensive item, but not worth wasting y</li>
            <li> The brush is really stiff, like a really cheap paintbrush. There are large gaps between some of the bristles, I think because of the stiffness. I do use it for my peels, because I&#x27;m too lazy to purchase anything else and it does put product on your face. I only do them once a week, so I can deal. If you&#x27;re looking and haven&#x27;t purchased this yet, consider purchasing a different fan brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect to ice for face masck</li>
            <li> Does its job but the bristles fall out every time I use it.</li>
            <li> -Yes- this works great !</li>
            <li> Affordable brush, works well</li>
            <li> Hopefully my three stars won&#x27;t prevent anybody from buying this brush if they are buying for purposes other than applying a facial masque.  I bought it to apply a glycolic peel and I found that it dripped all over the place.  I would use gauze next time.  Otherwise a high quality, nice looking brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> After washing them and sanitizing them, the hair gets HARD AS ROCK!</li>
            <li> Spreads TCA evenly but no good after a one-time use.</li>
            <li> Far too cheap and scratchy - this is not something you want to be putting on your face. I&#x27;ll be getting my aesthetician friend to buy one for me from her catalogue, or I&#x27;ll be heading to the art store to find a high-quality, soft brush.</li>
            <li> I used for face peel. It works the way its supposed to</li>
            <li> Nice, easier to apply Glycolic with this brush.  Works well!  The glycolic acid I purchased was not so great.</li>
            <li> Works great with the peel I bought! No complaints!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to apply my glycolic acid peel... and it worked very well. The brush is a quality item, with solid construction. The bristles were a bit stiff, but this is to be expected with boar bristle hairs... but the stiffer bristles allow for precise application control. Always swish a natural hair brush (like this one) in baking soda solution after using it to apply acid peels... this keeps the bristles in good shape, and keeps them from falling out... wash the brush with your hair shampoo to keep it soft. My only complaint was that when it arrived the bristles were bent, but a wash in hot water, then pressing in flat again under a heavy book, quickly fixed that.</li>
            <li> Worked okay for about a month (with very light use) then the bristles ALL came out and I had to toss it. Not the best quality brush, especially for the price. The bristles are also slightly on the rough side. I would highly recommend shopping for another brush.</li>
            <li> Back when I was a practicing licensed esthetician, I used a similar fan brush to apply peels and masks. Fan brushes like this one are excellent for applying a thin, even layer of product to the face, which saves you from using excess product (and $$$) and improves the quality of the peel or mask. This particular brush definitely gets the job done, though I find the bristles to be rather coarse and loosely packed. But you can&#x27;t beat the price. This brush is easy to clean and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Based on the photo, I thought the brush would have more bristles and collect more solution.  I have to be very cautious when applying the facial peel so it does not drip. Overall, a reasonable price for this product and has held up to multiple glycolic acid peel treatments.</li>
            <li> Recommend using a cotton ball applies much better.</li>
            <li> this is a really good brush, if you want your products to spread evenly then this is the brush to use.</li>
