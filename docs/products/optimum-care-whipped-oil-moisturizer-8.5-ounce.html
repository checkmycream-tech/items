            <li> It is thicker than the solution that comes in the packets with the home perm kit.</li>
            <li> I actually like this product. It really makes my hair shiny and soft. I have natural hair so I am always looking for something that can make my hair both soft and and manageable. I typically use this ondays when I need to refresh my hair, and it does an awesome job!</li>
            <li> I use this product because it makes my hair so soft and well moisturized. It tames my unruly grey hair too. I love it! I can never find it in stores when I need it so Amazon will be my go to place from now on. I also use the Optimum Perm in Super along with it. I have used these products faithfully for many years. They are my #1 hair tools. Thank you so very much. :D</li>
            <li> I know that what works well for one may not for another, but I love this product for my relaxed hair.  The way my hair feels, smells, and looks is so much better when I use it.  I think for the price it is worth a try ladies (and gents).</li>
            <li> I bought this at Sally&#x27;s because it was on sale and decided to give it a try. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m not using it right or what, but it leaves my hair greasy. I don&#x27;t put much in, and I have long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfy, my hair is beautiful</li>
            <li> I dont know about others but i just used it and my hair is so so greasy after blow drying ! Ughhh ! i was hoping it to be better !</li>
            <li> Very good for natural black hair!!</li>
            <li> Of all hair oisturizers, this in the best one so far. This&#x27;d is my second order. I would recommend over any other brands.</li>
            <li> I love using just a dab of this mixed with a little water and spread it on the unmanageable or frizzy sections of my hair.  The slight scent is non perfumy, but very clean smelling, just like in the salons!</li>
            <li> OPTIMUM IS A GREAT LINE OF HAIR CARE PRODUCTS BUT SOME ITEMS ARE NOT GREAT FOR ME &amp; MY HAIR.</li>

            <li> I really like this product because it provides shine and softness to my unrelaxed hairs. The fragrance is just right,  its not too overwhelming. I would highly recommend this product to friends and others who may be interested.</li>
            <li> I used this first time as it was in the relaxer kit. Best finishing product for my hair I have ever used. It is a  bit pricey but I love the results. I am seriously thinking about tossing all of the other products I have bought previously in the trash. This is the one. Please don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> I found this product included in my relaxer kit and liked it so much I decided to order the full version. It&#x27;s a great enhancer for the look of my hair on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This was good, but I wasn&#x27;t crazy about as I did discontinue using it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would use it again.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars because I needed a daily hair moisturizer, although I do not like the build-up feel of any hair product. Optimum didnt make my hair feel weighed down, which I really like. I would recommend the product as a great hair moisturizer. The ordering process was as always, Amazon Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
