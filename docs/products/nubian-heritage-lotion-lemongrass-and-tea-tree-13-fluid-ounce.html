            <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully hydrating.</li>
            <li>This lotion is so awesome.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>At the time the redness of my skin started subsiding already but the fact that impressed me was - I experienced no peeling.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST, I WILL GET MORE!</li>
            <li>Great for pain and acne</li>
            <li>This lotion is also great for body, but I use about a dime size for my face every morning and night when washing my face.</li>
            <li>and it was great too.</li>
            <li>It is a great value for your money.</li>
            <li>Great stuff....</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, but has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>To me it looks like this body lotion might be a good choice to use after the sun-bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it for my daughter also because  I liked it so good.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, but not cloying, and doesn&#x27;t bother my overactive sinuses.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I use it liberally throughout the day on my face and on weekends, I put it on my scalp for 30 minutes then wash it out with the sulfur soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>So after learning that the tea tree oil is effective on it, I bought these lotion with Nubian Lemongrass &amp; Tea Tree Soaps.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is like butter melting into warm skin, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>The cheery lemongrass scent is strong at application, but fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap smells fresh and wonderful and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know Nubian Heritage &amp;#34;Lemongrass and Tea Tree&amp;#34; body lotion ingredients are safe to use.</li>
            <li>Two products I purchased recently have helped me immensely...10% sulfur soap and this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>The lemongrass scent is refreshing and just divine.  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels more youthful.  </li>
            <li>So many things to love....  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the NH Lemongrass and Tea Tree soap for almost a year now and absolutely love it</li>
            <li>at age 49 my hands are not the most flattering.  </li>
            <li>I love this because of my hands have shown improvement since using it.  </li>
            <li>I love the lemon smell.</li>
            <li>and it would work better to have it packaged in a squeezable tube.  </li>
            <li>My skin looked and felt nicely moisturized and redness turned into tan - which is usually not the case with my fair complexion.</li>
            <li>This lotion is PERFECT for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love de original lemongrass lotion</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as wonderful as the soap / mostly because it&#x27;s missing the orange spice.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, keeps skin so soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this wonderful &#x27;lotion&#x27; for a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>My family&#x27;s a huge fan of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>This leaves the body smooth.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how GOOD this lotion smells.  </li>
            <li>Buying more right now.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like lemongrass but just something sweet, cloying and  cheap.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>It smells almost good enough to eat!  </li>
            <li>Sweet, the smells and textures and way</li>
            <li>It smells so sweet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad and actually smells good</li>
            <li>The scent is rather strong at first</li>
            <li>I have mild athletes foot that occurs time to time.  </li>
            <li>but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly without leaving an oily residue.</li>
            <li>It is also very oily and it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin but just sits on top.</li>
            <li>Rich, thick, absorbs quickly, and smells great.</li>
            <li>The one has a lighter scent, fresh and well suited to the summer months.</li>
            <li>The lotion has all natural ingredients and does a great job on my rashy skin, even in the in the middle of winter.</li>
            <li>The skin being our largest organ, anything we use topically is absorbed into the blood stream.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quicklu and leaves my skin soft and smoorh for more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, and I agree that the scent is strong at first but will disappear.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion after I had such a great experience with the Lemongrass and Tea Tree Soap of the same brand.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping .</li>
            <li>I can break out if the wind hits my face the wrong way, but this lotion is perfect!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this product - and soon.</li>
            <li>I first started using this lotion</li>
            <li>When you first put it on you feel the tea tree oil which soaks into the skin.</li>
            <li>I first bought this stuff from Whole foods because they had a tester.</li>
            <li>This product has a thick, rich consistency and a nice scent, even with the addition of Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li>pure sensual healing for your skin.</li>
            <li>This product works great to moisturize sensitive skin without any greasiness but had a strong waxy smell that was uncomfortably overpowering. .</li>
            <li>It really helped and my mom is also using it.  </li>
            <li>Really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and stays that way all day.</li>
            <li>This lotion moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>It also dried kind of sticky.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t go in for the high priced stuff they sell there, but this stuff was reasonable and the combination of lemon verbena oil and orange oil was absolutely intoxicating.</li>
            <li>I actually had enough left in it to give it to a friend who had commented on how good it smelled.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years my skin is soft and not flaky.</li>
            <li>After only using it twice my hands are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would say it is  Better or equal to products such as Eucerin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This lotion is thick, goes on well , leaves you skin soft, and smells lovely!</li>
            <li>I had just purchased a new bottle, otherwise I would never have given it up.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>For one, this lotion is VERY thick, smells AMAZING, and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li>If you have adult acne rosacea</li>
            <li>It really reminds me of the the way Japanese yuzu fruit smells.</li>
            <li>the lemon soap Nubian offers.</li>
            <li>I wondered how it would smell having tea tree oil in it, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Will buy this lotion from Whole Foods next time.</li>
            <li>but whatever SB Natural is selling is not it.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t linger long, so after initially brightening the mood, like most of the citrusy scents do, it won&#x27;t interfere with other scents you might use or if you prefer no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I live at a high elevation in a very dry climate.  </li>
            <li>Of all the Nubian body lotions, this is my favorite with raw shea butter and lemongrass as my second and third.</li>
            <li>like I do, as you get older, your nose pores get larger, your skin gets redder and going out in public can be embarrasing.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these not only for the athlete&#x27;s foot, but for regular purposes.</li>
            <li>It makes the veins not stand out as much because of all the other things going on bringing attention to them.</li>
            <li>I am a white older female with terribly dry skin.</li>

            <li> I am a white older female with terribly dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband always leans in for a long sniff when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> These lotions had strong orange scent instead of the usual subtle lemongrass.  </li>
            <li> Used together regularly, soap first, then lotion, I noticed dramatic improvements.  </li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I heard the lemon soap can be drying, and when the skin gets too dry, it overproduces oil (which is NOT what I want since my skin is oily already).</li>
            <li> When I wash my hands they dry out leaving them to look worst.....and uuuugggghhhh the veins.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American female and at my age my skin does change and looks a little dull.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune on products that do not work.</li>
            <li> The Lemongrass and Tea Tree lotions that I had purchased from A-Z Shopping were of a different quality from the other Nubian Heritage lotions that I bought in the past from other stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little shiny/oily, but that works for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It more reminds me of a bug repellent than a yummy personal care product.</li>
            <li> Is not worth returning it</li>
            <li> A little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> gave it four stars because I&#x27;m really not excited about the scent.</li>
            <li> It is a little fruity for a guy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> its too heavy going on.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that this is a very thick body cream</li>
            <li> If you need a little extra moisturizer after use, I have been using organic cold pressed coconut oil, as it doesn&#x27;t clog pores or contain harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a long time but the one I got from SB Naturals is fake.</li>
            <li> It is really thick, almost a cream.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is decently thick and there&#x27;s no pump included.</li>

            <li> If you have adult acne rosacea like I do, as you get older, your nose pores get larger, your skin gets redder and going out in public can be embarrasing.  Two products I purchased recently have helped me immensely...10% sulfur soap and this wonderful product.  Used together regularly, soap first, then lotion, I noticed dramatic improvements.  My face redness is going away, my nose pores are noticably smaller and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch.  This product has a thick, rich consistency and a nice scent, even with the addition of Tea Tree Oil. I use it liberally throughout the day on my face and on weekends, I put it on my scalp for 30 minutes then wash it out with the sulfur soap and warm water. If you need a little extra moisturizer after use, I have been using organic cold pressed coconut oil, as it doesn&#x27;t clog pores or contain harsh chemicals.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for pain and acne</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father who has severe eczema.  It really helped and my mom is also using it.  Lemongrass scent is a winner.</li>
            <li> This product works great to moisturize sensitive skin without any greasiness but had a strong waxy smell that was uncomfortably overpowering. .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this wonderful &#x27;lotion&#x27; for a year and a half.  It is really thick, almost a cream.  The lemongrass scent is refreshing and just divine.  The scent doesn&#x27;t linger long, so after initially brightening the mood, like most of the citrusy scents do, it won&#x27;t interfere with other scents you might use or if you prefer no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this as a face cream/lotion as well as on hands, arms, legs and it is perfect for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this because it is made with no toxic ingredients I don&#x27;t want to absorb in my body.</li>
            <li> My family&#x27;s a huge fan of this stuff. The one has a lighter scent, fresh and well suited to the summer months. The only issue is you&#x27;ll need to cut open the bottle to get all the lotion out! This stuff is decently thick and there&#x27;s no pump included.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST, I WILL GET MORE!</li>
            <li> I first bought this stuff from Whole foods because they had a tester. I normally don&#x27;t go in for the high priced stuff they sell there, but this stuff was reasonable and the combination of lemon verbena oil and orange oil was absolutely intoxicating. It really reminds me of the the way Japanese yuzu fruit smells. The lotion has all natural ingredients and does a great job on my rashy skin, even in the in the middle of winter.</li>
            <li> Really like this lotion. Smell is subtle. Makes my skin smooth. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion with the lemon soap Nubian offers. For one, this lotion is VERY thick, smells AMAZING, and does not clog my pores. I can break out if the wind hits my face the wrong way, but this lotion is perfect! I bought this lotion because I heard the lemon soap can be drying, and when the skin gets too dry, it overproduces oil (which is NOT what I want since my skin is oily already). This lotion is also great for body, but I use about a dime size for my face every morning and night when washing my face. I could use this lotion on my face, but I have a water softener in my house, so it isn&#x27;t really necessary. I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have mild athletes foot that occurs time to time.  So after learning that the tea tree oil is effective on it, I bought these lotion with Nubian Lemongrass &amp; Tea Tree Soaps.  I use the soap to wash my feet and put on the lotion.  It seems to have gotten rid of any signs of athlete&#x27;s foot after using it for about three weeks.  I love it!  I also like the fragrance of both of these products.  I would highly recommend these not only for the athlete&#x27;s foot, but for regular purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I swear it&#x27;s reduced wrinkles and my skin feels more youthful.  It&#x27;s a little shiny/oily, but that works for my dry skin.  Very happy with it.  I really like the smell, and I agree that the scent is strong at first but will disappear.</li>
            <li> its too heavy going on.  And the smell of it has nothing to do with tea or lemmongrass.  It&#x27;s orange.  You smell like an orange smoothie</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick and creamy. It helped sooth my hands after working on the hardwoods floors in my house. And it smells delicious</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite lotion. I take it with me everywhere. So many things to love....  The scent is amazing, but not cloying, and doesn&#x27;t bother my overactive sinuses.  My husband always leans in for a long sniff when I put it on.  He says it smells like oranges, whereas it smells like lemondrop candies to me, with a hint of orange.  And it&#x27;s organic, which is also a big plus. A little goes a loooong way. From just using it on my extremities, 1 bottle lasted over a year. I actually had enough left in it to give it to a friend who had commented on how good it smelled. I had just purchased a new bottle, otherwise I would never have given it up.  I just hope they never discontinue this lotion.  The only downside to it is the thickness. I know, that&#x27;s usually a plus, but it&#x27;s very difficult to shake it down and squeeze it out, and no pump bottle options, so store upside down!  With that said, thinning it put would probably ruin it.  I would pay big bucks for a larger size in a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> This lotion is PERFECT for anyone with dry skin. It is very moisturizing and stays that way all day. It doesn&#x27;t smell as wonderful as the soap / mostly because it&#x27;s missing the orange spice. I like it anyway.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, keeps skin so soft and smelling good. I tried it by accident and very proud of the accident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the NH Lemongrass and Tea Tree soap for almost a year now and absolutely love it so I decided to try the lotion as well. This lotion is amazing! Rich, thick, absorbs quickly, and smells great. The scent is rather strong at first but it fades quickly. It keeps my skin well hydrated throughout the day. While I purchased it with the intent to use on my body, I did use it on my face a couple of times when I ran out of my face cream and it was great too. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am picky when using anything on my body.....at age 49 my hands are not the most flattering.  I love this because of my hands have shown improvement since using it.  I am an African American female and at my age my skin does change and looks a little dull.  When I wash my hands they dry out leaving them to look worst.....and uuuugggghhhh the veins.  After using this each time I wash my hands throughout the day, my hands have show improvement of textures and softness.  It makes the veins not stand out as much because of all the other things going on bringing attention to them.</li>
            <li> I wondered how it would smell having tea tree oil in it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, but has a pleasant aroma. It&#x27;s wonderfully hydrating. After only using it twice my hands are soft and smooth. It absorbs quickly without leaving an oily residue. The skin being our largest organ, anything we use topically is absorbed into the blood stream. It&#x27;s nice to know Nubian Heritage &amp;#34;Lemongrass and Tea Tree&amp;#34; body lotion ingredients are safe to use.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping . Good stuff. I like it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This lotion is so awesome.  I bought it for my daughter also because  I liked it so good.</li>
            <li> This lotion moisturizes very well. I would say it is  Better or equal to products such as Eucerin. I don&#x27;t necessarily like the smell. It&#x27;s not bad and actually smells good but I don&#x27;t like smelling like furniture polish.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion a lot! It absorbs quicklu and leaves my skin soft and smoorh for more than 24 hours. Ashiness is no longer a problem.</li>
            <li> The Lemongrass and Tea Tree lotions that I had purchased from A-Z Shopping were of a different quality from the other Nubian Heritage lotions that I bought in the past from other stores.  These lotions had strong orange scent instead of the usual subtle lemongrass.  The texture was runny and not as thick.  It also dried kind of sticky.  Can&#x27;t help but doubt the authenticity of this product from A-Z Shopping.  Will buy this lotion from Whole Foods next time.</li>
            <li> WOW!  I purchased this lotion after I had such a great experience with the Lemongrass and Tea Tree Soap of the same brand.  I wanted something I could use between showering to help my skin.  This product has ingredients that fight inflammation.  I was pleasantly surprised with how GOOD this lotion smells.  It smells almost good enough to eat!  Lemon!  I will definitely be buying more of this product - and soon.</li>
            <li> I am a white older female with terribly dry skin. This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I showered with the lemongrass and tea tree soap and followed with the lotion all  over including my face. For the first time in years my skin is soft and not flaky. The soap smells fresh and wonderful and rinses clean. The lotion is like butter melting into warm skin, but not greasy. I have spent a fortune on products that do not work. I will never buy anything else!</li>
            <li> I first started using this lotion three days after I got sun-burnt on the beach. At the time the redness of my skin started subsiding already but the fact that impressed me was - I experienced no peeling. My skin looked and felt nicely moisturized and redness turned into tan - which is usually not the case with my fair complexion. To me it looks like this body lotion might be a good choice to use after the sun-bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because I&#x27;m really not excited about the scent. It more reminds me of a bug repellent than a yummy personal care product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick, goes on well , leaves you skin soft, and smells lovely! It is a great value for your money.</li>
            <li> I love the lemon smell. This leaves the body smooth. When you first put it on you feel the tea tree oil which soaks into the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing.  It truly moisturizes for 24 hrs.  I live at a high elevation in a very dry climate.  I use this lotion all over my body. The cheery lemongrass scent is strong at application, but fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this is a very thick body cream and it would work better to have it packaged in a squeezable tube.  I am having difficulty retrieving the last third of the lotion left in the bottle.  I would have given it five stars if not for the packaging.</li>
            <li> Sweet, the smells and textures and way it makes me feel...pure sensual healing for your skin. I buy it in the largest bottles they make, 4 at a time. I will never tire of this lotion. Of all the Nubian body lotions, this is my favorite with raw shea butter and lemongrass as my second and third.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a long time but the one I got from SB Naturals is fake. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like lemongrass but just something sweet, cloying and  cheap. It smells so sweet it makes me sick to my stomach. It is also very oily and it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin but just sits on top. I love de original lemongrass lotion but whatever SB Natural is selling is not it. Is not worth returning it so I&#x27;ll throw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Great stuff....helped with my skin condition combined with use of tea tree oil.  Nothing else worked, even over the counter eczema lotions.  Buying more right now.  It is a little fruity for a guy but I do not care, it works.</li>
