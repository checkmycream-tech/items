            <li>good product for stiffening up fine hair, but bottle exploded when I opened it and powder went everywhere.  </li>
            <li>love this ,works amazing .Probably</li>
            <li>(then kind of part an inch to each side and tap s&#x27;more)</li>
            <li>Good price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products as it helps with oil control and gives my hair lots of volume and texture.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Never use there must be a better product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend adding to top of hair, but rather parting hair by comb and adding to roots.</li>
            <li>I tried this product using tape on the top thinking</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay emergency product but doesn&#x27;t have the texture or grip that Redkin has.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting more volume...  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I loooovvvvveeee this stuff :)</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I want more lift.  </li>
            <li>It is like magic.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and it&#x27;s on my must have list.</li>
            <li>Interesting stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>None of these products wash out easily, but this one does better than the Regis counterpart.  </li>
            <li>lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This gives my fine hair great texture and major fullness.</li>
            <li>My hair is somewhat fine</li>
            <li>on a boyfriend crop cut with a head of fine hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its because my hair is fine or</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and fine.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing and Texturizing powder.  </li>
            <li>You have to work with it, but like all Big Sexy Hair products I have purchased they are all good.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Redkin brand by far.</li>
            <li>Really gives hair more texture, more substance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be good to go when your next important event or date arrives.</li>
            <li>Wow, am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>it works and it is not bad for your health being made of rice powder.</li>
            <li>I barely sprinkle any into the section I want to tease and it gives the brush something to grab hold of, while somehow making my hair that it&#x27;s rubbed into feel thicker; it is like magic!</li>
            <li>but over all the product works great on hair that isn&#x27;t too weighed down by excess length.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how this stuff works, but it does!  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about this product.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I like it enough to keep using it on my own</li>
            <li>you only need a light, SUPER LIGHT, dusting.</li>
            <li>Great stuff once you get past the learning curve.</li>
            <li>This product is great for my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome product and for those people saying it makes your hair feel gross or &amp;#34;gritty,&amp;#34; you have to give it a little thought.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>I like it well enough to continue using it and buy some more.</li>
            <li>It might work well on thicker more coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I actually think I like the spray better.  </li>
            <li>When you put it in your hair it really has volumizing power!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Big Sexy Hair Powder Play for anyone who wants big sexy hair!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used  this magical powder on my hair and  I couldn&#x27;t believe the lift and volume iplus didn&#x27;t go flat all day.  </li>
            <li>There are too many holes in the top and too much product comes out which makes your hair sticky and dull.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use, and it keeps you hairstyle in place the entire day.</li>
            <li>the product grew less effective and I needed to take additional steps to keep volume (adding heat)</li>
            <li>Dry shampoo works better for me.</li>
            <li>but really this is what it takes to get the volume you want.  </li>
            <li>maybe I was getting too much at one time.  </li>
            <li>BUT I end up using almost the whole bottle for one day.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, your hair becomes gummy and sticky.  </li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;d you use the recommended amount, it doesn&#x27;t provide much volume.</li>
            <li>Came fast too</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spend much time applying this product - instead I just part my hair using my fingers or rat-tail comb and dab and rub the powder along the part.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and this powder provides great volume.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>But you don&#x27;t need to use that much per hairdo.</li>
            <li>makes it so much easier to style your hair.</li>
            <li>gives it so much body and lift.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you like to tease your hair, it&#x27;s so much easier with this product.  </li>
            <li>While this does add volume, it leaves hair feeling really coated.</li>
            <li>This is a great solution for flat and limp hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I live in L.A. where people mistakenly believe we have no humidity - LIES, I tell you!</li>
            <li>I deciding to buy this volumizing powder to go with a mousse I purchased to enhance the volume in my hair and while it is for the most part effective, it leaves my hair feeling dirty and gunky.</li>
            <li>I got to say though that is the only product that Big Sexy puts out that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I suppose I use a bit too much the first time but even reducing the application of it still makes my roots feel gross.</li>
            <li>I use it on newly shampooed hair to add volume to my roots.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely helps to give my hair more oomph and thickness, especially if you use it properly.</li>
            <li>Love using Powder play, redken has something similar but you Can never go wrong with Sexy Hair products.</li>
            <li>My hair has thinned over the years and getting any volume , especially on top was virtually impossible to achieve unless I back combed it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to chemicals don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised no one else mentioned this in the review.</li>
            <li>Works well on a humid day when no hairspray is used as it will allow natural curl to emerge and the weight of the product keeps hair from looking fuzzy.</li>
            <li>I assume that baby powder will give you the same results and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It is hard to tell how fast I am using it up, so it depends on how long it lasts if the cost is worthwhile to use it after every shampoo.</li>
            <li>Works OK, very small bottle.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I turn my head upside down and rub my scalp lightly to fluff up the hair even more.</li>
            <li>I noticed as my pin straight hair grew really long</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>It was totally brand new when i revived it</li>
            <li>I generally sprinkle it onto my finger tips and then rub my fingertips into my roots.</li>
            <li>Try it on a night when you have nowhere to go first, so you can master the crazy witch magic</li>
            <li>And you barely have to use any at all.</li>
            <li>However, it also creates a less than natural feel to hair and weights down fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like crazy witch magic!</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Have fine  thin hair and this made 100% difference.</li>
            <li>I have fine, somewhat thin, blonde hair.</li>

            <li> Afterwards, I turn my head upside down and rub my scalp lightly to fluff up the hair even more.</li>
            <li> I noticed as my pin straight hair grew really long</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> It was totally brand new when i revived it</li>
            <li> I generally sprinkle it onto my finger tips and then rub my fingertips into my roots.</li>
            <li> Try it on a night when you have nowhere to go first, so you can master the crazy witch magic</li>
            <li> And you barely have to use any at all.</li>
            <li> However, it also creates a less than natural feel to hair and weights down fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like crazy witch magic!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Have fine  thin hair and this made 100% difference.</li>
            <li> I have fine, somewhat thin, blonde hair.</li>
            <li> This, not only combats the moisture/humidity issue, but it turns my hair from flat, anorexic model to Jersey Girl in seconds.</li>
            <li> I have very short fine thin hair!</li>
            <li> It instantly attaches to the hair and makes it feel somewhat rough--</li>
            <li> It feels gross when you wash it out or get your hair wet though.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little to add instant texture and a bit of teasing will add tons of volume.</li>
            <li> This seems to do the same things as the more expensive brand and comes a few dollars cheaper than the other product.  </li>
            <li> I have thin blonde hair and using this really adds volume.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product from my hairdresser-and I love it since I have very thin hair, it gives me the volume I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> Someone had previously posted that this was essentially baby powder.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t tease the roots or do something to add volume, my hair will look weighted down and flat-- not flattering at all.  </li>
            <li> Felt like my pours were closed</li>
            <li> Then fluff the roots with you fingers and style.</li>
            <li> Did not really work for my hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle was almost empty when I received it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of other products in an attempt to achieve volume-- mousse, gels, whips, hairspray, etc.</li>
            <li> It almost makes your roots feel  slightly wet and weighted down.  </li>
            <li> It takes a use or two to get used to the texture, but if you literally just tap the bottle holding it on it&#x27;s side to create a slight dusting (rather than a pouring) and tap it all along the roots, center part</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry out my hair somewhat (and my hair is already dry), but still, I will continue to use it to get the look I want, which is edgy and texturized.  </li>
            <li> I know some people hate this, but I love the slight tacky feeling because I know it&#x27;s doing its job of fluffing my hair out.</li>
            <li> Gret to use with teasing your hair for slight bumps.</li>
            <li> pay $100 for a little bottle</li>
            <li> Dried my hair.</li>
            <li> This just kinda made my hair sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> I have thin, flat hair.</li>
            <li> WOW root color fix covers grey and thickens hair but does not make hair feel dirty and lasts 4 days between washes!</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say that a little goes along way!</li>
            <li> Just put a little on your hair, like a salt shaker!</li>
            <li> I had to wash hair in just a few minutes!  </li>
            <li> After I sprinkle a tiny bit on the area, I rub it into my scalp and the base of the section, nothing shows, it doesn&#x27;t feel or look any different, but it makes your hair do whatever you are trying to accomplish.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel dirty instantly.</li>
            <li> I wish this small bottle wasn&#x27;t as expensive as it is, though.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Kinda weird for a volumizing powder.</li>
            <li> Leaves a residue that feels weird.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> no thank you. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is good but not as good as some I&#x27;ve tried.  Doesn&#x27;t give the volume I was expecting so probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Made my head itch. I got to say though that is the only product that Big Sexy puts out that I don&#x27;t like. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I have thin, flat hair. This is one of my favorite products as it helps with oil control and gives my hair lots of volume and texture.</li>
            <li> does what it is advertised to do</li>
            <li> It has propylene glycol in it...a known carcinogen. no thank you. :( trying to cut back on carcinogens~~</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. A little goes a long way. Great for thinner hair. I have thin blonde hair and using this really adds volume. I generally sprinkle it onto my finger tips and then rub my fingertips into my roots. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel dirty instantly. If you&#x27;re sensitive to chemicals don&#x27;t but!!  I had to wash hair in just a few minutes!  Felt like my pours were closed and I got a migraine!  Never use there must be a better product. WOW root color fix covers grey and thickens hair but does not make hair feel dirty and lasts 4 days between washes!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST!  I have never seen it at this price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a similar product in the Regis Designline and wanted to find a cheaper alternative.  This seems to do the same things as the more expensive brand and comes a few dollars cheaper than the other product.  I use it on newly shampooed hair to add volume to my roots.  My hair is somewhat fine but I&#x27;ve got a lot of it.  If I don&#x27;t tease the roots or do something to add volume, my hair will look weighted down and flat-- not flattering at all.  I&#x27;ve used lots of other products in an attempt to achieve volume-- mousse, gels, whips, hairspray, etc. Not even teasing gets it like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is how it makes your hair feel.  It instantly attaches to the hair and makes it feel somewhat rough-- but really this is what it takes to get the volume you want.  None of these products wash out easily, but this one does better than the Regis counterpart.  I like it well enough to continue using it and buy some more.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product from my hairdresser-and I love it since I have very thin hair, it gives me the volume I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> You have to work with it, but like all Big Sexy Hair products I have purchased they are all good.</li>
            <li> This is a great solution for flat and limp hair like mine. You only need a little to add instant texture and a bit of teasing will add tons of volume. I don&#x27;t recommend adding to top of hair, but rather parting hair by comb and adding to roots. Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> love this ,works amazing .Probably the best hair product ever</li>
            <li> good product for stiffening up fine hair, but bottle exploded when I opened it and powder went everywhere.  I lost a lot of powder as a result.  Bottle was packaged well, but not something that should be sold thru the mail.  I&#x27;m surprised no one else mentioned this in the review.</li>
            <li> The product does create texture, and some additional density of the hair. However, it also creates a less than natural feel to hair and weights down fine hair. Works well on a humid day when no hairspray is used as it will allow natural curl to emerge and the weight of the product keeps hair from looking fuzzy. So it kinda works ..... on a boyfriend crop cut with a head of fine hair. It might work well on thicker more coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I deciding to buy this volumizing powder to go with a mousse I purchased to enhance the volume in my hair and while it is for the most part effective, it leaves my hair feeling dirty and gunky. Believe me when I say that a little goes along way! I suppose I use a bit too much the first time but even reducing the application of it still makes my roots feel gross. I don&#x27;t know if its because my hair is fine or what? Maybe it&#x27;s not made for finer hair. So beware of this product and the amount that you use. I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Always a great value when you can get a great price for named products like this!  I love the price and the value!</li>
            <li> I actually think I like the spray better.  I tried this product using tape on the top thinking maybe I was getting too much at one time.  I just don&#x27;t see the same benefit as the spray.</li>
            <li> It works BUT I end up using almost the whole bottle for one day. Just get hair spray since it&#x27;s easier to put on.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this product.  If you use too much, your hair becomes gummy and sticky.  But, I&#x27;d you use the recommended amount, it doesn&#x27;t provide much volume.</li>
            <li> it works and it is not bad for your health being made of rice powder.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this. Came fast too</li>
            <li> This product definitely helps to give my hair more oomph and thickness, especially if you use it properly. I have extremely fine, thin hair. I don&#x27;t spend much time applying this product - instead I just part my hair using my fingers or rat-tail comb and dab and rub the powder along the part. Afterwards, I turn my head upside down and rub my scalp lightly to fluff up the hair even more. This type of application works and seems to help my hair look somewhat thicker even the following day. I know some people hate this, but I love the slight tacky feeling because I know it&#x27;s doing its job of fluffing my hair out.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Redkin brand by far. It&#x27;s an okay emergency product but doesn&#x27;t have the texture or grip that Redkin has.</li>
            <li> already the 2nd bottle Ive bought...LOVE IT and will be buying more as soon as Im out of this one!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have thin hair and this powder provides great volume. I highly recommend this product. The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores. This gives my fine hair great texture and major fullness. It feels gross when you wash it out or get your hair wet though.  But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> this does work.  and there is no powdery residue on my scalp or hair..  I guess I was expecting more volume...  It does take out the oil and its good for when you have no time to wash your hair and youre going out...  don&#x27;t think I would get this again...</li>
            <li> This stuff works like a dream.  So easy to use, and it keeps you hairstyle in place the entire day. Just put a little on your hair, like a salt shaker! It does an amazing job of adding volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> Nice product and great service.</li>
            <li> I guess this is a so so product.  I assume that baby powder will give you the same results and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It almost makes your roots feel  slightly wet and weighted down.  Kinda weird for a volumizing powder.</li>
            <li> Hairstylist suggested it.I have very short fine thin hair! I love this product. IT does make my hair fuller and keeps it in shape all day. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Great product to use if you know what your doing. Gret to use with teasing your hair for slight bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan.  Didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference.  Felt a lot like I was putting baby powder on my hair. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly.  Leaves a residue that feels weird.</li>
            <li> Good price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> it works if you are using this product, doesn&#x27;t prevent any thing, such a big lie</li>
            <li> I loooovvvvveeee this stuff :)</li>
            <li> Works OK, very small bottle. But you don&#x27;t need to use that much per hairdo.</li>
            <li> i used this for my clip in extensions, sprinkle a tad and then clip your clip ins in!&lt;br /&gt;Makes them stay in place and keep just enough texture for all day wear.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> love this product. makes it so much easier to style your hair. gives it so much body and lift.&lt;br /&gt; easier to control</li>
            <li> I have fine, somewhat thin, blonde hair. Tried this on a whim just to see if it was different. Wow, am I glad I did!  Someone had previously posted that this was essentially baby powder. Nothing could be further from the truth.  A very light sprinkling of this stuff adds amazing texture to the hair, with no dulling whatsoever, and voila! Instant body. And you barely have to use any at all. I&#x27;ve never had anything like it before, and I&#x27;m never going to be without it again!</li>
            <li> ive used the stuff before and liked it but the salon did it. I don&#x27;t know if I like it enough to keep using it on my own</li>
            <li> Really gives hair more texture, more substance.  If you like to tease your hair, it&#x27;s so much easier with this product.  It gives your teasing comb something to grab onto!</li>
            <li> Keep your host happy when traveling by avoiding aerosol residue. Keep your man happy w/&amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> left my hair feeling gunky</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how this stuff works, but it does!  It gives me amazing body and control in the areas I want more lift.  It does seem to dry out my hair somewhat (and my hair is already dry), but still, I will continue to use it to get the look I want, which is edgy and texturized.  I wish this small bottle wasn&#x27;t as expensive as it is, though.  It is hard to tell how fast I am using it up, so it depends on how long it lasts if the cost is worthwhile to use it after every shampoo.</li>
            <li> the product is great. Its the same as it always is. Nothing wrong with it. It was totally brand new when i revived it and I&#x27;m happy about that!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It is like magic.  When you put it in your hair it really has volumizing power!  I always get compliments when I use it.</li>
            <li> The company was great, the item arrived even before the estimated time frame. This is an awesome product and for those people saying it makes your hair feel gross or &amp;#34;gritty,&amp;#34; you have to give it a little thought. This product is to give your hair volume and make it easier to tease, that&#x27;s how it does its job. It gives your hair great texture to do just that. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and sometimes my hair needs teasing to give it extra body, e.g., second day hair, after deep conditioning, close to a trim time, etc.  I did as another reviewer suggested and taped all but three holes. I barely sprinkle any into the section I want to tease and it gives the brush something to grab hold of, while somehow making my hair that it&#x27;s rubbed into feel thicker; it is like magic! I get lift and volume. I absolutely love this product and it&#x27;s on my must have list. After I sprinkle a tiny bit on the area, I rub it into my scalp and the base of the section, nothing shows, it doesn&#x27;t feel or look any different, but it makes your hair do whatever you are trying to accomplish. Awesome!</li>
            <li> LOVE it! Have fine  thin hair and this made 100% difference. My hair feels thicker ,styles easier ,extensions were great with it. Just tape across part of the holes and it&#x27;s just enough ! Use sparingly as you section at roots then tease! Wash out is  a breeze!!! Second day &amp;#34;no wash&amp;#34; hair just as fabulous!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know how I lived without this 58 yrs but not going to a minute longer!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d pay $100 for a little bottle it works that well!!</li>
            <li> While this does add volume, it leaves hair feeling really coated. I can&#x27;t stand the feel of my hair when I have this stuff in. Interesting stuff. But it does the job.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair. Did not like product.</li>
            <li> Love using Powder play, redken has something similar but you Can never go wrong with Sexy Hair products. It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and fine.  I like the way this adds texture.  Makes my hair feel like &amp;#34;second day&amp;#34; hair (in a good way!).  The only problem is the packaging.  There are too many holes in the top and too much product comes out which makes your hair sticky and dull.  I covered up all but 2 of the holes with tape.  Problem solved.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing and Texturizing powder.  My hair has thinned over the years and getting any volume , especially on top was virtually impossible to achieve unless I back combed it. My hairdresser used  this magical powder on my hair and  I couldn&#x27;t believe the lift and volume iplus didn&#x27;t go flat all day.  I highly recommend Big Sexy Hair Powder Play for anyone who wants big sexy hair!</li>
            <li> This product is great for my fine thin hair.  I will definitely will buy  it again.  lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I noticed as my pin straight hair grew really long the product grew less effective and I needed to take additional steps to keep volume (adding heat) but over all the product works great on hair that isn&#x27;t too weighed down by excess length.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s like crazy witch magic! I live in L.A. where people mistakenly believe we have no humidity - LIES, I tell you! This, not only combats the moisture/humidity issue, but it turns my hair from flat, anorexic model to Jersey Girl in seconds. It also seems to keep my style in place. It takes a use or two to get used to the texture, but if you literally just tap the bottle holding it on it&#x27;s side to create a slight dusting (rather than a pouring) and tap it all along the roots, center part (then kind of part an inch to each side and tap s&#x27;more) you only need a light, SUPER LIGHT, dusting. Then fluff the roots with you fingers and style. Great stuff once you get past the learning curve. Try it on a night when you have nowhere to go first, so you can master the crazy witch magic and you&#x27;ll be good to go when your next important event or date arrives.</li>
            <li> I found it to be tacky. Not for me.</li>
            <li> Did not really work for my hair.Dry shampoo works better for me.This just kinda made my hair sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> The bottle was almost empty when I received it.</li>
