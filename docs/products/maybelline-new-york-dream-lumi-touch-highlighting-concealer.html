            <li>This concealer is amazing!</li>
            <li>Perfect for under the eyes to highlight your cheek bones and on the nose for contouring :)</li>
            <li>I have a somewhat fair complexion</li>
            <li>I find this color is still good for highlighting when I have tanner on my skin.  </li>
            <li>When applied with a makeup sponge, or even my finger, it is good buildable coverage for acne and undereye circles.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good every day concealer.</li>
            <li>It was sold out with good reason.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t as good as the YSL version, so let&#x27;s just get that out  of the way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good under eye concealer for....</li>
            <li>It was a good deal.</li>
            <li>im super exited its so awesome!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a Touche Eclat knockoff, and it does a pretty impressive job of being a Touche Eclat</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for highlighting my face when doing makeup!</li>
            <li>I love what this concealer does for my highlighting process!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>But I do that without the need for more concealer, which is another plus in my book!  </li>
            <li>After all my years using makeup and cosmetics, I will say that this IS one of my favorite products ever!  </li>
            <li>Staying power not so great but its easy to chuck in your handbag to reapply.</li>
            <li>I also end up with a nice, healthy glow (highlighting effect indeed!)</li>
            <li>Very light, looks good as an undereye brightener.</li>
            <li>Very nice product, easy to use and helps lighten wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Really smooth finish and great price.</li>
            <li>it does highlight nicely, but then it stats to blotch and look caked on my oily skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really handy on-the-go</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the effect.</li>
            <li>Its a nice concealer</li>
            <li>but this a lot cheaper and is just as good or better.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice; I like the twist up bottom, and though some may worry about how hygienic the brush is, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>purchased this product because I had heard so many good things about it.</li>
            <li>Covers well, blends and feels so nice</li>
            <li>this is a good fit.  </li>
            <li>Love it for directly under and over my brows after coloring in for that perfect shape and lift!!</li>
            <li>I still use my finger tip to dab it into my skin but the results are pretty great.</li>
            <li>Its very light with a tinge of pinkish.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and blends well.  </li>
            <li>You can use it purely as a concealer or swipe some over your cheekbones for a great highlighter.</li>
            <li>Love the coverage and staying power</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so  can get more of a value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave this product a chance.</li>
            <li>Love the highlighting that this product gives you</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but there are better ones out there.</li>
            <li>Love this concealer..</li>
            <li>Wish there was more in the bottle though.  </li>
            <li>It has a great consistancy and matches my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, this is one of  the highlighting/concealers on the market</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell the two apart once they had been applied, and I like the color variety of Maybelline better.</li>
            <li>, that always happens when i love a product or shade.  </li>
            <li>I have used couple of concealers that are $20 more and this is still better.</li>
            <li>Just ok for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that you could build the coverage to cover circles or darkness, I just don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a great dupe for some higher-end highlighters, so you really are getting the most for your money with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this and wear it every day.</li>
            <li>Love this product for highlighting purposes.  </li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>My color skin is white-pinkish (more on the white side) and this Ivory tone worked wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite product ever, for lightening and brightening...</li>
            <li>I say I love it?</li>
            <li>I love this product for days when I have under eye circles or need to camouflage some redness.  </li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day when set with some powder</li>
            <li>i LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I am pretty fair but not ghostly</li>
            <li>the color is perfect, it hid my dark circles and large freckles, and it blends very nicely.</li>
            <li>so I have to dab the fine lines with my finger tip once more.  </li>
            <li>The finish was perfect, not dewy but not really matte, and it brightened my face instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly light in consistency, so it doesn&#x27;t offer the sort of coverage needed to cover up the blue/purple tinges that most of us have under our eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and control application.  </li>
            <li>The applicator makes it easy to feather out the color.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and blends well</li>
            <li>This dual action highlighter &amp; concealer by Maybelline is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m plagued with really dark under eye circles, this highlighter is the best one I&#x27;ve found to highlight and conceal!</li>
            <li>I love the coverage, not bad for a drug store concealer.  </li>
            <li>but besides that it dries very quickly so make sure you work quick once</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines under my eyes, covers darkness and gives a sublte highliting effect.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful, being that it was just a Mabelline product, but after using it, I am considering using more of their products!  </li>
            <li>But since I am looking for a bargain replacement, I certainly don&#x27;t expect it to be AS good, just good enough.</li>
            <li>its so light and doesnt even feel like</li>
            <li>I use it under my eyes primarily.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the overall effect, though, and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>ever I think, and this had such great reviews on beauty sites</li>
            <li>i saw this product on maskcara.com and decided to try it since im too cheap to by clinique.</li>
            <li>I first bought this about a year ago on a lark and wound up loving it, I use the radiant one, At first when i tried it i thought it may be too light</li>
            <li>Yes, but I&#x27;d probably try another brand that has a better applicator first.  </li>
            <li>Not thick at all, very brightening and kind of dewy..not a ton of coverage, but does the job under my eyes.!</li>
            <li>I really love the way this concealer goes on smooth, thanks to the brush applicator.  </li>
            <li>use it in the inner corners of my eyes, radiating downward under both eyes, even on my nose, cupid&#x27;s bow, dab on my chin, and anywhere else I need to look light and bright.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super translucent pale and it&#x27;s a great match, and very light both in color and consistency.</li>
            <li>and she was right!</li>
            <li>As a highlighter it is great - it doesn&#x27;t have the sort of glow that YSL does, but it is close - bringing lightness to areas that I want to highlight, like the bridge of my nose, center of my chin and forehead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel like this is a good buy, since the one tube will probably only have lasted me a month or so.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to apply exactly where you need it and</li>
            <li>It has quickly become a staple!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>After about 20-30 mins, I do a quick take in the mirror and dab under my eyes again - it has staying power</li>
            <li>I chose the ivory at first and it works for me in the winter (nc25, fair white skin)</li>
            <li>If you want to save a few bucks and get the same amazing results, this is a great alternative to the YSL.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used concealers and/or highlighters by MAC, Amazing cosmetics, Stila, Laura Mercier, and others offered by Maybelline, but I will definitely be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li>Tis right up there with the high-end products that the pros use, softening and brightening just where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i am very, very, very low-maintenance with make up.</li>
            <li>The color and consistency of this product are good, but I find that I&#x27;ve gone through this tube of concealer really fast, a LOT faster than other types of concealer, and I don&#x27;t even use a lot at one time - I just use it around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the shops, convenience of not having to go shopping.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as it was billed.  </li>
            <li>The actual make up is magic.  </li>
            <li>NO TOO MUCH!  </li>
            <li>At first, I was unsure what all the hype was about.</li>
            <li>It provides a soft light efect.  </li>
            <li>It gives my face a nice glow and cover my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>the maybelline concealer was creamy and looked super natural.</li>
            <li>The color is great and it is easy to use, but unfortunately made my sensitive skin break out.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch, and it works really well.</li>
            <li>and there really isn&#x27;t much difference except $.</li>
            <li>I had to get rid of this as it really made my eyes burn.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will purchase a regual foundation makeup in the light color instead</li>
            <li>Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li>I just seem to go through it really fast</li>
            <li>I really like this concealer.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get much for the money</li>
            <li>I guess I expected more.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t illuminate anything really.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage in terms of a concealer.</li>
            <li>The formula isn&#x27;t as creamy, the coverage isn&#x27;t quite as smooth and opaque and the packaging definitely feels cheaper.</li>
            <li>It really brightens my whole eye area and face.</li>
            <li>It is a tad too much for the daytime.</li>
            <li>I truly like it, although I think that today I learned that I have been applying too much.</li>
            <li>This product was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It really does brighten and it&#x27;s my go to now.  </li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 3 stars is that you really can&#x27;t use the brush it comes with to blend.  </li>
            <li>but it works very well.</li>
            <li>It works well for highlighting and for covering up red-tinted blemishes, but it doesn&#x27;t do much at all for under-eye circles.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as opaque as Laura Mercier&#x27;s Secret Camouflage, but I felt it looked more natural and didn&#x27;t settle into my new fine lines that come with sleep deprivation!</li>
            <li>Only thing is it runs out fairly quickly</li>
            <li>(I like to use it around the nose area too) and it does a decent job covering up zits when the occasion arises.  </li>
            <li>Purchased as read it was a dupe for another high end product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The formula covers nicely (I use it under my eyes) to cover red or dark spots.</li>
            <li>Comes out kind of slow though.</li>
            <li>It does kinda settle into fine lines a little bit too much for my liking.</li>
            <li>Overall, this gives the right amount of coverage for highlighting.  </li>
            <li>I also used it for &#x27;spot touches&#x27; where I have hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline New York Dream Lumi Touch Highlighting Concealer, Ivory, 0.05.</li>
            <li>It also has a subtle shimmer to it which is nice for highlighting.</li>
            <li>and it compares favorably to the most expensive ones available.</li>
            <li>love the way it brightens up my eyes and how little I have to use!</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and this is the first Maybelline product that actually hurt.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like it at first, try applying it differently -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, definitely not full coverage</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ll use this sparingly for highlighting and the occasional mild blemish, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li>However it is a little too light for concealing b/c</li>
            <li>but I used self-tanner frequently.  </li>
            <li>Prices on Amazn change frequently</li>
            <li>for the real test: does it look the same as YSL once it is on your skin?</li>
            <li>I wish it lasted longer as I have to touch it up several times a day, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much in the vial to begin with.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have much in the tube after you get it to actually start coming out.</li>
            <li>It maybe doesn&#x27;t completely cover up my under eye circles</li>
            <li>I tried it as my mascara had been rubbing into my creamier old concealer as the day went on.  </li>
            <li>so much, I&#x27;m purchasing several, just in case they discontinue it (please don&#x27;t, Maybelline!), and one for my purse.  </li>
            <li>It may not have have a HEAVY coverage that some are looking for but you&#x27;ll find your skin looks much better just using it to perk up specific areas of the face.  </li>
            <li>I get kind of tired of paying over 20 bucks a pop for the YSL Touche Eclat (which this product is trying to compete with).</li>
            <li>You do have to re-apply half way throught the day, but that is true with all concealers.</li>
            <li>Have used this for a long time and certainly will purchase again.</li>
            <li>so if you are not fair skinned (Classic Ivory, Ivory or Light beige) don&#x27;t try this</li>
            <li>It gave me better coverage and staying power than another highlighting concealer I got from a certain Secret place!  </li>
            <li>i have EXTREMELY dark circles and it covers them right up.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that to access more product, you twist the tube.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of the liquid, not too thin.  </li>
            <li>Great, less expensive alternative to the YSL Touche Eclait.</li>
            <li>After applying it with my fingers I disliked the finish and it didn&#x27;t seem to highlight my face right.</li>
            <li>not dark enough for me.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, this doesn&#x27;t actually cover much.</li>
            <li>a little yellow tendency, and theres isn&#x27;t very much product in there</li>
            <li>the hard candy settles into lines i didnt even think were there and was super chalky.</li>
            <li>This pretty little fat &#x27;pen&#x27; will highlight, conceal and brighten anywhere you put it!  </li>

            <li> Great coverage.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you contour/highlight your face</li>
            <li> All in all thought it&#x27;s a great highlighter.</li>
            <li> great quality product.</li>
            <li> Great for concealing under eyes.</li>
            <li> it gave me a great glow under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This concealer is amazing!</li>
            <li> Perfect for under the eyes to highlight your cheek bones and on the nose for contouring :)</li>
            <li> I have a somewhat fair complexion</li>
            <li> I find this color is still good for highlighting when I have tanner on my skin.  </li>
            <li> When applied with a makeup sponge, or even my finger, it is good buildable coverage for acne and undereye circles.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good every day concealer.</li>
            <li> It was sold out with good reason.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t as good as the YSL version, so let&#x27;s just get that out  of the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good under eye concealer for....</li>
            <li> It was a good deal.</li>
            <li> im super exited its so awesome!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a Touche Eclat knockoff, and it does a pretty impressive job of being a Touche Eclat</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for highlighting my face when doing makeup!</li>
            <li> I love what this concealer does for my highlighting process!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> But I do that without the need for more concealer, which is another plus in my book!  </li>
            <li> After all my years using makeup and cosmetics, I will say that this IS one of my favorite products ever!  </li>
            <li> Staying power not so great but its easy to chuck in your handbag to reapply.</li>
            <li> I also end up with a nice, healthy glow (highlighting effect indeed!)</li>
            <li> Very light, looks good as an undereye brightener.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, easy to use and helps lighten wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Really smooth finish and great price.</li>
            <li> it does highlight nicely, but then it stats to blotch and look caked on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really handy on-the-go</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the effect.</li>
            <li> Its a nice concealer</li>
            <li> but this a lot cheaper and is just as good or better.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice; I like the twist up bottom, and though some may worry about how hygienic the brush is, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> purchased this product because I had heard so many good things about it.</li>
            <li> Covers well, blends and feels so nice</li>
            <li> this is a good fit.  </li>
            <li> Love it for directly under and over my brows after coloring in for that perfect shape and lift!!</li>
            <li> I still use my finger tip to dab it into my skin but the results are pretty great.</li>
            <li> Its very light with a tinge of pinkish.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and blends well.  </li>
            <li> You can use it purely as a concealer or swipe some over your cheekbones for a great highlighter.</li>
            <li> Love the coverage and staying power</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> so  can get more of a value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I gave this product a chance.</li>
            <li> Love the highlighting that this product gives you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but there are better ones out there.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer..</li>
            <li> Wish there was more in the bottle though.  </li>
            <li> It has a great consistancy and matches my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, this is one of  the highlighting/concealers on the market</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell the two apart once they had been applied, and I like the color variety of Maybelline better.</li>
            <li> , that always happens when i love a product or shade.  </li>
            <li> I have used couple of concealers that are $20 more and this is still better.</li>
            <li> Just ok for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that you could build the coverage to cover circles or darkness, I just don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a great dupe for some higher-end highlighters, so you really are getting the most for your money with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this and wear it every day.</li>
            <li> Love this product for highlighting purposes.  </li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> My color skin is white-pinkish (more on the white side) and this Ivory tone worked wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite product ever, for lightening and brightening...</li>
            <li> I say I love it?</li>
            <li> I love this product for days when I have under eye circles or need to camouflage some redness.  </li>
            <li> It lasts most of the day when set with some powder</li>
            <li> i LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I am pretty fair but not ghostly</li>
            <li> the color is perfect, it hid my dark circles and large freckles, and it blends very nicely.</li>
            <li> so I have to dab the fine lines with my finger tip once more.  </li>
            <li> The finish was perfect, not dewy but not really matte, and it brightened my face instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly light in consistency, so it doesn&#x27;t offer the sort of coverage needed to cover up the blue/purple tinges that most of us have under our eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and control application.  </li>
            <li> The applicator makes it easy to feather out the color.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and blends well</li>
            <li> This dual action highlighter &amp; concealer by Maybelline is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m plagued with really dark under eye circles, this highlighter is the best one I&#x27;ve found to highlight and conceal!</li>
            <li> I love the coverage, not bad for a drug store concealer.  </li>
            <li> but besides that it dries very quickly so make sure you work quick once</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines under my eyes, covers darkness and gives a sublte highliting effect.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful, being that it was just a Mabelline product, but after using it, I am considering using more of their products!  </li>
            <li> But since I am looking for a bargain replacement, I certainly don&#x27;t expect it to be AS good, just good enough.</li>
            <li> its so light and doesnt even feel like</li>
            <li> I use it under my eyes primarily.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the overall effect, though, and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> ever I think, and this had such great reviews on beauty sites</li>
            <li> i saw this product on maskcara.com and decided to try it since im too cheap to by clinique.</li>
            <li> I first bought this about a year ago on a lark and wound up loving it, I use the radiant one, At first when i tried it i thought it may be too light</li>
            <li> Yes, but I&#x27;d probably try another brand that has a better applicator first.  </li>
            <li> Not thick at all, very brightening and kind of dewy..not a ton of coverage, but does the job under my eyes.!</li>
            <li> I really love the way this concealer goes on smooth, thanks to the brush applicator.  </li>
            <li> use it in the inner corners of my eyes, radiating downward under both eyes, even on my nose, cupid&#x27;s bow, dab on my chin, and anywhere else I need to look light and bright.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super translucent pale and it&#x27;s a great match, and very light both in color and consistency.</li>
            <li> and she was right!</li>
            <li> As a highlighter it is great - it doesn&#x27;t have the sort of glow that YSL does, but it is close - bringing lightness to areas that I want to highlight, like the bridge of my nose, center of my chin and forehead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t feel like this is a good buy, since the one tube will probably only have lasted me a month or so.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to apply exactly where you need it and</li>
            <li> It has quickly become a staple!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After about 20-30 mins, I do a quick take in the mirror and dab under my eyes again - it has staying power</li>
            <li> I chose the ivory at first and it works for me in the winter (nc25, fair white skin)</li>
            <li> If you want to save a few bucks and get the same amazing results, this is a great alternative to the YSL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used concealers and/or highlighters by MAC, Amazing cosmetics, Stila, Laura Mercier, and others offered by Maybelline, but I will definitely be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> Tis right up there with the high-end products that the pros use, softening and brightening just where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i am very, very, very low-maintenance with make up.</li>
            <li> The color and consistency of this product are good, but I find that I&#x27;ve gone through this tube of concealer really fast, a LOT faster than other types of concealer, and I don&#x27;t even use a lot at one time - I just use it around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the shops, convenience of not having to go shopping.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as it was billed.  </li>
            <li> The actual make up is magic.  </li>
            <li> NO TOO MUCH!  </li>
            <li> At first, I was unsure what all the hype was about.</li>
            <li> It provides a soft light efect.  </li>
            <li> It gives my face a nice glow and cover my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> the maybelline concealer was creamy and looked super natural.</li>
            <li> The color is great and it is easy to use, but unfortunately made my sensitive skin break out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> and there really isn&#x27;t much difference except $.</li>
            <li> I had to get rid of this as it really made my eyes burn.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will purchase a regual foundation makeup in the light color instead</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> I just seem to go through it really fast</li>
            <li> I really like this concealer.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get much for the money</li>
            <li> I guess I expected more.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t illuminate anything really.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage in terms of a concealer.</li>
            <li> The formula isn&#x27;t as creamy, the coverage isn&#x27;t quite as smooth and opaque and the packaging definitely feels cheaper.</li>
            <li> It really brightens my whole eye area and face.</li>
            <li> It is a tad too much for the daytime.</li>
            <li> I truly like it, although I think that today I learned that I have been applying too much.</li>
            <li> This product was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It really does brighten and it&#x27;s my go to now.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 3 stars is that you really can&#x27;t use the brush it comes with to blend.  </li>
            <li> but it works very well.</li>
            <li> It works well for highlighting and for covering up red-tinted blemishes, but it doesn&#x27;t do much at all for under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as opaque as Laura Mercier&#x27;s Secret Camouflage, but I felt it looked more natural and didn&#x27;t settle into my new fine lines that come with sleep deprivation!</li>
            <li> Only thing is it runs out fairly quickly</li>
            <li> (I like to use it around the nose area too) and it does a decent job covering up zits when the occasion arises.  </li>
            <li> Purchased as read it was a dupe for another high end product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The formula covers nicely (I use it under my eyes) to cover red or dark spots.</li>
            <li> Comes out kind of slow though.</li>
            <li> It does kinda settle into fine lines a little bit too much for my liking.</li>
            <li> Overall, this gives the right amount of coverage for highlighting.  </li>
            <li> I also used it for &#x27;spot touches&#x27; where I have hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline New York Dream Lumi Touch Highlighting Concealer, Ivory, 0.05.</li>
            <li> It also has a subtle shimmer to it which is nice for highlighting.</li>
            <li> and it compares favorably to the most expensive ones available.</li>
            <li> love the way it brightens up my eyes and how little I have to use!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and this is the first Maybelline product that actually hurt.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it at first, try applying it differently -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, definitely not full coverage</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ll use this sparingly for highlighting and the occasional mild blemish, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> However it is a little too light for concealing b/c</li>
            <li> but I used self-tanner frequently.  </li>
            <li> Prices on Amazn change frequently</li>
            <li> for the real test: does it look the same as YSL once it is on your skin?</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted longer as I have to touch it up several times a day, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much in the vial to begin with.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have much in the tube after you get it to actually start coming out.</li>
            <li> It maybe doesn&#x27;t completely cover up my under eye circles</li>
            <li> I tried it as my mascara had been rubbing into my creamier old concealer as the day went on.  </li>
            <li> so much, I&#x27;m purchasing several, just in case they discontinue it (please don&#x27;t, Maybelline!), and one for my purse.  </li>
            <li> It may not have have a HEAVY coverage that some are looking for but you&#x27;ll find your skin looks much better just using it to perk up specific areas of the face.  </li>
            <li> I get kind of tired of paying over 20 bucks a pop for the YSL Touche Eclat (which this product is trying to compete with).</li>
            <li> You do have to re-apply half way throught the day, but that is true with all concealers.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a long time and certainly will purchase again.</li>
            <li> so if you are not fair skinned (Classic Ivory, Ivory or Light beige) don&#x27;t try this</li>
            <li> It gave me better coverage and staying power than another highlighting concealer I got from a certain Secret place!  </li>
            <li> i have EXTREMELY dark circles and it covers them right up.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that to access more product, you twist the tube.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of the liquid, not too thin.  </li>
            <li> Great, less expensive alternative to the YSL Touche Eclait.</li>
            <li> After applying it with my fingers I disliked the finish and it didn&#x27;t seem to highlight my face right.</li>
            <li> not dark enough for me.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, this doesn&#x27;t actually cover much.</li>
            <li> a little yellow tendency, and theres isn&#x27;t very much product in there</li>
            <li> the hard candy settles into lines i didnt even think were there and was super chalky.</li>
            <li> This pretty little fat &#x27;pen&#x27; will highlight, conceal and brighten anywhere you put it!  </li>
            <li> Lasts all day and hides dark circles while looking natural.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve hit my 40&#x27;s they just get worse and I can&#x27;t stand to use full coverage foundation.  </li>
            <li> but it does not not last very long.  </li>
            <li> I have to apply extra moisturizer before applying the &amp;#34;Dream Lumi Touch&amp;#34; to keep from getting that undesirable cakey, dry look.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a sheer but dry concealer (rather than creamy)</li>
            <li> I did not experience this problem with this product, but I found it too sheer and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible dark circles under my eyes, so I&#x27;m always looking for the perfect concealing/brightening miracle product.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, so be careful or your entire under eye area will be white and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will use this much as once I got it, only used it once and then got too lazy to put it on again.  </li>
            <li> The tip is an actual brush, and when you twist the base, it brings the liquid up through the center of the bristles, so it&#x27;s very easy to apply and get varying widths on lines.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that this amount doesn&#x27;t last very long as I&#x27;ve already needed to get another one.</li>
            <li> but you only need to use a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not even close.</li>
            <li> It says it only takes a few twists my in my experience</li>
            <li> My main complaint is that it does get a little cakey/dry.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It usually lasts all day, especially if set with powder.</li>
            <li> but it does not exactly stay as put throughout the day as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I use it on my forehead, down the center of my nose, tip of my chin, etc.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to try this out, because at a fourth of the price, you can hardly go wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it bought two different kinds of concealer (hard candy concealer) just to compare.</li>
            <li> Concealed my haven&#x27;t-slept-for-three-months dark circles under my eyes well.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this concealer does brighten the undereye area; however, if you have extremely dark circles then I would opt for something stronger.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t use it on my dark circles</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes since I was a kid (allergic shiners).</li>
            <li> and about medium coverage where my dark circles are concerned, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I do not personally have horrible under-eye circles, so I wanted a product that would give me minimal coverage and mostly act as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> In my experience, something thicker and with a more yellowy color base is what you need.</li>
            <li> It lasts about 4 or 5 hours (an hour less than YSL) and does the job.</li>
            <li> Buying this from Amazon cost less than from Rite Aide.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not super cheap :(</li>
            <li> The tube it comes in with a brush on the end requires a lot of turning sometimes to dispense the product, and the brush tends to cover my undereye circles unevenly.</li>
            <li> I feel like I waste a ton of product each time I use it because of the way it works.</li>
            <li> Check out my full review on my blog: [...]</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already half gone!</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like any sort of heavy makeup, and this was a little thick and gunky for my taste.</li>
            <li> There is an issue with the applicator which leaves about half an inch in the reservoir that is inaccessible and makes it hard to judge when you are out.</li>
            <li> Also if you take it on a flight it starts excessively coming out of the tip.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to blend.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a common problem with concealers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> so its a no win for me.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not a great look for the under eye area anyway, gets too cakey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted already.</li>
            <li> It is a little annoying how you have to twist the cap a ton of times before you get any product out</li>
            <li> I think I bought the wrong color</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not a lot of product in it, but it&#x27;s not too expensive</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t give a fake shimmery tone, either, ladies.  </li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>

            <li> Love the coverage and staying power this provides.  I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful, being that it was just a Mabelline product, but after using it, I am considering using more of their products!  It gave me better coverage and staying power than another highlighting concealer I got from a certain Secret place!  Will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My skin is very sensitive so I was a bit worried. It covers great and I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch, and it works really well. It&#x27;s like a Touche Eclat knockoff, and it does a pretty impressive job of being a Touche Eclat knockoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Touche Eclat is a cult Yves Saint Lauren concealer/highlighter.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a highlighter, though, so I wouldn&#x27;t use it to cover bumps or acne--it&#x27;s a highlighter.</li>
            <li> I am by nooooooooo means a makeup expert and I had never even heard of this... I came across it by searching for a different product and thought....&amp;#34;ehh. why not&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it brightens up my eyes and how little I have to use! It has quickly become a staple!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it creases  under my eyes throughout the day even if i moisturize and use a setting powder. it does highlight nicely, but then it stats to blotch and look caked on my oily skin. so its a no win for me.</li>
            <li> this is literally the best concealer ive ever used. i have EXTREMELY dark circles and it covers them right up. its so light and doesnt even feel like im wearing anything. doesnt wrinkle,</li>
            <li> This concealer does the trick. It is very similar to the Studio Gear one I have. The only difference is the Maybelline is a tad thicker. It does cover well and there really isn&#x27;t much difference except $.</li>
            <li> Overall, this gives the right amount of coverage for highlighting.  I use it under my eyes primarily.  The color works well as a highlighting shade.  I have a somewhat fair complexion but I used self-tanner frequently.  I find this color is still good for highlighting when I have tanner on my skin.  My main complaint is that it does get a little cakey/dry.  This seems to be a common problem with concealers.  I have to apply extra moisturizer before applying the &amp;#34;Dream Lumi Touch&amp;#34; to keep from getting that undesirable cakey, dry look.  It also has a subtle shimmer to it which is nice for highlighting.</li>
            <li> I think I bought the wrong color but besides that it dries very quickly so make sure you work quick once you.put it on your face.</li>
            <li> I had to get rid of this as it really made my eyes burn.  I have very sensitive skin and this is the first Maybelline product that actually hurt.  It could be just me though.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m super translucent pale and it&#x27;s a great match, and very light both in color and consistency. I use it to cover undereye circles and imperfections, and it&#x27;s perfect. The brush at the end is perfect for dabbing/brushing on product. Only thing is it runs out fairly quickly and there&#x27;s not a lot of product in it, but it&#x27;s not too expensive and it&#x27;s really handy on-the-go so I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Purchased as read it was a dupe for another high end product. This one caked under my eyes in my creases.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the shops, convenience of not having to go shopping. Great, less expensive alternative to the YSL Touche Eclait.</li>
            <li> I just received my product and it will not even come out of the dispenser.  I have given it over 200 twists and nothing.</li>
            <li> I have an olive skin tone with deep set eyes and lots of acne scarring. This product works great for me and I get lots of compliments when I wear it in combination with a bronzer and some blush. Great for highlighting under eyes, along cheekbones, nose and jawline. The tip is an actual brush, and when you twist the base, it brings the liquid up through the center of the bristles, so it&#x27;s very easy to apply and get varying widths on lines. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I use this on my cheekbones and blend with a beauty blender. Gives the best glow. I have med-fair skin.</li>
            <li> Concealed my haven&#x27;t-slept-for-three-months dark circles under my eyes well.  Wasn&#x27;t as opaque as Laura Mercier&#x27;s Secret Camouflage, but I felt it looked more natural and didn&#x27;t settle into my new fine lines that come with sleep deprivation!</li>
            <li> Just getting into makeup in my 30s...and bought this because Maskcara.com recommended it for a drug store concealer.  I use it around my eyes, and as a touch up wherever, and it doesn&#x27;t settle into wrinkles or look obvious.  It&#x27;s easy to use and control application.  I&#x27;ll purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I was told this was a dupe for YSL Touche Eclat. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s really not even close. It&#x27;s very thick and it&#x27;s hard to blend. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Got recomendation for this product from a YouTube video about highlighting and contouring. Product was exactly as it was billed.  Only problem is there is not alot of it in the container. Next time I will purchase a regual foundation makeup in the light color instead so  can get more of a value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a gel concealer in a much much more expensive brand but couldn&#x27;t pass this up for the price. I&#x27;m so glad I gave this product a chance. I got the lightest shade which is perfect for my very fair skin. Lasts all day and hides dark circles while looking natural. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love the highlighting that this product gives you but it does not not last very long.  There are products that will set your make-up but I have not tried one with this.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> I have terrible dark circles under my eyes, so I&#x27;m always looking for the perfect concealing/brightening miracle product. I bought this product after reading rave reviews online and I have to say I&#x27;m underwhelmed. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, so be careful or your entire under eye area will be white and shiny. I also tried using this for contouring and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the effect. It was just too shiny. I also don&#x27;t like any sort of heavy makeup, and this was a little thick and gunky for my taste. It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but there are better ones out there.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for highlighting my face when doing makeup! I just seem to go through it really fast and it&#x27;s not super cheap :(</li>
            <li> Excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Its very light with a tinge of pinkish. The cream comes out about the same color as what you see on the photo on your computer so if you are not fair skinned (Classic Ivory, Ivory or Light beige) don&#x27;t try this you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re wearing clown makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I like this under my eyes and along my eyebrows. I also used it for &#x27;spot touches&#x27; where I have hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline New York Dream Lumi Touch Highlighting Concealer, Ivory, 0.05.</li>
            <li> I feel like this concealer does brighten the undereye area; however, if you have extremely dark circles then I would opt for something stronger. It does kinda settle into fine lines a little bit too much for my liking.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer.. the color is perfect, it hid my dark circles and large freckles, and it blends very nicely.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I bought this because it was recommended on mascara.com.  Wish there was more in the bottle though.  It will be gone soon.</li>
            <li> I really like this concealer. It has a great consistancy and matches my skin tone very well. It usually lasts all day, especially if set with powder. The tube it comes in with a brush on the end requires a lot of turning sometimes to dispense the product, and the brush tends to cover my undereye circles unevenly. When applied with a makeup sponge, or even my finger, it is good buildable coverage for acne and undereye circles. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good every day concealer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, this is one of  the highlighting/concealers on the market, I don&#x27;t know what I ever do without it. I subscribe and save with this product tooI</li>
            <li> I love the coverage, not bad for a drug store concealer.  I use it under my eyes, my skin tends to get oily, but it lasts.</li>
            <li> Not thick at all, very brightening and kind of dewy..not a ton of coverage, but does the job under my eyes.! Don&#x27;t expect it to cover up acne.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.  You don&#x27;t get much for the money and I brought this from watching a video on You Tube. I guess I expected more.</li>
            <li> They were sold out at the store in this color so I came here to purchase vs driving all around town to find it in stop.  It was sold out with good reason.  It goes on very smoothly and blends well.  I love the consistency of the liquid, not too thin.  The applicator makes it easy to feather out the color.  It works great for brightening up your under eye area.  Buy it!  These are $7.99 at Ulta and $6.44 at Wal-mart.  Prices on Amazn change frequently so just keep an eye on what you&#x27;re paying.</li>
            <li> Awesome hiliter! Got it because of maskcara.com and she was right! It rocks! Great coverage. Comes out kind of slow though.</li>
            <li> There is an issue with the applicator which leaves about half an inch in the reservoir that is inaccessible and makes it hard to judge when you are out. Also if you take it on a flight it starts excessively coming out of the tip. Its a nice concealer but it does not exactly stay as put throughout the day as I&#x27;d like. Its just a concealer, I don&#x27;t know where the &amp;#34;lumi&amp;#34; part comes in but it doesn&#x27;t illuminate anything really.</li>
            <li> I like it as a highlighter but it doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage in terms of a concealer.</li>
            <li> I get kind of tired of paying over 20 bucks a pop for the YSL Touche Eclat (which this product is trying to compete with). I use it all the time, so it can get pricey. So I decided to try this out, because at a fourth of the price, you can hardly go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t as good as the YSL version, so let&#x27;s just get that out  of the way. The formula isn&#x27;t as creamy, the coverage isn&#x27;t quite as smooth and opaque and the packaging definitely feels cheaper. But since I am looking for a bargain replacement, I certainly don&#x27;t expect it to be AS good, just good enough. And that, the Maybelline Dream Lumi Touch Highlighting Concealer definitely lives up to. The formula covers nicely (I use it under my eyes) to cover red or dark spots. As a highlighter it is great - it doesn&#x27;t have the sort of glow that YSL does, but it is close - bringing lightness to areas that I want to highlight, like the bridge of my nose, center of my chin and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the real test: does it look the same as YSL once it is on your skin? The answer is yes. I couldn&#x27;t tell the two apart once they had been applied, and I like the color variety of Maybelline better. I chose the ivory at first and it works for me in the winter (nc25, fair white skin) but I have to go a shade darker in the summer. It lasts about 4 or 5 hours (an hour less than YSL) and does the job. If you want to save a few bucks and get the same amazing results, this is a great alternative to the YSL.</li>
            <li> I love what this concealer does for my highlighting process! It adds an instant glow, and, for somebody with the occasional pimple where I use product, it doesn&#x27;t highlight the pimple, just the area! I wish it lasted longer as I have to touch it up several times a day, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much in the vial to begin with. I am happy with the overall effect, though, and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good under eye concealer for....ever I think, and this had such great reviews on beauty sites I decided to try it. It&#x27;s fine, definitely not full coverage but that&#x27;s not a great look for the under eye area anyway, gets too cakey. On the other hand, this doesn&#x27;t actually cover much. It also doesn&#x27;t have much in the tube after you get it to actually start coming out. I&#x27;ll use it till it&#x27;s gone and then start my search again.</li>
            <li> I first bought this about a year ago on a lark and wound up loving it, I use the radiant one, At first when i tried it i thought it may be too light but you only need to use a little. It really brightens my whole eye area and face. I use to use touche elat but this a lot cheaper and is just as good or better. I do hope maybelline doesn&#x27;t discontinue it, that always happens when i love a product or shade.  2-23-17- Still keep coming back to this concealer. I have used couple of concealers that are $20 more and this is still better.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, easy to use and helps lighten wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The actual make up is magic.  Under my eyes and I go from insomniac to photo ready in a few seconds.  Above my cheekbones and the corners of my jaw and I feel like a model.  The only problem is the applicator.  You twist the tube to pull some make up into the brush.  Twist, nothing. Twist, nothing.  Twist, nothing.  Twist, OH NO TOO MUCH!  The brush needs to be cleaned each and every time you use it or it gets clumpy (which isn&#x27;t too big of a deal because you would never apply this with the brush, it would glom it on and you just need a tiny amount in each area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short story: would I buy this again?  Yes, but I&#x27;d probably try another brand that has a better applicator first.  I feel like I waste a ton of product each time I use it because of the way it works.</li>
            <li> i am very, very, very low-maintenance with make up. i saw a tutorial that used this product (as well as others), and decided to give it a try. i get compliments all the time that i look like i&#x27;m &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; when i use this product as a highlighter. i will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE! Perfect for under the eyes to highlight your cheek bones and on the nose for contouring :)</li>
            <li> Just ok for me.  I am not sure I will use this much as once I got it, only used it once and then got too lazy to put it on again.  It is a tad too much for the daytime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for about a month now and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with it. It maybe doesn&#x27;t completely cover up my under eye circles but I&#x27;m happy with it. The only complaint I have is that this amount doesn&#x27;t last very long as I&#x27;ve already needed to get another one.</li>
            <li> I do not personally have horrible under-eye circles, so I wanted a product that would give me minimal coverage and mostly act as a highlighter. This product is perfect! I got it in a lighter color than I needed to act as a highlighter and it perfectly highlights my skin. I&#x27;m sure that you could build the coverage to cover circles or darkness, I just don&#x27;t need to. The packaging is nice; I like the twist up bottom, and though some may worry about how hygienic the brush is, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product because I had heard so many good things about it. At first, I was unsure what all the hype was about. After applying it with my fingers I disliked the finish and it didn&#x27;t seem to highlight my face right. Then I tried applying the product in with a larger foundation brush instead of my fingers, and it worked wonders! The finish was perfect, not dewy but not really matte, and it brightened my face instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a great dupe for some higher-end highlighters, so you really are getting the most for your money with this product. If you don&#x27;t like it at first, try applying it differently - I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love this and wear it every day. It gives my face a nice glow and cover my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> not dark enough for me. it covers well, but i look like i&#x27;m wearing a mask. not for my skin shade</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m plagued with really dark under eye circles, this highlighter is the best one I&#x27;ve found to highlight and conceal! The pen applicator has a brush so it&#x27;s easy to apply exactly where you need it and the consistency is just perfect. Not too yellow or white looking.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product for highlighting. Use on forehead, middle of nose and under-eyes for a pop of luminosity.</li>
            <li> Love this product for highlighting purposes.  The ivory color is perfect for that.  However it is a little too light for concealing b/c I feel like it draws attention to pimples.  Also, I don&#x27;t use it on my dark circles b/c again I feel like it just draws attention to them.  I use it on my forehead, down the center of my nose, tip of my chin, etc.  It&#x27;s great if you contour/highlight your face</li>
            <li> easy to use and blends well</li>
            <li> Have used this for a long time and certainly will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before as part of my highlighting and contouring tools. I truly like it, although I think that today I learned that I have been applying too much. Buying this from Amazon cost less than from Rite Aide. It was a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted already. This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used and it compares favorably to the most expensive ones available.</li>
            <li> This product was better than I expected.  I have had dark circles under my eyes since I was a kid (allergic shiners). Since I&#x27;ve hit my 40&#x27;s they just get worse and I can&#x27;t stand to use full coverage foundation.  I&#x27;ve used this with my sheer to medium and it helped a lot.  It really does brighten and it&#x27;s my go to now.  The reason I gave it 3 stars is that you really can&#x27;t use the brush it comes with to blend.  I have to dab it on and then still blend it with my fingers or a different brush.  All in all thought it&#x27;s a great highlighter.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a sheer but dry concealer (rather than creamy) this is a good fit.  I tried it as my mascara had been rubbing into my creamier old concealer as the day went on.  I did not experience this problem with this product, but I found it too sheer and dry.  The search continues.</li>
            <li> The color and consistency of this product are good, but I find that I&#x27;ve gone through this tube of concealer really fast, a LOT faster than other types of concealer, and I don&#x27;t even use a lot at one time - I just use it around my eyes. It seems like nothing comes out when I twist the bottom of the tube because when I try to apply it nothing actually appears on my skin, but somehow the amount of concealer left is decreasing. I just don&#x27;t feel like this is a good buy, since the one tube will probably only have lasted me a month or so. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> The color is great and it is easy to use, but unfortunately made my sensitive skin break out. Oh well!</li>
            <li> Love the color. My only complaint is that to access more product, you twist the tube. It says it only takes a few twists my in my experience it take like 10 for my product to come out.</li>
            <li> I use it for highlighting. It is a little annoying how you have to twist the cap a ton of times before you get any product out but it works very well.</li>
            <li> This dual action highlighter &amp; concealer by Maybelline is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines under my eyes, covers darkness and gives a sublte highliting effect. Not oily or too shiny, so it doesn&#x27;t make my face look greasy. You can use it purely as a concealer or swipe some over your cheekbones for a great highlighter. The creamy consistency seems to last for hours. I&#x27;ve used concealers and/or highlighters by MAC, Amazing cosmetics, Stila, Laura Mercier, and others offered by Maybelline, but I will definitely be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> I went to a lot of reviews before getting it (considering you cannot go and try it at the store), and it is really great! Covers well, blends and feels so nice and it highlights. You do have to re-apply half way throught the day, but that is true with all concealers. My color skin is white-pinkish (more on the white side) and this Ivory tone worked wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li> read about this product in a magazine.  after researching it, finding great reviews, i too am a believer!!  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this at a drugstore and I have to say it has grown on me.  I really love the way this concealer goes on smooth, thanks to the brush applicator.  I still use my finger tip to dab it into my skin but the results are pretty great. A little goes a long way. I also end up with a nice, healthy glow (highlighting effect indeed!) and about medium coverage where my dark circles are concerned, which is a plus. After about 20-30 mins, I do a quick take in the mirror and dab under my eyes again - it has staying power but I personally have oilier skin under my eyes so I have to dab the fine lines with my finger tip once more.  But I do that without the need for more concealer, which is another plus in my book!  This stuff has actually brightened my face up (I like to use it around the nose area too) and it does a decent job covering up zits when the occasion arises.  It may not have have a HEAVY coverage that some are looking for but you&#x27;ll find your skin looks much better just using it to perk up specific areas of the face.  For the price, I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> great quality product. Great for concealing under eyes. a little yellow tendency, and theres isn&#x27;t very much product in there</li>
            <li> If I Could Give This A TEN . . .I would!  Just discovered this product and I will say IT IS MIRACULOUS!  This pretty little fat &#x27;pen&#x27; will highlight, conceal and brighten anywhere you put it!  After all my years using makeup and cosmetics, I will say that this IS one of my favorite products ever!  Ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the inner corners of my eyes, radiating downward under both eyes, even on my nose, cupid&#x27;s bow, dab on my chin, and anywhere else I need to look light and bright.  This doesn&#x27;t give a fake shimmery tone, either, ladies.  It provides a soft light efect.  &#x27;Tis right up there with the high-end products that the pros use, softening and brightening just where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much, I&#x27;m purchasing several, just in case they discontinue it (please don&#x27;t, Maybelline!), and one for my purse.  It&#x27;s my favorite product ever, for lightening and brightening...even concealing without looking applied or un-natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I say I love it?</li>
            <li> Very light, looks good as an undereye brightener. Staying power not so great but its easy to chuck in your handbag to reapply.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this recently and it&#x27;s already half gone! It&#x27;s just not enough product... you might as well order 2.</li>
            <li> This concealer is amazing! I use the shade 02 Nude and I must say it is the perfect shade for me. Check out my full review on my blog: [...]</li>
            <li> As someone who has tried a multitude of concealers for under-eye circles, I can say with certainty that if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product. It works well for highlighting and for covering up red-tinted blemishes, but it doesn&#x27;t do much at all for under-eye circles. It&#x27;s fairly light in consistency, so it doesn&#x27;t offer the sort of coverage needed to cover up the blue/purple tinges that most of us have under our eyes. In my experience, something thicker and with a more yellowy color base is what you need. Overall, I&#x27;ll use this sparingly for highlighting and the occasional mild blemish, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again. Oh, and the brush applicator is quite a pain - you have to click it a bunch of times before anything happens, and then it all pools out in a big blob. Very annoying.</li>
            <li> Great for concealing and highlighting!! Love it for directly under and over my brows after coloring in for that perfect shape and lift!! Conceals bags and acne well too!</li>
            <li> I love this product for days when I have under eye circles or need to camouflage some redness.  It lasts most of the day when set with some powder and I have also used it as a highlighter on cheekbones.  I am pretty fair but not ghostly and this is the perfect color. Really smooth finish and great price.</li>
            <li> i saw this product on maskcara.com and decided to try it since im too cheap to by clinique. i LOVE it. it bought two different kinds of concealer (hard candy concealer) just to compare. the hard candy settles into lines i didnt even think were there and was super chalky. the maybelline concealer was creamy and looked super natural. it gave me a great glow under my eyes. im super exited its so awesome!!!</li>
