            <li> This hairspray has the right hold, not too stiff but holds my hair in place.  </li>
            <li> One minor thing-</li>
            <li> Not really natural looking because your hair is a helmet, but if you don&#x27;t want your locks to move all day, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair all day long.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this is harder and harder to find on the store shelves.</li>
            <li> no compaints but not exactly the product that works wiith my hair.  </li>
            <li> it seems to slightly darken my colored medium blond hair when applied, but that is no biggie.</li>
            <li> I am truly afraid that Pure Force 16 is being, or has been discontinued,  by Refken, as I  not finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> Way too stiff.</li>
            <li> This spray will hold you in place all day long, but your hair will be stiff and it is sometimes difficult to comb out.</li>
            <li> Does this mean Redkin is discontinuing yet another of my favorites?</li>
            <li> You never can go wrong with Redken products!</li>
            <li> Bad product...</li>
            <li> To bad Redken you lost another customer.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> used this product for years and its non-aerosol without residue</li>
            <li> This is a good hairspray if you like a crisp look.</li>
            <li> I live in an area of high humidity and this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great product for my fly away,  fine hair ( which gets finer as I age).  So glad that my daughter originally bought it, and left some in the canister for me to try. All day hold. One minor thing- it seems to slightly darken my colored medium blond hair when applied, but that is no biggie. I am truly afraid that Pure Force 16 is being, or has been discontinued,  by Refken, as I  not finding it in stores. Thank goodness Amazon has it available.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It smells great and works really well.  You never can go wrong with Redken products!</li>
            <li> I did not like the spray. Way too stiff. It was supposed to be #9 replacement, definately did not do the job.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray!  I have fine hair and this does a superior job of holding it without losing shine.  It is not as flexible as some sprays, but that&#x27;s one of the reasons I use it.  Hair stays in place!</li>
            <li> Redken stopped making this particular product which I love.  I try to pick up several bottles when I can through Amazon.  I wish Redken didn&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used...period. Hold style four hours, but combs out easily without residue.</li>
            <li> Hold my hair good without a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Wish this Redken product had not been discontinued.  New product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent...I couldn&#x27;t be happier !!</li>
            <li> Bad product...The pump does not work at all. Nothing comes out so I cannot use the hairspray.  Should make sure product works before sending out.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is the only one that actually holds my hair in place all day.  And when you comb through it it &amp;#34;disappears&amp;#34; - i.e. does not leave a sticky residue.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for years but it&#x27;s no longer carried at my salon. Works great.</li>
            <li> not in stores anymore... got it for a friend who uses it all the time... she was happy to have found a supply source.</li>
            <li> The very best spray for designing your hair and creates a very&lt;br /&gt;noticeable shine.  Hope I can always find it.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite hairspray!!! Has a great hold without being stiff! Great smell too! Love the pump on this as well! Just a great product all around! I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Can no longer get this item in my location. Love Pure force. EVER time I find I love something from Redken, they remove.</li>
            <li> I am very well satisfied with this product, I do not understand why they have stopped making it.</li>
            <li> This is the best! it holds while still leaving the hair flexible. My only complaint is that this is harder and harder to find on the store shelves. Does this mean Redkin is discontinuing yet another of my favorites? You&#x27;ve already discontinued the Contour Lotion, which I wish you would bring back! Please don&#x27;t take this one away, too!</li>
            <li> I use the hair spray every day and wouldn&#x27;t use anythings else.  I keep several bottles on hand so that I am not without.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  Holds my hair and has flexible hold, controls and brushes out. Redken has discontinued it.  To bad Redken you lost another customer.</li>
            <li> The hairspray came in a timely manner but 3 of the cans I ordered were quite dented. They do seem to spray okay. I would suggest packing them in a box instead of the plastic bag they came in. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This hairspray has the right hold, not too stiff but holds my hair in place.  It also adds shine to my hair, which I really love.  Smells good to.  I would recommend this hair spray.</li>
            <li> This spray will hold you in place all day long, but your hair will be stiff and it is sometimes difficult to comb out. Not really natural looking because your hair is a helmet, but if you don&#x27;t want your locks to move all day, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> ok in price and delivery. no compaints but not exactly the product that works wiith my hair.  would recommend to someone who this product works with</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Holds my hair all day long.  I don&#x27;t know what I will do when I no longer can purchase this.</li>
            <li> my favorite, smells great and allows you to play with hair before sets</li>
            <li> Great hair spray.  We were very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Best Hair spray money can buy.</li>
