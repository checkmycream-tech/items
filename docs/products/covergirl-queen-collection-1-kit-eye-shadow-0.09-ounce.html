            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>It works great on my brown eyes and olive/tan skin.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t great at picking up and applying product.</li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>
            <li>Stays on all day color looks good .</li>
            <li>Good Price.</li>
            <li>Over all it is a good product.</li>
            <li>goes on nice, but it didn&#x27;t look good on me,</li>
            <li>Discount price for being  honest</li>
            <li>Very happy with the color, perfect for eyeshadow &amp; blush when your short on time to put on your face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a great color for the world&#x27;s best summer make up tip- fake a sunburn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I would have tried it more often.  </li>
            <li>The price was so inexpensive it would have cost me more to return it than to toss it out..</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow is a great compliment to the brand as a whole.</li>
            <li>color is nice and shows up well even on my light skin.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>maybe kind of a shimmery mix of a wine/cherry color--good for making light eyes pop.</li>
            <li>as a blush, it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li>It was darker than pictured but the color is gorgeous and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>but it was a fine purchase</li>
            <li>Saw this on a deal site for free, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful, but I didn&#x27;t pay for loose powder, I paid for a cake of eye-shadow.</li>
            <li>It goes on great and lasts for a long time without having to be reapplied.</li>
            <li>Since Amazon rejected my original 2 reviews for this product, please see my photos for the truth about the condition the item arrived in.</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty...</li>
            <li>Nice enough, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>This is a good base color or a good color for someone who wants to go with a more natural look.</li>
            <li>Product arrived with powder crushed into many pieces.</li>
            <li>I am very displeased with how it was just thrown in a box.</li>
            <li>But I own several other covergirl eye shadows and they apply very well and stay on all day with a make up setting spray.</li>
            <li>The few times I used it the product seemed ok,</li>
            <li>It was darker than I expected, more of a mauve than a dusty rose.  </li>
            <li>Eyeshadow was completely crumbled both times</li>
            <li>It comes with two side eye shadow and one small box with some powder kind of thing, I am not much familiar with that.  </li>
            <li>This is such a soft color on me that I can also use it as a blush.</li>
            <li>Color was not right for my pale skin, but was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I only paid a dollar not really a color I would normally wear</li>
            <li>The Product is fine except when it arrived it was broken.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I recieved the shadow broke so it was more difficult to use. I wish it were easier to use I would have tried it more often.  The price was so inexpensive it would have cost me more to return it than to toss it out..The few times I used it the product seemed ok,</li>
            <li> the product is as expected.</li>
            <li> goes on nice, but it didn&#x27;t look good on me, just okay.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow was completely crumbled both times I tried to purchase it. Product may be OK...but hard to determine when it is damaged both times I try to order.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It was darker than pictured but the color is gorgeous and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as an eyeshadow, but rather as a blush (it&#x27;s a plum-pink color) and it works great. Great price too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s covergirl!  It goes on great and lasts for a long time without having to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> I only paid a dollar not really a color I would normally wear but it was a fine purchase</li>
            <li> Stays on all day color looks good . Discount price for being  honest</li>
            <li> I love the color. It works great on my brown eyes and olive/tan skin. But it fades away throughout the day and I don&#x27;t even have oily lids. By the way, it&#x27;s darker than this weird pink eye shadow in the amazon picture. It&#x27;s a beautiful reddish purple.</li>
            <li> This is such a soft color on me that I can also use it as a blush. I do not use the applicators that come with eyeshadows. They aren&#x27;t great at picking up and applying product. The color is not overly pigmented but that can be rectified with the use of a primer and multiple layers of application. This eyeshadow is a great compliment to the brand as a whole.</li>
            <li> The Product is fine except when it arrived it was broken.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece. She likes &#x27;brighter&#x27; colors and loved this eye shadow!</li>
            <li> This eye shadow lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;There is not a lot of flaking when using this like some shadows have and provides a even coat to your lids.&lt;br /&gt;The color is nice and shows up well even on my light skin.</li>
            <li> Came all crumbled in pieces :(</li>
            <li> Color was not right for my pale skin, but was easy to apply.  It did not cause irritation, and only needed to be applied once during the day.  It was darker than I expected, more of a mauve than a dusty rose.  Nice enough, but not for me.  Would not buy this color again.</li>
            <li> Was in shambles when it arrived not usable i chucked it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the color, perfect for eyeshadow &amp; blush when your short on time to put on your face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a great color for the world&#x27;s best summer make up tip- fake a sunburn.</li>
            <li> Very Good Product.  Good Price. Spouse like it.  It comes with two side eye shadow and one small box with some powder kind of thing, I am not much familiar with that.  Over all it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Great price.  Going to order another one.</li>
            <li> I love the color. Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This is a good base color or a good color for someone who wants to go with a more natural look.</li>
            <li> I needed a filler for my Subscribe and Save shipment, and this item only cost me $.18. I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase. The color is very pretty...maybe kind of a shimmery mix of a wine/cherry color--good for making light eyes pop.</li>
            <li> Pretty color. The powder was broken when I received it from shipping. But I own several other covergirl eye shadows and they apply very well and stay on all day with a make up setting spray.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with powder crushed into many pieces.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the product itself, beautiful color, nicer on the skin then the picture shows. Since Amazon rejected my original 2 reviews for this product, please see my photos for the truth about the condition the item arrived in. Un-usable and un-returnable.</li>
            <li> Bought for a gift, no complaints, standard eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Came crushed up and in a powder form because it wasn&#x27;t bubble wrapped or anything!! The color is beautiful, but I didn&#x27;t pay for loose powder, I paid for a cake of eye-shadow. I am very displeased with how it was just thrown in a box. Not OK.</li>
            <li> Saw this on a deal site for free, so I can&#x27;t complain. It didn&#x27;t work for my skin as eyeshadow but as a blush, it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
