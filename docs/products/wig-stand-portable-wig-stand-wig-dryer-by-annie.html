            <li>and it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>She was very happy with the stands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for drying your wig.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one is more durable and perfect for storage.</li>
            <li>Also, this type of stand is good for drying your wig after you wash it.</li>
            <li>Good price and good purchase</li>
            <li>so I needed one of these to care for her wigs that was easy to store away!</li>
            <li>I should have returned it but it cost more to return the item to the seller.</li>
            <li>but I would like to find one that isn&#x27;t as flimsy. :)</li>
            <li>Needs to be more stable.  </li>
            <li>It falls over easily too.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and easy to take apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to carry it around to places.</li>
            <li>It fits just fine and doesn&#x27;t misshapen the wig.  </li>
            <li>This wig stand is cheap and it does</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not too happy paying more for the shipping than the product, it was about accurate to what I payed for the previous one at the gallery.</li>
            <li>This wig stand might be better for short haired wigs or even light weight wigs</li>
            <li>Easy to open and fold, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this stand is rather good at maintaining the roundness of the wigcap.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>Is exactly as advertised ..</li>
            <li>The stand was easy to put together no pieces were broken and it keeps my wig looking nice.</li>
            <li>This stand is very plastic and flimsy.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really stand up, the weight of the wig will make it fall over.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a reasonable item.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this stand is that it is made for short haired wigs; if you own a wig that reaches at least mid back, a good portion of the hair will be left on the shelf.</li>
            <li>When not in use, they lay flat and don&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>this stand is easy to take apart but its not really good to use for a wig it comes apart easily and its hard for me to put my wig on i</li>
            <li>my package wasn&#x27;t damaged and I would recommend this to a friend who has short haired wigs not so much the long haired ones</li>
            <li>it allows the wig to dry both from the inside and the outside highly recommend it to anyone who wears wigs</li>
            <li>would reccomend this stand to people who are only using it for smaller wigs and not long wigs because it moves my wig alot and sometimes it falls over with my wig on it.</li>

            <li> When I put it together, the legs were uneven</li>
            <li> I actually purchased these for an elderly women I knew wore wigs and was afraid to wash them..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stand is so convenient for travel as well as drying and storing my wigs after shampooing or just wearing. it allows the wig to dry both from the inside and the outside highly recommend it to anyone who wears wigs</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the one I had before (Revlon) broke all over the place. This one is more durable and perfect for storage. When I bought my wig from the gallery I went to, the sales woman told me not to get a styrofoam head because it stretches out the wig. Also, this type of stand is good for drying your wig after you wash it. The product came before the estimated date. Although I&#x27;m not too happy paying more for the shipping than the product, it was about accurate to what I payed for the previous one at the gallery.</li>
            <li> This stand is very plastic and flimsy. I should have returned it but it cost more to return the item to the seller. I would not even give this away. Not a good product. It falls over easily too.</li>
            <li> I us this to dry the wings when they are wet from being washed and it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wig...but my wig is not here yet..&lt;br /&gt;i already wait like 3 weeks but i like this for my wigg</li>
            <li> I actually purchased these for an elderly women I knew wore wigs and was afraid to wash them.. She was very happy with the stands. When not in use, they lay flat and don&#x27;t take up much space. Good price and good purchase</li>
            <li> The only downside to this stand is that it is made for short haired wigs; if you own a wig that reaches at least mid back, a good portion of the hair will be left on the shelf. This makes it a bit tedious for long curly wigs becuase you have to constantly detangle knots and then recurl the wig. Other than that, this stand is rather good at maintaining the roundness of the wigcap.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really stand up, the weight of the wig will make it fall over. Get one of those Styrofoam heads instead.</li>
            <li> This is a substandard product not worth even the postage paid.  It is flimsy and will not support the wig as described.</li>
            <li> Is exactly as advertised .. Easy to open and fold, easy to use. For the price, it&#x27;s a reasonable item.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and easy to take apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time, at home or when I am at a hotel..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see how one wouldn&#x27;t like this if you&#x27;re using it as its suppose to be used.  I have two of these which hold my wigs.  It fits just fine and doesn&#x27;t misshapen the wig.  I recommend this!</li>
            <li> This wig stand is cheap and it does it&#x27;s job well. It&#x27;s portable so it&#x27;s easy to carry it around to places. My only complaint is that I wish the product was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter does Pageants so I needed one of these to care for her wigs that was easy to store away!</li>
            <li> this stand is easy to take apart but its not really good to use for a wig it comes apart easily and its hard for me to put my wig on i would reccomend this stand to people who are only using it for smaller wigs and not long wigs because it moves my wig alot and sometimes it falls over with my wig on it.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and needs to be weighted down with something so it doesn&#x27;t keep tipping over...wish I got the gloria head instead. I might as well just go back to hanging on a tall bottle of some sort.</li>
            <li> The wig stand is indeed a little flimsy but it does the job none the less.This wig stand might be better for short haired wigs or even light weight wigs but it still works for me.But be careful if you have a window open around and the wind is blowing in it will knock over the stand and the wig so be mindful of that. The stand was easy to put together no pieces were broken and it keeps my wig looking nice. Shipping was very fast my package wasn&#x27;t damaged and I would recommend this to a friend who has short haired wigs not so much the long haired ones and I might buy this product again but I would like to find one that isn&#x27;t as flimsy. :)</li>
            <li> Needs to be more stable.  When I put it together, the legs were uneven and I could not straighten them. It&#x27;s great for drying your wig.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use it to flat iron my wig but that was a very difficult task.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend purchasing it if you only use it to dry your wig.</li>
