            <li>good price</li>
            <li>but i found that it works just as good with out the scalp therapy.</li>
            <li>Also.... get a really good conditioner (I use mine on just the tips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There appears to be bogus product out there being sold at what looks like a good discount.</li>
            <li>but I have a friend who is fairly convinced it works.  </li>
            <li>She started raving about how good of a product it was.</li>
            <li>Good luck fellow hair thinner.&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>I purchase this product for my son and it has worked good for him.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>You have lost a good customer....</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>His hairstylist is convinced that he still has a fair amount of hair because of Nioxin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had good luck with it.</li>
            <li>good on the scalp</li>
            <li>supplier offrs Nioxin at a good price and delivered it as promised.</li>
            <li>seems to be good product</li>
            <li>its good for now.</li>
            <li>good shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is a superior product when it comes to cleansing the hair and scalp and allowing the hair to &amp;#34;breathe.&amp;#34; It also help keep dandruff or flaky scalp in check and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>good product from gray hair</li>
            <li>Great refreshing feel while shampooing.</li>
            <li>great results; keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years now and it keeps my scalp very healthy...  </li>
            <li>My husband and I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have been using it maybe 2 months now, and can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like in 4 more!</li>
            <li>I love this Shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Works great and scalp feels good and clean.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and feel it is a very good, economical cleanser.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>so she ordered her own.</li>
            <li>I am just a user and loving it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I now suspect the product I just purchased will not be effective to regrow thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>website says that it&#x27;s effective for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>all these changes by P&amp;G, I question whether Nioxin today is the effective product of yesterday or</li>
            <li>Smells good and makes your head tingle, love it</li>
            <li>After just one use of this system, my sclap feel so good and healthy and not itchy.  </li>
            <li>A product that I have used for many years, scalp is in good condition, but the product has not improved hair growth.</li>
            <li>and nice price</li>
            <li>He likes how clean it makes his hair feel and, the great scent.</li>
            <li>All are easy to use and leave my hair in good shape.  </li>
            <li>excellent shampoo for daily use good price</li>
            <li>It is nice having my scalp feeling so healthy and my hair feels soooooo clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and this seems to make it thicker.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling very clean, and smells kind of peppermint-y.  </li>
            <li>I was a user of the original Nioxin for years with good results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for many years as it was recommended by the professional who cuts my hair, and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>They said that the minty shampoo would be great, that the conditioner wasn&#x27;t as important for hair growth, and that the tonic you put right on your scalp was AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ordering the Nioxin 2 cleanser to see if it works faster :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for over 20 years and have tried many others.  </li>
            <li>hair is thinning even more after I started to use Nioxin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even more impressive to me is that after just a week I keep looking for those fifteen or so hairs left in my hands after styling, but they&#x27;re not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are a lot of products out there claiming to help, but take it from me, this stuff does what it says, it creates a healthy scalp environment for hair to grow and leaves you hair feeling thicker.</li>
            <li>I have used Nioxin for more than 2 yrs now and love it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo feels and smells great (very minty).  </li>
            <li>Sure</li>
            <li>Amazon had the best price and several sizes to choose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i have been using nioxin for two years now and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It will be shiner and healthy.</li>
            <li>So the sooner you start using the product the better.  </li>
            <li>The sooner you get started the more hair you will keep into your 40s and 50s.  </li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>and unfortunately I won&#x27;t be able to continue.</li>
            <li>and I love it a lot.  </li>
            <li>it works well with the its sister conditional (which I like it better than the Shampoo).</li>
            <li>my hair feels and looks noticeably better.  </li>
            <li>I love the peppermint smell and</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair healthy and from falling out</li>
            <li>maybe more.  </li>
            <li>and I still love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love how my hair feels with it.  </li>
            <li>Will keep buying more bottles.</li>
            <li>love the product.</li>
            <li>I recommend to a friend who was almost bald on top.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the way it makes my scalp and hair feel.  </li>
            <li>I love this product as well as the rest in the set.  </li>
            <li>and it is better than the Tre&#x27;semme that I have used for years.</li>
            <li>, my hair just FEELS so much better.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am now looking for a replacement for my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>But, it is not sold in stores or salons in my area, so I was glad to find I could order it online.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>BTW, has anyone found a satisfying replacement?</li>
            <li>I love this product better than WEN.</li>
            <li>Works awesome, this is the second bottle I have ordered.</li>
            <li>About .5 inches!! :)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>* product was well packed , came safely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years, and Amazin definitely has the best prices on it.</li>
            <li>Really love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I had started losing hair and when I started using the nioxin shampoo and conditioner, it worked wonders, so I have continued to use it and am completely satisfied with it</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Plus, love the price and will always order through the wwebsite.</li>
            <li>and I cannot see anything magical happening.  </li>
            <li>Lovely minty smell and made my hair shine but did NOT improve thinness or volume.</li>
            <li>Been using for many years at the suggestion of my hairstylist.  </li>
            <li>Again what I just said love the product and was recommended by my hair dresser and it is doing the job</li>
            <li>I have not seen any noticeable \\&quot;fluffing\\&quot; to create an illusion of greater volume</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, the tea tree and mint, make for a refreshing wash.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li>i love it ,It makes my hair feel so nice and clean ,Try Nioxin.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice clean feeling and makes your hair feel thicker.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so nice and clean with no build up.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and rinses out clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had comments from a number of people over the years about how nice my hair looks, and that&#x27;s good news since I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>It has a very clean smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very fine and smooth ...not greasy at all</li>
            <li>But the shampoo IS worth the expense, every penny!!</li>
            <li>and I suppose the thinner area on top of my head filled in a bit more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only do the shampoo and conditioner feel great - they&#x27;re kind of minty and tingly -</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, healthy, and i feel proud of it again.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair so clean!  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair really clean!</li>
            <li>I saw amazing results after the first day!</li>
            <li>the only con I have is the shampoo doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel very good.</li>
            <li>Free shipping from Amazon made it all the more value.</li>
            <li>works great on my old hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I would like to use Nioxin and recommend to someone who wants to have a charming hair.</li>
            <li>and I was really self-conscious about it and having people notice and comment that my hair looks good makes me want to keep using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, however, what&#x27;s a nice head of hair worth?</li>
            <li>Oh sweet relief!  </li>
            <li>Instead, my hair is full of life!  </li>
            <li>i originally got it from a hair stylist because she thought it might help with a thinning patch on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>Now for the important item...performance.... keeping in mind that I wasn&#x27;t very good at using the conditioner or leave in scalp treatment, my review is only for the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos do not work well for my hair, Nioxin leaves my hair shiny, clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>Nioxin has very quickly thickened the hair on my head and virtually eliminated hair loss associated with combing, adding product and styling...</li>
            <li>The process is very quick every day.  </li>
            <li>This is our second bottle, leaves hair feeling really great and healthy.</li>
            <li>This is a great product as it really helps my hair to get thicker and leaves a fresh mint feeling to the scalp.</li>
            <li>and it has always been good for me as it makes my hair fell like they are real soft yet</li>
            <li>The cleanser works fine</li>
            <li>I have always had baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>For years I have used this product for my ultra fine hair.</li>
            <li>If your labs check out fine, then you should go for the product.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and does not bother my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I find the price reasonable and the system is easy and effective for hair thinning problems.  </li>
            <li>a huge difference by comparison.</li>
            <li>Delivery was prompt and securely packaged.  </li>
            <li>it is important to follow the directions though...</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that makes my hair fuller annd not \\&quot;fly</li>
            <li>Great product, can only buy it online now</li>
            <li>If you want a minty shampoo and conditioner get a cheap supermarket one as this is just a con.</li>
            <li>Nioxin does a good job of a \\&quot;perceived thickening effect\\&quot; while not stripping the natural oils.</li>
            <li>If you know what you&#x27;re looking for, it&#x27;s quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>I have been useing the original (gold caps, made in GA).  </li>
            <li>I cannot find the original anywhere.  </li>
            <li>is worth something!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice minty smell to it and cleans out the dirt and dust real well, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same arctic peppermint effect as it&#x27;s Conditioner-counterpart has (which is probably a good thing).</li>
            <li>I do not believe this is an original Nioxin shampoo.</li>
            <li>It gets the scalp really clean and healthy.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It has a minty smell which is a clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Always clean and makes my hair tingle</li>
            <li>Even if you are not looking for an amazing deep comdtioner safe for use every day</li>
            <li>h&#x3D;keeps my scalp clean.</li>
            <li>stays looking clean</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel clean without residue.</li>
            <li>Gives my scalp a clean tingly sensation and it no longer itches.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it has worked miracles for others, but for me this a good alcohol and animal product free shampoo and little more.</li>
            <li>However, I really think these products together do a phenomenal job.  </li>
            <li>Big bottle, good price</li>
            <li>Will be returning for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>This is a good shampoo, but don&#x27;t expect your hair to grow back.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got cool mint smell and gives your head the mint sensation like when you put a gum to your mouth, giving you that chilled cooled feeling to your head.  </li>
            <li>Amazons price is a true bargain.</li>
            <li>All true.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair more manageable an sped it appears to be much thicker.</li>
            <li>If anything my hair came out more and my scalp was really itchy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to order and the delivery was very fast.  </li>
            <li>Great price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>she liked it so much we got this large bottle</li>
            <li>From my experience, I can happily recommend Nioxin to other victims of premature hair loss.</li>
            <li>The savings is tremendous verses purchasing in a hair saloon or store.  </li>
            <li>Was loosing hair quick.  </li>
            <li>quick service...</li>
            <li>One plus is my hair felt super clean-until spraying the treatment spray.</li>
            <li>Lucky?  </li>
            <li>I mention my hair is super soft?!&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>Came quickly in the mail--never used.</li>
            <li>This came quickly, but the product seems counterfeit.</li>
            <li>sure enough it was a much better deal.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair seems to stay clean longer, so I only have to use it 2X/week - love it!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li>Like 3x more than normal.</li>
            <li>my wife actually started using it to clean her hair after she ran out of her own shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, naturally wavy/curly hair and my hair was always oily</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t always easy to find -- or people price it very high.</li>
            <li>Glad I read the new reviews before making a purchase...</li>
            <li>they never say that it prevents hair loss or creates more or new hair, it just creates the appearance of fuller hair for those whose hair is thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second this amazing shampoo was delivered to my door i quickly took a shower.</li>
            <li>For $30 I got the whole System 1 Kit for Fine Hair.(off eBay)</li>
            <li>I use the product everyday and is great for the price.</li>
            <li>: Hair still looks amazing 11 years later.</li>
            <li>Delivery was really fast, and free.</li>
            <li>You will have to decide if the leak in your wallet is worth the product results yourself but for me, it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it if it helps to regrow thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well worth the money that you are going to spend</li>
            <li>Here, you get free shipping, no sales tax in most states, plus a regular shipment.  </li>
            <li>But its better than being a bald 26 year old woman.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t form any dandruff and it has such a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Great for thin hair love the smell of it to</li>
            <li>Well worth the money if you hair is thinning and falling out.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance - the way it cleans - how soft my hair is and the shine I get.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s totally worth the money to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was wonderful for my baby-fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>Only kind our family will use.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the money???</li>
            <li>Always satisfied with results of soft manageable hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not thinning, I strictly bought it to promote a healthy scalp and apparently it works!!!  </li>
            <li>Waking up and finding a pillow full of hair doesn&#x27;t exactly feel right to a teenager.</li>
            <li>More than many other products on the market but worth it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and very clean.</li>
            <li>and she was so right.  </li>
            <li>at that point I thought I must be on the right path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Speedy shipping and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>It cleans my hair really well though, squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ll attest that I haven&#x27;t had dandruff or further hair loss since starting, and I like that the (online) price is reasonable and hasn&#x27;t increased much over time.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and clean!  </li>
            <li>I have platnum bleached hair that is very fine, if i use anything else other then enjoy (witch is $35  for a 12oz bottle) my hair brakes off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the original formula but still decent shampoo.</li>
            <li>I rarely use &#x27;product&#x27; or gels, and I eat healthy and exercise regularly (which may or may not matter to hair health).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to get a bottle of the old formula from a online supplier, now out of stock completely, as soon as I was able to start using the old formula again the hair loss STOPPED!</li>
            <li>After all this time and money spent, I have no perceived increase in hair density like the bottle claims and all it has done is made my hair fall out even more!  </li>
            <li>very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I ordered Nioxin Cleanser for Fine Hair, System 1, Natural Hair as it is showed on description but It came with Nioxin Cleanser for Fine Hair, System 2, Natural Hair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of this to get clean and like another reviewer said it doesn&#x27;t lather much.</li>
            <li>For the first bottle anyway.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this product line the first time, I was led to believe it would help me regrow the hair I&#x27;d lost.  </li>
            <li>Finally, another stylist said that I needed to stop using the product because it was causing more problems for my scalp</li>
            <li>but from the first treatment I noticed without question that my hair looked fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li>Overall I believe my hair health is better for using this product.</li>
            <li>What you are left with is nothing more than overpriced Suave.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo came in on time and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>First off...</li>
            <li>Exactly like it should be.</li>
            <li>So hte first thing you&#x27;re thinking is \\&quot;SCAM,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair grow back, but it stops loosing more hair.  </li>
            <li>His barber told him about it in the first place.</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Since I started using Nioxin scalp treatment (yes, it can burn but I&#x27;m willing to endure that for the benefits)</li>
            <li>It is soft, smooth, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It is now heavier to the feel, more like oldtime shampoo and doesn&#x27;t even smell the same.  </li>
            <li>I received more then double the ozs.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been using this stage one consistently for 5 years.</li>
            <li>Knowing the exact product you have to order is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used so many shampoos but this is the only one stopped my hair from falling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Of course, I throw it up on my head and braid it after the first day, but I tell you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be bald on the top and back of my head if it weren&#x27;t for this product.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me first after chemotherapy.</li>
            <li>Well, the first time I used this product, my hair came out in clumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, and my hair looks really good.  </li>
            <li>all these changes by P&amp;G, I question whether Nioxin today is the effective product of yesterday or a new commercial fraud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about six weeks, and can say that while I haven&#x27;t noticed any measureable differences, it does make my hair and scalp feel very clean.  </li>
            <li>I have tried any new shampoo product on the market that promotes hair growth and this is the only one that I have experienced that actually works.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and clean, but no result.  </li>
            <li>After some research I decided on this product and sure enough my hair looks much healthier than it did a month ago, my hair also seems thicker than before.</li>
            <li>and it becomes flat very quickly unless I have the right shampoo.</li>
            <li>powerful clear!!</li>
            <li>I was still a little nervous, but the people at the supply shop were SO SURE that this could help me--from their own personal experience to what they had learned at workshops, etc.  </li>
            <li>So first off, I use the whole system (shampoo, conditioner, scalp treatment).  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of Nioxin and have been well satisfied over the years.</li>
            <li>So unless I hear for a reliable source it is no better than good shampoo, no reason to switch.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it, if only for the tingle-fresh feeling it leaves behind on your scalp and the delightful peppermint scent.</li>
            <li>My wife has long hair and is very hypo alergic to many formulas, this one she loves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair super soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I can now even wear my hair down and with some hairspray, it actually looks great.  </li>
            <li>so far so good, and i will say it seems that less hair falls out as well</li>
            <li>and I do believe my fine hair also has more body than I generally notice with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got this for the dyke I was dating who had male pattern baldness, stopped hair loss, maybe some fine hair growth.</li>
            <li>&amp; I feel it has really helped stop hair loss.</li>
            <li>It is in reality, great for making thin hair look thicker, but it is not for the loss of hair at all and the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t claim it is even tho&#x27; some reviews by customers imply this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the whole Nioxin system (#1) for about 2 years now.  </li>
            <li>I also confirmed with 2 different Dermatologists that its all a gimmick and does nothing!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference yet.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t care if it is system 1 or system 2.</li>
            <li>I started using the whole system ( cleanser, scalp therapy and, conditioner)</li>
            <li>I started really noticing a difference in about three months, I started to get peach fuzz now</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t if you&#x27;re not getting the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like this product line.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this shampoo for awhile now and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>Works great for thin hair.</li>
            <li>My hair quit breaking off and it looked and felt SO much healthier.</li>
            <li>It really helps.  </li>
            <li>so who knows if it would really work or not.</li>
            <li>From my experience the shampoo cleans your hair like shampoos supposed to-It makes you smell really bad-It makes your scalp itch-</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re balding then none of these things (besides an allergic reaction) will really deter you from trying it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also made in Mexico so who knows what&#x27;s in it really.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so much thicker.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a much lower price then in the stores.  </li>
            <li>Very diappointed.  </li>
            <li>repair damaged ends.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not losing as much hair to brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>Now, thanks to customer reviews I have been spared experiencing the &amp;#34; new&amp;#34; version.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It really works and I do recommend it to whose who need this product for their hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product worked really well in fact it&#x27;s transformed my hair.</li>
            <li>My husband is really frugal but he will spend money on this shampoo .</li>
            <li>I used to feel an intense heated buzz on my scalp after using this product (5 years ago or so).  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The stimulation was almost too much.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for thin haired people; definitely recommended.  </li>
            <li>SO I PURCHASED THIS BIGGER BOTTLE, SEEMS TO BE WORKING - NOT A MIRACLE WORKER, STILL HAVE THIN HAIR BUT SEEMS TO HELP - AWESOME PRICE!</li>
            <li>The leave-in spray is a little sticky right after using it but in an hour or more that goes away and your hair is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair feels smooth and I tried a lot of other shampoos before this one (it&#x27;s worth the price).</li>
            <li>Now as far as growing back more hair, I&#x27;m not sure how effective that is.  </li>
            <li>Seems like a decent shampoo; thick and works up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>There is a noticeable difference, and this has worked better than other thickening shampoos for me.</li>
            <li>Proctor &amp; Gamble needs to bring back the original formula</li>
            <li>I never used it due to loosing hair, but rather for more volume and scalp calming.  </li>
            <li>Pricey, but as oldest of 5 boys, I have more hair than the other 4 combined.  </li>
            <li>My hair thinned out so much on that particular product my family and friends noticed.</li>
            <li>A week in and my hair is still falling out at its fast and steady pace...it does say to use for 30 days to see a difference though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but for me it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Only need a small amount and does a great job.</li>
            <li>So I scheduled a consultation at a high end salon, showed them what was going on, and they sent me straight to the beauty supply shop for Nioxin.  </li>
            <li>really couldn&#x27;t speak to whether or not it can help one regrow or stop losing hair, but it gets my hair and scalp very clean, is gentle enough for frequent use and definitely works better than any other $30 bottle of shampoo I&#x27;ve used, and so to me</li>
            <li>After buying a smaller bottle of this at my local hair supply store (for a LOT more money), this is the bargain on this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used it steady for about three years.</li>
            <li>I definitely believe I have kept more hair than would have happened without using this product daily.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent price.</li>
            <li>It strips all the residue that most cheap shampoos leave behind.</li>
            <li>At first I noticed the new product, unlike the old, made NO MENTION of its ability to remove Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the testosterone-based cause of baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily I heard about Nioxin and after 3 months of use my hair was back to its normal thickness.</li>
            <li>Nioxin dose not weight your hair down and leaves it very clean.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this as well as the partner conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>( I have a high testosterone level).</li>
            <li>the doctor&#x27;s all were wondering how I was breathing, if I was on medication for high blood pressure and they wanted to have me get a heart valve replacement.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly</li>
            <li>/&gt;This does not mean you will have an allergic reaction too - it means however that if you feel discomfort from using ANY product, you should discontinue use.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner smelled strongly of mint and was not exactly how I wanted to go around smelling.</li>
            <li>Nioxin Cleanser always keeps my hair feeling clean, and I have never had any dandruff or dry scalp while using this product.  </li>
            <li>(I have gray and straight hair at 65 yr old).</li>
            <li>Normally, I have to get it at a salon and pay the inflated price.</li>
            <li>I know most people say it falls out at the beginning of use because its dead hair and takes time to improve the scalp environment</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten into my late 30&#x27;s, my once-soft and touchable hair has gotten frizzy, stringy and kind of unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>In few days I have already experience a thicker more voluminous hair.</li>
            <li>I decided my dream of nice, thick hair was not meant to be</li>
            <li>In other words, if you buy decent regular shampoo, you are already in the whole 15 bucks or more.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily and fine hair</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo I have used in a long time that left my hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the &#x27;scalp therapy&#x27; spray any more, I use the cleanser pretty much daily, and the conditioner every few days.</li>
            <li>I had to find a new source.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my hair has been looking thinner with the new formula.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try and find a new shampoo.</li>
            <li>Since receiving the new bottle I can already see the difference.</li>
            <li>Great product, worth the price, and price isn&#x27;t even that bad considering the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The price is increasing lately but still good price compared the local hair salon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve run into the product before, which is pure white, thick and comes in the bottle with the black bottle cap with WHITE top before and noticed a greatly excellerated rate of hair loss, as it covered my shower drain daily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yesterday was the first time I used the cleanser only (I am out of conditioner and have to get some!)</li>
            <li>If I see a noticeable difference in the months to come, I&#x27;ll be the first person to come back and give this 5 stars and sing it&#x27;s praises from the rooftops.  </li>
            <li>feel, as a 33 yr old guy, my hair loss is slower (normal) now.</li>
            <li>I had run out of the shampoo and noticed my hair seemed to be falling out more than usual.</li>
            <li>she felt like it was able to clean all the buildup from other shampoos, conditioners, and other hair products she uses on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>It just helps hair grow out strong and gives your scalp a little umph.</li>
            <li>Only recently has my own hair loss moved into the next stage, where the System 2 will probably be my next purchase to help with the thinning look.</li>
            <li>Not good for someone who wants more hair...</li>
            <li>Light, small amount needed.leaves hair really supple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 now and still have a full head of hair with only a tiny amount of thinning in front.</li>
            <li>It left my hair looking full, without any buildup, meaning that I never felt the need to alternate shampoos.  </li>
            <li>At first the loss slowed, then I had the impression that the recessions filled back in a little.</li>
            <li>Plus I am unfotunate enough to love wearing black.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be watered down or not the original formula.  </li>
            <li>I have used Nioxin for years and this is definitely not the real thing as far as I can determine.</li>
            <li>If you look closely at the bottle and trademarks it will become clear.</li>
            <li>well I cannot say too much about it because it&#x27;s been only 3 weeks since i start using it</li>
            <li>Also, I feel better about myself since at least I&#x27;m trying to stop hair loss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old and noticed my hair is thinning</li>
            <li>: I was nearly out of shampoo</li>
            <li>Im 19 years old</li>
            <li>It really makes me feel like it is deep cleaning and working.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised I could see difference in my hair growth in 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>After using this product (cleanser and conditioner &amp;#34;scalp therapy&amp;#34;) I have noticed that my hair is not nearly as oily as before, even when I go a day without washing it (which used to make my hair look like I poured oil on my head)</li>
            <li>and my dandruff is almost completely non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product; you get a lot of it also for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not bald or even balding - I just have some thinning hair near my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy on here than at local stores.</li>
            <li>use it nearly every day of the year, why not, it works!&lt;br /&gt;TomB</li>
            <li>My hair texture feels silky and my hair looks alive now.</li>
            <li>My father is bald, my mother is balding, and my 23 year old brother is well on his way.</li>
            <li>hair doesn&#x27;t tangle nearly as easily.&lt;br /&gt;Helped</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a real way to prove it, but it is definitely different from what I used to get at Costco.</li>
            <li>it took a while for the effects of it to leave my body completely.</li>
            <li>Use something natural and not this stuff if you value your health and well being.</li>
            <li>The shine is gone and it eally just has that old lady,</li>
            <li>I do have about 4oz of the old formula in my travel kit to compare with the \\&quot;new\\&quot; formula.</li>
            <li>So it only makes sense to toss in a few more bucks and get the product that gives me the hair I want.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t lost much hair since I&#x27;ve been using it, but I can&#x27;t really say if that&#x27;s due to the Nioxin or not.  </li>
            <li>It also does not mean that you will grow hair back in areas where there has been loss by using this product.</li>
            <li>Very Very sad because I have been using this product for years.and that is a GREAT SHAMPOO!!!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE... they changed the formula it now makes my head itch.</li>
            <li>What I had was an expensive shampoo that did exactly what my old shampoo did, only with more itchiness.</li>
            <li>That, with my own personal experience is definitely proof enough that its a waste of money!  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as for reinvigorating that youthful head full of thick hair (or just putting the brakes on thinning hair) I would  advise you not to get your hopes up too high.  </li>
            <li>then I observed that the new product was distributed by Wella Haircare in CA and was made in Mexico;  the former product was made by Nioxin Laboratories in Atlanta in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a new commercial fraud.and Shoulders sells for $3.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was no longer falling out, and I actually saw new groth at temples.  </li>
            <li>They explained that Nioxin exfoliates your scalp and allows new hair to grow in, and they said I should definitely try it.  </li>
            <li>She said that there was quite a lot of new, short hair growing among the longer hair.  </li>
            <li>Now buying here at a new low price!  </li>
            <li>My scalp is very itchy and dry, and was driving me nuts.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair, works very well if used on a regular basis daily.  </li>
            <li>Mild thinning can go almost completely unnoticed using this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo if you have fine or thin hair.  </li>
            <li>They showed me all the new growth I had all over my head, and places where my hair had been flat and now was  filling in.  </li>
            <li>I am a sixty year old Asian American male and have been using Nioxin about eleven months as of this writing and highly recommend it for guys with thinning</li>
            <li>I am going to try in the near future.</li>
            <li>In my experience I&#x27;ve had (gray) hairs fill in randomly on my upper forehead and my eyebrows seem to grow wildly now, but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s not the Nioxin</li>
            <li>He was in his early thirties then and even I noticed his hair thinning, but he gave it a glowing recommendation which is why I agreed to buy it on my next haircut.</li>
            <li>I had gotten this product several years ago and the ingredients were all natural.  </li>
            <li>and I saved nearly $10 for the big bottle ordering it online.</li>
            <li>My hair is finally coming back to normal, and I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected and was the exact product I wanted to try.</li>
            <li>I was losing hair and getting thin on top.</li>
            <li>The large bottle makes it last a very long time.</li>
            <li>No new hair growth, but it certainly helps me keep what I&#x27;ve got left.  </li>
            <li>and that is that the conditioner and scalp therapy spray comes in too small of bottles, meaning it will go quick.</li>
            <li>The newer formula is pure white and thick and comes in a bottle with a black bottle cap with WHITE top to it.</li>
            <li>This has helped me to not loose hair.</li>
            <li>One person said, \\&quot;Your hair is really growing\\&quot; and the other said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t remember your hair being that long\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Now the new Nioxin cleanser formula makes my scalp dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser was clear color which is different from blue color what I used to use.</li>
            <li>but one of my co-workers also told me that he can really tell that my hair looks fuller and less thin on top.  </li>
            <li>There is no other product like it for my hair, and I spend half as much as retail.  </li>
            <li>I first started using it at the advise of my hair stylist &amp; within a short space of time could see that there was much less hair loss in the shower.</li>
            <li>My hair is noticeably thicker and just bigger in general.  </li>
            <li>the tingly feeling at first goes away after a few uses.</li>
            <li>My hair was really becoming noticeably thin</li>
            <li>Be warned, the first month you will shed out dead hair and it will freak you out.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend tried it but went back to her expensive Japanese shampoo that smells nice (and leaves my hair lifeless), but she loves my hair and runs her hands through it frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only did I not loose any hair</li>
            <li>I have used the product for several years and it has done well making my hair look full and thick.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the new product said simply: apply, rinse then add other Noxin products.  </li>
            <li>So if your looking for a quick fix, this isnt it try using a body shampoo that will coat your hair with wax and other harsh stuff that will brake your hair.</li>

            <li> There appears to be bogus product out there being sold at what looks like a good discount.</li>
            <li> but I have a friend who is fairly convinced it works.  </li>
            <li> She started raving about how good of a product it was.</li>
            <li> Good luck fellow hair thinner.&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> I purchase this product for my son and it has worked good for him.  </li>

            <li> You have lost a good customer....</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> His hairstylist is convinced that he still has a fair amount of hair because of Nioxin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had good luck with it.</li>
            <li> good on the scalp</li>
            <li> supplier offrs Nioxin at a good price and delivered it as promised.</li>
            <li> seems to be good product</li>
            <li> its good for now.</li>

            <li> Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Works great and scalp feels good and clean.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and feel it is a very good, economical cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> so she ordered her own.</li>
            <li> I am just a user and loving it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I now suspect the product I just purchased will not be effective to regrow thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> website says that it&#x27;s effective for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> all these changes by P&amp;G, I question whether Nioxin today is the effective product of yesterday or</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes your head tingle, love it</li>
            <li> After just one use of this system, my sclap feel so good and healthy and not itchy.  </li>
            <li> A product that I have used for many years, scalp is in good condition, but the product has not improved hair growth.</li>
            <li> and nice price</li>
            <li> He likes how clean it makes his hair feel and, the great scent.</li>
            <li> All are easy to use and leave my hair in good shape.  </li>
            <li> excellent shampoo for daily use good price</li>
            <li> It is nice having my scalp feeling so healthy and my hair feels soooooo clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and this seems to make it thicker.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling very clean, and smells kind of peppermint-y.  </li>
            <li> I was a user of the original Nioxin for years with good results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for many years as it was recommended by the professional who cuts my hair, and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> They said that the minty shampoo would be great, that the conditioner wasn&#x27;t as important for hair growth, and that the tonic you put right on your scalp was AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ordering the Nioxin 2 cleanser to see if it works faster :)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 20 years and have tried many others.  </li>
            <li> hair is thinning even more after I started to use Nioxin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even more impressive to me is that after just a week I keep looking for those fifteen or so hairs left in my hands after styling, but they&#x27;re not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are a lot of products out there claiming to help, but take it from me, this stuff does what it says, it creates a healthy scalp environment for hair to grow and leaves you hair feeling thicker.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for more than 2 yrs now and love it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo feels and smells great (very minty).  </li>
            <li> Sure</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price and several sizes to choose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i have been using nioxin for two years now and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It will be shiner and healthy.</li>
            <li> So the sooner you start using the product the better.  </li>
            <li> The sooner you get started the more hair you will keep into your 40s and 50s.  </li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I won&#x27;t be able to continue.</li>
            <li> and I love it a lot.  </li>
            <li> it works well with the its sister conditional (which I like it better than the Shampoo).</li>
            <li> my hair feels and looks noticeably better.  </li>
            <li> I love the peppermint smell and</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair healthy and from falling out</li>
            <li> maybe more.  </li>
            <li> and I still love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love how my hair feels with it.  </li>
            <li> Will keep buying more bottles.</li>
            <li> love the product.</li>
            <li> I recommend to a friend who was almost bald on top.</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the way it makes my scalp and hair feel.  </li>
            <li> I love this product as well as the rest in the set.  </li>
            <li> and it is better than the Tre&#x27;semme that I have used for years.</li>
            <li> , my hair just FEELS so much better.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am now looking for a replacement for my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li> But, it is not sold in stores or salons in my area, so I was glad to find I could order it online.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li> BTW, has anyone found a satisfying replacement?</li>
            <li> I love this product better than WEN.</li>
            <li> Works awesome, this is the second bottle I have ordered.</li>
            <li> About .5 inches!! :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> * product was well packed , came safely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and Amazin definitely has the best prices on it.</li>
            <li> Really love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I had started losing hair and when I started using the nioxin shampoo and conditioner, it worked wonders, so I have continued to use it and am completely satisfied with it</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Plus, love the price and will always order through the wwebsite.</li>
            <li> and I cannot see anything magical happening.  </li>
            <li> Lovely minty smell and made my hair shine but did NOT improve thinness or volume.</li>
            <li> Been using for many years at the suggestion of my hairstylist.  </li>
            <li> Again what I just said love the product and was recommended by my hair dresser and it is doing the job</li>
            <li> I have not seen any noticeable \\&quot;fluffing\\&quot; to create an illusion of greater volume</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, the tea tree and mint, make for a refreshing wash.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li> i love it ,It makes my hair feel so nice and clean ,Try Nioxin.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice clean feeling and makes your hair feel thicker.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so nice and clean with no build up.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and rinses out clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had comments from a number of people over the years about how nice my hair looks, and that&#x27;s good news since I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> It has a very clean smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very fine and smooth ...not greasy at all</li>
            <li> But the shampoo IS worth the expense, every penny!!</li>
            <li> and I suppose the thinner area on top of my head filled in a bit more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only do the shampoo and conditioner feel great - they&#x27;re kind of minty and tingly -</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, healthy, and i feel proud of it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair so clean!  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair really clean!</li>
            <li> I saw amazing results after the first day!</li>
            <li> the only con I have is the shampoo doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel very good.</li>
            <li> Free shipping from Amazon made it all the more value.</li>
            <li> works great on my old hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I would like to use Nioxin and recommend to someone who wants to have a charming hair.</li>
            <li> and I was really self-conscious about it and having people notice and comment that my hair looks good makes me want to keep using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, however, what&#x27;s a nice head of hair worth?</li>
            <li> Oh sweet relief!  </li>
            <li> Instead, my hair is full of life!  </li>
            <li> i originally got it from a hair stylist because she thought it might help with a thinning patch on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> Now for the important item...performance.... keeping in mind that I wasn&#x27;t very good at using the conditioner or leave in scalp treatment, my review is only for the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos do not work well for my hair, Nioxin leaves my hair shiny, clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> Nioxin has very quickly thickened the hair on my head and virtually eliminated hair loss associated with combing, adding product and styling...</li>
            <li> The process is very quick every day.  </li>
            <li> This is our second bottle, leaves hair feeling really great and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product as it really helps my hair to get thicker and leaves a fresh mint feeling to the scalp.</li>
            <li> and it has always been good for me as it makes my hair fell like they are real soft yet</li>
            <li> The cleanser works fine</li>
            <li> I have always had baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> For years I have used this product for my ultra fine hair.</li>
            <li> If your labs check out fine, then you should go for the product.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and does not bother my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I find the price reasonable and the system is easy and effective for hair thinning problems.  </li>
            <li> a huge difference by comparison.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and securely packaged.  </li>
            <li> it is important to follow the directions though...</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that makes my hair fuller annd not \\&quot;fly</li>
            <li> Great product, can only buy it online now</li>
            <li> If you want a minty shampoo and conditioner get a cheap supermarket one as this is just a con.</li>
            <li> Nioxin does a good job of a \\&quot;perceived thickening effect\\&quot; while not stripping the natural oils.</li>
            <li> If you know what you&#x27;re looking for, it&#x27;s quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> I have been useing the original (gold caps, made in GA).  </li>
            <li> I cannot find the original anywhere.  </li>
            <li> is worth something!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice minty smell to it and cleans out the dirt and dust real well, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same arctic peppermint effect as it&#x27;s Conditioner-counterpart has (which is probably a good thing).</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is an original Nioxin shampoo.</li>
            <li> It gets the scalp really clean and healthy.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> It has a minty smell which is a clean smell.  </li>
            <li> Always clean and makes my hair tingle</li>
            <li> Even if you are not looking for an amazing deep comdtioner safe for use every day</li>
            <li> h&#x3D;keeps my scalp clean.</li>
            <li> stays looking clean</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel clean without residue.</li>
            <li> Gives my scalp a clean tingly sensation and it no longer itches.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it has worked miracles for others, but for me this a good alcohol and animal product free shampoo and little more.</li>
            <li> However, I really think these products together do a phenomenal job.  </li>
            <li> Big bottle, good price</li>
            <li> Will be returning for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo, but don&#x27;t expect your hair to grow back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got cool mint smell and gives your head the mint sensation like when you put a gum to your mouth, giving you that chilled cooled feeling to your head.  </li>
            <li> Amazons price is a true bargain.</li>
            <li> All true.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair more manageable an sped it appears to be much thicker.</li>
            <li> If anything my hair came out more and my scalp was really itchy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy to order and the delivery was very fast.  </li>
            <li> Great price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> she liked it so much we got this large bottle</li>
            <li> From my experience, I can happily recommend Nioxin to other victims of premature hair loss.</li>
            <li> The savings is tremendous verses purchasing in a hair saloon or store.  </li>
            <li> Was loosing hair quick.  </li>
            <li> quick service...</li>
            <li> One plus is my hair felt super clean-until spraying the treatment spray.</li>
            <li> Lucky?  </li>
            <li> I mention my hair is super soft?!&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> Came quickly in the mail--never used.</li>
            <li> This came quickly, but the product seems counterfeit.</li>
            <li> sure enough it was a much better deal.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair seems to stay clean longer, so I only have to use it 2X/week - love it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li> Like 3x more than normal.</li>
            <li> my wife actually started using it to clean her hair after she ran out of her own shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, naturally wavy/curly hair and my hair was always oily</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t always easy to find -- or people price it very high.</li>
            <li> Glad I read the new reviews before making a purchase...</li>
            <li> they never say that it prevents hair loss or creates more or new hair, it just creates the appearance of fuller hair for those whose hair is thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second this amazing shampoo was delivered to my door i quickly took a shower.</li>
            <li> For $30 I got the whole System 1 Kit for Fine Hair.(off eBay)</li>
            <li> I use the product everyday and is great for the price.</li>
            <li> : Hair still looks amazing 11 years later.</li>
            <li> Delivery was really fast, and free.</li>
            <li> You will have to decide if the leak in your wallet is worth the product results yourself but for me, it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it if it helps to regrow thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is well worth the money that you are going to spend</li>
            <li> Here, you get free shipping, no sales tax in most states, plus a regular shipment.  </li>
            <li> But its better than being a bald 26 year old woman.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t form any dandruff and it has such a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair love the smell of it to</li>
            <li> Well worth the money if you hair is thinning and falling out.  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance - the way it cleans - how soft my hair is and the shine I get.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s totally worth the money to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was wonderful for my baby-fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> Only kind our family will use.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the money???</li>
            <li> Always satisfied with results of soft manageable hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not thinning, I strictly bought it to promote a healthy scalp and apparently it works!!!  </li>
            <li> Waking up and finding a pillow full of hair doesn&#x27;t exactly feel right to a teenager.</li>
            <li> More than many other products on the market but worth it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and very clean.</li>
            <li> and she was so right.  </li>
            <li> at that point I thought I must be on the right path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Speedy shipping and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> It cleans my hair really well though, squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ll attest that I haven&#x27;t had dandruff or further hair loss since starting, and I like that the (online) price is reasonable and hasn&#x27;t increased much over time.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and clean!  </li>
            <li> I have platnum bleached hair that is very fine, if i use anything else other then enjoy (witch is $35  for a 12oz bottle) my hair brakes off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the original formula but still decent shampoo.</li>
            <li> I rarely use &#x27;product&#x27; or gels, and I eat healthy and exercise regularly (which may or may not matter to hair health).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to get a bottle of the old formula from a online supplier, now out of stock completely, as soon as I was able to start using the old formula again the hair loss STOPPED!</li>
            <li> After all this time and money spent, I have no perceived increase in hair density like the bottle claims and all it has done is made my hair fall out even more!  </li>
            <li> very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I ordered Nioxin Cleanser for Fine Hair, System 1, Natural Hair as it is showed on description but It came with Nioxin Cleanser for Fine Hair, System 2, Natural Hair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of this to get clean and like another reviewer said it doesn&#x27;t lather much.</li>
            <li> For the first bottle anyway.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product line the first time, I was led to believe it would help me regrow the hair I&#x27;d lost.  </li>
            <li> Finally, another stylist said that I needed to stop using the product because it was causing more problems for my scalp</li>
            <li> but from the first treatment I noticed without question that my hair looked fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li> Overall I believe my hair health is better for using this product.</li>
            <li> What you are left with is nothing more than overpriced Suave.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo came in on time and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> First off...</li>
            <li> Exactly like it should be.</li>
            <li> So hte first thing you&#x27;re thinking is \\&quot;SCAM,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair grow back, but it stops loosing more hair.  </li>
            <li> His barber told him about it in the first place.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Since I started using Nioxin scalp treatment (yes, it can burn but I&#x27;m willing to endure that for the benefits)</li>
            <li> It is soft, smooth, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It is now heavier to the feel, more like oldtime shampoo and doesn&#x27;t even smell the same.  </li>
            <li> I received more then double the ozs.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been using this stage one consistently for 5 years.</li>
            <li> Knowing the exact product you have to order is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used so many shampoos but this is the only one stopped my hair from falling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Of course, I throw it up on my head and braid it after the first day, but I tell you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be bald on the top and back of my head if it weren&#x27;t for this product.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me first after chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> Well, the first time I used this product, my hair came out in clumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, and my hair looks really good.  </li>
            <li> all these changes by P&amp;G, I question whether Nioxin today is the effective product of yesterday or a new commercial fraud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about six weeks, and can say that while I haven&#x27;t noticed any measureable differences, it does make my hair and scalp feel very clean.  </li>
            <li> I have tried any new shampoo product on the market that promotes hair growth and this is the only one that I have experienced that actually works.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and clean, but no result.  </li>
            <li> After some research I decided on this product and sure enough my hair looks much healthier than it did a month ago, my hair also seems thicker than before.</li>
            <li> and it becomes flat very quickly unless I have the right shampoo.</li>
            <li> powerful clear!!</li>
            <li> I was still a little nervous, but the people at the supply shop were SO SURE that this could help me--from their own personal experience to what they had learned at workshops, etc.  </li>
            <li> So first off, I use the whole system (shampoo, conditioner, scalp treatment).  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Nioxin and have been well satisfied over the years.</li>
            <li> So unless I hear for a reliable source it is no better than good shampoo, no reason to switch.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it, if only for the tingle-fresh feeling it leaves behind on your scalp and the delightful peppermint scent.</li>
            <li> My wife has long hair and is very hypo alergic to many formulas, this one she loves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair super soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I can now even wear my hair down and with some hairspray, it actually looks great.  </li>
            <li> so far so good, and i will say it seems that less hair falls out as well</li>
            <li> and I do believe my fine hair also has more body than I generally notice with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got this for the dyke I was dating who had male pattern baldness, stopped hair loss, maybe some fine hair growth.</li>
            <li> &amp; I feel it has really helped stop hair loss.</li>
            <li> It is in reality, great for making thin hair look thicker, but it is not for the loss of hair at all and the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t claim it is even tho&#x27; some reviews by customers imply this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole Nioxin system (#1) for about 2 years now.  </li>
            <li> I also confirmed with 2 different Dermatologists that its all a gimmick and does nothing!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference yet.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t care if it is system 1 or system 2.</li>
            <li> I started using the whole system ( cleanser, scalp therapy and, conditioner)</li>
            <li> I started really noticing a difference in about three months, I started to get peach fuzz now</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t if you&#x27;re not getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product line.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shampoo for awhile now and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> Works great for thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair quit breaking off and it looked and felt SO much healthier.</li>
            <li> It really helps.  </li>
            <li> so who knows if it would really work or not.</li>
            <li> From my experience the shampoo cleans your hair like shampoos supposed to-It makes you smell really bad-It makes your scalp itch-</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re balding then none of these things (besides an allergic reaction) will really deter you from trying it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also made in Mexico so who knows what&#x27;s in it really.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so much thicker.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a much lower price then in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Very diappointed.  </li>
            <li> repair damaged ends.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not losing as much hair to brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> Now, thanks to customer reviews I have been spared experiencing the &amp;#34; new&amp;#34; version.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast and arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It really works and I do recommend it to whose who need this product for their hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product worked really well in fact it&#x27;s transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> My husband is really frugal but he will spend money on this shampoo .</li>
            <li> I used to feel an intense heated buzz on my scalp after using this product (5 years ago or so).  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> The stimulation was almost too much.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for thin haired people; definitely recommended.  </li>
            <li> SO I PURCHASED THIS BIGGER BOTTLE, SEEMS TO BE WORKING - NOT A MIRACLE WORKER, STILL HAVE THIN HAIR BUT SEEMS TO HELP - AWESOME PRICE!</li>
            <li> The leave-in spray is a little sticky right after using it but in an hour or more that goes away and your hair is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair feels smooth and I tried a lot of other shampoos before this one (it&#x27;s worth the price).</li>
            <li> Now as far as growing back more hair, I&#x27;m not sure how effective that is.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a decent shampoo; thick and works up a good lather.  </li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference, and this has worked better than other thickening shampoos for me.</li>
            <li> Proctor &amp; Gamble needs to bring back the original formula</li>
            <li> I never used it due to loosing hair, but rather for more volume and scalp calming.  </li>
            <li> Pricey, but as oldest of 5 boys, I have more hair than the other 4 combined.  </li>
            <li> My hair thinned out so much on that particular product my family and friends noticed.</li>
            <li> A week in and my hair is still falling out at its fast and steady pace...it does say to use for 30 days to see a difference though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but for me it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> Only need a small amount and does a great job.</li>
            <li> So I scheduled a consultation at a high end salon, showed them what was going on, and they sent me straight to the beauty supply shop for Nioxin.  </li>
            <li> really couldn&#x27;t speak to whether or not it can help one regrow or stop losing hair, but it gets my hair and scalp very clean, is gentle enough for frequent use and definitely works better than any other $30 bottle of shampoo I&#x27;ve used, and so to me</li>
            <li> After buying a smaller bottle of this at my local hair supply store (for a LOT more money), this is the bargain on this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used it steady for about three years.</li>
            <li> I definitely believe I have kept more hair than would have happened without using this product daily.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent price.</li>
            <li> It strips all the residue that most cheap shampoos leave behind.</li>
            <li> At first I noticed the new product, unlike the old, made NO MENTION of its ability to remove Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the testosterone-based cause of baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily I heard about Nioxin and after 3 months of use my hair was back to its normal thickness.</li>
            <li> Nioxin dose not weight your hair down and leaves it very clean.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this as well as the partner conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> ( I have a high testosterone level).</li>
            <li> the doctor&#x27;s all were wondering how I was breathing, if I was on medication for high blood pressure and they wanted to have me get a heart valve replacement.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does not mean you will have an allergic reaction too - it means however that if you feel discomfort from using ANY product, you should discontinue use.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smelled strongly of mint and was not exactly how I wanted to go around smelling.</li>
            <li> Nioxin Cleanser always keeps my hair feeling clean, and I have never had any dandruff or dry scalp while using this product.  </li>
            <li> (I have gray and straight hair at 65 yr old).</li>
            <li> Normally, I have to get it at a salon and pay the inflated price.</li>
            <li> I know most people say it falls out at the beginning of use because its dead hair and takes time to improve the scalp environment</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten into my late 30&#x27;s, my once-soft and touchable hair has gotten frizzy, stringy and kind of unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> In few days I have already experience a thicker more voluminous hair.</li>
            <li> I decided my dream of nice, thick hair was not meant to be</li>
            <li> In other words, if you buy decent regular shampoo, you are already in the whole 15 bucks or more.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily and fine hair</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo I have used in a long time that left my hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the &#x27;scalp therapy&#x27; spray any more, I use the cleanser pretty much daily, and the conditioner every few days.</li>
            <li> I had to find a new source.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my hair has been looking thinner with the new formula.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try and find a new shampoo.</li>
            <li> Since receiving the new bottle I can already see the difference.</li>
            <li> Great product, worth the price, and price isn&#x27;t even that bad considering the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The price is increasing lately but still good price compared the local hair salon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve run into the product before, which is pure white, thick and comes in the bottle with the black bottle cap with WHITE top before and noticed a greatly excellerated rate of hair loss, as it covered my shower drain daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yesterday was the first time I used the cleanser only (I am out of conditioner and have to get some!)</li>
            <li> If I see a noticeable difference in the months to come, I&#x27;ll be the first person to come back and give this 5 stars and sing it&#x27;s praises from the rooftops.  </li>
            <li> feel, as a 33 yr old guy, my hair loss is slower (normal) now.</li>
            <li> I had run out of the shampoo and noticed my hair seemed to be falling out more than usual.</li>
            <li> she felt like it was able to clean all the buildup from other shampoos, conditioners, and other hair products she uses on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> It just helps hair grow out strong and gives your scalp a little umph.</li>
            <li> Only recently has my own hair loss moved into the next stage, where the System 2 will probably be my next purchase to help with the thinning look.</li>
            <li> Not good for someone who wants more hair...</li>
            <li> Light, small amount needed.leaves hair really supple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 now and still have a full head of hair with only a tiny amount of thinning in front.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking full, without any buildup, meaning that I never felt the need to alternate shampoos.  </li>
            <li> At first the loss slowed, then I had the impression that the recessions filled back in a little.</li>
            <li> Plus I am unfotunate enough to love wearing black.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be watered down or not the original formula.  </li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for years and this is definitely not the real thing as far as I can determine.</li>
            <li> If you look closely at the bottle and trademarks it will become clear.</li>
            <li> well I cannot say too much about it because it&#x27;s been only 3 weeks since i start using it</li>
            <li> Also, I feel better about myself since at least I&#x27;m trying to stop hair loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and noticed my hair is thinning</li>
            <li> : I was nearly out of shampoo</li>
            <li> Im 19 years old</li>
            <li> It really makes me feel like it is deep cleaning and working.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised I could see difference in my hair growth in 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> After using this product (cleanser and conditioner &amp;#34;scalp therapy&amp;#34;) I have noticed that my hair is not nearly as oily as before, even when I go a day without washing it (which used to make my hair look like I poured oil on my head)</li>
            <li> and my dandruff is almost completely non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product; you get a lot of it also for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not bald or even balding - I just have some thinning hair near my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper to buy on here than at local stores.</li>
            <li> use it nearly every day of the year, why not, it works!&lt;br /&gt;TomB</li>
            <li> My hair texture feels silky and my hair looks alive now.</li>
            <li> My father is bald, my mother is balding, and my 23 year old brother is well on his way.</li>
            <li> hair doesn&#x27;t tangle nearly as easily.&lt;br /&gt;Helped</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a real way to prove it, but it is definitely different from what I used to get at Costco.</li>
            <li> it took a while for the effects of it to leave my body completely.</li>
            <li> Use something natural and not this stuff if you value your health and well being.</li>
            <li> The shine is gone and it eally just has that old lady,</li>
            <li> I do have about 4oz of the old formula in my travel kit to compare with the \\&quot;new\\&quot; formula.</li>
            <li> So it only makes sense to toss in a few more bucks and get the product that gives me the hair I want.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t lost much hair since I&#x27;ve been using it, but I can&#x27;t really say if that&#x27;s due to the Nioxin or not.  </li>
            <li> It also does not mean that you will grow hair back in areas where there has been loss by using this product.</li>
            <li> Very Very sad because I have been using this product for years.and that is a GREAT SHAMPOO!!!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE... they changed the formula it now makes my head itch.</li>
            <li> What I had was an expensive shampoo that did exactly what my old shampoo did, only with more itchiness.</li>
            <li> That, with my own personal experience is definitely proof enough that its a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as for reinvigorating that youthful head full of thick hair (or just putting the brakes on thinning hair) I would  advise you not to get your hopes up too high.  </li>
            <li> then I observed that the new product was distributed by Wella Haircare in CA and was made in Mexico;  the former product was made by Nioxin Laboratories in Atlanta in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a new commercial fraud.and Shoulders sells for $3.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was no longer falling out, and I actually saw new groth at temples.  </li>
            <li> They explained that Nioxin exfoliates your scalp and allows new hair to grow in, and they said I should definitely try it.  </li>
            <li> She said that there was quite a lot of new, short hair growing among the longer hair.  </li>
            <li> Now buying here at a new low price!  </li>
            <li> My scalp is very itchy and dry, and was driving me nuts.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair, works very well if used on a regular basis daily.  </li>
            <li> Mild thinning can go almost completely unnoticed using this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo if you have fine or thin hair.  </li>
            <li> They showed me all the new growth I had all over my head, and places where my hair had been flat and now was  filling in.  </li>
            <li> I am a sixty year old Asian American male and have been using Nioxin about eleven months as of this writing and highly recommend it for guys with thinning</li>
            <li> I am going to try in the near future.</li>
            <li> In my experience I&#x27;ve had (gray) hairs fill in randomly on my upper forehead and my eyebrows seem to grow wildly now, but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s not the Nioxin</li>
            <li> He was in his early thirties then and even I noticed his hair thinning, but he gave it a glowing recommendation which is why I agreed to buy it on my next haircut.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this product several years ago and the ingredients were all natural.  </li>
            <li> and I saved nearly $10 for the big bottle ordering it online.</li>
            <li> My hair is finally coming back to normal, and I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected and was the exact product I wanted to try.</li>
            <li> I was losing hair and getting thin on top.</li>
            <li> The large bottle makes it last a very long time.</li>
            <li> No new hair growth, but it certainly helps me keep what I&#x27;ve got left.  </li>
            <li> and that is that the conditioner and scalp therapy spray comes in too small of bottles, meaning it will go quick.</li>
            <li> The newer formula is pure white and thick and comes in a bottle with a black bottle cap with WHITE top to it.</li>
            <li> This has helped me to not loose hair.</li>
            <li> One person said, \\&quot;Your hair is really growing\\&quot; and the other said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t remember your hair being that long\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Now the new Nioxin cleanser formula makes my scalp dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser was clear color which is different from blue color what I used to use.</li>
            <li> but one of my co-workers also told me that he can really tell that my hair looks fuller and less thin on top.  </li>
            <li> There is no other product like it for my hair, and I spend half as much as retail.  </li>
            <li> I first started using it at the advise of my hair stylist &amp; within a short space of time could see that there was much less hair loss in the shower.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably thicker and just bigger in general.  </li>
            <li> the tingly feeling at first goes away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> My hair was really becoming noticeably thin</li>
            <li> Be warned, the first month you will shed out dead hair and it will freak you out.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend tried it but went back to her expensive Japanese shampoo that smells nice (and leaves my hair lifeless), but she loves my hair and runs her hands through it frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only did I not loose any hair</li>
            <li> I have used the product for several years and it has done well making my hair look full and thick.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the new product said simply: apply, rinse then add other Noxin products.  </li>
            <li> So if your looking for a quick fix, this isnt it try using a body shampoo that will coat your hair with wax and other harsh stuff that will brake your hair.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair extremely dry, like no other product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My husband is going naturally genetically bald, and my hair thins due to medication......</li>
            <li> Previously, I was using WEN products and that really helped, but with the WEN I had to wash my hair every single day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> scalp treatment did not seem effective whatsoever and left an unpleasant smoky smell</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s a little frail and doesn&#x27;t style blow dry very well.</li>
            <li> He has a full head of hair, very thick and wave.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much about less hair loss yet, it&#x27;s only been a few days, but there is a MAJOR improvement in how my hair looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a giant bottle, at least as much product as 2 or 3 of the regular size bottles of shampoo.</li>
            <li> conditioner made my hair flat to my head once blow dried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t seem to last as long.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> I will try to use it for the bottle&#x27;s worth and see if anything changes, and will update this review if there are changes... but I am seriously wondering if I can make it that long.</li>
            <li> The older formula had a pale green hue to it and smelled more pepperminty and was relatively thin, compared to this \\&quot;newer\\&quot; formula.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has no pleasant or unpleasant smell, so don&#x27;t expect your significant other to stick their nose in your hair and be allured in by the normal girly smells that come so easily with the over the counter products.</li>
            <li> but i did notice difference on my hair, soft, less frizz and shiny</li>
            <li> The old formula had an ALL black bottle cap.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Long time user of Nioxin.</li>
            <li> Anytime it rains, I must run because if my hair gets wet in public, it&#x27;s a disaster.  </li>
            <li> Genetically, I should have been bald long ago (it&#x27;s supposed to come through your Mother&#x27;s side), but it&#x27;s helped me keep my hair.  </li>
            <li> Two years later,  P&amp;G closed the research lab, headquarters and factory in Atlanta and moved manufacturing to Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how manageable it makes my long thinnish hair.</li>
            <li> The product can be pricey but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it each time you wash your hair and it does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin Bionutrient Cleanser long before the company was bought by Proctor and Gamble.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this as long as it exists.</li>
            <li> so really, since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, it cost less than WEN.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a long time, but think about how long it takes to grow hair!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 5 years and just the last bottle I used had a different feel to it and didn&#x27;t even seem as if I had purchased the same shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t notice any difference from using it or using other commercial shampoos.  </li>
            <li> and with any other shampoo and conditioner I have used before if I only shampooed my hair would be dry and oily.  </li>
            <li> This bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years... keeps my scalp from getting too dry and my hair from falling out.......</li>
            <li> I am discontinuing my use of this shampoo and on to another search for something that will stop my dry scalp from itching and still produce shiney hair with a fuller feel to it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, made my hair dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> You see, there is a chemical or toxin in it that they use in dry cleaning.</li>
            <li> My permed curls were nullified as well, coming out straighter and dry looking.  </li>
            <li> I continued use for a few years and then bounced back and forth between several products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my hair would fall out after Nioxin use every single time up until today.  </li>
            <li> Wash your hair with this product, and leave it on for three minutes, not just one, and you will be amazed in just a couple of week or less how full even thin hair looks.  </li>
            <li> We do not buy the conditioner as we don&#x27;t use it, but if we did use conditioner, we&#x27;d just use regular over-the-counter conditioner, not worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair and this shampoo gives it some texture which helps make</li>
            <li> When I tried an off brand of hair growth set, i got at sallys and i started to loose my hair again.</li>
            <li> This was NEVER an issue with the older pale green formula.</li>
            <li> This got me thinking that the new formulation lacked the DHT removing ingredients that would require remaining on the scalp for at least one minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is no more expensive than most shampoos.  </li>
            <li> and you only use small amounts which means it will last you quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair loss after several weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that was falling like crazy after my baby.</li>
            <li> It smells like washing your hair with toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, not good value for money, I would say highly overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The new formula, which is no longer made in the U.S. leaves my hair stiff, dull, flat and coated.  </li>
            <li> The old product advised that the medicinal shampoo should remain on the scalp for at least ONE MINUTE before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I still have an empty bottle of the old Nioxin Bionutrient cleanser and the ingredients listed are: Water, (Nioxin Complex), Aloe Vera, Panthenol, Extract of Burdock &amp; Comfrey &amp; Quassia &amp; Buckthorn &amp; Chaparral &amp; Cranesbil &amp; Rosemary &amp; Sage &amp; Nettle &amp; Hops &amp; Horsetail &amp; Chammomile &amp; Yarrow, Jojoba, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Mucopolysaccharides, Tocopherol, Wheat Amino Acids, Biotin, Niacin, Sorbitol, Linoleic Acid, Arachidonic Acid, Acetamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, TEA Lauryl Sulfate, Lauramide DEA, 6-(N-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nioxin system on and off since I was 16... when I began shedding hair at an alarming rate.</li>
            <li> Really, I never did.</li>
            <li> I bought two big bottles of the 2 and its a waste of money</li>
            <li> This is not the same Nioxin I had purchased a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> It does and that hair was going to fall out in the next few months anyway.  </li>
            <li> Also, after looking at various reviews online...it does seem to have made quite a few people have allergic reactions as well.</li>
            <li> He is thin hair and buy using these products his hair is thicker and does not lose much in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I believe my hair-loss is minimal to none.</li>
            <li> Not much hair in my brush or my bathroom</li>
            <li> My hair stopped falling out and grew back in within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The problem is whether I can live with lousy looking hair long enough for those benefits to happen.</li>
            <li> If you have fine thin hair ...GIVE IT A TRY!!</li>
            <li> Possibly leaves hair a little easier to manage than some other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally skeptical about stuff like this, but the timing was right</li>
            <li> I like it, cleans the scalp and hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3 years and its definitely improved the texture and thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> and it says should be used in conjunction with 2 other products.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried the other products that you can use with it... which is why the word \\&quot;system\\&quot; is in the name.....</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it also saves the hair that is just about to die from clogging up.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product in the past ten years</li>
            <li> I do not think Nioxin is marketed for anything other than thinning hair and</li>
            <li> Would not use any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave residue the way other shampoos do.  </li>
            <li> I use this product to help thinning hair due to thyroid problems.  </li>
            <li> I have used it alone without other products for years.  </li>
            <li> WE have recommended to other men with thinning hair issues.  </li>
            <li> With my hair being untreated, I have always relied on \\&quot;product\\&quot; and Velcro rollers for uplift (I am very careful about taking the Velcro rollers out of my hair due to breakage).</li>
            <li> I would be very careful ordering Nioxin online.</li>
            <li> ; I started using Nioxin at the recommendation of my hair cutter who had other male clients whose thin hair came back over time.  </li>
            <li> Regular dandruff shampoos only made it worse.  </li>
            <li> I was having severe medical problems with reduced thyroid production and, among other icky side-effects (like gaining weight)</li>
            <li> I spent the past week hoping the hives I had all over my upper body wasn&#x27;t from my new, expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> The cost from amazon was also less than other supplier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels fresh, stimulating, when we ran out of first bottle we missed this shampoo terribly.</li>
            <li> really nothings worse than being a bald female but beware of the negatives and expect the worse.</li>
            <li> I have moderately thin hair, and in my young thirties</li>
            <li> VBS beauty can not back up their shipping, recieved half empty bottle, tough luck to bad, Lost my hard earned money with these folks, Go to your local store and purchase full bottle, this company is a rip off!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has basically slowed that hairline down and leaves my hair feeling thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li> and I want to see how my hair is doing six months down the road.  </li>
            <li> Also, my hair is on the oily side and anything will make it bog down and oily.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down like</li>
            <li> It helps keep his shedding down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I had to have a camera inserted down my throat ...</li>
            <li> From the second week of use to the bitter end, my scalp itched, getting worse as time wore on.  </li>
            <li> Even if your hair is not super thin/fine</li>
            <li> I also notice less hair in my hands after washing and a lot less all over my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Since he started using this shampoo, I can see much less hair in the showerbox.  </li>
            <li> it less ratty-</li>
            <li> After a year and a half, he has hair to comb.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately as a lot of women get older their hair gets thinner.</li>
            <li> This expensive shampoo has been highly recommended for men and women with thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Now at eleven months it&#x27;s definite, the thin patches of hair where I could see down to my scalp are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d grown a little concerned about losing hair again...  </li>
            <li> It took a little while to determine that it was this shampoo that did this to me.</li>
            <li> I made the bad decision to try a new body soap at the same time as I started this shampoo and this caused me some confusion as to what was causing an allergic reaction I started to have.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll see in few months, maybe by then I&#x27;ll give 5 starts.</li>
            <li> Well it did not work at all its just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money people.</li>
            <li> I have to shampoo my hair everyday though, even with this,</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a few months thinking...</li>
            <li> I also am a everyday shampoo&#x27;er.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> have never experienced any irritation or itching nor did I lose any hair initially as some people have reported.  </li>
            <li> I think), a \\&quot;scalp therapy\\&quot; spray, and a drain filter to trap hair (which I thought was gimmicky).</li>
            <li> After a few weeks the hair that had been accumulating on the drain screen after each shower stopped accumulating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m educated in an Orthodox sense with a master&#x27;s and a bachelor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I do not use the conditioner and still find my hair manageable without being limp from conditioner.</li>
            <li> used it few times.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used this for a few years now and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be a bit expensive to continue the Nioxin system, and that is the ONLY reason I ever switched to other products.</li>
            <li> Be it genetics or other common knowledge</li>
            <li> My pony-tail was dying slowly and my self-esteem was also going down the drain.  </li>
            <li> and I think it is helping me slow down the rate of hair loss.  </li>
            <li> The only reason we don&#x27;t is if we fail to place the order and don&#x27;t have time to wait.</li>
            <li> I usually use about a drop about the size of a quarter</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive, compared to traditional shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin Cleanser System 1 for the past 12 years.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, it will not prevent breakage and will not prevent hair loss (especially due to stress...</li>
            <li> ehem (guilty)... or any medical issues.</li>
            <li> so my expectations are quite small.  </li>
            <li> They usually cost $33, plus tax.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to, not sure why, but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because they have changed the chemical makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice hair loss like I did in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have oily hair (requires daily washing) that is thin, falling, and getting visibly thin at the crown area.</li>
            <li> The people who are writing the negative reviews about the shampoo being white have purchased the wrong item.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money and very expensive.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> (I am in my late thirties now).  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and when you age, your hair just loses it lustre.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost a week and my hair looks and feels thick</li>
            <li> I have a thick head of hair (Rogaine may have helped also).  </li>
            <li> Just these last two weeks I have also had at least 5 or 6 people (random strangers!)</li>
            <li> To bad Nioxnin you really have disappointed a formerly dedicated customer.</li>
            <li> I mean like 6 months.</li>
            <li> My scalp become irritated and caused serious flaking.</li>
            <li> it seriously saved my life.</li>
            <li> I used to use Nioxin years ago and was looking at getting it again after a few years of not using it (having tried Keranique with sad results).</li>
            <li> Not fair for me to post a review.</li>
            <li> I used it for over a month but no good results.</li>
            <li> The liquid content was weak and not of the substance I have been used to buying.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, the smell is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Just to review, you will lose some hair rapidly for 2-3 weeks and feel dumb for using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The scalp spray is the real stinker though-completely gross.</li>
            <li> So if you have thin hair like me, PLEASE TRY IT.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 10 years.....</li>
            <li> a matter of fact, my hair continues to thin out.  </li>
            <li> My hair started getting thin after the birth of my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have thin, frizzy and semi-wavy hair, and sans conditioner, I&#x27;m helpless at styling.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin Cleanser, System 1 (which is for fine/Untreated/Normal to Thin hair).</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Fine/untreated/normal to Thin hair\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair and realize that you are loosing hair every time you wash or comb it.  </li>
            <li> My hair was beginning to appear thin and my stylist used this product to wash my hair and suggested that I continue.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any improvement on my thin hair, but I havent noticed it getting worse in the 2 years</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> leave any residual behind when rinsed out.</li>
            <li> so you know I&#x27;m serious!</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in this stuff, but it made my hair fall out like crazy in the shower.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is another expensive shampoo..</li>
            <li> Until then, it&#x27;s simply an expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is soooo expensive at ULTA</li>
            <li> I do have to keep using tho ccuz if I stop ill</li>
            <li> It was scary.</li>
            <li> shampoo might work for bald guys who have nothing to lose, but for us women who want to keep our hair is a scary product.</li>
            <li> Thinning hair and serious flaking. :(</li>
            <li> It always has to be in a bun; otherwise, it looks terrible (limp, lifeless, oily).  </li>
            <li> It continues to fall out like crazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to ask what&#x27;s in it...</li>
            <li> I have very very thin and ugly hair.  </li>
            <li> Very Very sad because I have been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> That is some bad stuff.</li>
            <li> Plus, the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product with unrealistic expectations, as you will be disappointed, and be patient!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that the formula has changed.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Try it you wil not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The flaking is horrible too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worst test ever.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great everything was perfect</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair, works very well if used on a regular basis daily.  Great</li>
            <li> I have tried any new shampoo product on the market that promotes hair growth and this is the only one that I have experienced that actually works.  I have only used the cleanser for a month and I have had 2 people who hadn&#x27;t seen me in a month notice the hair growth and commented on it. One person said, \\&quot;Your hair is really growing\\&quot; and the other said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t remember your hair being that long\\&quot;  That has never happened to me before.  My hair is not thinning, I strictly bought it to promote a healthy scalp and apparently it works!!!  I&#x27;m almost out and I&#x27;m ordering the Nioxin 2 cleanser to see if it works faster :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so inexpensive (around $17 for 10.1 oz.) for something that works!  Plus the cooling sensation wakes me up in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definately can recommend this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for over 10 years and my hair is still there.  I believe it stopped falling out after I started using this product and it is no more expensive than most shampoos.  So unless I hear for a reliable source it is no better than good shampoo, no reason to switch.</li>
            <li> well I cannot say too much about it because it&#x27;s been only 3 weeks since i start using it but i did notice difference on my hair, soft, less frizz and shiny, I&#x27;ll see in few months, maybe by then I&#x27;ll give 5 starts. also on amazon is cheaper than beauty salon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been part of my routine for 15 years. My hair looks great and I love it.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE CLEANSER AND WAS SENT THE CONDITIONER TWICE. I WAS TOLD BY THE COMPANY THEY WILL SEND ME A CLEANSER AND IT HAS BEEN 4 MONTHS. HAVE SENT EMAILS NO ANSWER. WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR OREDER BE CAREFULL. THE COMPANY CLAIMS IS AMAZONS FAULT ???? STILL DON&#x27;T HAVE THE SHAMPOO I PAID FOR.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has slowed my hair loss because I&#x27;m not keeping track.  It cleans my hair really well though, squeaky clean.  Also, I feel better about myself since at least I&#x27;m trying to stop hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years &amp; I feel it has really helped stop hair loss. I first started using it at the advise of my hair stylist &amp; within a short space of time could see that there was much less hair loss in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a while. Normally, I have to get it at a salon and pay the inflated price. This is about 1/3 off the salon price. And delivery is always a convenient plus</li>
            <li> This was a great bagain since this size was $50.00 in the salon. Still alot of money for shampoo, but I would recommend this and will return in the future.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Have been using it for years and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Long time user of Nioxin. Most shampoos do not work well for my hair, Nioxin leaves my hair shiny, clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my wife and myself.  Delivery was prompt and securely packaged.  If used several days, a conditioner is needed.  I&#x27;ve used this product for over 20 years and have tried many others.  Nothing compares.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nioxin system on and off since I was 16... when I began shedding hair at an alarming rate. Waking up and finding a pillow full of hair doesn&#x27;t exactly feel right to a teenager. Luckily I heard about Nioxin and after 3 months of use my hair was back to its normal thickness. I continued use for a few years and then bounced back and forth between several products.&lt;br /&gt;It can be a bit expensive to continue the Nioxin system, and that is the ONLY reason I ever switched to other products. I found a cheaper solution in DS Laboratories Revita. It worked! For the first bottle anyway. I was on the second bottle of that stuff and I started to shed again in the shower. My hair thinned out so much on that particular product my family and friends noticed. I panicked and went BACK to Nioxin! My hair is finally coming back to normal, and I learned my lesson. From my experience, I can happily recommend Nioxin to other victims of premature hair loss.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product line the first time, I was led to believe it would help me regrow the hair I&#x27;d lost.  I think that perhaps it was because the stylist misunderstood the definition of the term \\&quot;thinning hair\\&quot; as used by the product manufacturer.  It is in reality, great for making thin hair look thicker, but it is not for the loss of hair at all and the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t claim it is even tho&#x27; some reviews by customers imply this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I wanted to trust my stylist, I kept using this product for over a year. From the second week of use to the bitter end, my scalp itched, getting worse as time wore on.  All the while, my stylist kept urging me on saying that I should start noticing a difference in a short time.  Really, I never did. What I had was an expensive shampoo that did exactly what my old shampoo did, only with more itchiness. Finally, another stylist said that I needed to stop using the product because it was causing more problems for my scalp - seems I had a bit of an allergic reaction to some ingredient in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not mean you will have an allergic reaction too - it means however that if you feel discomfort from using ANY product, you should discontinue use. It also does not mean that you will grow hair back in areas where there has been loss by using this product. You will have to decide if the leak in your wallet is worth the product results yourself but for me, it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My scalp become irritated and caused serious flaking. After 2 months, Nioxin worsens the problem and my hair is thinning even more.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thinning even more after I started to use Nioxin.The flaking is horrible too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have two problems. Thinning hair and serious flaking. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and noticed my hair is thinning so I decided to switch shampoos once and for all. After some research I decided on this product and sure enough my hair looks much healthier than it did a month ago, my hair also seems thicker than before. My mom tried it and loves it too so she ordered her own. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with good price. I would like to use Nioxin and recommend to someone who wants to have a charming hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3 years and its definitely improved the texture and thickness of my hair. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone who has thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using all three Nioxin products for just about a week and was impressed from day one.  I had already been using the combination of Rogaine and Propecia for about four years to stop/reverse my receding hairline.  Between the two my hairline stopped receding and I suppose the thinner area on top of my head filled in a bit more.  These results alone were enough for me to continue using both products.  However, after about four years I began losing about fifteen hairs each morning after styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist suggested Nioxin recently, so I picked up the three-in-one kit.  I&#x27;m normally skeptical about stuff like this, but the timing was right: I was nearly out of shampoo and I&#x27;d grown a little concerned about losing hair again...  Well, I have scarcely been happier with a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do the shampoo and conditioner feel great - they&#x27;re kind of minty and tingly - but from the first treatment I noticed without question that my hair looked fuller and thicker.  My hair is softer, easier to style and just healthier looking.  Others noticed too.  What&#x27;s even more impressive to me is that after just a week I keep looking for those fifteen or so hairs left in my hands after styling, but they&#x27;re not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already using Propecia and Rogaine.  I don&#x27;t expect Nioxin to regrow any of my lost hairline.  However, I really think these products together do a phenomenal job.  Nioxin has very quickly thickened the hair on my head and virtually eliminated hair loss associated with combing, adding product and styling...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I bought nioxin at a hair salon. I bought two big bottles of the 2 and its a waste of money the hair salon people said if I use anything but nioxon it will not work. Well it did not work at all its just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for many years as it was recommended by the professional who cuts my hair, and I am very happy with it.  Purchasing through this vendor is the only affordable way to go.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use Nioxin and find it meets our different needs. The savings is tremendous verses purchasing in a hair saloon or store.  95% of the time we order from Amazon.  The only reason we don&#x27;t is if we fail to place the order and don&#x27;t have time to wait.</li>
            <li> The second this amazing shampoo was delivered to my door i quickly took a shower. I saw amazing results after the first day! Im 19 years old my hair started thinning a year ago.. I have been using this shampoo for almost a week and my hair looks and feels thick it seriously saved my life. Please buy this amazing shampoo because you will see results!</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo when I was 21 (I&#x27;m 32 now) and noticed a receding hairline. This shampoo has basically slowed that hairline down and leaves my hair feeling thicker and healthier. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider buying anything else. There are a lot of products out there claiming to help, but take it from me, this stuff does what it says, it creates a healthy scalp environment for hair to grow and leaves you hair feeling thicker.</li>
            <li> I get that &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; feeling every time I shower. It really makes me feel like it is deep cleaning and working. Hair feels smooth and I tried a lot of other shampoos before this one (it&#x27;s worth the price). My hair is naturally very fine and smooth ...not greasy at all and this product helps me keep it that way. I have used Nioxin for more than 2 yrs now and love it.</li>
            <li> It has been about a month and I can already see follicle growth. Hair is thicker!</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.  CANNOT COMPLAIN about it at all.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see any improvement, but some things cannot be rushed. I try not to pass judgment until I give things a fair chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole Nioxin system (#1) for about 2 years now.  I finally gave up and stopped.  After all this time and money spent, I have no perceived increase in hair density like the bottle claims and all it has done is made my hair fall out even more!  I know most people say it falls out at the beginning of use because its dead hair and takes time to improve the scalp environment but my hair would fall out after Nioxin use every single time up until today.  I&#x27;m now going back to regular shampoos and conditioners so my hair will stop falling out!  Don&#x27;t believe in this product... its a rip off.  I also confirmed with 2 different Dermatologists that its all a gimmick and does nothing!  That, with my own personal experience is definitely proof enough that its a waste of money!  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money people.</li>
            <li> My scalp used to drive me nuts with itching and flaking.  Plus I am unfotunate enough to love wearing black.  Regular dandruff shampoos only made it worse.  A hairdresser friend of mine recommended Nioxin because in her words: \\&quot;I use this shampoo on everyone.  It gets the scalp really clean and healthy.\\&quot;  Having nothing to lose I tried it and she was so right.  Oh sweet relief!  This definitely keeps things in check and I do believe my fine hair also has more body than I generally notice with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really couldn&#x27;t speak to whether or not it can help one regrow or stop losing hair, but it gets my hair and scalp very clean, is gentle enough for frequent use and definitely works better than any other $30 bottle of shampoo I&#x27;ve used, and so to me it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference yet. Been use for about 1 month.</li>
            <li> So first off, I use the whole system (shampoo, conditioner, scalp treatment).  The process is very quick every day.  The shampoo feels and smells great (very minty).  Now as far as growing back more hair, I&#x27;m not sure how effective that is.  I have very very thin and ugly hair.  It always has to be in a bun; otherwise, it looks terrible (limp, lifeless, oily).  The rain is my enemy.  Anytime it rains, I must run because if my hair gets wet in public, it&#x27;s a disaster.  Then I started using Nioxin and yes!  It works!  It TRULY TRULY works!  So if you have thin hair like me, PLEASE TRY IT.  This stuff is great.  My hair is noticeably thicker and just bigger in general.  I can now even wear my hair down and with some hairspray, it actually looks great.  Wonderful product for thin haired people; definitely recommended.  But do use the entire system as I think it makes a difference.  My hair feels great now.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this stuff! Sure it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it, if only for the tingle-fresh feeling it leaves behind on your scalp and the delightful peppermint scent. It&#x27;s definitely been a boon to my receding hairline, and my husband&#x27;s, so for now, we&#x27;re definitely sticking with it.</li>
            <li> Was loosing hair quick.  Was recommended this stuff and it actually works.  No new hair growth, but it certainly helps me keep what I&#x27;ve got left.  Recommend to anyone who may notice the hairline retreating but doesn&#x27;t want to admit it to himself yet.  Don&#x27;t hesitate!  This stuff will let you keep your youth for a bit longer!</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo I have used in a long time that left my hair squeaky clean.  It has a minty smell which is a clean smell.  Overall I believe my hair health is better for using this product.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Nioxin Cleanser before Christmas and was given a&lt;br /&gt;sample to try at home.  After reading the directions, I found that the&lt;br /&gt;product lived up to its promises.  I tried to find the product and went&lt;br /&gt;to their website.  Amazon had the best price and several sizes to choose.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to order and the delivery was very fast.  I had never ordered&lt;br /&gt;anything from Amazon before and will in the future.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. I&#x27;m 67 now and still have a full head of hair with only a tiny amount of thinning in front. Genetically, I should have been bald long ago (it&#x27;s supposed to come through your Mother&#x27;s side), but it&#x27;s helped me keep my hair.  I&#x27;ve had comments from a number of people over the years about how nice my hair looks, and that&#x27;s good news since I have fine, straight hair. It&#x27;s gray but it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> Hair regrowth achieved!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot .</li>
            <li> I ordered Nioxin Cleanser for Fine Hair, System 1, Natural Hair as it is showed on description but It came with Nioxin Cleanser for Fine Hair, System 2, Natural Hair. The cleanser works fine and I really don&#x27;t care if it is system 1 or system 2. However I think the product description and image should match to the actual product. The cleanser was clear color which is different from blue color what I used to use. Is System 2 color different from System 1 ???</li>
            <li> Great refreshing feel while shampooing.</li>
            <li> After buying a smaller bottle of this at my local hair supply store (for a LOT more money), this is the bargain on this shampoo. Works well with my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price</li>
            <li> Have used for years once a week for thinning hair.  Good product.  Big bottle, good price</li>
            <li> I use the product everyday and is great for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo every since my sister-in-law, a hairdresser, recommended it about 7 years ago after she found out I shampoo my hair daily. She would order it for me and I&#x27;d pick it up when I got my hair cut. She recently retired so I had to find a new source. I like it, cleans the scalp and hair and a little goes a long way. I usually use about a drop about the size of a quarter</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair extremely dry, like no other product I&#x27;ve ever used. You CAN NOT use this without a conditioner or something else afterwards unless your hair goals include looking like you were just electrocuted.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. My hairstylist recommended it to me 25+ years ago. I had a severe oily (and somewhat smelly) hair condition and was losing my hair rather rapidly. This product balanced my oil production, virtually eliminated my scalp smellm and my hair looks great all the time. No, I do not have stocks in this company. I am just a user and loving it.</li>
            <li> This is not the same Nioxin I had purchased a few years ago.  All of the premium ingredients including the DHT inhibitors have been removed.  What you are left with is nothing more than overpriced Suave.  Will be returning for a full refund.  If you want growth stimulation, get Rogaine for $15 a month.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 10 years.....excellent product and it is a hair system that works......It slowed my hair loss to almost a halt.....would recommend this to you whether you be a male or female.  Give it a try you will like it....</li>
            <li> I used Nioxin shampoo/conditioner/scalp therapy religiously for 6 months and saw no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, my hair continues to thin out.  Been doing so since menopause (5 yrs.) and I doubt there are any products that will make a change.</li>
            <li> quick service...good price</li>
            <li> This was a great price for the volume.  Free shipping from Amazon made it all the more value.</li>
            <li> Always clean and makes my hair tingle</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000F4EMP0 Nioxin Cleanser, System 1 (Fine/Untreated/Normal to Thin-Looking), 33.8 Ounce]]  This expensive shampoo has been highly recommended for men and women with thinning hair.  It was recommended to me at age 35 when my hair was thinning and now at age 70 I have a thick head of hair (Rogaine may have helped also).  My female friend was also advised to use this product when she was going through chemo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, compared to traditional shampoos.  I paid $30 for a 33.8 oz bottle recently.  But it&#x27;s worth it if it helps to regrow thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I now suspect the product I just purchased will not be effective to regrow thinning hair.  At first I noticed the new product, unlike the old, made NO MENTION of its ability to remove Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the testosterone-based cause of baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I noticed that the new product said simply: apply, rinse then add other Noxin products.  The old product advised that the medicinal shampoo should remain on the scalp for at least ONE MINUTE before rinsing.  This got me thinking that the new formulation lacked the DHT removing ingredients that would require remaining on the scalp for at least one minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I noticed that the ingredients were DIFFERENT,  despite no notification from the manufacturer that this would occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I observed that the new product was distributed by Wella Haircare in CA and was made in Mexico;  the former product was made by Nioxin Laboratories in Atlanta in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of research revealed the basis for all these anomalies:  Nioxin Research Labs were purchased in 2008 by Proctor and Gamble.  Two years later,  P&amp;G closed the research lab, headquarters and factory in Atlanta and moved manufacturing to Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin&#x27;s /P&amp;G&#x27;s website says that it&#x27;s effective for thinning hair.  This is the niche that it bought when it purchased Nioxin.  It justifies charging $30  for Nioxin when P&amp;G&#x27;s Head and Shoulders sells for $3.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all these changes by P&amp;G, I question whether Nioxin today is the effective product of yesterday or a new commercial fraud.and Shoulders sells for $3.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all these changes by P&amp;G, I question whether Nioxin today is the effective product of yesterday or a new commercial fraud.</li>
            <li> The shampoo came in on time and is exactly as advertised. I am happy with this product and have used it for years. I will order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin Cleanser System 1 for the past 12 years.  My recent purchase did not contain the shampoo I have been used to.  The liquid content was weak and not of the substance I have been used to buying.  It seems to be watered down or not the original formula.  The delivered price was a bargain and I was wondering how the supplier could ship one 33.8 ounce and make a profit.</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and i have been using nioxin for two years now and love it. My hair started getting thin after the birth of my daughter. I started using the whole system ( cleanser, scalp therapy and, conditioner) but i found that it works just as good with out the scalp therapy. I started really noticing a difference in about three months, I started to get peach fuzz now the peach fuzz is completly grown out.  When I tried an off brand of hair growth set, i got at sallys and i started to loose my hair again. So if your looking for a quick fix, this isnt it try using a body shampoo that will coat your hair with wax and other harsh stuff that will brake your hair. Even if you are not looking for an amazing deep comdtioner safe for use every day this is it. I have platnum bleached hair that is very fine, if i use anything else other then enjoy (witch is $35  for a 12oz bottle) my hair brakes off. Nioxin dose not weight your hair down and leaves it very clean. I recomend it to my clients and always have it in the back bar and for retail.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for fine hair</li>
            <li> Alright, so I&#x27;ve officially been using System 1 for almost one year now. I have oily hair (requires daily washing) that is thin, falling, and getting visibly thin at the crown area. First off... the tingly feeling at first goes away after a few uses. The shampoo has no pleasant or unpleasant smell, so don&#x27;t expect your significant other to stick their nose in your hair and be allured in by the normal girly smells that come so easily with the over the counter products. Now for the important item...performance.... keeping in mind that I wasn&#x27;t very good at using the conditioner or leave in scalp treatment, my review is only for the shampoo. I used it almost daily for the last year. I was pleasantly surprised I could see difference in my hair growth in 3-4 months. Yes... it&#x27;s a long time, but think about how long it takes to grow hair! In my experience, it will not prevent breakage and will not prevent hair loss (especially due to stress... ehem (guilty)... or any medical issues. It just helps hair grow out strong and gives your scalp a little umph. Do not buy this product with unrealistic expectations, as you will be disappointed, and be patient! I&#x27;m probably going to switch to a volumizing and clarifying shampoo to supplement my routine. Also.... get a really good conditioner (I use mine on just the tips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the only con I have is the shampoo doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel very good. If you skip conditioner it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s a little frail and doesn&#x27;t style blow dry very well. I have thin, frizzy and semi-wavy hair, and sans conditioner, I&#x27;m helpless at styling. So again... get a good conditioner and you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes your head tingle, love it</li>
            <li> This is not a Nioxin formulation, in my opinion. I dare say it is a bogus product. I have used Nioxin for years and this is definitely not the real thing as far as I can determine. I would be very careful ordering Nioxin online. There appears to be bogus product out there being sold at what looks like a good discount. It isn&#x27;t if you&#x27;re not getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> great!!! love this product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a month and I have already noticed a difference in my hair.  I have very fine, naturally wavy/curly hair and my hair was always oily and I had a dandruff problem which meant daily washing.  After using this product (cleanser and conditioner &amp;#34;scalp therapy&amp;#34;) I have noticed that my hair is not nearly as oily as before, even when I go a day without washing it (which used to make my hair look like I poured oil on my head) and my dandruff is almost completely non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday was the first time I used the cleanser only (I am out of conditioner and have to get some!) and with any other shampoo and conditioner I have used before if I only shampooed my hair would be dry and oily.  Not with this!  My hair was soft and clean!  That is a miracle in and of itself!  Just these last two weeks I have also had at least 5 or 6 people (random strangers!) tell me that my hair looked really great.  This would not be a big deal except that people haven&#x27;t told me that since I was in my teens/twenties (I am in my late thirties now).  That is a big enough endorsement for me to keep using it but one of my co-workers also told me that he can really tell that my hair looks fuller and less thin on top.  My hair was really becoming noticeably thin and I was really self-conscious about it and having people notice and comment that my hair looks good makes me want to keep using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  The only reason I gave three stars and 4 or 5 is because I have only been using for a month and I want to see how my hair is doing six months down the road.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.P.S  Try this product!  Even if your hair is not super thin/fine I think you will like how it makes your hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo, but don&#x27;t expect your hair to grow back.  Even Nioxin claims on its bottle as \\&quot;9 out of 10 people perceived increase in hair density..\\&quot;.  The keyword is \\&quot;Perceive\\&quot;.. If you want to \\&quot;perceive\\&quot; that your hair is regrowing or thickening, this is your product. Otherwise, this is another expensive shampoo..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI- I&#x27;ve tried, Nioxin system 1 and 2 shampoo &amp; conditioner (6+ months), Nioxin vitamins (6+months), and the liquid treatment for 3+ months.  My hair feels soft and clean, but no result.  I did \\&quot;PERCEIVE\\&quot; that my hair density increased, but no regrowth.  Use Head &amp; shoulders thickening shampoo for $2.99 instead of wasting money like me.</li>
            <li> Exactly like it should be.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily and fine hair and it becomes flat very quickly unless I have the right shampoo. Nioxin does a good job of a \\&quot;perceived thickening effect\\&quot; while not stripping the natural oils. There is a noticeable difference, and this has worked better than other thickening shampoos for me. I have to shampoo my hair everyday though, even with this, (I&#x27;m a guy) because after about a day it will become oily again. I would definitely recommend this product; you get a lot of it also for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Stop reading these reviews and buy this now!!  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, and my hair looks really good.  It gives a nice clean feeling and makes your hair feel thicker.  I also notice less hair in my hands after washing and a lot less all over my bathroom.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00138Y0FY Nioxin  System 2 Starter Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;I have had Weight Loss Surgery, and some of my hair has fallen out. My scalp is very itchy and dry, and was driving me nuts.  After just one use of this system, my sclap feel so good and healthy and not itchy.  I also purchased a Follicle Booster along with this system.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.  If you are sitting on the fence about buying this product don&#x27;t wait any longer.  Give it a try.  It is nice having my scalp feeling so healthy and my hair feels soooooo clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the money that you are going to spend and you only use small amounts which means it will last you quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I really like this product line. My hair is very fine and this seems to make it thicker. I have been using it maybe 2 months now, and can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like in 4 more!</li>
            <li> You order the product because it talks about hair regrowth but then you get it and it says should be used in conjunction with 2 other products.  So hte first thing you&#x27;re thinking is \\&quot;SCAM,\\&quot; but I have a friend who is fairly convinced it works.  They also use the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars becasue I have hope it will work.  I&#x27;m not bald or even balding - I just have some thinning hair near my forehead.  I&#x27;m not expecting to turn into an orangutan so my expectations are quite small.  If I see a noticeable difference in the months to come, I&#x27;ll be the first person to come back and give this 5 stars and sing it&#x27;s praises from the rooftops.  Until then, it&#x27;s simply an expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shampoo for awhile now and it really makes a difference.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair grow back, but it stops loosing more hair.  Since he started using this shampoo, I can see much less hair in the showerbox.  So if you are starting to see your hairline going north, it&#x27;s time to start using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This price is the cheapest compare to a retail beauty supply store.  They usually cost $33, plus tax.  Here, you get free shipping, no sales tax in most states, plus a regular shipment.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Firstly, the smell is horrible.  It smells like washing your hair with toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, not good value for money, I would say highly overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo made my hair feel coarse and tangled.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner made my hair flat to my head once blow dried.&lt;br /&gt;The scalp treatment did not seem effective whatsoever and left an unpleasant smoky smell lingering.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product and I wish I had listened to advice and bought Kerastase instead.</li>
            <li> Works great for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It helps keep my seborrheic dermatitis at bay and has a great smell.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> VBS beauty can not back up their shipping, recieved half empty bottle, tough luck to bad, Lost my hard earned money with these folks, Go to your local store and purchase full bottle, this company is a rip off!</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin Cleanser, System 1 (which is for fine/Untreated/Normal to Thin hair). My hair is \\&quot;untreated\\&quot;. I have always had baby fine hair. Also, my hair is on the oily side and anything will make it bog down and oily. This product does not make my hair do either of these two things. With my hair being untreated, I have always relied on \\&quot;product\\&quot; and Velcro rollers for uplift (I am very careful about taking the Velcro rollers out of my hair due to breakage). Unfortunately as a lot of women get older their hair gets thinner. I happen to fall into that category. Also I WAS having problems with it breaking off. I discovered this shampoo about six years ago. I used it steady for about three years. My hair quit breaking off and it looked and felt SO much healthier. I stopped using it for a few months thinking...\\&quot;I will just buy OTC shampoo for a while\\&quot;. BIG MISTAKE!!!.... The next trip to my hairdresser she said that my hair was breaking off. She even asked if I was doing something different to my hair. I told her that I had stopped using my regular shampoo and I proceeded to tell her the name of it. She started raving about how good of a product it was. So I came home and ordered another bottle. I always order the 33.8 ounce and it lasts me for months. I mean like 6 months. And all you have to use is a dime size. I also am a everyday shampoo&#x27;er.  Although I do not find that this is by no means a product that promises to make hair thicker... It does help with the over all problems for what it says... \\&quot;Fine/untreated/normal to Thin hair\\&quot;... I only have tried the Shampoo. I have not tried the other products that you can use with it... which is why the word \\&quot;system\\&quot; is in the name.....BUT! I am going to try in the near future. And when I do I will give an update on my review. Also, this shampoo has  a peppermint / menthol feel to it on your scalp (only while you are soaped up. Not after you rinse). It also has a very pleasant smell. So bottom line...It is what it is and that is a GREAT SHAMPOO!!!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE... they changed the formula it now makes my head itch. Just as well buy OTC shampoo for the same effect. Very Very sad because I have been using this product for years.and that is a GREAT SHAMPOO!!!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE... they changed the formula it now makes my head itch.

            <li> If you have thin hair and realize that you are loosing hair every time you wash or comb it.  Star using Nixion Shampoos.  The product is wonderful and restores the hair you have.  It will be shiner and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin cleanser for 6 years and have lost perhaps an inch of my hair to my forehead.  I definitely believe I have kept more hair than would have happened without using this product daily.  Be warned, the first month you will shed out dead hair and it will freak you out.  You will start to wonder if the shedding will ever stop.  It does and that hair was going to fall out in the next few months anyway.  This product just hurried it along.  On the other hand, it also saves the hair that is just about to die from clogging up.  So the sooner you start using the product the better.  Just to review, you will lose some hair rapidly for 2-3 weeks and feel dumb for using this stuff.  Then you will keep your remaining hair for years longer by using it from then on.  You have to be patient and trust that it works.  The sooner you get started the more hair you will keep into your 40s and 50s.  Good luck fellow hair thinner.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Hair still looks amazing 11 years later. I am 45 now. Have hair that makes people jealous. I am on Nioxin 2 now. I think Nioxin 1&#x27;s formula changed. Nioxin 2 does what Nioxin 1 used to do for me. I think they changed manufacturers and formulas.</li>
            <li> No effect. At all. Waste of money. Okay shampoo but doesn&#x27;t help hair growth of prevent hair loss in any way.</li>
            <li> Glad I read the new reviews before making a purchase...I used to use Nioxin years ago and was looking at getting it again after a few years of not using it (having tried Keranique with sad results). Proctor &amp; Gamble needs to bring back the original formula, I won&#x27;t be wasting my money on this until it changes back...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shampoo I use. It does not weigh my hair down like&lt;br /&gt;other shampoos do! If you have fine thin hair ...GIVE IT A TRY!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo if you have fine or thin hair.  It really helps.  And this is the best price I have ever gotten this size bottle for.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair and this shampoo gives it some texture which helps make it less ratty- it is important to follow the directions though... lathering for 60 seconds opposed to say 15 seconds does make a difference.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smelled strongly of mint and was not exactly how I wanted to go around smelling. However, if it would make my hair thicker then I didn&#x27;t care enough to not use it. The scalp spray is the real stinker though-completely gross. But its better than being a bald 26 year old woman. My scalp did itch some after starting this shampoo. I&#x27;ve only used this nioxin treatment for a week and unfortunately I won&#x27;t be able to continue. I made the bad decision to try a new body soap at the same time as I started this shampoo and this caused me some confusion as to what was causing an allergic reaction I started to have. I spent the past week hoping the hives I had all over my upper body wasn&#x27;t from my new, expensive shampoo. However, after yet another night of hives on my arms I decided my dream of nice, thick hair was not meant to be and I dabbed some of this nioxin gunk on my hand to confirm my fear once and for all that yes, this stinky shot I had at keeping my hair is no longer an option. Read the label before you buy... Maybe find a local hair masters and dab a spot of the conditioner on your hand before buying here on amazon. A week in and my hair is still falling out at its fast and steady pace...it does say to use for 30 days to see a difference though so who knows if it would really work or not. From my experience the shampoo cleans your hair like shampoos supposed to-It makes you smell really bad-It makes your scalp itch-Its spendy. One plus is my hair felt super clean-until spraying the treatment spray. If you&#x27;re balding then none of these things (besides an allergic reaction) will really deter you from trying it...really nothings worse than being a bald female but beware of the negatives and expect the worse. Also, after looking at various reviews online...it does seem to have made quite a few people have allergic reactions as well.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin system seems to have changed. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to, not sure why, but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because they have changed the chemical makeup. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years... keeps my scalp from getting too dry and my hair from falling out.......</li>
            <li> Wife loves this (took care of dandruff) and wanted to get one for co-worker (oily hair)...she loves it!  Oh I use it too...it seems to invigorate the scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for men and women to prevent thinning hair.  We&#x27;ve been using it for years.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product for my son and it has worked good for him.  He is thin hair and buy using these products his hair is thicker and does not lose much in the shower.  He has been using Nioxin for over a year and will continuel</li>
            <li> Shampoo works good! Cleans scalp well. I&#x27;ve used it for years and continue to use it. Much cheaper to buy on here than at local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about six weeks, and can say that while I haven&#x27;t noticed any measureable differences, it does make my hair and scalp feel very clean.  It also seems to thicken my hair somewhat.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> It came on time, and it was the product I thought i was going to get. Good price.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this cleanser faithfully.  He loves it.  He has psoriasis, and it helps with the dryness and flakes.  He has a full head of hair, very thick and wave.  He would recommend this to anyone.  His barber told him about it in the first place.</li>
            <li> prompt delivery. exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This has helped me to not loose hair.</li>
            <li> I thought they were kidding when they told me it would help my hair to quit thinning, but it works great.  On my third bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in the past ten years and I love it a lot.  The price is increasing lately but still good price compared the local hair salon</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shampoo either my Husband or I have ever used! My husband is going naturally genetically bald, and my hair thins due to medication......but this shampoo is awesome! We do not buy the conditioner as we don&#x27;t use it, but if we did use conditioner, we&#x27;d just use regular over-the-counter conditioner, not worth the expense. But the shampoo IS worth the expense, every penny!!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this as well as the partner conditioner.  Buying the two together is probably the recommended purchase though.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping</li>
            <li> Been using this product for awhile now &amp; for the size bottle great price !!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone whose gracefully thinning.</li>
            <li> I started using this back in the beginning of March. My hair started falling out.  It continues to fall out like crazy so I am stopping using it.  Paid $40 for the 3 products that do not have nioxin listed anywhere on the ingredients.  It&#x27;s also made in Mexico so who knows what&#x27;s in it really. Rip off.</li>
            <li> I believe this product is excellent !&lt;br /&gt;I use it nearly every day of the year, why not, it works!&lt;br /&gt;TomB</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo!  It&#x27;s got cool mint smell and gives your head the mint sensation like when you put a gum to your mouth, giving you that chilled cooled feeling to your head.  it works well with the its sister conditional (which I like it better than the Shampoo). Once I go through with this bottle, I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great price!</li>
            <li> Been using Nioxin for several years now. A beautician told me about Nioxin and I started using it. I&#x27;m not bald but was thinning and I believe it has helped keep what I have all theses years and always get the best price on Amazon</li>
            <li> Great shampoo even if a bit on the pricey side</li>
            <li> I am a sixty year old Asian American male and have been using Nioxin about eleven months as of this writing and highly recommend it for guys with thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to replace hair nor stop hair loss specifically; I started using Nioxin at the recommendation of my hair cutter who had other male clients whose thin hair came back over time.  I started using it for about 2 months and didn&#x27;t notice anything and by that time had migrated (for style reasons) to another hairdresser.  I told her I was using Nioxin and she said that that&#x27;s what her and her salon uses to treat thinning hair - at that point I thought I must be on the right path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone told me it takes about six months to see any results though after about four months I thought I was improving.  Now at eleven months it&#x27;s definite, the thin patches of hair where I could see down to my scalp are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Nioxin 3 system product because I color my hair which consists of a shampoo, conditioner and a leave-in spray treatment.  All are easy to use and leave my hair in good shape.  The leave-in spray is a little sticky right after using it but in an hour or more that goes away and your hair is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never experienced any irritation or itching nor did I lose any hair initially as some people have reported.  I find the price reasonable and the system is easy and effective for hair thinning problems.  I do not think Nioxin is marketed for anything other than thinning hair and they never say that it prevents hair loss or creates more or new hair, it just creates the appearance of fuller hair for those whose hair is thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for fixing thinning hair, but you must give it time!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much about less hair loss yet, it&#x27;s only been a few days, but there is a MAJOR improvement in how my hair looks and feels.  As I&#x27;ve gotten into my late 30&#x27;s, my once-soft and touchable hair has gotten frizzy, stringy and kind of unmanageable.  Since I started using Nioxin scalp treatment (yes, it can burn but I&#x27;m willing to endure that for the benefits) my hair feels and looks noticeably better.  It is soft, smooth, and shiny.  I will keep using this product for that reason alone.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com comes through again!  Speedy shipping and the price was right.  This is the only shampoo that makes my hair fuller annd not \\&quot;fly away.\\&quot;  I love the peppermint smell and how manageable it makes my long thinnish hair.</li>
            <li> Great price compared to the salon price.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair healthy and from falling out</li>
            <li> Great product that cleans without being hurtful to your hair.</li>
            <li> WOnderful product.  very fast delivery. Thank  you.</li>
            <li> I have been useing the original (gold caps, made in GA).  System 3 for thining  hair..  I saw a remarkable change.  My hair was no longer falling out, and I actually saw new groth at temples.  Then came &amp;#34;made in Mexico&amp;#34;.....  I cannot find the original anywhere.  After a month of  &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product, hair is falling out again!&lt;br /&gt;SHAME ON YOU Proctor &amp; Gamel.  You have lost a good customer....maybe more.  It was really a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for over 8 years now and I still love it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any buildup and I love how my hair feels with it.  I haven&#x27;t lost much hair since I&#x27;ve been using it, but I can&#x27;t really say if that&#x27;s due to the Nioxin or not.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but for me it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo my husband will use.  He likes how clean it makes his hair feel and, the great scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 5 years and just the last bottle I used had a different feel to it and didn&#x27;t even seem as if I had purchased the same shampoo.  It is now heavier to the feel, more like oldtime shampoo and doesn&#x27;t even smell the same.  I never used it due to loosing hair, but rather for more volume and scalp calming.  Now I don&#x27;t notice any difference from using it or using other commercial shampoos.  Has to be that now it belongs to Proctor and Gamble and they have changed the formula.  I am discontinuing my use of this shampoo and on to another search for something that will stop my dry scalp from itching and still produce shiney hair with a fuller feel to it.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo for me!!</li>
            <li> Not fair for me to post a review. I have been using Nioxin for 10 years now. Would not use any other shampoo. It leaves my hair feeling soft and very clean. Has given my hair a curl that I had as a child. Highly recommend it. There is also one for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair so clean!  It doesn&#x27;t leave residue the way other shampoos do.  Will keep buying more bottles.</li>
            <li> Very good product. My hair texture feels silky and my hair looks alive now.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Thank you for the on time shipment..!</li>
            <li> This is our second bottle, leaves hair feeling really great and healthy. My wife has long hair and is very hypo alergic to many formulas, this one she loves.&lt;br /&gt;Feels fresh, stimulating, when we ran out of first bottle we missed this shampoo terribly. Last a long time. Amazons price is a true bargain. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have moderately thin hair, and in my young thirties my hairline started receding, especially on my part side. My stylist noticed it and recommended I try the Nioxin \\&quot;starter package\\&quot;, which is the cleanser, conditioner (with tea tree oil I think), a \\&quot;scalp therapy\\&quot; spray, and a drain filter to trap hair (which I thought was gimmicky). Fast-forward almost a decade later and I use the cleanser and conditioner regularly, as indeed the loss stopped within weeks of &#x27;therapy.&#x27; At first the loss slowed, then I had the impression that the recessions filled back in a little. I don&#x27;t use the &#x27;scalp therapy&#x27; spray any more, I use the cleanser pretty much daily, and the conditioner every few days. I rarely use &#x27;product&#x27; or gels, and I eat healthy and exercise regularly (which may or may not matter to hair health). My girlfriend tried it but went back to her expensive Japanese shampoo that smells nice (and leaves my hair lifeless), but she loves my hair and runs her hands through it frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer complains that their hair isn&#x27;t filling back in, but I think that&#x27;s an unreasonable expectation. In my experience I&#x27;ve had (gray) hairs fill in randomly on my upper forehead and my eyebrows seem to grow wildly now, but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s not the Nioxin...  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ll attest that I haven&#x27;t had dandruff or further hair loss since starting, and I like that the (online) price is reasonable and hasn&#x27;t increased much over time. You don&#x27;t need much of this to get clean and like another reviewer said it doesn&#x27;t lather much. Anecdotally, I replaced a shower head for a tenant and noticed he was using it. He was in his early thirties then and even I noticed his hair thinning, but he gave it a glowing recommendation which is why I agreed to buy it on my next haircut.</li>
            <li> I was living in a hair nightmare.  I was having severe medical problems with reduced thyroid production and, among other icky side-effects (like gaining weight) *my hair was falling out.*  In the shower, when i combed it--constantly falling out.  My pony-tail was dying slowly and my self-esteem was also going down the drain.  I needed big-time help, and I had heard the name \\&quot;Nioxin\\&quot; but that&#x27;s all I knew.  So I scheduled a consultation at a high end salon, showed them what was going on, and they sent me straight to the beauty supply shop for Nioxin.  They explained that Nioxin exfoliates your scalp and allows new hair to grow in, and they said I should definitely try it.  I was still a little nervous, but the people at the supply shop were SO SURE that this could help me--from their own personal experience to what they had learned at workshops, etc.  They said that the minty shampoo would be great, that the conditioner wasn&#x27;t as important for hair growth, and that the tonic you put right on your scalp was AMAZING.  All true.  They said to give it up to 7-8 weeks and not give up.&lt;br /&gt;Six months later I went back to the salon and the people who had seen my \\&quot;before\\&quot; hair said, quote, \\&quot;Whatever you&#x27;ve been doing to your hair, DON&#x27;T STOP.\\&quot;  They showed me all the new growth I had all over my head, and places where my hair had been flat and now was  filling in.  My hair is soft, healthy, and i feel proud of it again. Try Nioxin.  It will help you.  Once you understand how it works, it just makes sense.  And I&#x27;ve never written one of these review-type-things in my life--so you know I&#x27;m serious!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hair showed improvement but it has done nothing for me( I have a high testosterone level). My hair has thinned considerably especially after I stopped using rogaine .  The rogaine gave me a lot of coarse facial hair (did I need another problem?)</li>
            <li> Wash your hair with this product, and leave it on for three minutes, not just one, and you will be amazed in just a couple of week or less how full even thin hair looks.  It also stopped hair from falling out while washing.  The cost from amazon was also less than other supplier.  Delivery was really fast, and free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for the last 2 years and haven&#x27;t had any hair loss problem. I was having problem with dandruff and itchy scalp, but everything stopped ever since I started using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the best shampoo in the market.</li>
            <li> Whenever I need to use a cleanser I always use Nioxin. It doesn&#x27;t form any dandruff and it has such a nice smell. Definitely going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo for years.  Pricey, but as oldest of 5 boys, I have more hair than the other 4 combined.  Lucky?  I want to believe the Nioxin played a role in making the difference.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so much thicker. I saw improvement after one shampoo</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair love the smell of it to</li>
            <li> Great hair product I&#x27;ve used for years.  Also, use it as a facial cleaner while washing hair.</li>
            <li> Been using for 20 years, got lots of hair still</li>
            <li> love the product. shipped on time-no complaints</li>
            <li> ABOUT A MONTH AGO, I BOUGHT THE STARTER THREE STEP PROCESS THEN USED ALL OF IT SO I PURCHASED THIS BIGGER BOTTLE, SEEMS TO BE WORKING - NOT A MIRACLE WORKER, STILL HAVE THIN HAIR BUT SEEMS TO HELP - AWESOME PRICE!</li>
            <li> I was losing hair and getting thin on top. My twin brother was using it and suggested that I use it. After a few weeks the hair that had been accumulating on the drain screen after each shower stopped accumulating. The hair was not falling out. My thinning stopped and my hair is thicker. Good stuff. I recommend to a friend who was almost bald on top. I see him every six month or so. After a year and a half, he has hair to comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for three years now.  About a month or two after starting, my barber asked me if I had recently damaged my hair.  She said that there was quite a lot of new, short hair growing among the longer hair.  That convinced me that Nioxin was working well.  The bottle I bought last year though was smaller but the price stayed the same.  Also,  the shampoo was thinner so it didn&#x27;t seem to last as long.  I also noticed that my hair has been looking thinner with the new formula.  I&#x27;m going to try and find a new shampoo.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this shampoo for several years. When he has run out, we see hair on his pillow. His hairstylist is convinced that he still has a fair amount of hair because of Nioxin. The Amazon price is the best we have ever found!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a much lower price then in the stores.  works great on my old hair.  I received more then double the ozs. for the price.  I paid 18.99 for 10.5 ozs in the store. Amazon has a great price for 33 plus ounces.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  This stuff works.  You need to use the entire system (shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment).  After several weeks your hair will look fuller.  I don&#x27;t notice hair loss like I did in the past.  The product can be pricey but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it each time you wash your hair and it does go a long way.  Well worth the money if you hair is thinning and falling out.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Cleans great.  Smells great and h&#x3D;keeps my scalp clean.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance - the way it cleans - how soft my hair is and the shine I get.  Also, my hair seems to stay clean longer, so I only have to use it 2X/week - love it!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shampoo daily and loves it. It helps keep his shedding down to a minimum. Great price for such a large bottle.Will buy from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I use this product to help thinning hair due to thyroid problems.  It works.  What more can I say.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years.  If you have thinning hair or problems with loosing hair I would definitely recommend this product.  I was happy to find it at Amazon because you cannot purchase it at any retail store.</li>
            <li> Wish this were cheaper but I&#x27;ve had good luck with it.</li>
            <li> Great product, can only buy it online now</li>
            <li> Love this product and the way it makes my scalp and hair feel.  Will order this again.  This bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product as well as the rest in the set.  It makes my hair feel so nice and clean with no build up.  It has helped my hair to grow and fill in in the areas I was lacking.  I would recommend this product to anyone with hair loss problems or build up problems.</li>
            <li> The people who are writing the negative reviews about the shampoo being white have purchased the wrong item.  Nioxin Cleanser always keeps my hair feeling clean, and I have never had any dandruff or dry scalp while using this product.  Great product, worth the price, and price isn&#x27;t even that bad considering the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I use it since 8 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I feel, as a 33 yr old guy, my hair loss is slower (normal) now.</li>
            <li> Under went chemo treatment 4 years ago and my stylist  recommended this product.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did I not loose any hair but it remained without any change. It worked for me&lt;br /&gt;but may not for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;Robert</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, made my hair dry and brittle.  I have no clue what people are talking about.  Back to my $5 shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man of science. I&#x27;m educated in an Orthodox sense with a master&#x27;s and a bachelor&#x27;s. I consider I&#x27;m educated on the streetwise sense as well. My father is bald, my mother is balding, and my 23 year old brother is well on his way. Be it genetics or other common knowledge I should be bald at 30. However, I&#x27;ve been using this stage one consistently for 5 years. I believe my hair-loss is minimal to none. I&#x27;m a believer that this product works.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my barber when asked what to use while swimming in a pool.  Works great at removing smell am makes hair softer.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this product several years ago and the ingredients were all natural.  This newer product has a bunch of things in it that I DO NOT like to use.  Very diappointed.  Ingredients were not listed so I could I tell until I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Recomended by my hair dresser and it has always been good for me as it makes my hair fell like they are real soft yet holds its shape.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in this stuff, but it made my hair fall out like crazy in the shower. Like 3x more than normal. Not good for someone who wants more hair...</li>
            <li> Great product to protect your scalp and hair. It stopped my hair lose.</li>
            <li> accurate shipping excellent product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair more manageable an sped it appears to be much thicker. I have been using this product about 3 months and it is better than the Tre&#x27;semme that I have used for years.</li>
            <li> If you know what you&#x27;re looking for, it&#x27;s quick and easy.  I had to think whether it was number 1 or number 2.  Knowing the exact product you have to order is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the money I saved was spend in shipping and handling but the convenience of having it at your door as opposed to scouring different places (to avoid having to go all the way to Wal Mart!) is worth something!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and feel it is a very good, economical cleanser. Also recommend their Scalp Therapy product</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. For $30 I got the whole System 1 Kit for Fine Hair.(off eBay) I saw results almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;Feels good on the scalp&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair super soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t tangle nearly as easily.&lt;br /&gt;Helped repair damaged ends.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not losing as much hair to brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Hair stays looking clean longer.&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention my hair is super soft?!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my hair just FEELS so much better. It&#x27;s only been 3 days since I started using this. My boyfriend can run his fingers through my hair and it&#x27;s not all tangled and falling out. It&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Only one, and that is that the conditioner and scalp therapy spray comes in too small of bottles, meaning it will go quick. But, it&#x27;s totally worth the money to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;I never want to spend money on another shampoo again.</li>
            <li> Works great and scalp feels good and clean.</li>
            <li> Not the same ingredients. Beware..</li>
            <li> I have used so many shampoos but this is the only one stopped my hair from falling.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day and it works great.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Makes my hair feel clean without residue.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Came quickly in the mail--never used. The large bottle makes it last a very long time. Can also get a pump for this specific bottle.</li>
            <li> I had used Nioxin System 1 Cleanser for years.  It was wonderful for my baby-fine, thin hair.  It left my hair looking full, without any buildup, meaning that I never felt the need to alternate shampoos.  I always bought the jumbo size, and recently finished a bottle.  The new formula, which is no longer made in the U.S. leaves my hair stiff, dull, flat and coated.  After 3 shampoos, I feel the need to use a clarifying shampoo just to get some life back in my hair.  I am now looking for a replacement for my favorite shampoo.  Nioxin is no longer what it pretends to be!</li>
            <li> For years I have used this product for my ultra fine hair. But, it is not sold in stores or salons in my area, so I was glad to find I could order it online. Nioxin does NOT grow hair; instead it creates an environment in which hair can flourish. I had run out of the shampoo and noticed my hair seemed to be falling out more than usual. Since receiving the new bottle I can already see the difference. Not much hair in my brush or my bathroom floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supplier offrs Nioxin at a good price and delivered it as promised. Good job!</li>
            <li> I think this is the best shampoo if any kind on the market.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, however, what&#x27;s a nice head of hair worth?</li>
            <li> The best, used for years. Light, small amount needed.leaves hair really supple.Use it every day without hair drying out.</li>
            <li> excellent shampoo for daily use good price</li>
            <li> As described. Timely. Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for cleaning your hair and scalp.  My hair stylist recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;you should by it</li>
            <li> I was a user of the original Nioxin for years with good results.  I stopped using it because I decided I didn&#x27;t need it.  Now, thanks to customer reviews I have been spared experiencing the &amp;#34; new&amp;#34; version.  I am so disappointed that the formula has changed.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all the reviews! BTW, has anyone found a satisfying replacement?</li>
            <li> Got this for the dyke I was dating who had male pattern baldness, stopped hair loss, maybe some fine hair growth.</li>
            <li> This came quickly, but the product seems counterfeit. I don&#x27;t have a real way to prove it, but it is definitely different from what I used to get at Costco.</li>
            <li> In few days I have already experience a thicker more voluminous hair. Try it you wil not be disappointed! I{m waiting for my hair to grow in some area too!</li>
            <li> Stay away from this shampoo if you value your health. I started using this on the advice at some hairdresser. After using it for a week, I had went to my doctor for a check up and he discovered that my heart was pounding and I had a rapid heart beat. Had to go get an EKG and an ECG ... the doctor&#x27;s all were wondering how I was breathing, if I was on medication for high blood pressure and they wanted to have me get a heart valve replacement. I had to have a camera inserted down my throat ...worst test ever. It took a little while to determine that it was this shampoo that did this to me. You see, there is a chemical or toxin in it that they use in dry cleaning. That is some bad stuff. it took a while for the effects of it to leave my body completely. Worst shampoo ever. Use something natural and not this stuff if you value your health and well being. I should give it no stars ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice minty smell to it and cleans out the dirt and dust real well, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same arctic peppermint effect as it&#x27;s Conditioner-counterpart has (which is probably a good thing). Very nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, flat and lifeless.  Instead, my hair is full of life!  Thank you Nioxin...</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and when you age, your hair just loses it lustre. The shine is gone and it eally just has that old lady, cotton candy look. I thought I would try the Nioxin system for color-treated hair. Previously, I was using WEN products and that really helped, but with the WEN I had to wash my hair every single day.&lt;br /&gt;So I picked some Nioxin up at my salon to give it a try. The Nioxin is a 3 part product, shampoo, conditioner, and then a scalp treatment that I try to remember to use. With Nioxin, I can get away with washing my hair every 3-4 days, and it looks great! Of course, I throw it up on my head and braid it after the first day, but I tell you I love this product better than WEN. so really, since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, it cost less than WEN.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to everyone. I  met with a friend of mine I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while and she wanted to know what I was doing to my hair. She went online immediately to get some!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone losing their hair, like combing it and lots and lots of hair coming out, or it coming out in the shower--see your doctor. This could be a problem with thyroid that will not be helped by any hair product. If your labs check out fine, then you should go for the product. Actually, go for it regardless but do see your doctor!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin Bionutrient Cleanser long before the company was bought by Proctor and Gamble.  Now the new Nioxin cleanser formula makes my scalp dry and itchy.  I still have an empty bottle of the old Nioxin Bionutrient cleanser and the ingredients listed are: Water, (Nioxin Complex), Aloe Vera, Panthenol, Extract of Burdock &amp; Comfrey &amp; Quassia &amp; Buckthorn &amp; Chaparral &amp; Cranesbil &amp; Rosemary &amp; Sage &amp; Nettle &amp; Hops &amp; Horsetail &amp; Chammomile &amp; Yarrow, Jojoba, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Mucopolysaccharides, Tocopherol, Wheat Amino Acids, Biotin, Niacin, Sorbitol, Linoleic Acid, Arachidonic Acid, Acetamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, TEA Lauryl Sulfate, Lauramide DEA, 6-(N-Acetylamino)-4-Oxahexyl Trimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Proplparaben, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid FD&amp;C Blue #1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current Nioxin Cleanser 1 formula is: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Benzoate, Salicylic Acid, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Menthol, Mentha Arvensis Leaf Oil, Tetrasodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylene Glycol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cystine Bis-PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Lecithin, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit Extract, Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Extract, Saccharomyces/Magnesium Ferment, Blue 1, Biotin/Folic Acid/Cyanocobalamin/Niacinamide/Pantothenic Acid/Pyridoxine/Riboflavin/Thiamine/Yeast Polypeptides,Yeast Extract, Saccharomyces/Iron Ferment, Saccharomyces/Copper Ferment, Saccharomyces/Silicon Ferment, Saccharomyces/Zinc Ferment, Phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a huge difference by comparison. This is no longer the same product. Proctor and Gamble bought the name and changed the formula!</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Nioxin and have been well satisfied over the years. My hair was beginning to appear thin and my stylist used this product to wash my hair and suggested that I continue. I did and over time, the thinning stopped and I continue to have the fullness that I once had.</li>
            <li> Works awesome, this is the second bottle I have ordered. I started out with the 10 ounce and have been using for a month, my hair is getting noticeably longer. About .5 inches!! :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is an original Nioxin shampoo. If you look closely at the bottle and trademarks it will become clear. Product does not work as well either.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and arrived as advertised. I have used the product for several years and it has done well making my hair look full and thick. Only recently has my own hair loss moved into the next stage, where the System 2 will probably be my next purchase to help with the thinning look. Mild thinning can go almost completely unnoticed using this product. Plus, the price isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s a giant bottle, at least as much product as 2 or 3 of the regular size bottles of shampoo. In other words, if you buy decent regular shampoo, you are already in the whole 15 bucks or more. And for me, regular shampoos do nothing to add thickness to my thinning hair. So it only makes sense to toss in a few more bucks and get the product that gives me the hair I want. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent product been using for years. Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> It seems to keep my hair from thinning. I have used it for about seven years and my hair seems to have slowed in thinning.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years now.  Only need a small amount and does a great job. Smells nice and rinses out clean.</li>
            <li> seems to be good product</li>
            <li> This is a great product as it really helps my hair to get thicker and leaves a fresh mint feeling to the scalp. I highly recommend. I also use this together with the Nioxin conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using Noixin Cleanser for a couple of years and I love it. Since I have been using it my hair seems to be maintaining its thickness. I use to get the product in a store but they were out of stock so I went online and found it on Amazon. They had the best price and I saved nearly $10 for the big bottle ordering it online. Great deal!</li>
            <li> There is no other product like it for my hair, and I spend half as much as retail.  I&#x27;ll buy this as long as it exists.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over 15 years; great results; keeps my hair healthy. This is a decent price. It isn&#x27;t always easy to find -- or people price it very high.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo....Will order again</li>
            <li> I am hoping that the review I read about Proctor and Gamble buying this product out and taking it to Mexico does not affect the product&#x27;s ability to help my thinning hair. I will say that it cleans my hair wonderfully without drying it out (I have gray and straight hair at 65 yr old). I do not use the conditioner and still find my hair manageable without being limp from conditioner. A beautician recommended this product because it helped her mother&#x27;s thinning hair. I have not noticed any improvement on my thin hair, but I havent noticed it getting worse in the 2 years I have used it. It is soooo expensive at ULTA so I looked on Amazon and sure enough it was a much better deal. You go Amazon!</li>
            <li> used it few times. its good for now. i have lots of hair loss. so trying this based on oher reviews. i vil update the review after couple of months. ** product was well packed , came safely. no breakage or leakage**</li>
            <li> Great at oil control.  Leaves my hair feeling very clean, and smells kind of peppermint-y.  I&#x27;ve used this for years, and Amazin definitely has the best prices on it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have used it for years now and it keeps my scalp very healthy...  Well worth the price - for it lasts a looooong time.</li>
            <li> Really love this shampoo.  Have been using this shampoo for years and it still works wonders.  I had started losing hair and when I started using the nioxin shampoo and conditioner, it worked wonders, so I have continued to use it and am completely satisfied with it and that is why I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Been using it for years.  More than many other products on the market but worth it. Recommend highly</li>
            <li> great shampoo! Only kind our family will use.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that keeps working! My hair has not gotten &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to it. After 5 years of using I can give it a 10 star</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be bald on the top and back of my head if it weren&#x27;t for this product. I&#x27;m afraid to ask what&#x27;s in it... It strips all the residue that most cheap shampoos leave behind.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected and was the exact product I wanted to try.</li>
            <li> good shampoo. Hair seems thicker. The only issue I&#x27;m having is dandruff....</li>
            <li> I have used it alone without other products for years.  I like the way it leaves my hair but it does not help hair loss by itself anyway.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  i originally got it from a hair stylist because she thought it might help with a thinning patch on the top of my head.  not that it is a hair replacement shampoo, but that it would make your scalp healthier and therefore hair follicles happier along with the hair they grow thicker and stronger.  I didn&#x27;t have dandruff before, but i did get some intermittent itching, but since starting to use this shampoo that has all but stopped.  my wife actually started using it to clean her hair after she ran out of her own shampoo.  she felt like it was able to clean all the buildup from other shampoos, conditioners, and other hair products she uses on a regular basis.  she liked it so much we got this large bottle so both of us can use it. so far so good, and i will say it seems that less hair falls out as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years because it does a great job.  I have thin hair and I think it is helping me slow down the rate of hair loss.  That&#x27;s just a hunch.</li>
            <li> Love it. Leaves my hair beautiful and it does work. Plus, love the price and will always order through the wwebsite.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin System 1 for Thin-Looking Hair for about 10 years now. It is a superior product when it comes to cleansing the hair and scalp and allowing the hair to &amp;#34;breathe.&amp;#34; It also help keep dandruff or flaky scalp in check and leaves no residue. I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the original formula but still decent shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 7 years. It cleanses your hair and it helps to prevent thinning of your hair. Great price on Amazon. I had been paying $34-$38 retail price for this shampoo from my local beauty supply stores. I bought it recently on Amazon for $25.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended to my by my stylist.  I have noticed less hair loss after several weeks of use.  It has a pleasant scent and does not bother my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo.  I think it continues to keep my hair from thinning.  That&#x27;s it.  I don&#x27;t like having to write a minimum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for close to 15 years without an issue. The formula was \\&quot;redone\\&quot; by Nioxin and now there ARE issues. Like enough hair falling out to clog the shower drain daily. The newer formula is pure white and thick and comes in a bottle with a black bottle cap with WHITE top to it. The old formula had an ALL black bottle cap. I just got done \\&quot;chatting\\&quot; with Nioxin and they told me of the formula change and didn&#x27;t believe there is a difference. I do have about 4oz of the old formula in my travel kit to compare with the \\&quot;new\\&quot; formula. The older formula had a pale green hue to it and smelled more pepperminty and was relatively thin, compared to this \\&quot;newer\\&quot; formula. I have put both products on a paper towel to compare and this is correct. I&#x27;ve run into the product before, which is pure white, thick and comes in the bottle with the black bottle cap with WHITE top before and noticed a greatly excellerated rate of hair loss, as it covered my shower drain daily. This was NEVER an issue with the older pale green formula. All Nixoin has offered is my money back and for me to look for another product elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get a bottle of the old formula from a online supplier, now out of stock completely, as soon as I was able to start using the old formula again the hair loss STOPPED! To bad Nioxnin you really have disappointed a formerly dedicated customer.</li>
            <li> A product that I have used for many years, scalp is in good condition, but the product has not improved hair growth. Possibly leaves hair a little easier to manage than some other products. Is it worth the money???</li>
            <li> powerful clear!! and nice price</li>
            <li> good product from gray hair</li>
            <li> Seems like a decent shampoo; thick and works up a good lather.  However, I have been using for over 6 months and I cannot see anything magical happening.  It is a seemingly quality &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; which contains no alcohol or animal products etc. and I likely will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as for reinvigorating that youthful head full of thick hair (or just putting the brakes on thinning hair) I would  advise you not to get your hopes up too high.  Perhaps it has worked miracles for others, but for me this a good alcohol and animal product free shampoo and little more.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 10 years. Always satisfied with results of soft manageable hair.  No residue left on hair after shompooing</li>
            <li> Husband loves this shampoo. Great size.</li>
            <li> My husband has used Nioxin for years. It is a very good product. I use it occasionally to deep cleanse my scalp.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a.good product</li>
            <li> Gives my scalp a clean tingly sensation and it no longer itches. It was recommended to me first after chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about a year and it has stopped hair loss.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for my hair.  I use it everyday.  It really works and I do recommend it to whose who need this product for their hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product it is amazing.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a NIOXIN hair care system kit in exchange for compensation but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product worked really well in fact it&#x27;s transformed my hair. I did write this as a review on my blog but continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Lovely minty smell and made my hair shine but did NOT improve thinness or volume.If anything my hair came out more and my scalp was really itchy.I used it for over a month but no good results.Total waste of money and very expensive.If you want a minty shampoo and conditioner get a cheap supermarket one as this is just a con.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is hard to find.  One Big Boix Store sells it once a year, maybe not in all locations.  Been using for many years at the suggestion of my hairstylist.  Used to purchase from an online beauty supply, which is no longer.  Now buying here at a new low price!  With Prime and S&amp;S benefits I think this is the best deal on this product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have always had greasy hair and have tried every shampoo under the sun to get rid of it. Although this product hasn&#x27;t done that, it is the best one I have found that helps reduce that greasy look! Pair it with the conditioner on the tips of your hair and your good for the day!!</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for a few years now and will continue to use.  His hair has stopped thinning and actually looks thicker.  WE have recommended to other men with thinning hair issues.  Great product and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Again what I just said love the product and was recommended by my hair dresser and it is doing the job</li>
            <li> My husband is really frugal but he will spend money on this shampoo .</li>
            <li> My hair did not respond well to this product.  It was not shiny at all.  My permed curls were nullified as well, coming out straighter and dry looking.  I have not seen any noticeable \\&quot;fluffing\\&quot; to create an illusion of greater volume either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be benefits that emerge from use of this product over time, perhaps helping the scalp, or increasing growth.  The problem is whether I can live with lousy looking hair long enough for those benefits to happen. I will try to use it for the bottle&#x27;s worth and see if anything changes, and will update this review if there are changes... but I am seriously wondering if I can make it that long.</li>
            <li> Started using this when my hair started falling out from stress.  Used this along with the Nioxin Scalp Activating Treatment.  My hair stopped falling out and grew back in within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> i love it ,It makes my hair feel so nice and clean ,Try Nioxin. It will help you&lt;br /&gt;I definately can recommend this product</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.  It has a very clean smell.</li>
            <li> I used to feel an intense heated buzz on my scalp after using this product (5 years ago or so).  I don&#x27;t feel that same buzz anymore.  Ingredients changed?</li>
            <li> I had a bald spot on the back of my head. And I used this stuff and after a month or so my hair started coming back. Now I have no bald spot. I do have to keep using tho ccuz if I stop ill start losing my hair again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop using this! It works so well!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, the tea tree and mint, make for a refreshing wash.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave any residual behind when rinsed out.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and I really like it.  I have recommended it to several others.</li>
            <li> Well, I purchased this product from Target. I have fine hair that was falling like crazy after my baby. I was looking for something that would stop the hairloss. Well, the first time I used this product, my hair came out in clumps. It was scary. I thought I would go bald by the next day. Also, the shampoo almost burned my scalp. The stimulation was almost too much. I was in tears. Thankfully, the shedding stopped the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo might work for bald guys who have nothing to lose, but for us women who want to keep our hair is a scary product. I will be returning the bottle to target and aiming for an organic tea tree and mint shampoo instead.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Leaves hair really clean!</li>
