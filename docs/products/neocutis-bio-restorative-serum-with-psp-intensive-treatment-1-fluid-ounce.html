            <li>Great product I love it!</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>I have the Bio-Restorative cream, and I think that it is really good, but this serum does not seem to have any benefit.</li>
            <li>Great product and I received it so quickly!!</li>
            <li>I just love this serum and believe it is a very effective anti-aging product, containing peptides.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>(yes, I&#x27;m being honest).  </li>
            <li>Nice serum.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>I honestly have not seen any improvements in my skin after a month of using this product.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, despite high price.</li>
            <li>It goes on very light and works great for minimizing fine lines around my face.</li>
            <li>When I put this serum on, then put another serum + oil on top of it, my face felt really warm, but I thought it might be in my imagination.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but not &amp;#34;significantly&amp;#34;  better than the anti aging moisturizers</li>
            <li>This is a great product but cost too much!  </li>
            <li>You WILL see fine lines disappear!</li>
            <li>My face does not seem be any better than using the cream alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a cosmetic product I think this is one of the better ones.  </li>
            <li>Love this product for all over face cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok... not the Wonder product I read about.</li>
            <li>My skin loves this treatment and I love the way my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get a sample of this from my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this Neocutis bio-restorative serum</li>
            <li>The longer I use it, the more improvement I see.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend buying it on Amazon as it was $96 more at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d take a leap and try the serum for more impact.  </li>
            <li>Love the neocutis line</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact product and is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It also erases fine lines.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Cream helps hide wrinkles, is easily worn under makeup and has a cumulative effect of making the skin look better the more frequently it is used.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed very quickly and people have commented that it makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>I quickly washed off my face, but the redness was a true burn and stayed.</li>
            <li>and they told my sking was looking great due to using the product, not knowing I was buying from Amazon!</li>
            <li>So happy, at the office they wanted $200, here I got a steal, this product is amazing, in just a few short weeks it I can tell!!</li>
            <li>may not be worth  the $</li>
            <li>so worth the money</li>
            <li>I know this product is in the anti-aging category; but, it also works miracles for repairing skin that has been damaged from acne and all the treatments necessary to effectively treat it.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>I hope to try to order this product in the future, but much will depend on it being provided in it&#x27;s original packaging, so that you know it is safe, genuine and valued.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see results super fast!</li>
            <li>I use this serum, the face cream and the eye cream together, my face looks wonderful, and I only use a little amount each night, i can see and feel the difference,  </li>
            <li>I like to mix my amazon serums sometimes, or put different oils on top of serums.</li>
            <li>If they made the packaging smaller they might be able to cut the price</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, toned, clear and glowing.</li>
            <li>Good results in a few weeks</li>
            <li>It is ok product mayby for mid 30s,but for me did not do much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s certainly a process.  </li>
            <li>This product really delivers.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and with the bio serum</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I did not observe much difference.</li>
            <li>She intends to order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>Neocutis makes a really decent eye cream also.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high price.</li>
            <li>Closest thing to having some sort of procedure done recommend it highly over and over and over.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and use it everyday</li>
            <li>This is a medical intervention as far as I am concerned and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It settles the redness, infuses the skin with collagen and makes my skin look and feel very soft.</li>
            <li>My whole complection glows, looks even, and looks younger.  </li>
            <li>The eye cream is my favorite, but the face cream works at least as well as Department store products.  </li>
            <li>I slapped a thick layer of hydrocortisone cream on my face, then took a Benadryl, then thankfully it was mostly healed by morning.</li>
            <li>It feels like the Russian dolls that fit into each other.</li>
            <li>Only a small amount is required so it lasts a long time, making it cost effective despite</li>

            <li> I have tried TNS serum and My Body (which I thought was a high priced department store product and more or less useless).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to be able to use it twice a day, but that is cost prohibitive for me, so unfortunately I may be looking for a less expensive product</li>
            <li> I went back to the dermatoligist a year and a half later</li>
            <li> My face had turned dark beet red like a 1st degree sunburn.</li>
            <li> Love it but very expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this size only lasts about two months and for me it is a little pricey, but worth it when I can afford it.</li>
            <li> did not really care for this product.</li>
            <li> But be careful.</li>
            <li> I have issues under my eyes and uneven marionette lines next to my mouth.  </li>
            <li> achieved results are not what was expected based on the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like other Neocutis products.</li>
            <li> I tested the other items I used with it separately, but they weren&#x27;t the burn trigger; this one was.</li>
            <li> but I started buying this product from Amazon due to the price.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after several weeks of daily usage, I haven&#x27;t seen any change at all.  </li>
            <li> Go cream, it&#x27;s cheaper &amp; less mess.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but</li>
            <li> THINK Neocutis is evening those lines out, and helping the multitude of little wrinkles under my eyes disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Messy.  </li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use since it was so expensive, but if there are no differences after this bottle, I definitely will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> , I am not sure if the results are definitive ...</li>
            <li> Too bad as it is pretty expensive not to work.</li>
            <li> not good!</li>
            <li> While I am no stranger to expensive beauty products, I just do not see any benefit at all to this product.</li>
            <li> I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li> But it had a weird reaction.</li>
            <li> my opinion,  it is way over priced, over exaggerated, and&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> This is a skin care product sold by Life Med Products and was very disappointed to see that the cream that I apply to my face is previously used.  </li>
            <li> sent me the wrong product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed for the results considering what it cost.</li>
            <li> TOO expensive!!</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, but that passes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and I received it so quickly!!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I already see a difference in texture &amp; tone, I think this will become a staple in my skin care routine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2months after having Ultherapy laser. I see no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I saved over 60 Dollars by getting it on Amazon.  My Doctor charges over $200.00 for it.  Good Product.</li>
            <li> I have the Bio-Restorative cream, and I think that it is really good, but this serum does not seem to have any benefit. While I am no stranger to expensive beauty products, I just do not see any benefit at all to this product. My face does not seem be any better than using the cream alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great price for a staple cosmetic item.</li>
            <li> Best product ever! I have finished 4 bottles and In between bottles I would try something else but always come back to this serum.  Try it!!</li>
            <li> Great Product! Made visible improvements on my skin. It delivers and keeps skin moisturized all day and night. It also erases fine lines. Love it!</li>
            <li> did not really care for this product.The customer service was very good</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived on time just as promised</li>
            <li> For a cosmetic product I think this is one of the better ones.  I have tried TNS serum and My Body (which I thought was a high priced department store product and more or less useless).  Calling My Body medical grade is hype in my opinion.  I do like Neocutis Bio Restorative Serum and saw an improvement in my skin and felt with a month or two use it will improve and nourish your skin.  Neocutis makes a really decent eye cream also.</li>
            <li> Actually my wife ordered it and she loves it. She intends to order more in the near future. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon gave me a sample when I got botox (yes, I&#x27;m being honest).  This was $210 at the office so I found it cheaper here.  It&#x27;s the exact product and is amazing.  My whole complection glows, looks even, and looks younger.  Love this product for all over face cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... not the Wonder product I read about. Smells horrible, but that passes. I like other Neocutis products.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this treatment and I love the way my skin looks and feels.  I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> On 2nd bottle of this and I do like the way it makes my skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle lasts 6 months at one pump a day.</li>
            <li> may not be worth  the $</li>
            <li> This serum is one I use after a skin procedure. It settles the redness, infuses the skin with collagen and makes my skin look and feel very soft. I have had scarring from acne and radiation for the acne. The procedure of microneedling and the Neocutis Bio-Restorative Serum is smoothing my skin. I am now in my 60&#x27;s and this is something I am now doing for myself.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get a sample of this from my dermatologist.  But I know that it is a very good and pricey skincare line sold in the office.  I am glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product really delivers. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with milia but this is the one product that has greatly helped minimize the issue. Only a small amount is required so it lasts a long time, making it cost effective despite it&#x27;s high price.</li>
            <li> Nice serum.  Feels great on skin.  But overpriced for what it is.  And 1 fluid ounce is used up in no time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Fast shipping and with the bio serum I see results super fast! It&#x27;s just the best</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used!  A little pricey but a little bit goes a long way. You WILL see fine lines disappear!</li>
            <li> I just love this serum and believe it is a very effective anti-aging product, containing peptides.</li>
            <li> great seller.  I only use Neocutis products and these prices are low compared to my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I use this serum, the face cream and the eye cream together, my face looks wonderful, and I only use a little amount each night, i can see and feel the difference,  great product, I have been using it for over a year, and it&#x27;s the best for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this Neocutis bio-restorative serum, my skin just soaks it up.  I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.  I&#x27;d love to be able to use it twice a day, but that is cost prohibitive for me, so unfortunately I may be looking for a less expensive product</li>
            <li> Awesome product, despite high price. It works! The longer I use it, the more improvement I see.</li>
            <li> This serum is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This seemed to work well, and maybe it helped my skin heal. But it had a weird reaction. I like to mix my amazon serums sometimes, or put different oils on top of serums. When I put this serum on, then put another serum + oil on top of it, my face felt really warm, but I thought it might be in my imagination. But after another couple minutes, I decided to look in the mirror. My face had turned dark beet red like a 1st degree sunburn. I quickly washed off my face, but the redness was a true burn and stayed. I slapped a thick layer of hydrocortisone cream on my face, then took a Benadryl, then thankfully it was mostly healed by morning. But be careful. I tested the other items I used with it separately, but they weren&#x27;t the burn trigger; this one was.</li>
            <li> If you try this product you will see results. Only product line sold by my dermatologist. Read the research and results of this product.</li>
            <li> Love Neocutis skincare products, Amazon has the best prices I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I honestly have not seen any improvements in my skin after a month of using this product. Pretty disappointed. I will continue to use since it was so expensive, but if there are no differences after this bottle, I definitely will not repurchase. TOO expensive!!</li>
            <li> sent me the wrong product!  had to send it back now I have none!!!!!  not good!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money!  Does not work.</li>
            <li> best line on the market</li>
            <li> So happy, at the office they wanted $200, here I got a steal, this product is amazing, in just a few short weeks it I can tell!!</li>
            <li> Some of the best skin care lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I started using this years ago from my dermatoigist but I started buying this product from Amazon due to the price.  I went back to the dermatoligist a year and a half later and they told my sking was looking great due to using the product, not knowing I was buying from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love it but very expensive. I wish that it came in a larger size. Packaging is overdone. It feels like the Russian dolls that fit into each other. If they made the packaging smaller they might be able to cut the price</li>
            <li> Closest thing to having some sort of procedure done recommend it highly over and over and over.&lt;br /&gt;.......so worth the money</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has made a noticeable difference in my face.  It is absorbed very quickly and people have commented that it makes my skin glow.  Unfortunately this size only lasts about two months and for me it is a little pricey, but worth it when I can afford it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken care of my skin with quality products. After 3 weeks of using Bio-Restorative Serum, my face is tighter, smoother and even toned. Excellent results!</li>
            <li> Good results in a few weeks, I am not sure if the results are definitive ...</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years.  It goes on very light and works great for minimizing fine lines around my face.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist so I had high hopes.  After reading the reviews on this site, I eagerly purchased it and couldn&#x27;t wait to see the improvement in my skin.  Unfortunately, after several weeks of daily usage, I haven&#x27;t seen any change at all.  I guess it is one of those things where it works for some skin types but not all.  Too bad as it is pretty expensive not to work.</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> My skin has suffered the effects of steroid acne. I have Addison&#x27;s Disease. I have been seeing the dermatologist for acid peels and have been using several acne creams....Aczone, Ziana and Differin. The acne is cleared now; but, the scarring and redness remained....and was appearing permanent.  I started using this serum and within three weeks it has transformed my skin. My skin is smooth, toned, clear and glowing. I know this product is in the anti-aging category; but, it also works miracles for repairing skin that has been damaged from acne and all the treatments necessary to effectively treat it. This is a medical intervention as far as I am concerned and worth every penny. I do recommend buying it on Amazon as it was $96 more at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Neocutis products recommended by my dermatologist. They are cheaper on Amazon.  The eye cream is my favorite, but the face cream works at least as well as Department store products.  I thought I&#x27;d take a leap and try the serum for more impact.  The serum does not go on well under make up. As soon as it mixes with primer it quite literally sloghs off like a sunburn peel.  Messy.  No noticeable difference from the cream. Go cream, it&#x27;s cheaper &amp; less mess.</li>
            <li> Great product I love it!</li>
            <li> This serum is supposed to rebuild one&#x27;s collagen.  I have issues under my eyes and uneven marionette lines next to my mouth.  I&#x27;ve had cosmetic people try and fix this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I THINK Neocutis is evening those lines out, and helping the multitude of little wrinkles under my eyes disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s certainly a process.  I&#x27;m going to stick with it for a year.</li>
            <li> Cream helps hide wrinkles, is easily worn under makeup and has a cumulative effect of making the skin look better the more frequently it is used.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but cost too much!  It is the best serum I have used but is not cost effective!!!</li>
            <li> It is ok product mayby for mid 30s,but for me did not do much.I did not observe much difference.I will stick with my SkinMedica products.</li>
            <li> Love the neocutis line</li>
            <li> Great skin care product.  I use this every night.</li>
            <li> have not noticed anything yet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but not &amp;#34;significantly&amp;#34;  better than the anti aging moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;offered at the drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion,  it is way over priced, over exaggerated, and&lt;br /&gt;the achieved results are not what was expected based on the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.  It&#x27;s not making a difference. I&#x27;m disappointed for the results considering what it cost.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it everyday</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in the results of using this product and the serum I buy from Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is a skin care product sold by Life Med Products and was very disappointed to see that the cream that I apply to my face is previously used.  I do not believe this product is trustworthy being that it may be contaminated.  I hope to try to order this product in the future, but much will depend on it being provided in it&#x27;s original packaging, so that you know it is safe, genuine and valued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great quality!  Worth the $  Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Made it glowing</li>
