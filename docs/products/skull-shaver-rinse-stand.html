    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>So the one thing that it was actually good for - using as a stand - is now off list of any pros I could think of.</li>
            <li>This rinse stand cradles my beloved skull shaver like my boxer</li>
            <li>This was a good idea in theory, eh in practicality.</li>
            <li>It is a nice product to hold the shaver in position as it cleans, then drains and dries after use.  </li>
            <li>Looks sturdy and nice.</li>
            <li>faster / more efficient.</li>
            <li>For the price I was expecting better quality.  </li>
            <li>FOR WHAT IT DOES IT IS OK,  BUT THE CHROME LOOKING THING IS JUST PASTIC LIKE THE REST.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>but I like this more than the stand because the dripping water from the blades doesn&#x27;t get all over the counter resulting in spots.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>Every shaver needs something to clean it in!  </li>
            <li>only good thing I can say is that it&#x27;s a nice stand for keeping your shaver at the sink and blades in the air.</li>
            <li>a shaver stand it works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE - I wrote the original review below just yesterday June 30th 2015, bought this rinse stand on June 9th</li>
            <li>I actually clean mine in the sink now</li>
            <li>After I clean the razor, I always hang it on the stand,  </li>
            <li>If used for its intended purpose its pain to clean out.</li>
            <li>Thankful Amazon gave full refund</li>
            <li>an old cup is more practical</li>
            <li>Much simpler and easier to clean this way.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Skip the older stand and get right all up in this.</li>
            <li>Does not do well for cleaning my Bald Eagle Smart shaver.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting something a little better to help clean my new shaver.</li>
            <li>I use it for a stand now and simply put some water in the sink then run the heads in it to clean it out.</li>
            <li>Instead it does the opposite and simply using a glass of water works a million times better /</li>
            <li>It keeps it clean and also gives it a place to dry.</li>
            <li>IT TRYING TO OPEN IT THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li>Very fragile, one of the joints broke the first time I tried to swivel it.</li>
            <li>I have to clean that out whereas in the sink its a splash of water and down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using this &amp;#34;rinse stand&amp;#34; requires running through the normal process of rinsing several times, plus also having to rinse / wipe the shaver heads off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too bad, as it was a great idea.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not needed just use the sink</li>
            <li> Difficult to put on and take off. Also not needed. I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> Have only used it one time but I was expecting something a little better to help clean my new shaver. It is conveient though</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Doesn&#x27;t hold enough water or rinse clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - I wrote the original review below just yesterday June 30th 2015, bought this rinse stand on June 9th, it arrived on June 12th and today the plastic hinges on the plastic chrome piece literally just wore out. Seriously - 3 weeks of use and the hinge wears out / stops clasping properly. (And no, the plastic tabs are not broken, simply not gripping). So the one thing that it was actually good for - using as a stand - is now off list of any pros I could think of. I would NOT recommend this product considering this and the other issues I wrote about below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the lines of what another reviewer wrote; I can confirm the following problems with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does not do well for cleaning my Bald Eagle Smart shaver. The container is so small that a single rinse doesn&#x27;t work, and leaves tiny bits of stubble in and on the blades / shaver heads. Using this &amp;#34;rinse stand&amp;#34; requires running through the normal process of rinsing several times, plus also having to rinse / wipe the shaver heads off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Whatever type of plastic they used for the basin simply attracts tiny stubble and it clings to it like glue. There is no such thing as &amp;#34;simply rinsing&amp;#34; with this product. No matter what you do, rinse with cold or hot or even soap, you&#x27;re not getting the stubble buildup out of this thing without thoroughly wiping it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those might seem like minor inconveniences until you think about this - the idea behind this product was to make the cleaning process of our shaver easier. Instead it does the opposite and simply using a glass of water works a million times better / faster / more efficient. This unit is high-maintenance - the opposite of what we invested in these shavers for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I can say is that it&#x27;s a nice stand for keeping your shaver at the sink and blades in the air.</li>
            <li> Needs a slight redesign to force the heads apart while the razor is cleaning. This will remove stubble around the heads.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product to hold the shaver in position as it cleans, then drains and dries after use.  For the price I was expecting better quality.  It does the job, but it is average plastic and sports a plastic hinge that I wonder how well it will wear with use.</li>
            <li> SIMPLY PLASTIC,  ALMOST BROKE IT TRYING TO OPEN IT THE FIRST TIME. FOR WHAT IT DOES IT IS OK,  BUT THE CHROME LOOKING THING IS JUST PASTIC LIKE THE REST.</li>
            <li> Just ok. I stopped using it to rinse the shaver after 2 uses. Its easier to put a half inch of water into the sink and rinse it that way. The rinse stand has whiskers stuck to the sides that don&#x27;t want to come out even when ran under water, as if they&#x27;re stuck to the plastic. Just a pain since now I have to clean that out whereas in the sink its a splash of water and down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shaver stand it works fine.</li>
            <li> I actually clean mine in the sink now but I like this more than the stand because the dripping water from the blades doesn&#x27;t get all over the counter resulting in spots.</li>
            <li> Every shaver needs something to clean it in!  Here it is.....for the skull shaver!</li>
            <li> This rinse stand cradles my beloved skull shaver like my boxer briefs cradle my family jewels. Solid construction and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do time and time again. Skip the older stand and get right all up in this.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality!  The plastic holder is held in by plastic clips that broke after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> My husband said it provided no benefit.  I tried to return it and they did not acknowledge the return.  And there is no where to complain.</li>
            <li> Not real sturdy but serves it&#x27;s purpose well.  After I clean the razor, I always hang it on the stand,  It keeps it clean and also gives it a place to dry.</li>
            <li> Very fragile, one of the joints broke the first time I tried to swivel it.</li>
            <li> Flimsy plastic construction.  The pins on the arm that allow it to adjust broke almost immediately.  Too bad, as it was a great idea.</li>
            <li> Looks sturdy and nice. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this. One cutter head broke off within 30 days. Thankful Amazon gave full refund</li>
            <li> Its ok. If used for its intended purpose its pain to clean out. I use it for a stand now and simply put some water in the sink then run the heads in it to clean it out. Much simpler and easier to clean this way. This was a good idea in theory, eh in practicality.</li>
            <li> it is alresdy broken....an old cup is more practical</li>
