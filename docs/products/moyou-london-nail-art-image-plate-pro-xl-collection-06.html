            <li>I love ALL Moyou London stamping plates.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>You could not ask for a better stamping plate.  </li>
            <li>I love that the metal is adhered to a plastic plate.  </li>
            <li>Nice crisp image!!</li>
            <li>These are well etched and so easy to use...</li>
            <li>I am able to use many, many more of my polishes and get a good image...even with my thinner polishes that never work with any other stamps!  </li>
            <li>I am a huge Mo You London fan.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just nothing else to say, Beginner or advanced, this is what you want.</li>
            <li>The designs are very intricate and come out nice and clean on nails.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re large but the partial transfer looks great!!!</li>

            <li>Have fun.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t that big of w deal to me though, I don&#x27;t own ANY plates that I love ALL the images on and this one has several that I will use</li>
            <li>I recommend them very highly!</li>
            <li>OK, I am a big time nail stamper.  </li>
            <li>The etchings are really deep and are able to hold a lot of color.</li>
            <li>is my first time buying this brand</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li>The MoYou plates are by far my favorite plates, the images print very clean and sharp.</li>
            <li>You do have to work fast with some of the really fine images because they tend to dry pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The vast majority of stamps out there are not etched deeply enough to be used with many of the nail polishes that are widely available, like at drug stores and walmart etc.  </li>
            <li>The etching is more shallow and many nail polishes won&#x27;t work with alot of my stamps.  </li>
            <li>the designs are large, and the flowers are prefect to color in.</li>
            <li>Plates are very large which is a plus for still being new to stamping.</li>
            <li>Some of the stamps work well, and some not so much.  </li>
            <li>love the wide range in designs</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very recommended to everyone who wants to have diferent designs in their nails.</li>
            <li>and the images are beautiful and transfer well a few of the images seem stretched and distorted.  </li>
            <li>New favorite brand, just wish shipping hadn&#x27;t been so long.</li>
            <li>I love the wide range of original and different the designs.</li>
            <li>Cool but smaller then I was expecting</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t realize it until much later when I went to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Images are clear and sharp and complete image (not imcomplete like the other cheap brands I&#x27;ve tried)This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been stamping my nails with very intricate, professional designs every week for the last year and a half.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently gotten addicted to nail stamping and have purchased more nail plates than I care to admit.  </li>

            <li> OK, I am a big time nail stamper.  I&#x27;ve been stamping my nails with very intricate, professional designs every week for the last year and a half.  I have an enormous collection of stamps from everywhere imaginable.  I have never before been SO IMPRESSED with a stamp set that I felt compelled to write a review...until now!  These Stamps by MoYou-London are simply fantastic!  Usually when you get a big plate with numerous stamps you get a hodge-podge.  Some of the stamps work well, and some not so much.  The vast majority of stamps out there are not etched deeply enough to be used with many of the nail polishes that are widely available, like at drug stores and walmart etc.  The etching is more shallow and many nail polishes won&#x27;t work with alot of my stamps.  But these are incredible!  Seriously...I was thrilled as I experimented with the three plates I ordered.  ALL of the images stamp amazingly well!  I am able to use many, many more of my polishes and get a good image...even with my thinner polishes that never work with any other stamps!  These are truly well made stamps!  I love them and plan to order many more! I recommend them very highly!</li>
            <li> cute sleeve packaging ... cant wait to try it out.. bought it but haven&#x27;t had a chance to play with it..</li>
            <li> So far the best stamp plate I&#x27;ve used. Didn&#x27;t need to use bail stamping nail polish with this one. Nice crisp image!! Very happy, definitely want more!!&lt;br /&gt;My top coat smudge the image otherwise I&#x27;d put up a picture.</li>
            <li> This stamping plate is great. the designs are large, and the flowers are prefect to color in. I am very happy with this plate</li>
            <li> Beautiful images that fit even my thumb!? No more stretching, double stamping and messing up my life!? FINALLY!!!!!! LOOOOVE:D love love</li>
            <li> great stamping plates! designs stamp on so clean and crisp. best to use with a plastic scraper instead of metal one. love the wide range in designs MoYou has to offer.</li>
            <li> Loving this! Like the designs on it and it works good!</li>
            <li> Considering I&#x27;ve never used plates when doing my nails before, my first try with this plate was a long and messy process haha. However, that was user error, the plates themselves are great! The etchings are really deep and are able to hold a lot of color. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying them again when i take this nail polish off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten addicted to nail stamping and have purchased more nail plates than I care to admit.  The MoYou plates are by far my favorite plates, the images print very clean and sharp. I love the wide range of original and different the designs. You do have to work fast with some of the really fine images because they tend to dry pretty quickly. I&#x27;m sure I will be purchasing many more of these! Have fun.</li>
            <li> Finally a brand that actually stamps the way its supposed to! yay!!  Images are clear and sharp and complete image (not imcomplete like the other cheap brands I&#x27;ve tried)This is my first time buying this brand and I plan on buying more. Will not buy the other brands even though they are less expensive than these.These are worth the price because they are actually good quality unlike Konad and the cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> All the prints are beautiful. They&#x27;re large but the partial transfer looks great!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I was getting the XL plate until it arrived and the images are beautiful and transfer well a few of the images seem stretched and distorted.  It isn&#x27;t that big of w deal to me though, I don&#x27;t own ANY plates that I love ALL the images on and this one has several that I will use</li>
            <li> I love this plate, but mine came scratched and I didn&#x27;t realize it until much later when I went to use it for the first time. Guess I&#x27;ll just have to buy another one.</li>
            <li> MoYou London plates are the BEST stamping plates. There&#x27;s just nothing else to say, Beginner or advanced, this is what you want.</li>
            <li> I love every plate I get from MOYO! It is the only plates I will buy. They are the best quality and ships super fast!</li>
            <li> I just love MoYou.  Wish I could buy all of them.</li>
            <li> After waiting over a month and a half with a lost order I finally received the stamp. It works great. Stamps were all prefect when transferring. New favorite brand, just wish shipping hadn&#x27;t been so long. Plates are very large which is a plus for still being new to stamping.</li>
            <li> Cool but smaller then I was expecting</li>
            <li> I am a huge Mo You London fan. There images are high quality and stamp incredibly well- this plate did not disappoint! Well worth the money and I can&#x27;t wait to try all of the images</li>
            <li> I love it..I love ALL Moyou London stamping plates. They stamp amazing and are very unique. I love them. Thanks</li>
            <li> A very good nail art image plate, arrived at time with beautiful images. Very recommended to everyone who wants to have diferent designs in their nails.</li>
            <li> You could not ask for a better stamping plate.  These are well etched and so easy to use...anyone who loves stamping their nails should own them all.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I am in chicago and plate arrived much earlier than their estimate of a month.  Arrived in 11 business days which is not too bad for International.  Great plate, I just ordered more.  I love that the metal is adhered to a plastic plate.  Helps prevent cuts from those cheaper brand&#x27;s sharp metal edges.</li>
            <li> These plates are great! The designs are very intricate and come out nice and clean on nails. Big enough to cover the entire nail and mine are on the larger side. The only thing I wish it had is mirror images of some of the asymmetrical designs so both hands can match. Definitely will buy more.</li>
