            <li>Excellent service fast</li>
            <li>Just get em they come in handy.</li>
            <li>Comes in this handy plastic box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purpose of purchase was to give me something else to gnaw on besides my own fingers/fingernails.</li>
            <li>and I liked them.</li>
            <li>He liked the minty taste and the durability of the toothpick.</li>
            <li>These babys come in handy when I get the urge to smoke or eat anything that I should not.  </li>
            <li>Plus, my breath smells great, and I always have that just went-to-the dentist clean mouth feeling.  </li>
            <li>They taste so good and make your breath smell great, and toothpicks are so much classier than cigarettes!  </li>
            <li>They have a strong but pleasant smell and he seems to be using them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed none of the nausea that another reviewer mentioned, and the amount of tea tree in these is negligible at best unless you&#x27;re very sensitive to the effects.</li>
            <li>more birchwood, birchwood love!  </li>
            <li>They taste fine and make your breath smell good.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product, Thursday Plantation.</li>
            <li>Actually, I believe I like the Tea tree the best for quitting smoking.  </li>
            <li>Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have chewed many toothpicks in my day, and these blow them all away.  </li>
            <li>These gave me a way to channel my nervous energy in a healthy way.  </li>
            <li>Superb as a regular toothpick, and efficient as a breath mint.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed these chewing sticks.  </li>
            <li>A flowery tale more menthol than our rhyme:  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Not to the sensual tongue, but, more endeared,  &lt;</li>
            <li>Pipe to the spirited flavor of no tone.  </li>
            <li>For oral health and still to be enjoyed,  </li>
            <li>They taste good and leave your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I really loved them back in the day, they are also great for freshening your breath.  </li>
            <li>I am not so sure that chewing this will make you quit.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t care what they say, i love these lil sticks</li>
            <li>My kids also like them :)</li>
            <li>i love these</li>
            <li>Those have quite a bit more punch than the Thursday Plantation offering.</li>
            <li>One item to note is that these toothpicks seem to be a bit more durable tan</li>
            <li>They have a refreshing mint taste and tingle.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love thursday plantation chewing sticks and will accept no substitutes and believe me</li>
            <li>I just love these sticks.</li>
            <li>Love the milled end as well.</li>
            <li>Make your mouth feel very fresh!</li>
            <li>gives nice clean feel to mouth</li>
            <li>Taste great, not a bad habit, keeps your breath fresh.</li>
            <li>They work great to freshen up your breathe in a healthy and natural way.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit strong, and can be overwhelming at times.  </li>
            <li>I must say, the taste is really refreshing, though quite strong.</li>
            <li>in all these are good toothpicks and good mints, at the same time.  </li>
            <li>They are very strong, so it may take a little getting used to, but the mix of oils in these gives the best flavor and the wood they use is the highest quality.</li>
            <li>very cool</li>
            <li>Like I said in the title, the taste is very very good, but it lasts for a very short time.</li>
            <li>I just wonder if it would be more cost-effective to buy a bunch of cheap toothpicks and soak them in tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Chewing on these won&#x27;t make you quit smoking, but they are perfect for getting you through the rough spots when you are quitting.</li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised by this product which serves as great gum stimlulation as well as breath freshner.  </li>
            <li>Very spicy but good.  </li>
            <li>Bought because tea tree oil is supposed to be good for alleviating tooth pain, and I don&#x27;t know how much it helped on that front?  </li>
            <li>It helps keep my mouth tasting nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Convenient, easy to use.</li>
            <li>the Tea Tree and Spearmint are strong and used to mineralize your teeth  and are in the sticks</li>
            <li>Man, its so strong, just started using them.</li>
            <li>Some of them are really strong others</li>
            <li>strong flavor but</li>
            <li>Strong for anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried them yet.</li>
            <li>I saw there is a cinnamon, but since I&#x27;m replacing a menthol cigarette addiction, I think this is helping me just fine.</li>
            <li>These little flavored toothpicks are wonderful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to order separately from large items, in which case they&#x27;ll ship in a padded envelope rather than a big box and won&#x27;t have this problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>also the wood does not splinter which is a huge must if your going to be putting it in your mouth</li>
            <li>I am using the patch which helps greatly, but I do like the taste this leaves in my mouth especially the menthol.  </li>
            <li>They are great for after meals or simply to freshen your breath throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Cheap for 100, and tasty.</li>
            <li>also enjoy the taste of these.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend then if you are trying to quit!!!</li>
            <li>also a very popular australian product.</li>
            <li>They have a nice menthol taste and are stronger then normal toothpicks.  </li>
            <li>and no I&#x27;m not disappointed at all its like therapy for your mouth.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure they help your breath too.</li>
            <li>Still, these perform as advertised and will clean between your teeth and give your gums a dose of anti-microbial tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these about one month and use them after I eat to clean between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Leave mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>And It will also clean your mouth as well.</li>
            <li>And I feel like my breath is fresher and my mouth just feels pleasantly clean all the time.</li>
            <li>If your plan to stop smoking, then these babies right here are it!</li>
            <li>menthol is so sweet, but those unheard  </li>
            <li>A fresh mouth, and a light feeling.</li>
            <li>They look cool.</li>
            <li>I thought,\\&quot;Eh, why not?\\&quot; I just got the pack today (two days ahead of schedule, good job amazon), and I honestly put the first stick in my mouth like an hour and a half ago.</li>
            <li>The mint and tea tree are strong enough on their own.</li>
            <li>Made of birch they don&#x27;t shred as easy for the avid chewer.</li>
            <li>The taste is also pretty strong and helps freshen breath.</li>
            <li>As you clean your teeth you get this cool sensation as well as a fresh breath</li>
            <li>Luckily these are a lot cheaper then cigarettes.</li>
            <li>but I consider them to be quite mild.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li>It works pretty well when you want to keep your mouth busy and gives you that nice menthol-ly taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem with these toothpicks is that I have to loan them to so many free-loading friends!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though winning near the goal---yet, do not grieve;  </li>
            <li>my breath smells fresh and I&#x27;m yet to see the effects</li>
            <li>These are by far my favorite flavor and type of pick to keep in the mouth.   </li>
            <li>It leaves your breath fresh.</li>
            <li>The sticks are sturdy and the flavor is distinct but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>Not only are they tasty and refreshing, but they clean your teeth and also fill a void.</li>
            <li>Very strong taste, perfect to help quit doing a bad habit like smoking chewing or even snacking</li>
            <li>The toothpicks are strong and capable of sustaining intense chewing.  </li>
            <li>Tast great and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped very fast &amp; the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Tastes good, despite the slight bit of cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>breathing bright Cassia far above,  </li>
            <li>I find it an amazing subtitute for chewing on the rubber commonly known as &amp;#34;chewing gum&amp;#34;. :)</li>
            <li>they really make my whole mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Great not only as a smoking cessation aid but as regular toothpicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but because I was mislead and ended up buying toothpicks instead of real sticks, I&#x27;m giving it a 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chewed into a tiny brush they do clean the plague off the gum line real well and give a refreshing taste that lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,  </li>
            <li>and these things are hot as hell in summer and fall on ya mouth</li>
            <li>rather then popping a mint in ya mouth or spraying something to make ya breath smell better on the low.</li>
            <li>continue to make my tea using hot water, however, and with that I am somewhat dismayed.</li>
            <li>I used them 15 years ago when I first quit smoking, and they still work like a charm.</li>
            <li>My dentist says my teeth look better since my last visit</li>
            <li>and as I&#x27;m writing this review I still have the first stick in my mouth.</li>
            <li>these have tea tree oil taste, and I love that fact, and these are terrific.</li>
            <li>and I chew them on a regular basis, let me just say this: They are fantastic!</li>
            <li>If for no other reason that they are excellent to chew upon (especially during the times when I would be better to use my mouth for something other than making noise), have a not-unpleasant flavor, the the container will be useful for later, maybe for carrying toof picks or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a case of people realizing having both is a waste of space and doing something intelligent about it, same reason people carry a Leatherman Wave instead of a full toolbox everywhere they go.</li>
            <li>And for the brave at heart, I suggest chewing on them after they get a little soft.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to run into other devotees and note, with a wink and a nod, the distinctively-shaped blunt end protruding from each others mouths.</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree flavor is VERY strong so don&#x27;t bite down on the tooth pick right away.</li>
            <li>Over all, highly recommended for people who like to chew things and have fresh breath, or for those who need help quitting smoking.</li>
            <li>they are just excellent, they do their job perfectly (i mean not only cleaning, but disinfecting)</li>
            <li>I want to note that the taste of these picks is pretty strong especially for the non-smoker (like me)</li>
            <li>Having read all of the positive reviews, I had to try them.  </li>
            <li>Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Australian chewing sticks help keep your teeth clean and you breath minty fresh.</li>
            <li>Most people have never heard of them and will be curious ;).  </li>
            <li>The menthol has been consistently strong the entire time.</li>
            <li>Several reviews state they are strong.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon ones are veeeerrry strong, so if you aren&#x27;t a big cinnamon fan, stay away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a person who smokes however these are very high quality chew sticks.</li>
            <li>These things, these little sticks in this box, had a rather less-than-wood flavor to them, some kind of minty-yet-earthy flavor.</li>
            <li>They burn your lips as you first insert them, suck them clean before chewing the last bit out.  </li>
            <li>I found my new loyal toothpick and plan on using these as long as they are made available.  </li>
            <li>flavor is very strong and as the toothpick breaks down, the flavor stays.</li>
            <li>At first the taste &amp; smell is very strong, but after a few chews you get used to it &amp; it becomes really enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived much faster then said.</li>
            <li>Plaque is pushed off of teeth wherever I gently rub along gums.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look at the picture very closely.</li>
            <li>They make a big deal about the birch wood, and, quite frankly, had these been the regular kind of toothpicks you&#x27;d find in the front of some sit-down restaurants, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have a wet gob of mashed wood in my mouth by now.</li>
            <li>Helped me not smoke as much</li>
            <li>Thank U much.</li>
            <li>This is really helping me stop smoking.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping,good toothpicks to help stop smoking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the cinnamon, which is a real blast of taste.  </li>
            <li>very cautiously.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have really helped with my smoking cessation.</li>
            <li>Rarely used toothpicks myself, but these are a big step in right direction.</li>
            <li>These toothpicks are pretty unique, originally ordered them to help curb smoking, (that lasted for about a week) but found that sticking a  small, thin,(minty) stick in my mouth just didn&#x27;t cut it for me to help curb the urge to smoke, so now - they are just premium minty flavored toothpicks.</li>
            <li>The tea oil and the flavor of birch will mostly put you off, if you&#x27;re extremely turned off by slightly bitter things; other than that these have very nice flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve quit smoking 3 months ago , These have proven to be very helpful in the process , They give you the strong taste in your mouth that smells and tastes very good , You will hate to put a cigarette in your mouth with these in it .</li>
            <li>I was not sure I would like these  as I wanted to make my own cinnamon toothpicks.  </li>
            <li>not so much not very even flavor wise other than that they were chewing sticks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the taste, but I am someone who does not like mint, peppermint, spearmint, gum, etc.</li>
            <li>These are high quality tooth picks with tea tree flavor, what else do u want?</li>
            <li>Product creates tingly minty fresh sensation in mouth, it&#x27;s even a bit addictive to use.</li>
            <li>Definitely leave your mouth tingling, and gives you confidence that your breath is fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not going to throw these away, but now I wished I would have bought plastic toothpicks for durability&#x27;s sake or bought just normal toothpicks for the cost savings.</li>
            <li>It is kind of an odd taste when you first start using them, but give it a couple of tries before you decide this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>I realize this is a trend in our econmy, to give less for the same price, but I would certainly rather pay more for the quality I am accustomed to.</li>
            <li>Forever dentition forever new;  </li>
            <li>For less than four bucks, they&#x27;re worth it in my opinion, and I don&#x27;t even like menthol all that much.</li>
            <li>Just fantastic little toothpicks.</li>
            <li>they are not overwhelmingly flavored but you get a clean feeling after picking at your teeth or chewing on it!</li>
            <li>Only caution is that the cinnamon ones can be a little spicy for those who&#x27;ve never had them before, but they grow on you for sure.</li>
            <li>, it states clearly in the product description that these are toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;  </li>
            <li>Forever tea tree, and forever young;  </li>
            <li>I completely quit smoking and kicked cravings with these toothpicks</li>
            <li>I wanted to use this product to keep my mouth busy</li>
            <li>I used to chew on paper or regular toothpicks for the most part, sometimes I&#x27;d just chew plain gum or go and get some candy.</li>
            <li>When I say they &amp;#34;filled a void,&amp;#34; what I mean is that they satisfied my smoking-induced oral-fixation.</li>
            <li>The taste is really strong if I bite down on the toothpick so the Tea Tree oil has penetrated deep into the Birch wood.</li>
            <li>I used these in high school to quit smoking, and it was the only thing that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>You will notice the new label that says \\&quot;Personal Care\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>&quot; I was expecting something more Australian, and by that I mean aboriginal.</li>
            <li>Ten years later, I am finding myself smoking again and suddenly remembered how I stopped in the first place.  </li>
            <li>My only complaints are they are a little pricey to buy online, possibly cheaper at the store, and the lid does not snap securely shut.</li>
            <li>Thy seed,  forever will those trees be bare;  </li>
            <li>So these are regular old toothpicks that have been soaked in tea tree oil and a bit of Cinnamon Oil</li>
            <li>The birchwood is soft enough so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth if I&#x27;m gnawing it to mush, something I couldn&#x27;t do with pen caps or chewing gum.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I&#x27;ve pretty much swapped one addiction for another.  </li>
            <li>I picked up a normal toothpick at a restaurant today (shaped just like these with one pointed end and one flat w/ embellishments) and it was of the same durability, just without the various oils taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to have nicotine gum on standby because was a pretty heavy smoker (1pk/day).  </li>

            <li> Comes in this handy plastic box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purpose of purchase was to give me something else to gnaw on besides my own fingers/fingernails.</li>
            <li> and I liked them.</li>
            <li> He liked the minty taste and the durability of the toothpick.</li>
            <li> These babys come in handy when I get the urge to smoke or eat anything that I should not.  </li>
            <li> Plus, my breath smells great, and I always have that just went-to-the dentist clean mouth feeling.  </li>
            <li> They taste so good and make your breath smell great, and toothpicks are so much classier than cigarettes!  </li>
            <li> They have a strong but pleasant smell and he seems to be using them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed none of the nausea that another reviewer mentioned, and the amount of tea tree in these is negligible at best unless you&#x27;re very sensitive to the effects.</li>
            <li> more birchwood, birchwood love!  </li>
            <li> They taste fine and make your breath smell good.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product, Thursday Plantation.</li>
            <li> Actually, I believe I like the Tea tree the best for quitting smoking.  </li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have chewed many toothpicks in my day, and these blow them all away.  </li>
            <li> These gave me a way to channel my nervous energy in a healthy way.  </li>
            <li> Superb as a regular toothpick, and efficient as a breath mint.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these chewing sticks.  </li>
            <li> A flowery tale more menthol than our rhyme:  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Not to the sensual tongue, but, more endeared,  &lt;</li>
            <li> Pipe to the spirited flavor of no tone.  </li>
            <li> For oral health and still to be enjoyed,  </li>
            <li> They taste good and leave your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I really loved them back in the day, they are also great for freshening your breath.  </li>
            <li> I am not so sure that chewing this will make you quit.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t care what they say, i love these lil sticks</li>
            <li> My kids also like them :)</li>
            <li> i love these</li>
            <li> Those have quite a bit more punch than the Thursday Plantation offering.</li>
            <li> One item to note is that these toothpicks seem to be a bit more durable tan</li>
            <li> They have a refreshing mint taste and tingle.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love thursday plantation chewing sticks and will accept no substitutes and believe me</li>
            <li> I just love these sticks.</li>
            <li> Love the milled end as well.</li>
            <li> Make your mouth feel very fresh!</li>
            <li> gives nice clean feel to mouth</li>
            <li> Taste great, not a bad habit, keeps your breath fresh.</li>
            <li> They work great to freshen up your breathe in a healthy and natural way.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit strong, and can be overwhelming at times.  </li>
            <li> I must say, the taste is really refreshing, though quite strong.</li>
            <li> in all these are good toothpicks and good mints, at the same time.  </li>
            <li> They are very strong, so it may take a little getting used to, but the mix of oils in these gives the best flavor and the wood they use is the highest quality.</li>
            <li> very cool</li>
            <li> Like I said in the title, the taste is very very good, but it lasts for a very short time.</li>
            <li> I just wonder if it would be more cost-effective to buy a bunch of cheap toothpicks and soak them in tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Chewing on these won&#x27;t make you quit smoking, but they are perfect for getting you through the rough spots when you are quitting.</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised by this product which serves as great gum stimlulation as well as breath freshner.  </li>
            <li> Very spicy but good.  </li>
            <li> Bought because tea tree oil is supposed to be good for alleviating tooth pain, and I don&#x27;t know how much it helped on that front?  </li>
            <li> It helps keep my mouth tasting nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Convenient, easy to use.</li>
            <li> the Tea Tree and Spearmint are strong and used to mineralize your teeth  and are in the sticks</li>
            <li> Man, its so strong, just started using them.</li>
            <li> Some of them are really strong others</li>
            <li> strong flavor but</li>
            <li> Strong for anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried them yet.</li>
            <li> I saw there is a cinnamon, but since I&#x27;m replacing a menthol cigarette addiction, I think this is helping me just fine.</li>
            <li> These little flavored toothpicks are wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to order separately from large items, in which case they&#x27;ll ship in a padded envelope rather than a big box and won&#x27;t have this problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also the wood does not splinter which is a huge must if your going to be putting it in your mouth</li>
            <li> I am using the patch which helps greatly, but I do like the taste this leaves in my mouth especially the menthol.  </li>
            <li> They are great for after meals or simply to freshen your breath throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Cheap for 100, and tasty.</li>
            <li> also enjoy the taste of these.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend then if you are trying to quit!!!</li>
            <li> also a very popular australian product.</li>
            <li> They have a nice menthol taste and are stronger then normal toothpicks.  </li>
            <li> and no I&#x27;m not disappointed at all its like therapy for your mouth.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure they help your breath too.</li>
            <li> Still, these perform as advertised and will clean between your teeth and give your gums a dose of anti-microbial tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these about one month and use them after I eat to clean between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Leave mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> And It will also clean your mouth as well.</li>
            <li> And I feel like my breath is fresher and my mouth just feels pleasantly clean all the time.</li>
            <li> If your plan to stop smoking, then these babies right here are it!</li>
            <li> menthol is so sweet, but those unheard  </li>
            <li> A fresh mouth, and a light feeling.</li>
            <li> They look cool.</li>
            <li> I thought,\\&quot;Eh, why not?\\&quot; I just got the pack today (two days ahead of schedule, good job amazon), and I honestly put the first stick in my mouth like an hour and a half ago.</li>
            <li> The mint and tea tree are strong enough on their own.</li>
            <li> Made of birch they don&#x27;t shred as easy for the avid chewer.</li>
            <li> The taste is also pretty strong and helps freshen breath.</li>
            <li> As you clean your teeth you get this cool sensation as well as a fresh breath</li>
            <li> Luckily these are a lot cheaper then cigarettes.</li>
            <li> but I consider them to be quite mild.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> It works pretty well when you want to keep your mouth busy and gives you that nice menthol-ly taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem with these toothpicks is that I have to loan them to so many free-loading friends!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though winning near the goal---yet, do not grieve;  </li>
            <li> my breath smells fresh and I&#x27;m yet to see the effects</li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite flavor and type of pick to keep in the mouth.   </li>
            <li> It leaves your breath fresh.</li>
            <li> The sticks are sturdy and the flavor is distinct but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> Not only are they tasty and refreshing, but they clean your teeth and also fill a void.</li>
            <li> Very strong taste, perfect to help quit doing a bad habit like smoking chewing or even snacking</li>
            <li> The toothpicks are strong and capable of sustaining intense chewing.  </li>
            <li> Tast great and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped very fast &amp; the price is right.  </li>
            <li> Tastes good, despite the slight bit of cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li> breathing bright Cassia far above,  </li>
            <li> I find it an amazing subtitute for chewing on the rubber commonly known as &amp;#34;chewing gum&amp;#34;. :)</li>
            <li> they really make my whole mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Great not only as a smoking cessation aid but as regular toothpicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but because I was mislead and ended up buying toothpicks instead of real sticks, I&#x27;m giving it a 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chewed into a tiny brush they do clean the plague off the gum line real well and give a refreshing taste that lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,  </li>
            <li> and these things are hot as hell in summer and fall on ya mouth</li>
            <li> rather then popping a mint in ya mouth or spraying something to make ya breath smell better on the low.</li>
            <li> continue to make my tea using hot water, however, and with that I am somewhat dismayed.</li>
            <li> I used them 15 years ago when I first quit smoking, and they still work like a charm.</li>
            <li> My dentist says my teeth look better since my last visit</li>
            <li> and as I&#x27;m writing this review I still have the first stick in my mouth.</li>
            <li> these have tea tree oil taste, and I love that fact, and these are terrific.</li>
            <li> and I chew them on a regular basis, let me just say this: They are fantastic!</li>
            <li> If for no other reason that they are excellent to chew upon (especially during the times when I would be better to use my mouth for something other than making noise), have a not-unpleasant flavor, the the container will be useful for later, maybe for carrying toof picks or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a case of people realizing having both is a waste of space and doing something intelligent about it, same reason people carry a Leatherman Wave instead of a full toolbox everywhere they go.</li>
            <li> And for the brave at heart, I suggest chewing on them after they get a little soft.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to run into other devotees and note, with a wink and a nod, the distinctively-shaped blunt end protruding from each others mouths.</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree flavor is VERY strong so don&#x27;t bite down on the tooth pick right away.</li>
            <li> Over all, highly recommended for people who like to chew things and have fresh breath, or for those who need help quitting smoking.</li>
            <li> they are just excellent, they do their job perfectly (i mean not only cleaning, but disinfecting)</li>
            <li> I want to note that the taste of these picks is pretty strong especially for the non-smoker (like me)</li>
            <li> Having read all of the positive reviews, I had to try them.  </li>
            <li> Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Australian chewing sticks help keep your teeth clean and you breath minty fresh.</li>
            <li> Most people have never heard of them and will be curious ;).  </li>
            <li> The menthol has been consistently strong the entire time.</li>
            <li> Several reviews state they are strong.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon ones are veeeerrry strong, so if you aren&#x27;t a big cinnamon fan, stay away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person who smokes however these are very high quality chew sticks.</li>
            <li> These things, these little sticks in this box, had a rather less-than-wood flavor to them, some kind of minty-yet-earthy flavor.</li>
            <li> They burn your lips as you first insert them, suck them clean before chewing the last bit out.  </li>
            <li> I found my new loyal toothpick and plan on using these as long as they are made available.  </li>
            <li> flavor is very strong and as the toothpick breaks down, the flavor stays.</li>
            <li> At first the taste &amp; smell is very strong, but after a few chews you get used to it &amp; it becomes really enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived much faster then said.</li>
            <li> Plaque is pushed off of teeth wherever I gently rub along gums.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look at the picture very closely.</li>
            <li> They make a big deal about the birch wood, and, quite frankly, had these been the regular kind of toothpicks you&#x27;d find in the front of some sit-down restaurants, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have a wet gob of mashed wood in my mouth by now.</li>
            <li> Helped me not smoke as much</li>
            <li> Thank U much.</li>
            <li> This is really helping me stop smoking.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping,good toothpicks to help stop smoking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the cinnamon, which is a real blast of taste.  </li>
            <li> very cautiously.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have really helped with my smoking cessation.</li>
            <li> Rarely used toothpicks myself, but these are a big step in right direction.</li>
            <li> These toothpicks are pretty unique, originally ordered them to help curb smoking, (that lasted for about a week) but found that sticking a  small, thin,(minty) stick in my mouth just didn&#x27;t cut it for me to help curb the urge to smoke, so now - they are just premium minty flavored toothpicks.</li>
            <li> The tea oil and the flavor of birch will mostly put you off, if you&#x27;re extremely turned off by slightly bitter things; other than that these have very nice flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve quit smoking 3 months ago , These have proven to be very helpful in the process , They give you the strong taste in your mouth that smells and tastes very good , You will hate to put a cigarette in your mouth with these in it .</li>
            <li> I was not sure I would like these  as I wanted to make my own cinnamon toothpicks.  </li>
            <li> not so much not very even flavor wise other than that they were chewing sticks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the taste, but I am someone who does not like mint, peppermint, spearmint, gum, etc.</li>
            <li> These are high quality tooth picks with tea tree flavor, what else do u want?</li>
            <li> Product creates tingly minty fresh sensation in mouth, it&#x27;s even a bit addictive to use.</li>
            <li> Definitely leave your mouth tingling, and gives you confidence that your breath is fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not going to throw these away, but now I wished I would have bought plastic toothpicks for durability&#x27;s sake or bought just normal toothpicks for the cost savings.</li>
            <li> It is kind of an odd taste when you first start using them, but give it a couple of tries before you decide this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I realize this is a trend in our econmy, to give less for the same price, but I would certainly rather pay more for the quality I am accustomed to.</li>
            <li> Forever dentition forever new;  </li>
            <li> For less than four bucks, they&#x27;re worth it in my opinion, and I don&#x27;t even like menthol all that much.</li>
            <li> Just fantastic little toothpicks.</li>
            <li> they are not overwhelmingly flavored but you get a clean feeling after picking at your teeth or chewing on it!</li>
            <li> Only caution is that the cinnamon ones can be a little spicy for those who&#x27;ve never had them before, but they grow on you for sure.</li>
            <li> , it states clearly in the product description that these are toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;  </li>
            <li> Forever tea tree, and forever young;  </li>
            <li> I completely quit smoking and kicked cravings with these toothpicks</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this product to keep my mouth busy</li>
            <li> I used to chew on paper or regular toothpicks for the most part, sometimes I&#x27;d just chew plain gum or go and get some candy.</li>
            <li> When I say they &amp;#34;filled a void,&amp;#34; what I mean is that they satisfied my smoking-induced oral-fixation.</li>
            <li> The taste is really strong if I bite down on the toothpick so the Tea Tree oil has penetrated deep into the Birch wood.</li>
            <li> I used these in high school to quit smoking, and it was the only thing that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> You will notice the new label that says \\&quot;Personal Care\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> &quot; I was expecting something more Australian, and by that I mean aboriginal.</li>
            <li> Ten years later, I am finding myself smoking again and suddenly remembered how I stopped in the first place.  </li>
            <li> My only complaints are they are a little pricey to buy online, possibly cheaper at the store, and the lid does not snap securely shut.</li>
            <li> Thy seed,  forever will those trees be bare;  </li>
            <li> So these are regular old toothpicks that have been soaked in tea tree oil and a bit of Cinnamon Oil</li>
            <li> The birchwood is soft enough so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth if I&#x27;m gnawing it to mush, something I couldn&#x27;t do with pen caps or chewing gum.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I&#x27;ve pretty much swapped one addiction for another.  </li>
            <li> I picked up a normal toothpick at a restaurant today (shaped just like these with one pointed end and one flat w/ embellishments) and it was of the same durability, just without the various oils taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to have nicotine gum on standby because was a pretty heavy smoker (1pk/day).  </li>
            <li> Again this is likely due to variation in the natural materials used.</li>
            <li> They are toothpicks flavored (heavily) with minty fresh tea tree oil, they last for hours unless actively \\&quot;chewed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why they haven&#x27;t tried to truly market these as anti-smoking aids, because they really do work.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> This lets the freshness of the flavor really last a long time.</li>
            <li> Chew though I might, the pieces of wood remained intact for such a significant period of time that I finally grew bored</li>
            <li> I have used these when trying to stop smoking, it keeps my mouth busy and I even like the slight burn.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected them to be larger or otherwise different because the are called \\&quot;chewing sticks\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It can be highly toxic even in small doses.</li>
            <li> Hope there is no side effects to these because I chew them all day long.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> When old age shall this generation waste,  &lt;br</li>
            <li> The minty flavor lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I recommend these over any other standard toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I guess it kind of helped numb the area a little.  </li>
            <li> For me, smoking isn&#x27;t about the addiction to nicotine or other addictive concotions in cigarettes.  </li>
            <li> One toothpick lasts a very long time!  </li>
            <li> tastes like camel dung... or maybe dried flung monkey poop... useing them for toothpicks only...</li>
            <li> To what green altar, O mysterious lips,  </li>
            <li> I expected to find a kit from which I could grow a tree which would dispense tea (and at this price, how could one say \\&quot;no?\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rcvd on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I expected wrongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected STICKS, NOT toothpicks.</li>
            <li> The taste is a little weird, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> Note that I have been Cold free for about 2 and a half years.  </li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t get the oils on your fingers and rub your eyes, you&#x27;ll be sorry.  ;)</li>
            <li> There are other brands out there but don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> so I gave him the other pack.</li>
            <li> The plastic container they come in is small enough to throw in the front pocket and forget about them until needed.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m on the computer, I&#x27;m notorious for smoking, moreso than any other place.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid chewer of things, it gives me something to focus on when I&#x27;m bored out of my skull.</li>
            <li> forest branches and the active oil;  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that something so simple could help me quit, but so far, it is helping.</li>
            <li> Down under or the dales of Arcady?  </li>
            <li> Can be used while sitting, lying down or even jogging.</li>
            <li> They keep my teeth clean after meals and they get rid of bad breath.</li>
            <li> my experience, these do not appear to splinter any less than \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Just when you think the flavor is getting weak, bite in a little and it all comes rushing back.  </li>
            <li> little town by river or sea shore,  </li>
            <li> I do like the little plastic pack they come in; that is handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually hold onto a single one at a time in my mouth for at least half an hour to a couple hours.</li>
            <li> Chewing on these sticks makes me think of myself as a crying baby sucking on a pacifier.</li>
            <li> narrow shape!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the dental benefits</li>
            <li> Too often I was disappointed with the poor quality and short lasting taste.      </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a willpower thing that varies person to person, but these were not effective in helping me quit smoking.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend these to younger people as toothpicks are somewhat dangerous, but everyone else should give these a try.</li>
            <li> Also have been getting nausea a lot lately.</li>
            <li> Until now I had been forced to pilfer handfuls of toothpicks from restaurants, hoping that they would be minty and not splinter after 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Thou foster child of arbor and slow time,  &lt;br /&gt;Sylvan historian, who canst thus express  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Contemplating the failure my purchase</li>
            <li> Further, they appear to be impossible to wear out.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed to discover that they are now making them noticeably thinner as of this year (2012), apparently to save money without raising the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly addicted to these flavored toothpicks.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any side effects, i.e., nausea as indicated by another reviewer.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> Hah, I know it&#x27;s crazy, but it works.</li>
            <li> What mad pursuit?</li>
            <li> Bad breath disappears.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Biting these is a bad idea.  </li>
            <li> Every slightest urge to smoke, I pop one of these bad boys in my mouth and suck and chew on it for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Cold Pastoral!  </li>
            <li> I must admit I was initially disappointed.</li>
            <li> , all that was in the case was a bunch of stupid sticks.</li>
            <li> Your friends will probably hate you if you offer them one, mine did.</li>
            <li> nasty flavor nasty after taste...who evented this flavor?</li>
            <li> not letting these nasty things rest in my mouth anymore than i have too.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived much faster then said. Tastes great.</li>
            <li> Please google product before buying.  It appears that tea tree oil should not be ingested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly addicted to these flavored toothpicks.  Great alternative to smoking/dipping or just chewing on.</li>
            <li> I will buy these again. Bad breath disappears. Plaque is pushed off of teeth wherever I gently rub along gums. The taste is really strong if I bite down on the toothpick so the Tea Tree oil has penetrated deep into the Birch wood. Thanks for a great product, Thursday Plantation.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s essentially what these are. I guess when I read \\&quot;chewing stick\\&quot; I was expecting something more Australian, and by that I mean aboriginal. I didn&#x27;t look at the picture very closely. Still, these perform as advertised and will clean between your teeth and give your gums a dose of anti-microbial tea tree oil. I just wonder if it would be more cost-effective to buy a bunch of cheap toothpicks and soak them in tea tree oil. But this is a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I was not sure I would like these  as I wanted to make my own cinnamon toothpicks.  After looking for cinnamon oil at a health food store, I saw these and there was a dual pack that also had cinnamon. Actually, I believe I like the Tea tree the best for quitting smoking.  I am using the patch which helps greatly, but I do like the taste this leaves in my mouth especially the menthol.  I have also ordered some wintergreen oil to make my own wintergreen flavored toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I got a pack just because. I was searching for licorice root sticks and stumbled across them, so I thought,\\&quot;Eh, why not?\\&quot; I just got the pack today (two days ahead of schedule, good job amazon), and I honestly put the first stick in my mouth like an hour and a half ago. The menthol has been consistently strong the entire time. They make a big deal about the birch wood, and, quite frankly, had these been the regular kind of toothpicks you&#x27;d find in the front of some sit-down restaurants, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have a wet gob of mashed wood in my mouth by now. For less than four bucks, they&#x27;re worth it in my opinion, and I don&#x27;t even like menthol all that much.</li>
            <li> Very strong taste, perfect to help quit doing a bad habit like smoking chewing or even snacking</li>
            <li> They are toothpicks flavored (heavily) with minty fresh tea tree oil, they last for hours unless actively \\&quot;chewed\\&quot;. Everyone at work asks me for them. My only complaints are they are a little pricey to buy online, possibly cheaper at the store, and the lid does not snap securely shut. Oh yeah, don&#x27;t rub your eyes after handling these. Over all, highly recommended for people who like to chew things and have fresh breath, or for those who need help quitting smoking.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as advertised.  Took a couple days longer to receive it than I had planned on, but the product is definitely a good one.</li>
            <li> Very spicy but good.  Make your mouth feel very fresh!</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li> For years I have been searching for the perfect toothpick chewing experience.  Until now I had been forced to pilfer handfuls of toothpicks from restaurants, hoping that they would be minty and not splinter after 5 minutes.  Too often I was disappointed with the poor quality and short lasting taste.      After some investigation, I stumbled upon these chewing sticks.  Having read all of the positive reviews, I had to try them.  I could not be happier.  They last forever, and so does the flavor!  Just when you think the flavor is getting weak, bite in a little and it all comes rushing back.  I have chewed many toothpicks in my day, and these blow them all away.  Get these.</li>
            <li> Hope there is no side effects to these because I chew them all day long.  Very good for people how smoke and are trying to quit or as an alternative to gum.</li>
            <li> I have been chewing these for years.  I was highly disappointed to discover that they are now making them noticeably thinner as of this year (2012), apparently to save money without raising the cost. You will notice the new label that says \\&quot;Personal Care\\&quot;. I realize this is a trend in our econmy, to give less for the same price, but I would certainly rather pay more for the quality I am accustomed to.</li>
            <li> These are great!  I was looking for an alternative to eating candy &amp; fidgeting all the time.  These gave me a way to channel my nervous energy in a healthy way.  At first the taste &amp; smell is very strong, but after a few chews you get used to it &amp; it becomes really enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped very fast &amp; the price is right.  Will definitely be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5</li>
            <li> Tastes good, despite the slight bit of cinnamon flavor. Superb as a regular toothpick, and efficient as a breath mint. I will continue to buy this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> The Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Toothpicks is a great product. I love the smell and taste of this excellent product. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> These toothpicks have a very nice taste.  I do not drink tea but these taste great.  One toothpick lasts a very long time!  I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> Chewing on these won&#x27;t make you quit smoking, but they are perfect for getting you through the rough spots when you are quitting.</li>
            <li> they are just excellent, they do their job perfectly (i mean not only cleaning, but disinfecting)</li>
            <li> I love these. I have used these when trying to stop smoking, it keeps my mouth busy and I even like the slight burn. I carry these with me everywhere. People often also complement me on my breath after having these in.</li>
            <li> It is nice to run into other devotees and note, with a wink and a nod, the distinctively-shaped blunt end protruding from each others mouths.The only problem with these toothpicks is that I have to loan them to so many free-loading friends!</li>
            <li> Helped me not smoke as much</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product. Very good quality made. I just don&#x27;t like the flavor. Tasted like mint mixed with grass lawn clippings.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these chewing sticks.  They have a lot of flavor, freshen up my mouth just as well as gum, the flavor lasts longer than gum, and for the price, 100 chewing sticks is cheaper than 2 packs of gum.  That and gum can&#x27;t pick stuff out of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Does everything (don&#x27;t know about smoking cessation - not a smoker) as product description says. Rarely used toothpicks myself, but these are a big step in right direction. Product creates tingly minty fresh sensation in mouth, it&#x27;s even a bit addictive to use.</li>
            <li> Thou still so ravished bride of quietness,  &lt;br /&gt;      Thou foster child of arbor and slow time,  &lt;br /&gt;Sylvan historian, who canst thus express  &lt;br /&gt;      A flowery tale more menthol than our rhyme:  &lt;br /&gt;What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape  &lt;br /&gt;      Of deities or mortals, or of both,  &lt;br /&gt;            Down under or the dales of Arcady?  &lt;br /&gt;What teeth to pick are these? What dental loath?  &lt;br /&gt;      What mad pursuit? What struggle to dentate?  &lt;br /&gt;            What gaps and molars? What mastication?  &lt;br /&gt;My menthol is so sweet, but those unheard  &lt;br /&gt;      Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;  &lt;br /&gt;Not to the sensual tongue, but, more endeared,  &lt;br /&gt;      Pipe to the spirited flavor of no tone.  &lt;br /&gt;Fair youth, you made of trees, thou canst not leave  &lt;br /&gt;      Thy seed,  forever will those trees be bare;  &lt;br /&gt;            Non-smoker, never, never canst thou kiss,  &lt;br /&gt;Though winning near the goal---yet, do not grieve;  &lt;br /&gt;      She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss  &lt;br /&gt;            Forever wilt thou love, and she be fair!  &lt;br /&gt;Ah, happy, happy boughs! that chewed up shed  &lt;br /&gt;      Your leaves, nor ever bid the mouth adieu;  &lt;br /&gt;And, happy non-smoker, unweari-ed,  &lt;br /&gt;      Forever dentition forever new;  &lt;br /&gt;More birchwood love! more birchwood, birchwood love!  &lt;br /&gt;      For oral health and still to be enjoyed,  &lt;br /&gt;            Forever tea tree, and forever young;  &lt;br /&gt;All breathing bright Cassia far above,  &lt;br /&gt;      That leaves a mouth high-plentiful and cleaned,  &lt;br /&gt;            A burning foremouth, and a wetted tongue.  &lt;br /&gt;Who are these coming to the sacrifice?  &lt;br /&gt;      To what green altar, O mysterious lips,  &lt;br /&gt;Swet oil of fennel lowing at the skies,  &lt;br /&gt;      And all her peppermint with garlands dressed?  &lt;br /&gt;What little town by river or sea shore,  &lt;br /&gt;      Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,  &lt;br /&gt;            Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?  &lt;br /&gt;melaleuca alternifolia,  &lt;br /&gt;      Will silent be; and not a soul to tell  &lt;br /&gt;            Why thou art desolate, can breath return.  &lt;br /&gt;O narrow shape! Fair attitude! With toil  &lt;br /&gt;      Of wooden men and maidens picking teeth,  &lt;br /&gt;With forest branches and the active oil;  &lt;br /&gt;      Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought  &lt;br /&gt;As doth eternity. Cold Pastoral!  &lt;br /&gt;      When old age shall this generation waste,  &lt;br /&gt;            Thou shalt remain, in midst of gapping tooth  &lt;br /&gt;Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say&#x27;st,  &lt;br /&gt;      \\&quot;Beauty is truth, truth beauty\\&quot;---that is all  &lt;br /&gt;            Ye know on earth, and all ye have is truth.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The taste is a little weird, but not bad.  The tea oil and the flavor of birch will mostly put you off, if you&#x27;re extremely turned off by slightly bitter things; other than that these have very nice flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biting these is a bad idea.  They burn your lips as you first insert them, suck them clean before chewing the last bit out.  Also don&#x27;t get the oils on your fingers and rub your eyes, you&#x27;ll be sorry.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all these are good toothpicks and good mints, at the same time.  This is a case of people realizing having both is a waste of space and doing something intelligent about it, same reason people carry a Leatherman Wave instead of a full toolbox everywhere they go.</li>
            <li> nasty flavor nasty after taste...who evented this flavor? tastes like camel dung... or maybe dried flung monkey poop... useing them for toothpicks only... not letting these nasty things rest in my mouth anymore than i have too.</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised by this product which serves as great gum stimlulation as well as breath freshner.  Convenient, easy to use. Will definately make future purchases.</li>
            <li> Very helpful to quit smoking and any kind of habit espicially if you set your mind to it very happy with the purchase thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent service fast and these things are hot as hell in summer and fall on ya mouth trust me. But it&#x27;s all good as you get use to it. Not only do they work but you look cooler chewing on it rather then popping a mint in ya mouth or spraying something to make ya breath smell better on the low. Honestly!! Just get em they come in handy. Trust me.</li>
            <li> If your plan to stop smoking, then these babies right here are it! Once I put one of these toothpicks in my mouth, I havent picked up cigarette since!!!</li>
            <li> I must admit I was initially disappointed. I expected to find a kit from which I could grow a tree which would dispense tea (and at this price, how could one say \\&quot;no?\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, all that was in the case was a bunch of stupid sticks. I planted several anyway (note: There&#x27;s no directions, or even a support phone number) but it&#x27;s not looking like this is going to work out as I&#x27;m not even seeing a bud or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contemplating the failure my purchase, I took one of the sticks out so as to chew on it, to give me something to occupy myself as I contemplated the next step in growing trees which dispense tea. And, zoot alors! These things, these little sticks in this box, had a rather less-than-wood flavor to them, some kind of minty-yet-earthy flavor. Further, they appear to be impossible to wear out. Chew though I might, the pieces of wood remained intact for such a significant period of time that I finally grew bored (\\&quot;bored,\\&quot; get it?) with that phase of the experiment and threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I am keeping the tree/stick things I have left. If for no other reason that they are excellent to chew upon (especially during the times when I would be better to use my mouth for something other than making noise), have a not-unpleasant flavor, the the container will be useful for later, maybe for carrying toof picks or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to make my tea using hot water, however, and with that I am somewhat dismayed.</li>
            <li> They taste good and leave your mouth feeling fresh. I recommend these over any other standard toothpicks. The case is convenient, too.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a willpower thing that varies person to person, but these were not effective in helping me quit smoking. They were very refreshing, however.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of brands of Tea Tree Oil chewing sticks and these are the best! They are very strong, so it may take a little getting used to, but the mix of oils in these gives the best flavor and the wood they use is the highest quality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, I always carry a pack with me. They are great for after meals or simply to freshen your breath throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Bought these as an alternative to gum.  They work great to freshen up your breathe in a healthy and natural way.  They are a bit strong, and can be overwhelming at times.  Definitely leave your mouth tingling, and gives you confidence that your breath is fresh.</li>
            <li> Got this to quit smoking.  It works pretty well when you want to keep your mouth busy and gives you that nice menthol-ly taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice: It kinda burns after a while, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing I completely quit smoking and kicked cravings with these toothpicks I absolutely recommend then if you are trying to quit!!!</li>
            <li> Ever since I was introduced to Thursday Plantation - Tea Tree Toothpicks I carry them with me all the time. They keep my teeth clean after meals and they get rid of bad breath. There are other brands out there but don&#x27;t be fooled. Thursday Plantation - Tea Tree Toothpicks are the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought those  tooth sticks because of the ingredients. And I wanted to basically improve my ooral health(not that I need it that much)and the Tea Tree and Spearmint are strong and used to mineralize your teeth  and are in the sticks it&#x27;s why I bought the item. But when I got the item, I used 1 tooth stick and already felt the results! A fresh mouth, and a light feeling. So it works as it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;You must buy this!</li>
            <li> I used to help quit the Nicorette, which I used to quit smoking... what will get me off the toothpicks? (Just kidding... sort of.) It&#x27;s great when you have a craving and need it to pass. I used them 15 years ago when I first quit smoking, and they still work like a charm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person who smokes however these are very high quality chew sticks. Made of birch they don&#x27;t shred as easy for the avid chewer. Regular toothpicks are no longer the same to me because these def. raise the standard. I want to note that the taste of these picks is pretty strong especially for the non-smoker (like me) but I like these all the same.     Note that I&#x27;m cavity prone! However after chewing and picking my teeth with these 3 times a day, 2 weeks before i went to the dentist...my dentist informed me that I had the cleanest mouth he had ever seen. And no cavities.  Note that I have been Cold free for about 2 and a half years.  Note that I gave one of these to my friends at work who had a mouthsore and he claims it numbed the pain away.    I can&#x27;t recommend these to younger people as toothpicks are somewhat dangerous, but everyone else should give these a try.</li>
            <li> I was given this product by a client of mine whom I told I was planning on quitting smoking.  I decided to have nicotine gum on standby because was a pretty heavy smoker (1pk/day).  Well, hesitant to chew the gum and feed my body the drug I am trying to kick, I turned to these chewing sticks.  Every slightest urge to smoke, I pop one of these bad boys in my mouth and suck and chew on it for 10 minutes.  The minute it hits my mouth, I forget my cigarette craving.  Plus, my breath smells great, and I always have that just went-to-the dentist clean mouth feeling.  This is the easiest time I have ever had stopping smoking.</li>
            <li> A great way to kill bacteria, and etc. with just a &amp;#34;toothpick&amp;#34; and I use it while I am driving or whatever. Can be used while sitting, lying down or even jogging.</li>
            <li> Minty toothpicks.  Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Rcvd on time and as expected. was gift for friend. he enjoyes the taste. Would order again. Thank U much.</li>
            <li> Cheap for 100, and tasty. I usually hold onto a single one at a time in my mouth for at least half an hour to a couple hours. I find it an amazing subtitute for chewing on the rubber commonly known as &amp;#34;chewing gum&amp;#34;. :)</li>
            <li> I used these in high school to quit smoking, and it was the only thing that worked for me.  Ten years later, I am finding myself smoking again and suddenly remembered how I stopped in the first place.  I just bought three packs of these, after 10 years, because I know I won&#x27;t need to smoke when I use them.  I really loved them back in the day, they are also great for freshening your breath.  They can also be a great conversation starter.  Most people have never heard of them and will be curious ;).  I&#x27;m not really sure why they haven&#x27;t tried to truly market these as anti-smoking aids, because they really do work.</li>
            <li> I quit smoking 6 months ago with chantix and these toothpicks. I quit the Chantix a couple months in but have been using the toothpicks ever since. Also have been getting nausea a lot lately. After looking into lots of different ideas, I googled tea tree oil.....every site warns you not to take internally. It can be highly toxic even in small doses. So while it did help quitting smoking, I&#x27;m switching over to the minty toothpicks you get in restaurants.</li>
            <li> Does the job and gives your breath a makeover. Would recommend as a call along in the makeup bag. A believer in tea tree oil</li>
            <li> I keep a box of these at home, in the car, and at my desk at work. The toothpicks are strong and capable of sustaining intense chewing.  The taste is also pretty strong and helps freshen breath.</li>
            <li> Man, its so strong, just started using them. my breath smells fresh and I&#x27;m yet to see the effects but i will update later probably. I&#x27;d still brush with water and salt for the time being but if yo want an alternative to gum or toothpaste get these. Tell a lie already i can feel my toothache easing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve quit smoking 3 months ago , These have proven to be very helpful in the process , They give you the strong taste in your mouth that smells and tastes very good , You will hate to put a cigarette in your mouth with these in it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these about one month and use them after I eat to clean between my teeth. They taste fine and make your breath smell good. My dentist says my teeth look better since my last visit so I guess they are working.</li>
            <li> These tooth picks taste really good. Leave mouth feeling clean and refreshed. A+ if trying to stop smoking. I plan on continuing use of these tooth picks.</li>
            <li> I am not so sure that chewing this will make you quit. Chewing stick for awhile, it may not be good for your health because some debris can go inside of your stomach. However, putting inside of the mouth and smell of menthol will give you some pleasure. And It will also clean your mouth as well. This what make this product good...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the dental benefits but I do like having these around for toothpicks and stress relief; great taste too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these along with NicoDerm to help me quit smoking.  They have a nice menthol taste and are stronger then normal toothpicks.  You can suck, chew, and gnaw on them for a while before they start to splinter.  I noticed I haven&#x27;t been chewing on my fingers like I use to either.  I would recommend them to a non-smoker as well as someone who is looking to kick the habit.  My only complaint is that I&#x27;ve pretty much swapped one addiction for another.  Luckily these are a lot cheaper then cigarettes.</li>
            <li> Instead of having a cigarette. This is really helping me stop smoking.  The minty flavor lasts a long time.  Comes in this handy plastic box.</li>
            <li> fast shipping,good toothpicks to help stop smoking</li>
            <li> so good can&#x27;t stop chewing. i just read that tea tree oil is estrogenic. also a very popular australian product. i don&#x27;t care what they say, i love these lil sticks</li>
            <li> So these are regular old toothpicks that have been soaked in tea tree oil and a bit of Cinnamon Oil (those are the only two I can taste); also according to the package- canola oil, peppermint oil, spearmint oil, and fennel oil. I guess I expected them to be larger or otherwise different because the are called \\&quot;chewing sticks\\&quot;. I expected wrongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, these do not appear to splinter any less than \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothpicks. I picked up a normal toothpick at a restaurant today (shaped just like these with one pointed end and one flat w/ embellishments) and it was of the same durability, just without the various oils taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to throw these away, but now I wished I would have bought plastic toothpicks for durability&#x27;s sake or bought just normal toothpicks for the cost savings. I do like the little plastic pack they come in; that is handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose of purchase was to give me something else to gnaw on besides my own fingers/fingernails.</li>
            <li> I thought this was chewing gum,  but its not and no I&#x27;m not disappointed at all its like therapy for your mouth. As you clean your teeth you get this cool sensation as well as a fresh breath and as I&#x27;m writing this review I still have the first stick in my mouth. I gave my uncle a stick and he was relived so I gave him the other pack. This tste good thank you.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product. I wanted to use this product to keep my mouth busy so I could keep my mind off of smoking. It is a great tool for that purpose. I used to use J&amp;J Stim-u-dents and they worked but I was looking for something different as J&amp;J sold to another company that does not produce them as well. I found my new loyal toothpick and plan on using these as long as they are made available.  The Tea Tree flavor is VERY strong so don&#x27;t bite down on the tooth pick right away. I choose to let the flavor creep out before I put any pressure on the pick. This lets the freshness of the flavor really last a long time. These are by far my favorite flavor and type of pick to keep in the mouth.   The plastic container they come in is small enough to throw in the front pocket and forget about them until needed. Well done Thursday Plantation, Well done!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It leaves your breath fresh. I would recomend this to every one. Great for after meals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get my husband to stop smoking and was told these would help.  They have a strong but pleasant smell and he seems to be using them.  My kids also like them :)</li>
            <li> i love these and i use them daily at work in between brushings. they really make my whole mouth feel clean and fresh. they are not overwhelmingly flavored but you get a clean feeling after picking at your teeth or chewing on it! also the wood does not splinter which is a huge must if your going to be putting it in your mouth</li>
            <li> Some of them are really strong others not so much not very even flavor wise other than that they were chewing sticks</li>
            <li> I just ordered some of these Thursday Plantation toothpicks from Amazon. Several reviews state they are strong. Perhaps there is some variation in the manufacturing but I consider them to be quite mild. My perference is the toothpicks from Tea Tree Thereapy Inc. that are labeled: \\&quot;Tea Tree Thereapy - Tea Tree Toothpicks\\&quot;. Those have quite a bit more punch than the Thursday Plantation offering. One item to note is that these toothpicks seem to be a bit more durable tan the Tea Tree Therapy ones so that is a plus for this brand. Again this is likely due to variation in the natural materials used. Happy toothpicking!</li>
            <li> Bought because tea tree oil is supposed to be good for alleviating tooth pain, and I don&#x27;t know how much it helped on that front?  I guess it kind of helped numb the area a little.  Very very potent - would not recommend for everyone, but very cool and I liked them.</li>
            <li> Bought these on recommendation of a neighbor. They are a.) delicious b.) make your breath a bit sweeter and c.) milled at the end so not only are you chewing on a piece of wood, you are chewing on a fancy piece of wood with a milled end.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that something so simple could help me quit, but so far, it is helping. I have not experienced any side effects, i.e., nausea as indicated by another reviewer. They have a refreshing mint taste and tingle. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I switched to cinnamon picks, because these too me taste kinda gross. You&#x27;re breath is kinda funky too afterwards. But it gives you a kick.</li>
            <li> strong flavor but still good. gives nice clean feel to mouth</li>
            <li> these have tea tree oil taste, and I love that fact, and these are terrific. they get at the plaque, and satisfy my tongue.</li>
            <li> If you are in the process of quitting smoking, BUY THESE.  Chew on them in the car, outside with people on their smoke breaks, at the bar, etc.  They taste so good and make your breath smell great, and toothpicks are so much classier than cigarettes!  The cinnamon ones are veeeerrry strong, so if you aren&#x27;t a big cinnamon fan, stay away.  The mint and tea tree are strong enough on their own.</li>
            <li> There are SO many imposters but they all fail to achieve the kick that these pics pack when you pop one in your mouth.  And for the brave at heart, I suggest chewing on them after they get a little soft.  The effect is sinus-clearing!  I love thursday plantation chewing sticks and will accept no substitutes and believe me, I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Australian chewing sticks help keep your teeth clean and you breath minty fresh.</li>
            <li> Works great for steak and popcorn</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t suppress the craving of a cigarette at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is very strong and as the toothpick breaks down, the flavor stays. It is kind of an odd taste when you first start using them, but give it a couple of tries before you decide this isn&#x27;t for you. They do grow on you.</li>
            <li> For me, smoking isn&#x27;t about the addiction to nicotine or other addictive concotions in cigarettes.  It&#x27;s about the physical. These help me with having something physical for my mouth and hands in place of a cigarette.  When I&#x27;m on the computer, I&#x27;m notorious for smoking, moreso than any other place.  Also, it&#x27;s great to have in the car.  I no longer smoke in the car!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy the taste of these.  It helps keep my mouth tasting nice and fresh.  I&#x27;ve also tried the cinnamon, which is a real blast of taste.  I nibble at those very cautiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is great, too.  The price of these 100 sticks equals one pack of cigarettes, and I don&#x27;t use ten sticks/day.  I will definitely be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it states clearly in the product description that these are toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The sticks are sturdy and the flavor is distinct but not overpowering. Great not only as a smoking cessation aid but as regular toothpicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that when shipped as part of a larger order, the plastic containers can bounce around in the box and open, spilling the sticks all over. It&#x27;s best to order separately from large items, in which case they&#x27;ll ship in a padded envelope rather than a big box and won&#x27;t have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very-easy-opening containers might also pose a problem for someone trying to carry them around in a pants pocket.</li>
            <li> I have quit smoking recently, and I was a menthol smoker. I&#x27;ve been trying to find something to occupy me in the car, which seems to be my biggest &#x27;trigger&#x27;. I found these on Amazon and thought, why not try it? Well, they have worked great. They are actually so overpowering that it is distracting to me. I don&#x27;t particularly like the taste, but I am someone who does not like mint, peppermint, spearmint, gum, etc. I think if you like those flavors, you will like this taste. I saw there is a cinnamon, but since I&#x27;m replacing a menthol cigarette addiction, I think this is helping me just fine. I even &#x27;inhale&#x27; on the tooth pick sometimes. Hah, I know it&#x27;s crazy, but it works.</li>
            <li> So I got these in September and I chew them on a regular basis, let me just say this: They are fantastic! I am an avid chewer of things, it gives me something to focus on when I&#x27;m bored out of my skull. I used to chew on paper or regular toothpicks for the most part, sometimes I&#x27;d just chew plain gum or go and get some candy. Well these eliminate that for me. And I feel like my breath is fresher and my mouth just feels pleasantly clean all the time. I&#x27;ve noticed none of the nausea that another reviewer mentioned, and the amount of tea tree in these is negligible at best unless you&#x27;re very sensitive to the effects. The birchwood is soft enough so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth if I&#x27;m gnawing it to mush, something I couldn&#x27;t do with pen caps or chewing gum. I just love these sticks. I think my next purchase will be the cinnamon ones, though I did see a reviewer saying that they are a bit strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Tast great and not overwhelming. Love the milled end as well. I definitely recommend these to anyone who likes flavored toothpicks.</li>
            <li> These little flavored toothpicks are wonderful! Not only are they tasty and refreshing, but they clean your teeth and also fill a void. When I say they &amp;#34;filled a void,&amp;#34; what I mean is that they satisfied my smoking-induced oral-fixation. Ultimately, they helped me to quit smoking entirely. Great price on a fabulous product! Very pleased non-smoker.</li>
            <li> Like I said in the title, the taste is very very good, but it lasts for a very short time.</li>
            <li> Strong for anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried them yet. So, you&#x27;ll get used to them. They look cool. Good for those who need to quit smoking. Also might good for your teeth. Pretty sure they help your breath too. Lasted me forever as well. Worth it.</li>
            <li> i chew toothpicks and gum alot, thought this might kill two birds with one stone but the taste is unbearable!</li>
            <li> Just fantastic little toothpicks. Taste great, not a bad habit, keeps your breath fresh. Only caution is that the cinnamon ones can be a little spicy for those who&#x27;ve never had them before, but they grow on you for sure.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my bf who was trying to find a replacement for chewing gum. He loved them. He liked the minty taste and the durability of the toothpick.</li>
            <li> These babys come in handy when I get the urge to smoke or eat anything that I should not.  They have really helped with my smoking cessation.</li>
            <li> These toothpicks are pretty unique, originally ordered them to help curb smoking, (that lasted for about a week) but found that sticking a  small, thin,(minty) stick in my mouth just didn&#x27;t cut it for me to help curb the urge to smoke, so now - they are just premium minty flavored toothpicks.</li>
            <li> These are great! Read about the benefits of tea tree oil toothpicks as I was having tooth pain and had to see for myself. Your mouth will thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these sticks as an aid to quit smoking for good this time. I must say, the taste is really refreshing, though quite strong. Chewing on these sticks makes me think of myself as a crying baby sucking on a pacifier. It helps curve cravings and I made it to and from work yesterday and today without smoking but instead just chewing on these sticks. I like them a lot. Highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> I got these as a toothbrush replacement because I&#x27;m on a primal diet and currently have braces. I expected STICKS, NOT toothpicks. The product is labelled as chewing sticks, that&#x27;s misleading in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product 5 stars for taste and quality but because I was mislead and ended up buying toothpicks instead of real sticks, I&#x27;m giving it a 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chewed into a tiny brush they do clean the plague off the gum line real well and give a refreshing taste that lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> These are high quality tooth picks with tea tree flavor, what else do u want? Your friends will probably hate you if you offer them one, mine did.</li>
    </ol>
