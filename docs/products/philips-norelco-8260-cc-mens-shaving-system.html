    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have used the Norelco razors for about 35 years and am very happy with their products.</li>
            <li>The Norelco 8260 CC is the best razor I have used as of this date.  </li>
            <li>Both were very happy to receive them.</li>
            <li>Not the best razor in the world, but does what you expect it would do for the money.  </li>
            <li>Best shaving razor they have made yet, like the ease of maintenance and the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Phillips Norelco best ever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric reazors for over 30 years and this has got to be one of the best I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Great customer service!</li>
            <li>AN EXCELLENT SHAVE WITHOUT ANY IRRITATION</li>
            <li>, get the Philips Norelco 734XL which shaves better than the 8260CC or the Arcitec!!!</li>
            <li>The battery life between charges is very good.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve heard the battery life is very good, the switch idea would have been what Norelco SHOULD have done...particularly for $150.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this one for a month and am happy with it.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is great.</li>
            <li>A charging stand would greatly increase the convenience of this shaver.</li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle is great.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy with the Norelco.</li>
            <li>The shaver does a great job of shaving my neck without razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for decades with great results.  </li>
            <li>Razor still gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>Good Shaving-Michael</li>
            <li>It also has a good led system to keep you advised on what your battery level is.    </li>
            <li>The razor does a good job</li>
            <li>Cleaning solution bowl works good and santitizes the unit.</li>
            <li>If the shave weren&#x27;t so darn good, I&#x27;d give it a 2 star because I don&#x27;t like the idea of having to plug and unplug this thing all the time.   </li>
            <li>Good deal    </li>
            <li>Why is this loser still sold, the good models seem to go out of production/stock rapidly?</li>
            <li>I AM A VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER.</li>
            <li>I looked at the reviews for the Brauns and although they mostly looked good, I decided that I would stick with the rotary head razor.  </li>
            <li>: I had hoped that the four blades of the Panasonic ES8243A just might be able to give a superior shave.</li>
            <li>It is truly an astounding design oversight.  </li>
            <li>This may seem trivial,but it is nice to shave in peace.   </li>
            <li>When we bought a winter home in Florida I purchased this model because it looked like the others I own.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco cleaning system is kind of goofy, though.</li>
            <li>-- update - still nice shaver that I gave to my wife, better than a newer model that has the separated heads that supposedly provide for closer shave than this type.</li>
            <li>Ultimately I am very impressed and surprised at the shave I get from the Norelco 8260 Rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>My favorite was the Speed XL with cleaner.</li>
            <li>Nice razor burn free shave on face and neck but not so close of a shave on the head.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the charging (or relative lack of) of the unit.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace another Norelco shaver I&#x27;d been using for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I suppose this is proof that shavers cannot \\&quot;lift\\&quot; hairs to cut better.</li>
            <li>I used this rotary-type of shaver for many years during the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I am in agreement with many reviewers that did not like the cleaning stand for this razor.  </li>
            <li>This should give a much better battery life and ultimately more shaves between charges.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I went with the Norelco 8260.</li>
            <li>It does get most of their hairs but not all.  </li>
            <li>Neither of the 2 foil razors EVER shaved my neck sufficiently, but the Norelco 8260 does an outstanding job there.</li>
            <li>Is it really better than rinsing the head and spraying it with lube?</li>
            <li>Put the Remington blades and cutter (keeping the center blade of the Panasonic) on a Panasonic 13,000 RPM shaver and you would have the World&#x27;s best electric shaver.</li>
            <li>and they are easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>The shave itself is very close--by far the best I&#x27;ve had with any electric</li>
            <li>There is, however, a huge cleaning system--but the cleaning system doesn&#x27;t do anything for charging and requires juggling the wires around.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and it has great battery life.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It does it smoothly and with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably be perfectly happy with the shaver if it had come that way; the extra stuff just seems wasteful.</li>
            <li>I have not dumped the solution yet, but if it&#x27;s full of stubble, I might consider straining the stubble with a fine screen and reusing; depending on how it looks.</li>
            <li>Sanitization is probably better with hot water anyway.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean anything in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I still had to manually clean the unit and the liquid that this thing uses gums up the crud that&#x27;s already there.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable,  give a good shave and seem to last forever.  </li>
            <li>I have used norelco shavers for many years and they are long lasting and the best.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that Norelco should have either figured a way to allow me to leave the shaver in the cradle plugged in full time without damaging the batteries, or there should be a charging switch on that cradle.</li>
            <li>This shaver is superior to both of my prior shavers,and here&#x27;s why:   </li>
            <li>I do think the cleaning equipment is good but really not necessary.</li>
            <li>A quick rinse under a faucet is sufficient to clean the razor.    </li>
            <li>This new razor is lighter weight, very smooth, and I like the clean jet system.  </li>
            <li>The heads have been improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li>It made quick work of my unruly beard.  </li>
            <li>Decided it was time to make it the back-up and purchase a new more efficient one.</li>
            <li>The shaver shaves great, just like my previous Norelco&#x27;s -- no problem with its prime mission.    </li>
            <li>It takes about 10 minutes (no shaver will give you a first-pass close shave) to get to that good dry shave (with or without pre-electric gels/oils) and you do have to put pressure on to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund - what a coincidence!</li>
            <li>It may have been because my old Panasonic was over 10 years old with the original head, but the 8260 CC was a pleasant surprise when I first put it to my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep the shaver but will probably never get around to using the liquid cleaner unless I inherit or win enough money to get a bigger house with a huge sink counter.</li>
            <li>This is of much lower quality than the others, the shave is not  as comfortable or as close.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Shaving system is a good gift for busy young men.</li>
            <li>The price was right also.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really care about the jet clean.  </li>
            <li>I have only had the Philips Norelco 8260 CC razor for a month and am generally happy with it and its low battery indicator.</li>
            <li>I have owned 2 other Norelco XLs and have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>My order was shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>but I liked my old Norelco 8880XL shaver that had a height adjustment and hope that this one will last for many years like the old one.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that it was much better than my current Norelco.  </li>
            <li>The Braun would get so hot that I would have to take a break every minute or so.</li>
            <li>Just ordered a replacement after short period of ownership: another model with hopefully better battery life.</li>
            <li>He is well pleased as I am with the earlier model.</li>
            <li>MY FIRST ELECTRIC SHAVER WAS A NORELCO SC 7960, A TWO HEADED SPEED SHAVER, WHICH I STILL</li>
            <li>THEN USED A MODEL 805, PURCHASED IN 1992, WHICH WAS MY FIRST RECHARGEABLE TRIPLE HEADED</li>
            <li>The picture on Amazon shows the shaver in a cute little stand; the reality is that it comes with a huge cleaning stand that I have no room for.  </li>
            <li>The flat design of the foil is a better design than the \\&quot;Arc</li>
            <li>In fact, I think that the fourth blade in the middle actually interferes with a better shave and these two middle blades are not as good as the primary cutters.</li>
            <li>Additionally, these new Panasonic \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; shavers have the foil curving AWAY from your face at the ends of the foil, further decreasing exposure to the blades and requiring many more passes to cover the same area.</li>
            <li>wallah.. done, easy enough.    </li>
            <li>As it turns out, the large four-blade surface is like trying to keep the end of a 2x4 on your face.</li>
            <li>It also has a large tank that holds a liquid cleaner that you submerge the razor into</li>
            <li>In the cleaning cycle it charges and I certainly can&#x27;t wait around to unplug (or flip a lever that disconnects the power to the shaver)</li>
            <li>It takes up too much counter-top space to keep out all the time.  </li>
            <li>This 3-blade shaver gives a very close shave, with some work.</li>
            <li>As a result, closeness of the shave is better and time spent is shorter.</li>
            <li>It does have a much wider trimmer and longer battery life between charges, though.    </li>
            <li>This 8260 Shaver cuts very close with no pulls.</li>
            <li>3.The build quality of of the Norelco and Braun are very solid, but the Panasonic seems cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>( it is very well-made and</li>
            <li>Norelco customer service was very polite, and will replace it for me -- in 7 to 14 days --</li>
            <li>CLOSE SHAVE.YOUR RAZORS HAVE AGED WELL WITH QUALITY AND THERE ISN&#x27;T A BETTER SHAVER ON THE MARKET.I</li>
            <li>Panasonic discussion: Panasonic had developed an outstanding shaver line some ten years ago.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco shaver that I&#x27;d been using for many years, and that finally broke.  </li>
            <li>I had an older Norelco which was fine, except the battery was starting to go.  </li>
            <li>First thing, this shaver is super quiet.</li>
            <li>The shave is clean and comfortable with the battery charge lasting longer than those used in my prior shavers.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t get hot like my old Braun.</li>
            <li>Overall not a bad shaver.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised at what a nice shave it is, although it takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>In addition to a high quality razor, I bought this model for the recharging stand that is shown in the picture of the product.  </li>
            <li>The ten year old 6885XL, with dull blades provided a quicker and more satisfying shave that the new 8260s.    </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m going to do the same as the other reader who rinses in hot water most of the time, but every so often uses the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>So I clean my razor daily by running it under hot water after each use and only use the cleaning system when the battery needs charged.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic trimmers are so narrow, on all of these models, that you will not be able to trim sideburns with one attempt.</li>
            <li>I would have liked an LCD for the remaining charge as in my old razor, but not worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>Purchased the new Phillips Norelco 8260 cc men&#x27;s shaving system.  </li>
            <li>, SINCE I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.I JUST PURCHASED THE NORELCO 8260</li>
            <li>This one wants me to clean it every day with the little brush.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is ligth, noiseless and sharp  but the JET CLEAN SYSTEM IS BULKY AND IMPRACTICAL.</li>
            <li>My old ES8067 still shaves closer than this new \\&quot;NANO Technology\\&quot;- a misnomer (marketing gimmick).</li>
            <li>I run the cleaner when the battery needs charging, just like I did my Speed XL and expect it&#x27;ll last for a very long time with it&#x27;s original blades.</li>
            <li>The made in China models are clearly inferior to the originals</li>
            <li>This is, however, the loudest (and it is loud) of all shavers and there are no bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>It is an old saying and still carries weight.</li>
            <li>2.The 8260 shaver truly shaves in one or two passes, and is completely non-irritating from the get-go.</li>
            <li>I know they say a foil shaver shaves closer, but the Norelco far out-performs these 2 foils.   </li>
            <li>AND WOW.</li>
            <li>Based upon other reviewers, I was expecting it to sound like a lawn mower, but it is just an occasional buzzing noise as it cleans.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how important this is; my old one lasted very well with just a weekly \\&quot;dry clean\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is great, it last me at least a week shaving everyday.</li>
            <li>Another future problem with the 4-blade system is that you&#x27;ll want to buy a new shaver when your blades and foil need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I might also do what the other reviewer did and rinse with hot water before putting in the cleaning solution to reduce the gunk.   </li>
            <li>I wanted a new shaver since my Braun&#x27;s self clean system was broken and it needed a new foil.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8109S 3-blade - barely.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic was annoyingly loud, the Braun was quite noisy, but the 8260 is very quiet.</li>
            <li>I have been using an 8160 (earlier model) for a year and gave this one to my 18 year old grandson.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is sort of useless, unless you prefer not to clean your razor with hot water.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system actually cleans it very well; the problem as pointed out by other reviewers is that you are not supposed to leave the shaver charging.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, the shaver works as well as the old one, and you can just ignore the cleaning stand if you want, since the recharger can plug directly into the shaver.  </li>
            <li>It provides a very close shave with little to no irritation and stays charged much longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>What kind of an idiot is going to spend 80% of the cost of a new shaver just to get a set of new cutter blades and foil?</li>
            <li>in that it ran at what seemed like half to two-thirds the rpm of my old 6885XL, and provided an extremely unsatisfactory shave-even after shaving until the blades were hot on my face.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning fixture takes a very long time to complete the process and cannot be left plugged in without potential damage to the razor batteries.  </li>
            <li>Remington has the ideal blades (that Panasonic used to make) and it shows in closer cutting and less time spent doing so.</li>

            <li> Put the Remington blades and cutter (keeping the center blade of the Panasonic) on a Panasonic 13,000 RPM shaver and you would have the World&#x27;s best electric shaver.</li>
            <li> and they are easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> The shave itself is very close--by far the best I&#x27;ve had with any electric</li>
            <li> There is, however, a huge cleaning system--but the cleaning system doesn&#x27;t do anything for charging and requires juggling the wires around.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and it has great battery life.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It does it smoothly and with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably be perfectly happy with the shaver if it had come that way; the extra stuff just seems wasteful.</li>
            <li> I have not dumped the solution yet, but if it&#x27;s full of stubble, I might consider straining the stubble with a fine screen and reusing; depending on how it looks.</li>
            <li> Sanitization is probably better with hot water anyway.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean anything in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I still had to manually clean the unit and the liquid that this thing uses gums up the crud that&#x27;s already there.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable,  give a good shave and seem to last forever.  </li>
            <li> I have used norelco shavers for many years and they are long lasting and the best.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that Norelco should have either figured a way to allow me to leave the shaver in the cradle plugged in full time without damaging the batteries, or there should be a charging switch on that cradle.</li>
            <li> This shaver is superior to both of my prior shavers,and here&#x27;s why:   </li>
            <li> I do think the cleaning equipment is good but really not necessary.</li>
            <li> A quick rinse under a faucet is sufficient to clean the razor.    </li>
            <li> This new razor is lighter weight, very smooth, and I like the clean jet system.  </li>
            <li> The heads have been improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li> It made quick work of my unruly beard.  </li>
            <li> Decided it was time to make it the back-up and purchase a new more efficient one.</li>
            <li> The shaver shaves great, just like my previous Norelco&#x27;s -- no problem with its prime mission.    </li>
            <li> It takes about 10 minutes (no shaver will give you a first-pass close shave) to get to that good dry shave (with or without pre-electric gels/oils) and you do have to put pressure on to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund - what a coincidence!</li>
            <li> It may have been because my old Panasonic was over 10 years old with the original head, but the 8260 CC was a pleasant surprise when I first put it to my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep the shaver but will probably never get around to using the liquid cleaner unless I inherit or win enough money to get a bigger house with a huge sink counter.</li>
            <li> This is of much lower quality than the others, the shave is not  as comfortable or as close.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Shaving system is a good gift for busy young men.</li>
            <li> The price was right also.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really care about the jet clean.  </li>
            <li> I have only had the Philips Norelco 8260 CC razor for a month and am generally happy with it and its low battery indicator.</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 other Norelco XLs and have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> My order was shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> but I liked my old Norelco 8880XL shaver that had a height adjustment and hope that this one will last for many years like the old one.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that it was much better than my current Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The Braun would get so hot that I would have to take a break every minute or so.</li>
            <li> Just ordered a replacement after short period of ownership: another model with hopefully better battery life.</li>
            <li> He is well pleased as I am with the earlier model.</li>
            <li> MY FIRST ELECTRIC SHAVER WAS A NORELCO SC 7960, A TWO HEADED SPEED SHAVER, WHICH I STILL</li>
            <li> THEN USED A MODEL 805, PURCHASED IN 1992, WHICH WAS MY FIRST RECHARGEABLE TRIPLE HEADED</li>
            <li> The picture on Amazon shows the shaver in a cute little stand; the reality is that it comes with a huge cleaning stand that I have no room for.  </li>
            <li> The flat design of the foil is a better design than the \\&quot;Arc</li>
            <li> In fact, I think that the fourth blade in the middle actually interferes with a better shave and these two middle blades are not as good as the primary cutters.</li>
            <li> Additionally, these new Panasonic \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; shavers have the foil curving AWAY from your face at the ends of the foil, further decreasing exposure to the blades and requiring many more passes to cover the same area.</li>
            <li> wallah.. done, easy enough.    </li>
            <li> As it turns out, the large four-blade surface is like trying to keep the end of a 2x4 on your face.</li>
            <li> It also has a large tank that holds a liquid cleaner that you submerge the razor into</li>
            <li> In the cleaning cycle it charges and I certainly can&#x27;t wait around to unplug (or flip a lever that disconnects the power to the shaver)</li>
            <li> It takes up too much counter-top space to keep out all the time.  </li>
            <li> This 3-blade shaver gives a very close shave, with some work.</li>
            <li> As a result, closeness of the shave is better and time spent is shorter.</li>
            <li> It does have a much wider trimmer and longer battery life between charges, though.    </li>
            <li> This 8260 Shaver cuts very close with no pulls.</li>
            <li> 3.The build quality of of the Norelco and Braun are very solid, but the Panasonic seems cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> ( it is very well-made and</li>
            <li> Norelco customer service was very polite, and will replace it for me -- in 7 to 14 days --</li>
            <li> CLOSE SHAVE.YOUR RAZORS HAVE AGED WELL WITH QUALITY AND THERE ISN&#x27;T A BETTER SHAVER ON THE MARKET.I</li>
            <li> Panasonic discussion: Panasonic had developed an outstanding shaver line some ten years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco shaver that I&#x27;d been using for many years, and that finally broke.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Norelco which was fine, except the battery was starting to go.  </li>
            <li> First thing, this shaver is super quiet.</li>
            <li> The shave is clean and comfortable with the battery charge lasting longer than those used in my prior shavers.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t get hot like my old Braun.</li>
            <li> Overall not a bad shaver.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised at what a nice shave it is, although it takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> In addition to a high quality razor, I bought this model for the recharging stand that is shown in the picture of the product.  </li>
            <li> The ten year old 6885XL, with dull blades provided a quicker and more satisfying shave that the new 8260s.    </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m going to do the same as the other reader who rinses in hot water most of the time, but every so often uses the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> So I clean my razor daily by running it under hot water after each use and only use the cleaning system when the battery needs charged.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic trimmers are so narrow, on all of these models, that you will not be able to trim sideburns with one attempt.</li>
            <li> I would have liked an LCD for the remaining charge as in my old razor, but not worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> Purchased the new Phillips Norelco 8260 cc men&#x27;s shaving system.  </li>
            <li> , SINCE I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.I JUST PURCHASED THE NORELCO 8260</li>
            <li> This one wants me to clean it every day with the little brush.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is ligth, noiseless and sharp  but the JET CLEAN SYSTEM IS BULKY AND IMPRACTICAL.</li>
            <li> My old ES8067 still shaves closer than this new \\&quot;NANO Technology\\&quot;- a misnomer (marketing gimmick).</li>
            <li> I run the cleaner when the battery needs charging, just like I did my Speed XL and expect it&#x27;ll last for a very long time with it&#x27;s original blades.</li>
            <li> The made in China models are clearly inferior to the originals</li>
            <li> This is, however, the loudest (and it is loud) of all shavers and there are no bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> It is an old saying and still carries weight.</li>
            <li> 2.The 8260 shaver truly shaves in one or two passes, and is completely non-irritating from the get-go.</li>
            <li> I know they say a foil shaver shaves closer, but the Norelco far out-performs these 2 foils.   </li>
            <li> AND WOW.</li>
            <li> Based upon other reviewers, I was expecting it to sound like a lawn mower, but it is just an occasional buzzing noise as it cleans.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how important this is; my old one lasted very well with just a weekly \\&quot;dry clean\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is great, it last me at least a week shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> Another future problem with the 4-blade system is that you&#x27;ll want to buy a new shaver when your blades and foil need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I might also do what the other reviewer did and rinse with hot water before putting in the cleaning solution to reduce the gunk.   </li>
            <li> I wanted a new shaver since my Braun&#x27;s self clean system was broken and it needed a new foil.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8109S 3-blade - barely.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic was annoyingly loud, the Braun was quite noisy, but the 8260 is very quiet.</li>
            <li> I have been using an 8160 (earlier model) for a year and gave this one to my 18 year old grandson.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is sort of useless, unless you prefer not to clean your razor with hot water.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system actually cleans it very well; the problem as pointed out by other reviewers is that you are not supposed to leave the shaver charging.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, the shaver works as well as the old one, and you can just ignore the cleaning stand if you want, since the recharger can plug directly into the shaver.  </li>
            <li> It provides a very close shave with little to no irritation and stays charged much longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> What kind of an idiot is going to spend 80% of the cost of a new shaver just to get a set of new cutter blades and foil?</li>
            <li> in that it ran at what seemed like half to two-thirds the rpm of my old 6885XL, and provided an extremely unsatisfactory shave-even after shaving until the blades were hot on my face.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning fixture takes a very long time to complete the process and cannot be left plugged in without potential damage to the razor batteries.  </li>
            <li> Remington has the ideal blades (that Panasonic used to make) and it shows in closer cutting and less time spent doing so.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased foils due to hearing they shave closer, but I can state clearly that that is not the casewith me.</li>
            <li> At least Norelco offersthe ability to rinse with hot water.</li>
            <li> The models here are no better than any of the other higher quality shavers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I am finding, however, that the razor does not shave as closely as I would otherwise wish and that the charge does not hold as long as I would otherwise expect.</li>
            <li> First, the shave is about the same in my opinion, 2nd, the battery on this one lasts a lot longer than the slim unit with separate heads, 3rd - the cleaning catty that this comes with is an expensive joke.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle is long ~ 1 hour or so.  </li>
            <li> I have returned the replacement 8260 for a refund and will keep buying blades for the 6885XL for as long as it lasts.    </li>
            <li> Even though the blades are not dull, I have to throw them out because I can&#x27;t get the stubble from between the multiple blades even by running both hot and cold water at max pressure.   </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to try new things</li>
            <li> I did not rate it 5 stars though for one of the same reason other reviewers did not</li>
            <li> It is like the two items, the shaver and the cleaner were designed by two different teams that didn&#x27;t talk to each other.  </li>
            <li> It lasts like 2 weeks , and the other two only stay charged for a week   </li>
            <li> One trick, when the shaver is in the drying mode you can flip the lever up and it continues to dry but doesn&#x27;t  charge the battery.</li>
            <li> I prefer the simplicity of dry shaving.   </li>
            <li> The cleaner isn&#x27;t really necessary and it does take up lots of counter space, it consumes expensive cleaning agent, and takes a plug (a rare commodity in my bathroom).  </li>
            <li> The Remington MS2-390 has the blades that thePanasonics should have (and did have years ago): flat foil area (not \\&quot;Arc Foiled\\&quot;), good length (25% longer) and ultra thin cutting blades.</li>
            <li> just get a small glass or paper cup big enough to put the razor into...  </li>
            <li> This means more surface area on the newer blades and that means less cutting.</li>
            <li> The packaging is the old horrible packaging, with unopenable plastic over everything, not the new Amazon environmentally friendly packaging.    </li>
            <li> The Panasonic allows wet shaving in shower or with foam, but I tried it once with foam</li>
            <li> The other reviewers who warned that the cleaning stand that comes with this shaver were right - it&#x27;s useless and takes up space.</li>
            <li> I use the jetclean every other shave or so.</li>
            <li> The problem with blades these days is due to my lifestyle change; that is, I work from home now.</li>
            <li> Every other review complains about this...  </li>
            <li> The 8260 continues the tradition with an incremental improvement in the shave mainly due to the articulating head.  </li>
            <li> I just got the 8260 Norelco to replace my other 2 shavers(a Braun 8995 and a Panasonic Nano).</li>
            <li> The charge on the Norelco lasts WAAAYYYYYY longer that the other two shavers.</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 5 8995 tries hard (you can hear noticeable slowing when necessary pressure is applied, like a lawn mower when it reaches thicker grass), but it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as the Panasonics or Remington without leaving a stronger burning sensation after the shave.</li>
            <li> Additionally, because of the circular blades, it is somewhat difficult to target certain spots for cleanup.</li>
            <li> I would describe my beard as average.  </li>
            <li> I have an average beard and have been using electric shavers (foils and rotaries) over 30 years.</li>
            <li> This one was about double the price of that one, but I&#x27;m very disappointed to have to deal with the large \\&quot;cleaning system\\&quot; that came with the new shaver.  </li>
            <li> My last electric razor was the previous generation of this one and lasted 9 YEARS!!!  </li>
            <li> Odd</li>
            <li> Interesting thing is, the reason I purchased this shaver is because my previous Norelco, just a couple of months out of warranty so no support from Norelco -- failed -- the on / off switch failed and it could not be turned on.    </li>
            <li> and it was a mess.</li>
            <li> The Remington shaved a little closer than the Panasonic and provided a faster shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had over the years, this replaced an Aritek 3-D that I always hated.</li>
            <li> This increases the probability that you will get an uneven sideburn.    </li>
            <li> The longer beard stubble clogs up the blades in a few shaves.</li>
            <li> Turn the razor on and off a few times in the liquid and rinse afterwards....</li>
            <li> 4.They all come with cleaning stands, which are gimmicky junk,in my opinion,but the Norelco version is the nicest.</li>
            <li> The 8260 feels flimsy and poorly constructed, as compared to the solidly built 6885XL.      </li>
            <li> I think the reason is that Panasonic&#x27;s older models came with cutting blades with the individual blades having been about half the width of all of Panasonic&#x27;s newer cutting blades (including replacements).</li>
            <li> The replacement cleaning fluid is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is a version of the shaver without the cleaner.  </li>
            <li> However, after only 2 months of use, the on-off switch failed, and I cannot turn it on.  </li>
            <li> Having something this big is bad enough, but having to unplug it all the time is ridiculous.    </li>
            <li> It does give off a higher pitch &#x60;whine&#x27;, while shaving, that is somewhat annoying, but is not what I would consider noisy.</li>
            <li> It makes cutting in the areas where you don&#x27;t have a lot of skin area (chin, jaw line, upper lip, base of sideburns, etc) more difficult.</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t be hard to design the cleaner to not charge the shaver \\&quot;automagically\\&quot; except when the user wishes.  </li>
            <li> I also reuse the cleaning fluid because it does not get too dirty since I rinse the clippings out in running water before using the system.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for 5 months and each charge has lasted at least 30 days</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen of them over the years.  </li>
            <li> I have a VERY tough beard and very sensitive skin... bad combination.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother to WASTE your time or money on this razor!!!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic gets a little burny on the tough spots,and must be held at a specific angle to perform with it&#x27;s angled blade technology and that is very annoying.</li>
            <li> I give it four stars because it shaves well and subtract two stars for the stupid cleaner design but add one back for the travel power off system that locks the power button</li>
            <li> After 1 year the base unit seems to have lost the ability to sense the level of cleaning soulution and the cleaning is not performed because the unit thinks the solution level is low when it is at the correct level.</li>
            <li> However, the difficulty in cleaning, noise and lack of a charging base tipped me to the Panasonic as the final choice.    </li>
            <li> All in all: the ES8243A 4-blade is a poor value.    </li>
            <li> Remington did a poor job with the details.    </li>
            <li> It seems the electric shaving folk want to get into the razor/razor blades game, by selling cleaning solution for the shavers.  </li>
            <li> and I do not know how much longer I will use this one before I get disgusted and just throw it away.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this shaver has an under-powered motor and the floating head that cannot be locked.    </li>
            <li> I like how the cleaning cradle works though, but I agree with others that it&#x27;s too expensive to purchase that cleaning solution at the rate they require.</li>
            <li> been shaving with a Phillips Norelco for years ever since I started to shave, my last electric was purchased from the base exchange in Germany in 1984, unit still working today!  </li>
            <li> Something is wrong in Denmark.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> The replacement failed, as well, to provide a satisfactory shave.  </li>
            <li> I consider the cleaning system provided with the 8260 to be a needless feature.  </li>
            <li> When I let it grow it looks like a weather map of a bad hurricane season in the Caribbean.  </li>
            <li> I just wish Norelco would get rid of the stupid cleaning base and drop the price accordingly.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the 8260</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that, after tearing through in the insane packaging, there is no charging stand.  </li>
            <li> In addition to the cleaning stand being bulky, a terrible design decision is that you can&#x27;t leave the shaver plugged into it, because it will harm battery life.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had over the years, this replaced an Aritek 3-D that I always hated. My favorite was the Speed XL with cleaner. I simply wore the battery out on that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the replacement for that and it&#x27;s great. I run the cleaner when the battery needs charging, just like I did my Speed XL and expect it&#x27;ll last for a very long time with it&#x27;s original blades. The cleaner lubes the blades and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s there. Simple cleaning can be done at any sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Nice razor burn free shave on face and neck but not so close of a shave on the head. Overall not a bad shaver.  After 1 year the base unit seems to have lost the ability to sense the level of cleaning soulution and the cleaning is not performed because the unit thinks the solution level is low when it is at the correct level. Razor still gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 other Norelco XLs and have been very satisfied.  I bought this one because I thought it was time for a change after about 7-8 years.  I looked at the reviews for the Brauns and although they mostly looked good, I decided that I would stick with the rotary head razor.  I was amazed that it was much better than my current Norelco.  The heads have been improved tremendously.  The razor is very quiet. I would have liked an LCD for the remaining charge as in my old razor, but not worth the extra money.  The cleaning system is not a deal maker.  It takes up too much counter-top space to keep out all the time.  You can&#x27;t leave it in the cleaning system to keep it charged.  The replacement cleaning fluid is too expensive.  My plan is to rinse the unit in the water weekly and use the cleaning system monthly.  I also reuse the cleaning fluid because it does not get too dirty since I rinse the clippings out in running water before using the system.  I am impressed with the charging (or relative lack of) of the unit.  I get over 2 weeks of daily shaves on a charge!  I can get a close shave in under 7 minutes.  I would describe my beard as average.  Overall, I would definitely by again.  Forget the foil cutters.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for a month and am happy with it. I didn&#x27;t need nor will I use all of the extras that came with it, perhaps others will. I have used the Norelco razors for about 35 years and am very happy with their products.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother to WASTE your time or money on this razor!!! or the Arcitec for that matter!!!, get the Philips Norelco 734XL which shaves better than the 8260CC or the Arcitec!!! The 7340XL is on sale at Walmart for $[...]. Please see my review of the 7340XL. Any questions, please contact me at doghousesipper8@yahoo.com Good Shaving-Michael</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace another Norelco shaver I&#x27;d been using for more than 10 years. The other reviewers who warned that the cleaning stand that comes with this shaver were right - it&#x27;s useless and takes up space. Do what I did and chuck it in the wastebasket.    The shaver itself is great. It&#x27;s quiet and it has great battery life. I have had it for 5 months and each charge has lasted at least 30 days and I use it daily. It also has a good led system to keep you advised on what your battery level is.    Overall, this is a great product. I just wish Norelco would get rid of the stupid cleaning base and drop the price accordingly. Then they&#x27;d have home run.</li>
            <li> The Winner Is...    The Panasonic ES8109S 3-blade - barely. Put the Remington blades and cutter (keeping the center blade of the Panasonic) on a Panasonic 13,000 RPM shaver and you would have the World&#x27;s best electric shaver. The Remington shaved a little closer than the Panasonic and provided a faster shave. However, the difficulty in cleaning, noise and lack of a charging base tipped me to the Panasonic as the final choice.    This is a review of three Panasonic models; ES8243A (4-blade), ES8109S (3-blade) and ES7109, the Remington MS2-390, the Norelco 8260 CC and the Braun Series 5 8995 (8985 &amp; 8975 only differ in displays and cleaning). I have an average beard and have been using electric shavers (foils and rotaries) over 30 years. The models here are no better than any of the other higher quality shavers I&#x27;ve owned. It takes about 10 minutes (no shaver will give you a first-pass close shave) to get to that good dry shave (with or without pre-electric gels/oils) and you do have to put pressure on to get a close shave. This means recharging every 4-5 days. Gels/oils do make the process easier - not faster - and I have reviewed six of them on their Amazon sites.    ES8109S: This 3-blade shaver gives a very close shave, with some work. It does give off a higher pitch &#x60;whine&#x27;, while shaving, that is somewhat annoying, but is not what I would consider noisy. Nor is the cleaning operation noisy. Based upon other reviewers, I was expecting it to sound like a lawn mower, but it is just an occasional buzzing noise as it cleans. The \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; design slows shaving (see discussion, below).    ES8243A: I had hoped that the four blades of the Panasonic ES8243A just might be able to give a superior shave. As it turns out, the large four-blade surface is like trying to keep the end of a 2x4 on your face. It makes cutting in the areas where you don&#x27;t have a lot of skin area (chin, jaw line, upper lip, base of sideburns, etc) more difficult. In fact, I think that the fourth blade in the middle actually interferes with a better shave and these two middle blades are not as good as the primary cutters. The \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; design makes it even slower (see discussion, below). Another future problem with the 4-blade system is that you&#x27;ll want to buy a new shaver when your blades and foil need to be replaced. What kind of an idiot is going to spend 80% of the cost of a new shaver just to get a set of new cutter blades and foil? All in all: the ES8243A 4-blade is a poor value.    ES7109S: The flat design of the foil is a better design than the \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; (see below). Unfortunately, this shaver has an under-powered motor and the floating head that cannot be locked.    Panasonic discussion: Panasonic had developed an outstanding shaver line some ten years ago. My old ES8067 still shaves closer than this new \\&quot;NANO Technology\\&quot;- a misnomer (marketing gimmick). I think the reason is that Panasonic&#x27;s older models came with cutting blades with the individual blades having been about half the width of all of Panasonic&#x27;s newer cutting blades (including replacements). This means more surface area on the newer blades and that means less cutting. Remington has the ideal blades (that Panasonic used to make) and it shows in closer cutting and less time spent doing so. Additionally, these new Panasonic \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; shavers have the foil curving AWAY from your face at the ends of the foil, further decreasing exposure to the blades and requiring many more passes to cover the same area. Unfortunately, Panasonic puts their better motor (13,000 RPMs) only on these ill-conceived \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; designs. Battery time on the Panasonics is the shortest of all shavers reviewed here. The Panasonic trimmers are so narrow, on all of these models, that you will not be able to trim sideburns with one attempt. You will have to re-position the trimmer to get what you missed. This increases the probability that you will get an uneven sideburn.    The Remington MS2-390 has the blades that thePanasonics should have (and did have years ago): flat foil area (not \\&quot;Arc Foiled\\&quot;), good length (25% longer) and ultra thin cutting blades. As a result, closeness of the shave is better and time spent is shorter. This is, however, the loudest (and it is loud) of all shavers and there are no bells and whistles. Using a pre-shave oil/gel will gum up the blades, as with any shaver, but these blades pop off with even the slightest brushing so be prepared to watch them fall into the sink with every cleaning attempt. A charging stand would greatly increase the convenience of this shaver. Remington did a poor job with the details.    The Braun Series 5 8995 tries hard (you can hear noticeable slowing when necessary pressure is applied, like a lawn mower when it reaches thicker grass), but it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as the Panasonics or Remington without leaving a stronger burning sensation after the shave. The Braun can also leave burn marks and even cuts (nose and lips) that will bleed. Odd: you would think that, with it getting so close as to actually burn the skin, it would also give a closer shave. I suppose this is proof that shavers cannot \\&quot;lift\\&quot; hairs to cut better. Additionally, the design of the handle is inferior, making positioning more difficult. It does have a much wider trimmer and longer battery life between charges, though.    The Norelco 8260 CC: I used this rotary-type of shaver for many years during the 80&#x27;s. I switched to foil and found I could get a closer shave. This is still the case. Additionally, because of the circular blades, it is somewhat difficult to target certain spots for cleanup. However, this is the quietest shaver.    PS: don&#x27;t accept the nonsense about giving your face 30 days to adjust, unless you are coming off a blade. If you are accustomed to an electric shaver, you only need a week or two to determine the difference. The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund - what a coincidence!</li>
            <li> The Norelco 8260 CC is the best razor I have used as of this date.  I have been using electric razors for about 36 years with the majority of those razors being the Norelco brand.  The shave is clean and comfortable with the battery charge lasting longer than those used in my prior shavers.  Because of the length of time I use to shave, charges usually last about 5 days, whereas the charge on this razor lasts about 9 days.  The cleaning system is sort of useless, unless you prefer not to clean your razor with hot water.  Sanitization is probably better with hot water anyway.  You get what you pay for.  It is an old saying and still carries weight.</li>
            <li> I have only had the Philips Norelco 8260 CC razor for a month and am generally happy with it and its low battery indicator. I am finding, however, that the razor does not shave as closely as I would otherwise wish and that the charge does not hold as long as I would otherwise expect.</li>
            <li> I like this razor.  I had an older Norelco which was fine, except the battery was starting to go.  This new razor is lighter weight, very smooth, and I like the clean jet system.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My order was shipped very fast. The shaver works well. The cleaning cycle is great. The battery life between charges is very good. I would recommend this shaver to others.</li>
            <li> I am in agreement with many reviewers that did not like the cleaning stand for this razor.  However you do not have to use it since the razor can be charged without the cleaning stand. This should give a much better battery life and ultimately more shaves between charges.  The razor does a good job but I liked my old Norelco 8880XL shaver that had a height adjustment and hope that this one will last for many years like the old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun Shaver since I was 18. I&#x27;m 34 now. I wanted a new shaver since my Braun&#x27;s self clean system was broken and it needed a new foil. I usually don&#x27;t like to try new things but I decided to try a rotary shaver. After reading many reviews I went with the Norelco 8260. First thing, this shaver is super quiet. It shaves close but not quite as close as a foil. But there is no discomfort and it doesn&#x27;t get hot like my old Braun. The Braun would get so hot that I would have to take a break every minute or so. My shaving technique has changed too. I don&#x27;t need to stretch my skin to shave anymore. I just use a preshave lotion and go against the grain.   The Norelco cleaning system is kind of goofy, though. I got the shaver on sale at Sears for a 100 bucks so I didn&#x27;t really care about the jet clean.  You can just rinse it under water so the cleaning system isn&#x27;t needed. I use the jetclean every other shave or so. One trick, when the shaver is in the drying mode you can flip the lever up and it continues to dry but doesn&#x27;t  charge the battery. This way you don&#x27;t charge the shaver until you need to. The cleaning mode is only about 5 minutes but the drying goes on for hours.   So I&#x27;m happy with the Norelco. I just hope it lasts for 10 years like my Braun.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a great job of shaving my neck without razor burn.  But so did my last shaver that costs a third of this one.  This one wants me to clean it every day with the little brush.  That will never happen.  I cleaned my last one every Saturday.  It also has a large tank that holds a liquid cleaner that you submerge the razor into but it is so big I don&#x27;t have room on the sink counter for it to sit on and still be plugged into a socket.      I would have returned it in the three week trial period but we were traveling and time ran out.  I&#x27;ll keep the shaver but will probably never get around to using the liquid cleaner unless I inherit or win enough money to get a bigger house with a huge sink counter.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaced an earlier version I bought. This 8260 Shaver cuts very close with no pulls. The battery life is great, it last me at least a week shaving everyday. Cleaning solution bowl works good and santitizes the unit. I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a close,clean shave. The price was right also.</li>
            <li> -- update - still nice shaver that I gave to my wife, better than a newer model that has the separated heads that supposedly provide for closer shave than this type. First, the shave is about the same in my opinion, 2nd, the battery on this one lasts a lot longer than the slim unit with separate heads, 3rd - the cleaning catty that this comes with is an expensive joke. It doesn&#x27;t clean anything in my opinion. I still had to manually clean the unit and the liquid that this thing uses gums up the crud that&#x27;s already there. Just buy the shaver only. ------- I&#x27;ve been a blade guy all my life til now. The problem with blades these days is due to my lifestyle change; that is, I work from home now. So, consequently I don&#x27;t shave every day. I shave when I need to be presentable, but if I&#x27;m going to home depot or something, I don&#x27;t bother. But, that has created a big problem for me with the multi-blade manual shavers. The longer beard stubble clogs up the blades in a few shaves. Even though the blades are not dull, I have to throw them out because I can&#x27;t get the stubble from between the multiple blades even by running both hot and cold water at max pressure.   So without even looking at reviews (which is not like me), I went to Walmart and bought the Norelco 8260XLOCC. I was really surprised at what a nice shave it is, although it takes a little getting used to. I did not rate it 5 stars though for one of the same reason other reviewers did not; that is that it cannot be stored continuously in the cleaning holder plugged in. If the shave weren&#x27;t so darn good, I&#x27;d give it a 2 star because I don&#x27;t like the idea of having to plug and unplug this thing all the time.   I like how the cleaning cradle works though, but I agree with others that it&#x27;s too expensive to purchase that cleaning solution at the rate they require. So, I&#x27;m going to do the same as the other reader who rinses in hot water most of the time, but every so often uses the cleaning solution. At least Norelco offersthe ability to rinse with hot water. I have not dumped the solution yet, but if it&#x27;s full of stubble, I might consider straining the stubble with a fine screen and reusing; depending on how it looks. I might also do what the other reviewer did and rinse with hot water before putting in the cleaning solution to reduce the gunk.   I&#x27;ve only owned the shaver for six days, so I can&#x27;t comment on the battery life or long-term reliability.   Bottom line is that Norelco should have either figured a way to allow me to leave the shaver in the cradle plugged in full time without damaging the batteries, or there should be a charging switch on that cradle. Since I&#x27;ve heard the battery life is very good, the switch idea would have been what Norelco SHOULD have done...particularly for $150. I wish that were so.</li>
            <li> The Philips Shaving systems were gifts for two nephews.  Both were very happy to receive them. The Philips Shaving system is a good gift for busy young men. As it is a gift that will be used every day for years to come</li>
            <li> I have a VERY tough beard and very sensitive skin... bad combination.  It does get most of their hairs but not all.  It does it smoothly and with no irritation.  Runs well.  You do NOT need to do all this mumbo jumbo that the users guide says to in terms of cleaning it.  Every other review complains about this...  just get a small glass or paper cup big enough to put the razor into...  add some of the cleaning liquid (enough to cover the razors) and dunk a couple of times.  Turn the razor on and off a few times in the liquid and rinse afterwards.... wallah.. done, easy enough.    Not the best razor in the world, but does what you expect it would do for the money.  Good deal    P.S. My last electric razor was the previous generation of this one and lasted 9 YEARS!!!  NO joke.</li>
            <li> been shaving with a Phillips Norelco for years ever since I started to shave, my last electric was purchased from the base exchange in Germany in 1984, unit still working today!  Decided it was time to make it the back-up and purchase a new more efficient one. Purchased the new Phillips Norelco 8260 cc men&#x27;s shaving system.  Best shaving razor they have made yet, like the ease of maintenance and the cleaning system. Hope this one will last and perform like the last one. Phillips Norelco best ever!</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco Shavers for over 20 years.  I like the way they shave, I like how quiet they are and they are easy to maintain.  The 8260 continues the tradition with an incremental improvement in the shave mainly due to the articulating head.  Having said that, Norelco should either stop adding \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; as peripherals or pay attention their details like they do the shaver.  The cleaning system actually cleans it very well; the problem as pointed out by other reviewers is that you are not supposed to leave the shaver charging.  You are supposed to let it run low and then recharge to save the battery.  Guess what?  The cleaning cycle is long ~ 1 hour or so.  In the cleaning cycle it charges and I certainly can&#x27;t wait around to unplug (or flip a lever that disconnects the power to the shaver) it after the cleaning cycle.  It couldn&#x27;t be hard to design the cleaner to not charge the shaver \\&quot;automagically\\&quot; except when the user wishes.  It is like the two items, the shaver and the cleaner were designed by two different teams that didn&#x27;t talk to each other.  It is truly an astounding design oversight.  I&#x27;m not sure if there is a version of the shaver without the cleaner.  The cleaner isn&#x27;t really necessary and it does take up lots of counter space, it consumes expensive cleaning agent, and takes a plug (a rare commodity in my bathroom).  I give it four stars because it shaves well and subtract two stars for the stupid cleaner design but add one back for the travel power off system that locks the power button so it won&#x27;t turn on in your luggage.  I hope Philips reads these reviews and takes note of them -- it boggles the mind that the design is so flawed from a company that does so many things so well.</li>
            <li> Just ordered a replacement after short period of ownership: another model with hopefully better battery life. And a cleaning system that works. Never could get it to stand-clean  when needed despite fill levels, charged/charging status, phase of moon, etc. Why is this loser still sold, the good models seem to go out of production/stock rapidly?</li>
            <li> I just got the 8260 Norelco to replace my other 2 shavers(a Braun 8995 and a Panasonic Nano). This shaver is superior to both of my prior shavers,and here&#x27;s why:   1.There is the noise issue.The Panasonic was annoyingly loud, the Braun was quite noisy, but the 8260 is very quiet.This may seem trivial,but it is nice to shave in peace.   2.The 8260 shaver truly shaves in one or two passes, and is completely non-irritating from the get-go. The Panasonic gets a little burny on the tough spots,and must be held at a specific angle to perform with it&#x27;s angled blade technology and that is very annoying. The Braun requires multiple passes everywhere.Neither of the 2 foil razors EVER shaved my neck sufficiently, but the Norelco 8260 does an outstanding job there.I know they say a foil shaver shaves closer, but the Norelco far out-performs these 2 foils.   3.The build quality of of the Norelco and Braun are very solid, but the Panasonic seems cheap and flimsy.Also,replacement blades are cheaper on the Norelco,and you can&#x27;t even find Panasonic replacements anywhere, so you have to order them from their site.    4.They all come with cleaning stands, which are gimmicky junk,in my opinion,but the Norelco version is the nicest.I wouldn&#x27;t have bought any of these with the cleaning system,but these were either gifts or the same price with the claning stands. If I could save $40 or $50 bucks,I&#x27;d buy a model that didn&#x27;t come with the cleaner (Braun 8975 or Norelco 8240).    5. The Panasonic allows wet shaving in shower or with foam, but I tried it once with foam and it was a mess. I prefer the simplicity of dry shaving.   6. The charge on the Norelco lasts WAAAYYYYYY longer that the other two shavers. It lasts like 2 weeks , and the other two only stay charged for a week   Ultimately I am very impressed and surprised at the shave I get from the Norelco 8260 Rotary shaver. I have always purchased foils due to hearing they shave closer, but I can state clearly that that is not the casewith me. I would buy a Braun again( it is very well-made and reliable),but I would not buy a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric reazors for over 30 years and this has got to be one of the best I&#x27;ve owned.  It provides a very close shave with little to no irritation and stays charged much longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve owned.  The only drawback is if you use the cleaning system, it automatically charges the battery even when it doesn&#x27;t need to.  This cycles the battery and reduces battery life from what I&#x27;ve read.  So I clean my razor daily by running it under hot water after each use and only use the cleaning system when the battery needs charged.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco shaver that I&#x27;d been using for many years, and that finally broke.  This one was about double the price of that one, but I&#x27;m very disappointed to have to deal with the large \\&quot;cleaning system\\&quot; that came with the new shaver.  The picture on Amazon shows the shaver in a cute little stand; the reality is that it comes with a huge cleaning stand that I have no room for.  It seems the electric shaving folk want to get into the razor/razor blades game, by selling cleaning solution for the shavers.  I&#x27;m not sure how important this is; my old one lasted very well with just a weekly \\&quot;dry clean\\&quot;.  It also seems environmentally unfriendly to be wasting some water every day, and throwing out a plastic bottle every month or so.    In addition to the cleaning stand being bulky, a terrible design decision is that you can&#x27;t leave the shaver plugged into it, because it will harm battery life.  Having something this big is bad enough, but having to unplug it all the time is ridiculous.    The packaging is the old horrible packaging, with unopenable plastic over everything, not the new Amazon environmentally friendly packaging.    On the other hand, the shaver works as well as the old one, and you can just ignore the cleaning stand if you want, since the recharger can plug directly into the shaver.  I&#x27;d probably be perfectly happy with the shaver if it had come that way; the extra stuff just seems wasteful.</li>
            <li> In addition to a high quality razor, I bought this model for the recharging stand that is shown in the picture of the product.  I was very disappointed that, after tearing through in the insane packaging, there is no charging stand.  There is, however, a huge cleaning system--but the cleaning system doesn&#x27;t do anything for charging and requires juggling the wires around.  Not something I want to do on a regular basis.  The shave itself is very close--by far the best I&#x27;ve had with any electric and I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen of them over the years.  So I&#x27;d recommend this or one of the similar models, but don&#x27;t buy this for the recharging station that isn&#x27;t included!</li>
            <li> I received Philips Norelco 8260XLCC. The shaver is ligth, noiseless and sharp  but the JET CLEAN SYSTEM IS BULKY AND IMPRACTICAL. I HOPED TO GET A SMALLER AND PRACTICAL BASE-SUPPORT.</li>
            <li> I have been using an 8160 (earlier model) for a year and gave this one to my 18 year old grandson. He is well pleased as I am with the earlier model. I do think the cleaning equipment is good but really not necessary. I have used norelco shavers for many years and they are long lasting and the best.I have tried others over the years but they did&#x27;nt last.</li>
            <li> The shaver shaves great, just like my previous Norelco&#x27;s -- no problem with its prime mission.    However, after only 2 months of use, the on-off switch failed, and I cannot turn it on.  Norelco customer service was very polite, and will replace it for me -- in 7 to 14 days -- so what am I supposed to do in the meantime.    Interesting thing is, the reason I purchased this shaver is because my previous Norelco, just a couple of months out of warranty so no support from Norelco -- failed -- the on / off switch failed and it could not be turned on.    Something is wrong in Denmark.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for decades with great results.  They are comfortable,  give a good shave and seem to last forever.  When we bought a winter home in Florida I purchased this model because it looked like the others I own.  This is of much lower quality than the others, the shave is not  as comfortable or as close.  The made in China models are clearly inferior to the originals and I do not know how much longer I will use this one before I get disgusted and just throw it away.</li>
            <li> It may have been because my old Panasonic was over 10 years old with the original head, but the 8260 CC was a pleasant surprise when I first put it to my face.  I figured it would take forever to shave because it was so quiet.  I was wrong.  It made quick work of my unruly beard.  When I let it grow it looks like a weather map of a bad hurricane season in the Caribbean.  I do think the cleaning system might be overkill though.  Is it really better than rinsing the head and spraying it with lube?</li>
            <li> I purchased a Phillips Norelco 8260 razor to replace an aging Norelco 6885XL.  I was very disappointed with the 8260 in that it ran at what seemed like half to two-thirds the rpm of my old 6885XL, and provided an extremely unsatisfactory shave-even after shaving until the blades were hot on my face.  Thinking the 8260 was defective,I returned it and received a replacement. The replacement failed, as well, to provide a satisfactory shave.  The ten year old 6885XL, with dull blades provided a quicker and more satisfying shave that the new 8260s.    I consider the cleaning system provided with the 8260 to be a needless feature.  The cleaning fixture takes a very long time to complete the process and cannot be left plugged in without potential damage to the razor batteries.  A quick rinse under a faucet is sufficient to clean the razor.    The 8260 feels flimsy and poorly constructed, as compared to the solidly built 6885XL.      I have returned the replacement 8260 for a refund and will keep buying blades for the 6885XL for as long as it lasts.    I do appreciate Amazon.com&#x27;s return and refund policy.  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> MY FIRST ELECTRIC SHAVER WAS A NORELCO SC 7960, A TWO HEADED SPEED SHAVER, WHICH I STILL OWN.THAT WAS 47 YEARS AGO AT AGE 17.I THEN USED A MODEL 805, PURCHASED IN 1992, WHICH WAS MY FIRST RECHARGEABLE TRIPLE HEADED NORELCO.BOTH THESE RAZORS GAVE ME AN EXCELLENT SHAVE WITHOUT ANY IRRITATION, SINCE I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.I JUST PURCHASED THE NORELCO 8260 AND WOW. WHAT A CLOSE SHAVE.YOUR RAZORS HAVE AGED WELL WITH QUALITY AND THERE ISN&#x27;T A BETTER SHAVER ON THE MARKET.I HAVE TRIED FOILED RAZORS IN THE PAST,BUT I ALWAYS COME BACK TO NORELCO. I AM A VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER.</li>
