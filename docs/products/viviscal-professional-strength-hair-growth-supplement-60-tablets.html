    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are some good websites with information about hair loss.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>if I added up the cost, in comparison, this is CHEAP!!</li>
            <li>Pricey yet effective.</li>
            <li>When the professional strength was offered, I changed to that strength and continue to be very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Super effective!</li>
            <li>I had used the original supplement with good results before but this time even that wasn&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know better in 2or 3 months</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell any difference in my hair, but my hair dresser says it is better.  </li>
            <li>It is much more affordable  through Amazon.</li>
            <li>To make sure, I took them again and problem started.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions and keep on it for 3 months and you will be very happy, especially if hair loss is your concern.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking this for 3 months and my hair is noticeably stronger, longer and better.</li>
            <li>Many people claim to have discovered an equivalent product.  </li>
            <li>Another effective treatment is infrared light therapy.  </li>
            <li>also works for many people.  </li>
            <li>The Viviscal Pro has shown greater results</li>
            <li>I never have been able to grow my nails until thus product and now they don&#x27;t just growth</li>
            <li>It is easy to take and does not cause gastrointestinal problems.</li>
            <li>but they are really strong.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>However, true infrared light is not in the visible light spectrum.  </li>
            <li>I think this is the only safe product I used for helping my hair to grow better and look better.</li>
            <li>Give this stuff two months to see a significant difference.</li>
            <li>It will be worth it!</li>
            <li>and I find that also2 be true with this pill.</li>
            <li>and I am seeing a significant amount of new growth around the hairline and the top of my scalp.</li>
            <li>I also am taking a biotin supplement along with it - which may account for the super accelerated growth this time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having tried many products and consulted many doctors, this is the only product that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>very good product, my hair has grown a lot, and I can see where the thinning sections are slowly thicking.</li>
            <li>Effective, my hair is getting better everyday.</li>
            <li>Took this product for a few days until I experienced severe gas pains.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered another 3 months worth,</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants better hair.from people who are ill and loosing hair to people who want the best out of their hair.</li>
            <li>I am paying almost$50 dollars for1 month worth and its worth it.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended Viviscal, and I purchased a box right in his office â€” for twice the price I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>i&amp;#34;ve been using viviscal for more than 6 months and have major increase in length of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my hair growth so far.</li>
            <li>so I would recommend making sure you order a refill in enough time to not run out.</li>
            <li>I just completed my first box.</li>
            <li>(I have a healthy lifestyle , exercise regularly).</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work but be vigilant, take as directed!</li>
            <li>I stopped to see if the pills are causing the problem and sure enough, my gas pains stopped.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, will see if tablets really work!</li>
            <li>Product contains shark powder and says in large print on the bottom &amp;#34;CONTAINS FISH INGREDIENTS (SHARK).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am about finished with the first box and have a ton of new hair growth!</li>
            <li>so much nicer option than going bald.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing like wildfire for the first time since I was a teenager, and where I was actually BALD (and I&#x27;m female) has completely filled in, and my hair is thick and full, and super strong!  </li>
            <li>The texture was always fine but prior to my health issues, I had a decent head of hair.</li>
            <li>This may very well be responsible for new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I tried many supplements with no success.</li>
            <li>The new hair is very shiny and a bit thicker, too.</li>
            <li>Initially, I used the standard strength and was very pleased with the results - my eyebrows grew back!  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dermatologist, so I will keep using it for a few more months.</li>
            <li>In a years time, I have not had any new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Lots of new hairs around the hairline.  </li>
            <li>Literally when I brush it, ONE piece comes out, versus half a hairbrush full every time I used to brush it!  </li>
            <li>Extremely noticeable under my bangs at the top of my forehead if I pull the longer hair back.</li>
            <li>I have not skipped one day of taking these for over a year now, and I will take them for the rest of my life, and I hope to God they do not stop making these Professional Viviscal!  </li>
            <li>I restarted (just as a test to make sure it was due to viviscal) and same symptoms stated up again.</li>
            <li>So far have not seen any new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Also on the crown where they are still small enough to kind of stand up.</li>
            <li>wow -</li>
            <li>Individuals respond differently to products - this one happened to work really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m40 yrs old and</li>
            <li>My money is on the professional version.</li>
            <li>so I could compare after taking this pill supplement and so far have not noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is my hair is very oily since taking Viviscal Pro.</li>
            <li>I took religiously for nearly 3 months.  </li>
            <li>I tried the regular Viviscal and the Professional version.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviews that you need to take it for at least 3 months or more to start even seeing results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had read that viviscal professional also stops grey growth</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s hair seems to be growing out very well and less thinning seen.</li>
            <li>After several hospitalizations, surgeries, and taking a certain anti-seizure medication known for causing hair loss, I have lost about half of my hair.</li>

            <li> I can only speak for myself, but I tried the the regular Viviscal (pink box) last year and then switched to the Viviscal Pro.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m on my second box and my hair does actually seem to be growing a bit faster than usual.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I&#x27;ve been having a lot of trouble with my hair.</li>
            <li> the few grey hairs I started to get have grown out and grew into my natural color(medium brown)I haven&#x27;t started colouring my hair because it&#x27;s just been a few here and there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to tell what type of results you&#x27;re getting as far as hair growth is concerned.</li>
            <li> It is now almost 12 months since I had started &amp; NO NEW growth at all!!!  </li>
            <li> Just not worth it with side effects.</li>
            <li> Expensive but really works.</li>
            <li> Bad enough not to care whether hair grew or not-which by the way I did not notice any positive changes with my hair while taking supplement.</li>
            <li> This means that you either have to continue using the products or you will return to your previous state of thinning hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping took a little while</li>
            <li> Near the end of that 3 months, I had gotten ill (not from the pills)</li>
            <li> I have bought EVERYTHING in the past...</li>
            <li> Still have one small spot where nothing has grown.</li>
            <li> I intend to take it at least 6 months and see if there is a difference.</li>
            <li> You need to take them for at least  6 months before you noticed the hair growth.</li>
            <li> As a peri-menopausal woman, I noticed some thinning of my typically thick hair around the crown.</li>
            <li> I noticed a subtle difference in my hair growth.</li>
            <li> Real waste of money for me-might work for others but definitely not for me.stomach upset/pain, bad bloating and halt in weight loss</li>
            <li> Just not a good experience for me</li>
            <li> cuz I was afraid maybe the 1st 3 months was negated due to my illness/medications.  </li>
            <li> Also felt so tired while on it.</li>
            <li> I am thin and I can&#x27;t tell that there is any thickness</li>
            <li> Unfortunately could not take anymore due to bad side effects.</li>
            <li> Fail for me.</li>
            <li> Not happy price - keeps increasing every month!!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> It was not growing, was very thin, and frizzy and stringy.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive (I was desperate due to my terribly thinning hair) for a product that did nothing!  </li>
            <li> but I was terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I could return for refund :(</li>
            <li> Very expensive supplement for fingernails!</li>

            <li> My hair line is still residing.!</li>
            <li> After starting to lose hair excessively due to Hashimoto&#x27;s Thyroiditis, I was at my wit&#x27;s end trying to get some help. Started the meds for the disease but it takes time. I had used the original supplement with good results before but this time even that wasn&#x27;t doing anything. I figured I&#x27;d give the prop version a shot and wow - what a difference! I am about finished with the first box and have a ton of new hair growth! Extremely noticeable under my bangs at the top of my forehead if I pull the longer hair back. Also on the crown where they are still small enough to kind of stand up. I&#x27;d say they are about 1.5 - 2&amp;#34; long and this is after a 1-month supply box. Definitely ordering another ASAP so I don&#x27;t run out! I do take one in the morning and at night as recommended. I also am taking a biotin supplement along with it - which may account for the super accelerated growth this time. Individuals respond differently to products - this one happened to work really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took a little while so I would recommend making sure you order a refill in enough time to not run out.</li>
            <li> I just completed my first box. I noticed a subtle difference in my hair growth. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I have not skipped one day of taking these for over a year now, and I will take them for the rest of my life, and I hope to God they do not stop making these Professional Viviscal!  My hair is growing like wildfire for the first time since I was a teenager, and where I was actually BALD (and I&#x27;m female) has completely filled in, and my hair is thick and full, and super strong!  Literally when I brush it, ONE piece comes out, versus half a hairbrush full every time I used to brush it!  I have bought EVERYTHING in the past... if I added up the cost, in comparison, this is CHEAP!! And this is the ONLY product that WORKS!</li>
            <li> I guess I just  can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helping.  I have been using it for over a year and will probably continue at a reduced, 1-a-day dose.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair seems to be growing out very well and less thinning seen.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive (I was desperate due to my terribly thinning hair) for a product that did nothing!  I took religiously for nearly 3 months.  Near the end of that 3 months, I had gotten ill (not from the pills) so I ordered another 3 months worth, cuz I was afraid maybe the 1st 3 months was negated due to my illness/medications.  All in all, took for 6 months (didn&#x27;t miss a day).  It is now almost 12 months since I had started &amp; NO NEW growth at all!!!  My hair stylist had recommended this, so maybe it works for some - but I was terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I believe my hair is getting thicker.  So far have not seen any new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about 6 months. Seems to have helped in terms of making my hair feel thicker. Still have one small spot where nothing has grown. Recommended by my dermatologist, so I will keep using it for a few more months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second box and my hair does actually seem to be growing a bit faster than usual.  It&#x27;s helping me get my hair past a certain length I was stuck at.  It would only grow the same amount of length we had to trim in split ends at my regular salon visits.  I&#x27;m finally making some progress.  It&#x27;s not a miracle but give it time and it will make a difference.</li>
            <li> very good product, my hair has grown a lot, and I can see where the thinning sections are slowly thicking. it takes a while so be patient I can&#x27;t say how long a while it is because everyone&#x27;s hair grow at different rates.</li>
            <li> I THINK it&#x27;s working... I&#x27;ll know better in 2or 3 months</li>
            <li> i&amp;#34;ve been using viviscal for more than 6 months and have major increase in length of my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t help with thickness, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an expectation based on the package description.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is an update after3 months of using viviscal professional.incredible product!!!you have2 be patient and take twice a day.don&#x27;t just give up.everyone&#x27;s hair growth process is different.I would recommend this to anyone who wants better hair.from people who are ill and loosing hair to people who want the best out of their hair.I am paying almost$50 dollars for1 month worth and its worth it.I have virgin hair and want2 keep it that way.instead of buying a bunch of products and ruining your hair with heat,try viviscal.maybe in5 to6 months it will be the only product you use for your hair.BE patient and have faith;whatever your hair situation is.p.s.I&#x27;m40 yrs old and the few grey hairs I started to get have grown out and grew into my natural color(medium brown)I haven&#x27;t started colouring my hair because it&#x27;s just been a few here and there.I&#x27;m lucky I haven&#x27;t started going grey cuz I have no desire to have2 do that.I did that enough in my teens.I had read that viviscal professional also stops grey growth and I find that also2 be true with this pill.AMAZINGðŸ˜½!good luck with your hair journeyðŸ˜‡</li>
            <li> So far so good. I agree with the other reviews that you need to take it for at least 3 months or more to start even seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to tell what type of results you&#x27;re getting as far as hair growth is concerned. I&#x27;ve been taking this for 3 months not and this is the strongest and longest my fingernails have ever been which tells me it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stop fallout and did not increase hair</li>
            <li> It did not work me.  I took it for over 5 months and I cannot see any difference.</li>
            <li> Effective, my hair is getting better everyday.</li>
            <li> Its all in your head... can be replaced with vitamins for a 10th of the cost.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Unfortunately could not take anymore due to bad side effects. Just not worth it with side effects. Real waste of money for me-might work for others but definitely not for me.stomach upset/pain, bad bloating and halt in weight loss (I have a healthy lifestyle , exercise regularly). Also felt so tired while on it. After stopping for 4 days symptoms gone. I restarted (just as a test to make sure it was due to viviscal) and same symptoms stated up again. Bad enough not to care whether hair grew or not-which by the way I did not notice any positive changes with my hair while taking supplement. Just not a good experience for me -wish I could return for refund :(</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work but be vigilant, take as directed!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year. It is easy to take and does not cause gastrointestinal problems. In a years time, I have not had any new hair growth. My fingernails are stronger. Very expensive supplement for fingernails!</li>
            <li> Product contains shark powder and says in large print on the bottom &amp;#34;CONTAINS FISH INGREDIENTS (SHARK).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference in my hair, but my hair dresser says it is better.  I am thin and I can&#x27;t tell that there is any thickness but maybe that will come after a&lt;br /&gt;long period of taking the Viviscal</li>
            <li> I tried the regular Viviscal and the Professional version. My money is on the professional version. Shedding stopped ASAP.  Lots of new hairs around the hairline.  Don&#x27;t expect miracles if you are dealing with hereditary hair loss. If you are under stress (&amp; who isn&#x27;t these days???)--this will assist and provide you with added nutrients that is beneficial for your hair and skin.</li>
            <li> My hair grew 2&amp;#34; within a month!</li>
            <li> I noticed no efect from taking them after 8 months. No increase in growth, no regrowth on bald spots. Just nothing.  I stopped taking it 3 months ago and nothing has happened...no shedding no nothing. Fail for me.</li>
            <li> I,ve used it and recomended it...it works!</li>
            <li> I think this is the only safe product I used for helping my hair to grow better and look better. It effects your hair, and nails, but not your skin.  It is much more affordable  through Amazon. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> As a peri-menopausal woman, I noticed some thinning of my typically thick hair around the crown. My dermatologist recommended Viviscal, and I purchased a box right in his office â€” for twice the price I can get it on Amazon. I have noticed a difference, and will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for almost a year now my hair continues to come back so much nicer option than going bald.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Hair has stopped falling, but now it needs to work on breakage.  Hopefully that will come with time...from the inside out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and found a decided difference in the thickness of my hair.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> 3rd box recieved the other day for me. Why....? I&#x27;m blessed that it&#x27;s working for me. Hair in places where there once was none. I&#x27;m a believer!!!</li>
            <li> Took this product for a few days until I experienced severe gas pains.  I stopped to see if the pills are causing the problem and sure enough, my gas pains stopped.  To make sure, I took them again and problem started.  Because of this, I am not able to see if it really works.</li>
            <li> The jury is out on this. I am on my 3rd box of this and I still cannot notice a difference. In fact, I just had another &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; where a bunch of my hair fell out again. This lasted about one month. I have no idea why. Stress? My dermatologist told me to use men&#x27;s minoxidil once per day instead of the ladies version 2X per day and I was doing this until my hair started falling out, so this may be why...I stopped doing this by the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping my hair would get thicker or longer with this supplement. I took a photo of my hair so I could compare after taking this pill supplement and so far have not noticed a difference. I intend to take it at least 6 months and see if there is a difference. I will come back and edit my comment later if there is a difference.</li>
            <li> Expensive but really works. Follow the directions and keep on it for 3 months and you will be very happy, especially if hair loss is your concern.</li>
            <li> I have started taking it,however material said it might take 3-6 months to show any results</li>
            <li> This is working! My hairdresser recommend it . Says take for 6 months! I need to reorder!</li>
            <li> Not happy price - keeps increasing every month!!!!</li>
            <li> Super effective! I&#x27;ve been taking this for 3 months and my hair is noticeably stronger, longer and better. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, will see if tablets really work!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a decade.  It dose work if the underlying cause is addressed by the product.  If it does not work for you, then you should consult a physician or naturopath to determine the underlying cause of your hair loss.  Hair loss is an outward sign of an internal problem.  (Viviscal is not meant to treat any disease or illness but may help with the hair loss symptom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried many products and consulted many doctors, this is the only product that worked for me.  Yes, it is expensive.  No, there is no known equivalent or substitute.  Many people claim to have discovered an equivalent product.  If there were a cheaper alternative then no one would be buying Viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some good websites with information about hair loss.  Another effective treatment is infrared light therapy.  However, true infrared light is not in the visible light spectrum.  Finding a legitimate infrared product is a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine also works for many people.  With both Rogaine and Viviscal, when you stop taking them their effect gradually disappears.  This means that you either have to continue using the products or you will return to your previous state of thinning hair. Wish it were easier and cheaper to reverse hair loss.  But for me, it is not.</li>
            <li> I bought the dietary supplement for my wife. She heard about it from her hairdresser which in return a hair specialist had prescribed to her.. She swears that it works. You need to take them for at least  6 months before you noticed the hair growth.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I&#x27;ve been having a lot of trouble with my hair. From hair extensions for an event to a recent discovery of an autoimmune disease, my hair was falling out in chunks. It was not growing, was very thin, and frizzy and stringy. In come viviscal to save the day! Give this stuff two months to see a significant difference. It will be worth it! My hair is growing and is a lot thicker. I&#x27;ve been taking it for 6 months now and don&#x27;t plan on stopping. If this stuff can work against an autoimmune disease, then I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> It works like a charm!  I wish I knew about it a long time ago.  My hairdresser is amazed at the growth and so am I.</li>
            <li> Really not see any results I use it like the directions said twice daily for 8 months and saw no results.</li>
            <li> Pricey yet effective.</li>
            <li> I confess that I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Initially, I used the standard strength and was very pleased with the results - my eyebrows grew back!  When the professional strength was offered, I changed to that strength and continue to be very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> After several hospitalizations, surgeries, and taking a certain anti-seizure medication known for causing hair loss, I have lost about half of my hair. The texture was always fine but prior to my health issues, I had a decent head of hair. I tried many supplements with no success. It has been three months since I began taking Viviscal Pro and I am seeing a significant amount of new growth around the hairline and the top of my scalp. The new hair is very shiny and a bit thicker, too. The only drawback is my hair is very oily since taking Viviscal Pro. I used to wash it every three days and now need to wash it almost daily. I can only speak for myself, but I tried the the regular Viviscal (pink box) last year and then switched to the Viviscal Pro. The Viviscal Pro has shown greater results and I think there is finally hope!</li>
            <li> hope it is helping my hair!!!</li>
            <li> This may very well be responsible for new hair growth. I think I have been using it for 4 months now.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my hair growth so far. However, it has dramatically improved the strength and looks of my nails. I never have been able to grow my nails until thus product and now they don&#x27;t just growth but they are really strong.</li>
