            <li>Great stuff - does everything it says.  </li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>This deodorant is great</li>
            <li>I was always used to scented deodorants, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I ended up finding Jungleman on Amazon with great reviews, and thought that I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product works great, eliminates any body odor, and also appears to lessen perspiration.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, great product, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for hunters too.  </li>
            <li>Great deodorant.</li>
            <li>My wife is so happy that I found a deodorant that works.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>then switched to Earth Science Liken (lichen) deodorant, which works great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I used to buy prescription strength deodorant, and this stuff works great.  </li>
            <li>So happy with this one.</li>
            <li>So happy I found this.</li>
            <li>works great for both sexes.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work great.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with how effective it is.</li>
            <li>Works great, but</li>
            <li>Really great product.</li>
            <li>This is great product.</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Very effective, lasts all day, no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I used to use the salt crystals which was also very effective.</li>
            <li>product has been very effective for me.</li>
            <li>However, when they got delivered and i tried it out all i can say is IT&#x27;S AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I will be using this product until I make my own!</li>
            <li>I have never found a deodorant that is more perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Mitchum produces fine products that are among the best in the market</li>
            <li>It irks me to pay $6 for a 3oz product + $4 for shipping - but it&#x27;s good nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for 3 days now (including a sweaty beach &amp; street fair day) and there is no smell at all.</li>
            <li>The BEST aluminum free deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li>applying, it uses a fair amount</li>
            <li>Quit good</li>
            <li>Good folks.</li>
            <li>This product may be good for some, it just did not work well for me.</li>
            <li>It does a good job neutralizing smells as well.</li>
            <li>after i had a good workout.</li>
            <li>I walked around the fair all day and got home Saturday evening.</li>
            <li>IT is a good product, but not all that it is cracked up to be...&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>not apply good underneath the arms..</li>
            <li>that smelled good (I think).  </li>
            <li>I had a good experience with the Jungleman customer service representative.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a lot of people would enjoy the fragrance of this soap, but the TEA TREE oil is especially effective at cleansing and killing bacteria just as Jungleman is with the TEA TREE oil it contains.</li>
            <li>Works good as a deodorant, although you will still sweat.  </li>
            <li>Goes on in the morning, and works for a good 10 hours or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to stay away from aluminum and no product over the counter comes close to how good jungleman works.</li>
            <li>good news is I come home and of all places</li>
            <li>What I did find is if you just put it under your arm, and let it warm up for about 10 seconds then apply it works out great.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a lot of money for a good deodorant</li>
            <li>and it does hold up fairly well.</li>
            <li>, as it does not contain baking soda and has good reviews.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and works good.</li>
            <li>That being said, it doesn&#x27;t make me smell good or anything, just not smell at all.</li>
            <li>Loved this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Good product, no irritation with it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many many kinds and this seems to be the best for preventing odor with my chemistry.  </li>
            <li>The shipping is great to, they included an icepack to make sure it got to me in good shape.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>It feels strange to call a deodorant impressive, but I was seriously impressed.  </li>
            <li>Perfect pricing, and COMPLETELY worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased by its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I saw this product had many great reviews</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will be using this from now on.</li>
            <li>Thank you SO much for a great product &amp; amazing service!!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, feels good on my skin, and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: do not use in heat.</li>
            <li>I am sure it may work perfectly for others, as it is an amazon bestselling deodorant and my situation is pretty uncommon.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pasty, so it will clump as you apply, but on the bright side, it will keep you smelling good through most of the day.</li>
            <li>Great natural deodorant, happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li>In an attempt to see if I could get away without being burned by jungle man, and for the most part it was successful.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love the name too!</li>
            <li>buy more!</li>
            <li>I hope they have not changed their original formula again as I loved it just the way it was!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>To top it all off, it cost me $10 for this deodorant!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It works soo much better than TOMS!</li>
            <li>So healthy!</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful lime scent that works and blends in brilliantly with one&#x27;s natural body odor.</li>
            <li>It works great and lasts me a full day as it does a good job at preventing odor.  </li>
            <li>This stuff if kind of amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s aMAZing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>AMAZING odor control.</li>
            <li>This one works amazing.</li>
            <li>I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this product is.  </li>
            <li>Its amazing it allows me to sweat</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Jungleman deodorant is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Works great and keeping you odor free.</li>
            <li>for me, amazing product will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>Be honest about your product.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more and am absolutely delighted with this product.</li>
            <li>wore this all day + a sweaty workout and Jungleman was completely effective.</li>
            <li>The deodorant stick fell apart (and kind of melted) in about a month of use.</li>
            <li>This is an effective product that stopped any BO</li>
            <li>It makes me feel uber-manly, which is spectacular since I&#x27;m a chick.</li>
            <li>In fact, you won&#x27;t have any kind of odor at all.</li>
            <li>And after using it for probably a good month or two now, I can safely say that it&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>Effective.  </li>
            <li>it makes your armpits kind of sweaty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as effective, but it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so effective, though, that this can be overlooked.</li>
            <li>I never thought it would be SO effective.</li>
            <li>deodorant, effective but I am not a man that perspire a lot.</li>
            <li>The scent always bothered me, so I liked the unscented and I never sweated or smelled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s, Arm and Hammer, and Burt&#x27;s Bees, but none of those are effective on my stinky pits.  </li>
            <li>This product is effective for odor control BUT the abrasive properties of the baking soda make it unsuitable.....</li>
            <li>i was using a popular deodorant that was leaving a slippery film on my shower pouf every time i took a shower.  </li>
            <li>I looked into making my own deodorant, and would have probably tried that,</li>
            <li>all natural&lt;br /&gt;+ effective (</li>
            <li>This deodorant doesnt irritate me, and it is effective against stinky armpit smells.</li>
            <li>As honest as it gets.</li>
            <li>It seems to be equally as effective, with easier application and no staining.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an effective deoderant (not an antipersperant) that didn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell and also worked.</li>
            <li>It is extremely effective.</li>
            <li>I read many good reviews about this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>today\\&quot; kind of tinge,</li>
            <li>I really thought jungleman was going to be \\&quot;the\\&quot; deodorant perfect for myself</li>
            <li>Best of the organic deodorants that I have tried, it really does work.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s how much I liked it.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of going &amp;#34;All Natural&amp;#34; for a deodorant, but this didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>an all-natural deodorant could be so effective.</li>
            <li>the absolute best product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>when on is uhm, not the best and kinda smells like ejaculate but a squirt or two of your favorite cologn or perfume masks right over it.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is very effective and is, itself, fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>I even told the guys I was trying a new deodorant and to help me evaluate it by letting me know if it was failing, and believe me, they would lol!</li>
            <li>Works Works Works, and is safe, odor free, and all around a great buy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide as easily as most deorderants, but it works a lot better than any that I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I hope it doesn&#x27;t because this is one of the best natural deodorants I have tried!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>Best all-natural deodorant I have ever purchased by far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair (read: almost albino), so it was very noticeable.</li>
            <li>but this one is the most effective.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the best one I have found.  </li>
            <li>On its own, it gets you through most of the day.  </li>
            <li>But the ingredients and effectiveness are so far the best I have seen.</li>
            <li>I also gave a Jungleman to my adult son out of state and he swears its the best he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>Anyway, for us it&#x27;s more effective than aluminum antiperspirant for controlling odor.</li>
            <li>far as odor-fighting effectiveness, this deodorant is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>The BEST natural deodorant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is in fact the most effective deodorant I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant ever.  </li>
            <li>Jungle Man is the best Natural Deodorant I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried alot of them.</li>
            <li>Even with those issues it is still the best natural deodorant I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, this is definitely a great great product that is definitely worth the money, and worth trying out.  </li>
            <li>So far, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Weleda Rose Deodorant(which smells great at first</li>
            <li>I have used many deodorants and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This deodorant, however, works the best and uses simple, proven, and effective ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am SO happy to have found a safe deodorant that actually works and with the customer service being so great, I am happy to give my once a month business (at minimum) to such a great company.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy ;)</li>
            <li>After a first couple days, it worked great.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to just cover up odor, but rather prevents its development in the first place which is great.</li>
            <li>I wanted something strong and effective and I have found it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easily the best natural deodorant Ive tried.</li>
            <li>Very good ALL natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t just swish it on real quick because it doesn&#x27;t glide.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>If I am going to work out after working all day or if I plan to exert myself for hours on end, I will bring it with me to re-apply once more if needed.</li>
            <li>I forgot to mention that the mfg. sends this product out real quick.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t think it works any better than the OTCs, I think it helps more than others and is better than I&#x27;ve found anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>my Sure did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found this stuff</li>
            <li>keep sweating at bay most of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad to see this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>my favorite deoderant.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but after 6 months it started giving me a rash.  </li>
            <li>I now use it off and on trading days with  DeoMom deodorant and it has started working again, and I don&#x27;t have a rash any more.  </li>
            <li>work ok for the most part</li>
            <li>Jungleman brand deodorant is better at wetness protection, odor control, and doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts.</li>
            <li>A great product that I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>Not all that satisfied with this product...stings and  leaves  one itching at times...also does not exit the container</li>
            <li>in all, this product is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>What I also love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t stain any of my shirts.</li>
            <li>This worked well most of the time (but not always).  </li>
            <li>It works, but I&#x27;ve discovered that if I use it 3 days in a row or more, my underarms start itching</li>
            <li>This product works much better than the Kiss</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my boyfriend, ever since I read a study on how most OTC deodorants has a chemical in them&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s more than I can say for the Jungleman deodorant.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s more than I can say for the Jungleman deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it, and just ordered another one.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The second order (6 each) was delivered to a PO box, and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love them.  </li>
            <li>I tried putting more product on, but it irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ironically, it is not advised to order this product during the summer months when it would be most needed.  </li>
            <li>In many ways it works better than Mitchum, which is something I would not have believed before I tried it.</li>
            <li>I have tried EVERYTHING and nothing could mask my odor for more than 5 hours.  </li>
            <li>Besides being free of chemicals &amp; toxic metals.. this is the most effective deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li>I never heard of Jungleman deodorant before, but the more I learned about it</li>
            <li>I thoroughly put on the product just to make sure my underarm areas are fully covered.  </li>
            <li>I had better results with the Thai crystal deodorant stone, but again that contained aluminum.  </li>
            <li>No horrible rash.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell a lie - I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>, the corn starch absorbs some sweat, the tea tree oil is anti bacterial, and the palm oil is a safe carrier to mix it all together.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any deodorant or antiperspirant that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more for myself and friends.  </li>
            <li>Pretty nice!</li>
            <li>And I do notice that if I don&#x27;t shower at night, I make sure to shower or wash it off in the AM before putting it on again.</li>
            <li>I am not quite sure what it helps with yet</li>
            <li>It takes more work</li>
            <li>The shirt was touching my pits when I would pull the shirt over my head.</li>
            <li>(going organic, ingesting more greens and superfoods)</li>
            <li>My quality of life improved exponentially after acquiring this deodorant! :) :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for Tom&#x27;s of Maine (which I&#x27;d used for years but started to irritate my skin) and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I wish they sold this product in more stores.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish it were able to glide more smoothly, like a gel (a la Old Spice gel) or like Tom&#x27;s unscented deodorant which applies flawlessly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, IMHO, it should never take more than a couple days to get a product into the mail.</li>
            <li>it make more sense to ship in a manner that accommodates buyers from ALL climates at any time of year??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, done with the rant.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>it make more sense to ship in a manner that accommodates buyers from ALL climates at any time of year??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, done with the rant.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and so does he.</li>
            <li>sticks I&#x27;ve been able to find without all the crazy-cancer-talk in the ingredients list.</li>
            <li>Definitely glad I found this baby.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is from the additives.</li>
            <li>This product is simply the best that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic all natural deodorant, I have tried most and this works the best!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The crystal stick (mineral salt) worked ok, but I needed to apply liberally to achieve effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Works much better that way.}</li>
            <li>I love the ingredient profile on this although I ran into some complications.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Very happy overall with this product and will continue to order.</li>
            <li>but it works better than that stuff does.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using this, and the cysts stopped after a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>This product still works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I imagine I will continue to use this deodorant for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I used to use suave clinical stregth -this works better</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about the potassium alum in it</li>
            <li>I love most about Jungle Man deodorant</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve either ended up in the trash, or I&#x27;ve kept them but had to reapply more than once throughout the day (which isn&#x27;t always the most convenient thing to do).  </li>
            <li>BEWARE: be sure that when you purchase, it says that it is being shipped from Jungleman Naturals.</li>
            <li>I was using the crystal for a couple of years and then it stopped working, and I learned that it isn&#x27;t completely safe since it still contains aluminum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a truly healthy invisible deodorant, the search continues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the Jungleman Deodorant.</li>
            <li>i do find myself using more cologne</li>
            <li>Also, I must mention that the item I received was well packaged (came with cooling ice gel to make sure the item didn&#x27;t melt if exposed to heat during shipping).</li>
            <li>One interesting side effect is that my underarm hair seems to have lightened.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but sure does the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am highly satisfied with Jungleman and will buy more, even though it costs more.</li>
            <li>These were better than Jason&#x27;s but just couldn&#x27;t stop the BO.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t think it works as an antiperspirant but overall its an excellent product.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is simply the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>If I use Anti_Perspirants: I dont sweat in my pits most of the time</li>
            <li>most anti-perspirants tend to irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;JUNGLEMAN</li>
            <li>The unscented has tea tree oil which I think adds even more protection.</li>
            <li>tend to defeat most deodorants, and I am not fond of anti-perspirants.  </li>
            <li>I have finally found the perfect balance.</li>
            <li>Overall is  excellent!</li>
            <li>I told myself to wait to be cautious and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>After many years in search of the perfect deodorant I finally found it!!!</li>
            <li>I dare say this works better than antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>the ingredients are top notch</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees works a bit better but it stains your undershirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the service has been outstanding and everything you would want from a seller.  </li>
            <li>From my experience, my armpits have lasted 13 hours without smelling (by that time I needed to apply more).</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if it continues to impress, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>The BEST thing I love about this deodorant is that it is VERY easy to rinse off in the shower compared to other brands that literally stick to your hair/skin.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I guess the lack of chemicals is cool, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any kind of improvement or difference.</li>
            <li>I guess the lack of chemicals is cool, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any kind of improvement or difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome and unless it stops working for me or they stop making it, I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product, I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>I am now ready to reorder once again and am happy to find Jungleman easily available on Amazon</li>
            <li>I purchased this deodorant because of all the rave reviews and most of the natural deodorants I tried haven&#x27;t been very effective.</li>
            <li>This is the first and best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried!  </li>
            <li>Another reviewer mentioned rubbing a dab of shea butter into the armpits before applying Jungleman; that sounds like it would make the product apply more smoothly</li>
            <li>But more importantly, IT WORKS.</li>
            <li>I was surprised after using this at the great reviews that don&#x27;t seem to mention residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly a year and it works great.  </li>
            <li>but I wish it was more smoothly.  </li>
            <li>and I see they have more varieties available as well.  </li>
            <li>So glad this is available.</li>
            <li>It really is incredible and such a relief that I have found one that I can recommend to others.</li>
            <li>and it really is a great natural deodorant in terms of odor prevention/wetness minimization.</li>
            <li>i use it for the first time, and i&#x27;m very satisfied  </li>
            <li>Smooth long swipes seems to be the best I can do</li>
            <li>The company owners are great people who are clearly invested in their customers.</li>
            <li>There are better deodorants available.</li>
            <li>I got off on Saturday morning expecting to go take a shower, but we ended up going straight to the Ohio State Fair.</li>
            <li>Additionally, what impressed me was how it was scent free, but still left me odor free.</li>
            <li>But I decided to give it a try since the price was good and what did I have to lose really</li>
            <li>This one gets you through the day, feels good on your skin, and is absolutely all-natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From the rave reviews...I really was expecting a superior product.  </li>
            <li>However, the scent I have (Mountain spring) is very light and fresh and the application is very very smooth -</li>
            <li>Even the first stick was usable, and I love the product!</li>
            <li>I have had this stuff on for full days, no reapplying, and there is NO odor at the end of the day!  </li>
            <li>it is the best vs. the competition in every other way.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t apply easily).</li>
            <li>product goes on fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>You also want to make sure your underarms are fully clean and odor-free before putting on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then it applies easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I can go 24  hours easily and this deodorant still works.  </li>
            <li>This dissipates very quickly though.</li>
            <li>it doesnt go on easy.</li>
            <li>applied in the morning and before going to bed, it still had a strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything strong.</li>
            <li>Aluminum has a strong link to causing breast cancer.  </li>
            <li>Should you have any questions in the future, please feel free to contact us and we&#x27;ll be more than happy to help you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants but this stuff is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This one not only doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>First, I received both deodorants nicely packaged with a gel icebag to prevent them from melting.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re reading this you&#x27;re obviously interested in removing all the poisonous toxins so prevalent in the majority of body products out there, yet looking for something that&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3 months and am especially pleased to be able to write a review to say that this is the real deal...</li>
            <li>I ended up working in a very hot school portable moving books around and sweating  pretty good.</li>
            <li>At first she didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d like it, because it goes on kind of pasty</li>
            <li>If you buy more than one, just keep the extras stored in a cool place.  </li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the BEST all-natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best at controlling odor.</li>
            <li>it should be good as new.  </li>
            <li>I am a man, but I imagine, because it is unscented and has no musky smell, women would be fine with trying this as well.  </li>
            <li>so it goes on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s one of those people who can forget deodorant and he&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I put the product in the fridge for a couple of hours and it was fine.</li>
            <li>and they all worked fine.</li>
            <li>I am not a small man prone to smelling good at all times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried for YEARS to find a good all natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li>By far the BEST NATURAL deodorant out there!  </li>
            <li>I use almost exclusively natural products on my skin and have gone several years without using any kind of deodorant (Of course, I shower twice a day and have very good hygiene.)</li>
            <li>This is probably the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far out of 3 it seems to stay on longer</li>
            <li>This is by far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or otherwise.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t enjoy paying $9 for deodorant).  </li>
            <li>It does not go on smoothly and can irritate one&#x27;s armpits.  </li>
            <li>I preferred the light mint scent though.</li>
            <li>It does work as a deodorizer and keeps armpits stink free.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality.</li>
            <li>My Face fragrance free roll-on deodorant I used for years</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine that a product so free of chemicals could do that, so I just kept using it.</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, but honestly, that doesn&#x27;t bother me that much anymore.</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, but honestly, that doesn&#x27;t bother me that much anymore.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Not available in retail locations</li>
            <li>Pursuing aluminum free, as we all should, I&#x27;ve tried virtually everything out there...</li>
            <li>the more I thought it was worth giving a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my underarms remain just about odor free.</li>
            <li>, I was about to ask my primary care Physician to prescribe something because NO deodorant/antiperspirant worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I tried all the ones available at CVS and Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>Then come in Jungleman and I have truly been odor free for 2 weeks now.  </li>
            <li>but throughout the day I was odor free.  </li>
            <li>For anyone looking for an alternative to the aluminum-heavy deodorants available at drug stores, this is the answer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have it&#x27;s own smell</li>
            <li>I honestly was just testing this out, and didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>It has a light medicinal herbal scent.</li>
            <li>honestly, I don&#x27;t even care that much about that.</li>
            <li>It starts to get pricey when you include shipping so find a way to make your own or purchase for the whole year.</li>
            <li>I just wish there were free shipping on it.</li>
            <li>aluminum free deodorants with some smelly consequences.  </li>
            <li>I am SO happy that this level of service is provided by this seller as I will be ordering regularly from him from here on out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a really good, unscented natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>As far as natural deodorant goes, this is excellent.</li>
            <li>far as deodorants go, this product does a good job at preventing odor.  </li>
            <li>This product is good because it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>sure if the product comes in larger quantities, but that would be a good idea.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been looking for a good, natural deodorant without aluminum or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ive been on the hunt for a good natural deodorant since my crystal roll ons stopped working.</li>
            <li>used to apply all natural deodorants that smelled good but didnt work</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>So far it has worked okay, although hasn&#x27;t been completely effective in eliminating odor.</li>
            <li>Most natural deodorants are very strongly scented.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a strong scent, I just observe far more than most do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty smooth for me, I just make sure to swipe UP</li>
            <li>Definitely worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li>However, when you DO get it on - its odorless, lasts long and it works great.</li>
            <li>First let me say that most deodorants irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Love it!to the blazing hot mailbox anyway</li>
            <li>The product is definitely worth trying!  </li>
            <li>Now that is success!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this product, it pulled my hair out, didn&#x27;t control my sweating or stank.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, you want to make sure that the stick of deodorant does not stay in an area that is too hot when you are not using it, or it will melt into an unusable mush form.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth skin issues!</li>
            <li>My original order was damaged in shipping &amp; a replacement was sent no questions asked.  </li>
            <li>the bright side, I ordered this because my skin is sensitive to most deodorants (gets very itchy) and</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an ultra-distance bicyclist who wanted a deodorant that would not interfere with the body&#x27;s cooling system but leave me smelling clean after 50 to 150 miles.</li>
            <li>He also appreciated that the company responded to the reviews about the packaging and took great care and detail and sending it with an icepack and a sealed exposure proof package and clearly labeled about sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like how my under-arms never felt completely clean when using Ax, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely the simplest, most effective anti-persperant I&#x27;ve come across yet, can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li>Stuff works great as for keeping you dry and smell free,&lt;br</li>
            <li>, no perfume smell at all, and it washes completely clean in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I go by the reviews, for the most part they were positive, so I bought this for him.</li>
            <li>Just tank top it or wear wicking cotton materials when it&#x27;s super hot</li>
            <li>DO NOT apply this deodorant right after shaving!</li>
            <li>It applies decently and washes off great in the shower, so you don&#x27;t get that old antiperspirant smell or feeling.</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I received it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a warm body, and tend to sweat a little more than most.  </li>
            <li>It is 100% natural, with no toxic chemicals or perfume and the best of all: it will keep you dry and fresh all day!</li>
            <li>I ruined a couple of my good shirts which is a bummer, they have white stains that will not come out</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been a dream come true.</li>
            <li>Note this does NOT stain clothes, which is a plus, but it does not keep you smelling sweet either.</li>
            <li>I might try Tom&#x27;s of Maine next; I&#x27;ve heard good things about that brand, though you know how that can</li>
            <li>I might try Tom&#x27;s of Maine next; I&#x27;ve heard good things about that brand, though you know how that can</li>
            <li>Just as good as regular deodorant.  </li>
            <li>:) This all-natural deodorant really works by inhibiting bacterial growth...</li>
            <li>I tried to find a good alternate, non-scented solution.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It keeps &amp;#34;pit stains&amp;#34; off your dress shirts and can survive a trip to the gym after a full day of work.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product that really works.</li>
            <li>Store it somewhere cool and it won&#x27;t be a</li>
            <li>It protects well, but not as good as the regular brands with unnatural products.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me, i.e., does not burn or feel irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from controlling any odor very well, the two things that I like best about Jungleman: what it does contain and, just as equally, what it does not contain.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night after a shower and after a nights sleep, a full day of work, the gym, whatever I throw at it, there is no BO smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I loved the simple ingredients and that it had no smell.</li>
            <li>No bad stuff and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>It came in a special package with an ice pack which was super cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve changed my rating from a 3 to a 5 because I still think it&#x27;s a good product if you live in a place where you don&#x27;t sweat much.</li>
            <li>Something about putting metal in your pores to stop you from sweating doesn&#x27;t sound right.  </li>
            <li>First off, the package was sent very quickly and was shipped with product care in mind.</li>
            <li>I did read reviews of other people who said it worked great for a couple of days</li>
            <li>Great deodorant that works rather than just masking odor with a scent, perfume, and other chemicals.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Of course different people react differently but for me, this is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>I quickly stopped using it.</li>
            <li>but it goes quick.</li>
            <li>What I do is to wet the top of the stick with warm water before applying it to each armpit, and it goes on a bit easier.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many anti-perspirants/deodorants throughout the years that have destroyed my shirts over time and never left me satisfied.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;re super nervous/</li>
            <li>shipped with a cooling package in it, got it extremely quick.</li>
            <li>Lucky me.</li>
            <li>There is literally no drop off from traditional deodorants, and may even be better than most for oder protection and dryness.</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot, and I develop an odor quickly.  </li>
            <li>For me it works better than the toxic commercial deodorants and I love the fact that I&#x27;m not using those harmful products on my body.</li>
            <li>However unlike aluminum-based deodorants, Jungleman All-Natural stains come out with a quick wash.  </li>
            <li>so I was very impressed about the short and simple ingredient list.</li>
            <li>I went about a week using no deo and found out quick</li>
            <li>luckily it works well for me, my girlfriend tried one of my spare sticks of jungleman and got rashes.</li>
            <li>I did receive it quickly, so perhaps this company has stepped up it shipping process.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that this stuff knocks out the stink, but some people like myself may not be able to tolerate the main ingredient - baking soda.</li>
            <li>Better than anything made by any major brands and definitely the best natural option.</li>
            <li>They also include a stay cool pack inside the packaging to insure that the deodorant doesn&#x27;t melt during the hot summer months!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent product that can go head to head against any other deodorant, natural or not.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of aluminum free deodorants, and this was the first one that lasted all day without causing</li>
            <li>I have tried Tom&#x27;s, Jason, Bert&#x27;s Bees, and other natural deodorants, but this is the best product for me.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>Have used for couple of weeks daily very satisfied will order again.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is the best deodorant I have ever used, natural and conventional included.</li>
            <li>My new favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and smelling good all day.</li>
            <li>Plus I don&#x27;t think anyone wants to smell strong deodorant coming from another person&#x27;s armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most deodorants give me a rash or don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>Jungleman All Natural Deodorant is BEST deodorant I&#x27;ve EVER used, hands down.</li>
            <li>no complaints from the students either and believe me, they are not shy!).  </li>
            <li>Even after intense sweaty workouts I still smell like....NOTHING!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more in a natural deodorant!</li>
            <li>And I have got to say that this stuff REALLY WORKS!!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life i actually rarely have sweat spots in my arm pits!</li>
            <li>but then it becomes more dry when you dab it off and apply more.</li>
            <li>This is only the 3rd aluminum free deodorant I have tried but this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>That really does help it go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The amazing thing about this product is that not only does it work to keep odor at bay, but it doesn&#x27;t have to clog your pores to stop from there being any odor!</li>
            <li>Great for the outdoors or even for an everyday use.</li>
            <li>AMAZING odor protection from this actually all-natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product would absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I settled on making my own that had fairly similar ingredients to jungleman.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that this is completely</li>
            <li>Thank you for a healthy, responsible, alternative, that works so very well.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive armpits and most deodorants either give me a rash or just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My husband liked this and used it for several weeks before breaking out in hives.</li>
            <li>I rarely itch anymore, the skin is a lot healthier, and I don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t tolerate most deodorants.  </li>
            <li>When I was near the end of the Jungleman dispenser/tube, the insert the deodorant gets pushed up on fell out, so I probably missed out on one or two more uses of the product.  </li>
            <li>It actually works, smells great and is all natural.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m thinking I might try the mint, but honestly, after two weeks, my skin isn&#x27;t red anymore, and I think I&#x27;ve adjusted.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say I was pursuaded to use a more natural product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through so many natural deodorants trying to find one without sketchy ingredients that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go so far as to say it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>I ordered it and found it to be extremely simple and effective for me and the rest is history.  </li>
            <li>I love this natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Trader Joes standard antiperspirant stick which kind of works, but Jungleman does wonders.</li>
            <li>Of course, after viewing the simple ingredients list, you may be inclined to make your own deodorant and save yourself some money.</li>
            <li>and it works better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or otherwise.</li>
            <li>Together it&#x27;s a powerful combination.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had body odor for years now, but wanted to try something more natural because I heard about the ill-effects of aluminum.</li>
            <li>But she noticed that after several minutes, the pastiness kind of disappears.</li>
            <li>and I have learned to trust that I won&#x27;t stink just because there isn&#x27;t some absurdly powerful perfume smell attached to it.</li>
            <li>So far, it is okay.  </li>
            <li>Still works though, you just have to let it harden back up and kind of scoop it and rub it in.</li>
            <li>I found this product to actually be quite nice</li>
            <li>There are fraud companies out there (such as Action Development Group) that are taking advantage of a great product and selling it, yet are  unauthorized sellers.</li>
            <li>I had to microwave one of them for 10-12 seconds to warm the product up enough to twist the bottom dial.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised I even found this, too all those people getting irritation, could it be from the corn starch from what I am able to tell.</li>
            <li>I love this all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to my first use, I got rid of the edges of the product with a tissue, to make it smooth for the first application.</li>
            <li>I love the all natural components.  </li>
            <li>The odor may permanently stay with the stick and then future applications will not be as effective at blocking odor.</li>
            <li>It has completely eliminated bodily scents, which is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>but it tended to make me sweat (not so anti perspiring) and stink more, thus far I do not sweat or stink.</li>
            <li>The only challenge is that it doesn&#x27;t go on as easily and quickly as most deodorants, sometimes pulling out hairs or whatever, but to find something that truly works, even after a long day mountain biking, etc. is amazing.</li>
            <li>: If you live in a hot area like I do, make sure to let the seller know in a note for your order.</li>
            <li>Jungleman is unscented, but it works better than even my old Right gaurd.</li>
            <li>Even better, he didn&#x27;t break out in any rash like he has to so many other brands (both organic and not).</li>
            <li>After a long day working outside, there can start to be a hint of body odor but for most days and scenarios, this stuff is simply the best.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to reapply if you&#x27;re going out in the evening, or before bed if you want to stay sleep in cuddly nice for a significant other, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>but it does not smell and is infinitely superior to all the other products I tried.  </li>
            <li>After just two days, my right armpit started itching again and I caught myself scratching.</li>
            <li>After just two days, my right armpit started itching again and I caught myself scratching.</li>
            <li>right after I shower before applying this.</li>
            <li>does right for me.</li>
            <li>I stopped use right there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just thrilled that it actually works, and works really well!</li>
            <li>Will just have to find a better way to get more of it down here in the subtropics, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Will just have to find a better way to get more of it down here in the subtropics, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Despite the good reviews I just don&#x27;t see these and legitimate replacements for conventional deodorants.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any allergic reactions that some other reviewers experienced (perhaps high ph, or tea tree oil reaction).</li>
            <li>The formula must be lacking whatever it is that allows you to smoothly apply it like a normal deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t just work a little better; it works a lot better.</li>
            <li>know everybody&#x27;s body chemistry is a little different, and what works for one might not work for another, but I am VERY happy with this stuff!</li>
            <li>It is not quite as easy to put on as some of the other deodorants out there; it takes a couple more swipes on the armpits to get it sufficiently</li>
            <li>I certainly do!)  </li>
            <li>(I could tell it was more oil and less dry) but it still worked great for me</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up on natural deodorants; I tried so many and none of them gave me the protection I needed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have particularly sensitive underarms, but if you&#x27;ve had that problem, I recommend giving this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;No strong scent, so</li>
            <li>This works really well for me - and love the fact that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-doesn&#x27;t spread on the skin as easily as it&#x27;s non natural counterparts&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I was looking for a deodorant more intense than the natural one I was using.  </li>
            <li>The whole point of using a natural deodorant is that it would be better for my body.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought all of the good reviews here on Amazon were fake -- and I bought the product anyway.</li>
            <li>The very first day, I applied it after taking a shower and went out the whole night including dancing at a club, No smell</li>
            <li>Feels good, prevents smell when exercising and not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>You can stop shopping for a natural, aluminum free deodorant right here.</li>
            <li>when hiking, jogging, working out etc, and after such I&#x27;ve asked my wife to smell my underarms (that&#x27;s love right there...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found yet, though it is a bit stiff to put on; definitely pulls hairs, but I&#x27;ll deal with it.</li>
            <li>Plus it is very, very, very, sticky.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>My wife is using it, too, and likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>Their ingredients are great, truly natural with no imposture chemicals used by other brands.  </li>
            <li>First off, I must say this works very, very well.</li>
            <li>The major drawback of this stuff is that if it gets too warm (e.g., after a hot shower), it will become extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I used to use Old Spice and Right Guard, and this stuff actually seems to work better!  </li>
            <li>Natural was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first time I tried a deodorant that didn&#x27;t have aluminum</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to last most of a day or all day and night depending on activity level.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used consistently without irritation.</li>
            <li>Thus, I more than likely would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>The first was a flop</li>
            <li>After my first use, it irritated my underarms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really not totally unscented, like 100%... more like 95%...</li>
            <li>The deodorant is smooth and soft, not slimy, and is completey unscented, definitely works as described and is safe.</li>
            <li>Somehow this odorless bar keeps your underarms completely odor free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% all-natural, which is the first qualification.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put it through its paces from nervous sweats in office meetings to manual labor sweats in a hot, humid summer.</li>
            <li>He applied it the moment he received the package  (around 11 am) and he didn&#x27;t reapply till the next day; more than twelve hours.</li>
            <li>packaging on the deodorant should be noted: It was very well packaged!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fine, but man, I couldn&#x27;t be less satisfied with my Jungleman experience.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fine, but man, I couldn&#x27;t be less satisfied with my Jungleman experience.</li>
            <li>It provides moderate protection and for the price I was expecting a better product.</li>
            <li>Do not order it to be delivered in a hot environment though.</li>
            <li>My first stick was delivered to a hot mailbox, and was melted when I got it.</li>
            <li>I WILL buy more this winter, in order to be stocked for next year.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Very itchy and rashes!  </li>
            <li>Beyond that, I love the product after using it for a month, and will keep using it for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is really unscented!  </li>
            <li>Funny to say that I suffer from anosmia/hyposmia (inability/reduced ability to smell/ detect odor)</li>
            <li>/&gt;After showering and drying myself with a towel, I soak a cotton pad with 90% isopropyl alcohol and wipe both of my underarms to kill most bacteria left.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Jungleman!</li>
            <li>I have been trying different products now for more than 2 years.  </li>
            <li>Most of my T-shirts are colored so this caused a big problem.</li>
            <li>Thanks Jungleman!</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think I would like the &amp;#34;no sent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and man I am not sorry one</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;re looking for something that is better than you&#x27;re current deodorant in my opinion</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the side affects to my armpits, or any long term problems, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great deodorant stick.  </li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this, my product melted and leaked all over the package.</li>
            <li>, i will definitely buy more soon.</li>
            <li>now, heck I was probably one of their first customers.  </li>
            <li>so I continue to be an avid supporter.  </li>
            <li>I love that you CAN be all natural and odor free at the same time!</li>
            <li>this is what you want for a free and clear product.</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered 2 more after my first purchase to have as a back</li>
            <li>- I am looking at you ;)</li>
            <li>It would make me more likely to repurchase the item if they did...</li>
            <li>Jungleman works all day, and let&#x27;s just say that I am someone who really needs deodorant!</li>
            <li>Upon waking the following morning after having the deodorant on for 24 hrs or more, I NEVER have smelled any body odor.</li>
            <li>I love that it has simple ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am a pretty sweaty guy and have used all sorts of deodorants to-date, including antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>Something that actually WORKS, unlike many products sold on the store shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been sweating a lot throughout this hot summer, and odor has not been an issue.</li>
            <li>but I was still able to put the pieces back and use them.</li>
            <li>At first I figured that it was just some fluke thing going on with my body</li>
            <li>My most recent order was placed on a Sunday</li>
            <li>To top it off, I&#x27;m still using the same stick from three months ago!</li>
            <li>first then apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought lots of items on Amazon, but this is my first time leaving a review...</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;ve found that if you rub the excess &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; into your skin, it smooths out pretty well</li>
            <li>First of all, I could not get the product to twist up so that I could try it.</li>
            <li>This is true, but I&#x27;ve found that holding the stick on my skin for a few moments before moving it around softens it nicely.  </li>
            <li>Hoping I have better luck with it - I don&#x27;t want to go back to aluminum based deodorant!</li>
            <li>Some customers said beware that it may arrive melted if it&#x27;s hot out.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant exceeded my expectations and I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>but I found using a lighter pressure when applying it makes it flow on and apply pretty well.</li>
            <li>I refuse to smear anything on my body that I don&#x27;t know exactly what each ingredient is and what it does.  </li>
            <li>NOTES TO ALL:&lt;br /&gt;it is more like a solid stick deodorant.</li>
            <li>ONE AND TRY IT FIRST.</li>
            <li>This deodorant blew my mind the first day I used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Keeps your underarm virtually scentless even in hot and humid summer conditions.</li>
            <li>I formerly used the Burts Bees but this is better.  </li>
            <li>When I first found Jungleman deodorant</li>
            <li>works really well and only needs reapplication later in the day when you are sweating a great deal (tropical or desert conditions, no air conditioning or working out</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I am 30 year old man and very satisfied customer from Slovenia (the only disadvantage is that shipping for two sticks costs 10€).</li>
            <li>I am still using the first one that I ordered in december 2012</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how good it is when I perspire heavily after a run.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Jungleman Naturals for creating a natural product that WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li>Natural deodorants suck!!!!</li>
            <li>Unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried with the same premise this stuff is by far the very best.  </li>
            <li>I would still highly recommend this product as looking at the reviews many people absolutely love it and my boyfriend uses it everyday with no issues.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it smells fine and works for 18-24 hours (all day and into the next morning), but the spreadability (or lack of it) is worth subtracting one star.</li>
            <li>an ice pack enclosed does not seem optimum, especially when the company only uses the (slower) USPS \\&quot;First</li>
            <li>Trying to limit chemicals on my body, I tried about 4-5 other popular products from the health foods stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, skin friendly, and works for the day.</li>
            <li>Also, you only need apply one or two swipes, no more, so one stick lasts several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: So great I bought 3 more!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m also very happy to leave my old chemical laced deodorant behind.</li>
            <li>I just warmed it up with my hair dryer for a few seconds and applied it hassle and residue free :)</li>
            <li>However, combine it with Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant and you have an effective combo that gets you through the next day.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s completely melted (runny liquid throughout), you can do the same thing, however, you&#x27;ll need to stir it with some kind of stirring</li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot to you, then you&#x27;re kinda missing the point of healthy products.</li>
            <li>I waited before writing this review to be sure that my old product had completely worn off.  </li>
            <li>It keeps you smelling nice and absorbs sweat to keep you dry, BUT this product has a high chance of drying out your skin, changing the color and texture, and giving you a rash.</li>
            <li>I do not have to reapply it, and I live in Washington DC, where the summers are very hot and humid.</li>
            <li>Judging by all the positive reviews, I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m the outlier here</li>
            <li>Judging by all the positive reviews, I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m the outlier here</li>
            <li>but then I stumbled across Jungleman and was pleased to see this had the same ingredients as I would have used to make my own except I didn&#x27;t have to go to the trouble.  </li>
            <li>I found many of the popular natural products DID not work (at least according to my wife).  </li>
            <li>: I used to use Gillette gel deodorants, which worked really well, but my armpits would get pretty itchy sometimes</li>
            <li>Yes, much to my disbelief, this stuff REALLY works!  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this is a deodorant, *not* an anti-perspirant, and you should be happy, too, though it does do a decent job keeping my underarms dry during a regular sedentary day (</li>
            <li>Pretty much all you need to know.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sweat through pretty much every deodorant on the shelf in the stores.</li>
            <li>Even with the week or so of pimple/cysts that passed, the cost, and the sometimes slightly challenging application, I expect this will be my deodorant of choice for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>am a smelly sweaty guy who rides a bicycle to work to commute, I work in an office, go to meetings, ride a bicycle home and to do errands, and pretty much sweat</li>
            <li>Jungleman on the other hand lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t wreck my shirts, and is overall a great product.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good alternative to the usual store bought aluminum, alcohol etc.</li>
            <li>Now compared to typical alum based deodorants, this doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well, but for being what it is, it&#x27;s actually pretty good.</li>
            <li>There seems to be more residue when applying to dry underarms that then has to be rubbed in.</li>
            <li>They will contact you directly and quickly if you have any questions.</li>
            <li>A quick wash with hot water and tide removes all of it, whereas aluminum stains being much more difficult to get marginally better.</li>
            <li>but they have all fallen short--they either don&#x27;t properly block odor or they are so strongly scented I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>Whatever they use for their concoction of ingredients certainly seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy or white marks on my clothes, it has a subtle fresh scent, and best of all, it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>Now coincidently at around the same time I started using this deodorant, I started using a new shower soap named Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soap - 18 in 1 Hemp TEA TREE Pure Castile Soap with organic oils.</li>
            <li>I took it with me to basic training and it seemed to work great and lasted me for two and a half months.</li>
            <li>I live in a Los Angeles beach city and right now it is around 70/75 degrees here.</li>
            <li>We live in Texas and it is record heat right now.</li>
            <li>I then left it in the room temperature for a couple hours and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>It looks like they&#x27;re properly addressing this issue because for one, it arrived fine to me (and I&#x27;m in a sunny location), and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little embarrassing, but hey, they were itchy and I was in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>I would have liked some sort of scent in there, bc although it does neutralize smell quite effectively a little bit of scent</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll put a little coconut oil under my arm (which can be used as deodorant on it&#x27;s own)</li>
            <li>I thought, what&#x27;s a little vanity for effective deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfectly good deodorant, my only issue with it is that the stick itself is very dry.</li>
            <li>Works good, but sorta hard on the pits.</li>
            <li>Good natural product, however temp changes can cause changes in the product..will recommend this product though a little expensive...will buy again</li>
            <li>If the price drops &amp; shipping is free (prime or add-on item), I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me I would much rather use a product that I might have to apply twice rather than using a product with aluminum.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this product a try!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to put too much where it rubs off on your clothes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m female and I imagine that maybe it&#x27;s easier to apply to smooth, hairless skin rather than a hairy pit as it goes for men.</li>
            <li>They used to have a three-pack so shipping was not so much of an additional percentage of the cost.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t perspire that much</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t even come out of the stick anymore because of how much of a mush</li>
            <li>This Jungleman deodorant works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>and I have a much sharper sense of smell than he does</li>
            <li>When the surface of the deodorant stick warms up, it glides onto your armpit much</li>
            <li>I like this stuff so much</li>
            <li>The name implies men, but its not just for men, because its really unscented.  </li>
            <li>And this really works.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to scratch it that much, but you know what itching is like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I&#x27;m lowering my rating of this from three stars to one star because I just can&#x27;t really recommend this to anyone based on my experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I&#x27;m lowering my rating of this from three stars to one star because I just can&#x27;t really recommend this to anyone based on my experience.</li>
            <li>I decided to give Jungleman a try, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much problem with sweating, but with BO.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend  this.</li>
            <li>It applies much easier, but does not work as well.</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant really works.  </li>
            <li>This really irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>I like these so much</li>
            <li>I bought a whole bunch of them.</li>
            <li>I got the whole family using this product now..  </li>
            <li>It really stops odor and seems to stave off sweat even though it is not an anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;d think something was working, and by the end of the day, not so much.  </li>
            <li>They worked very well.  </li>
            <li>tried Jungle Man based on the reviews here and wasn&#x27;t expecting much since I never heard of it before.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It smells like absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the real test.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and survived the FL summer sun because it was packed w/an ice packet.</li>
            <li>I am 6&#x27; and 170 pounds and do not sweat that much.</li>
            <li>This works well and does not smell much.</li>
            <li>But if you happen to shave under that area, I doubt this will be much of a bother</li>
            <li>Additionally, it is a smaller size, and seems to go fast - so it is definitely not the most economical option out there - thus the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to that,</li>
            <li>- this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>But if effectiveness is your only criteria, this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The deodorant itself doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
            <li>Really wanted a deodorant after decades of using products with aluminum.  </li>
            <li>It has no smell and works very well.</li>
            <li>I was using regular &amp;#34;Sure&amp;#34; deodorant for years because NOTHING in the organic, paraben and aluminum free section worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There really isn&#x27;t much to say.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I sweat so much during this time period,</li>
            <li>This deodorant really works.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and they packed an ice pack with it(live in AZ).  </li>
            <li>This product really worked for him.</li>
            <li>This product works very well and gives me no irritation.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even make it through one day of sitting at my desk wearing a light t-shirt and doing no physical exertion without sweating and stinking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend trying the holistic deodorant made by Real Purity.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed and awed really.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t roll on as smooth as commercial deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put on too much, it can leave a whitish residue if applied too strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(doesn&#x27;t even seem to leave much, if anything, on clothing if you let it &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; a bit before getting dressed).  </li>
            <li>The real test was just yesterday...</li>
            <li>I bought them for my whole family.</li>
            <li>Thanks You Jungleman &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I has no odor, no residue, and really works!&lt;br /&gt;BUYER</li>
            <li>It does the job, not a big smell to it, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue.</li>
            <li>I am one of those people who are very picky about what ingredients go into my body</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really really like Jungleman Deodorant.  </li>
            <li>One star off for the fact that the sticks always get really crumbly over time.  </li>
            <li>so much that&#x27;s not going to stop me from using it</li>
            <li>thanks, delivery folks for not reading the instructions on the box).</li>
            <li>I thought I had found it and really wanted to like this one.  </li>
            <li>but i can tell you that this really really works  </li>
            <li>but there is no odor i will be buying this again thanks</li>
            <li>Either they aren&#x27;t really &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and/or they do not work.  </li>
            <li>It is invisible, almost scentless and works for the whole day.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal for a feminine woman like me.</li>
            <li>I expect some odor when I sweat that much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to their website, I found out that the crystal deodorant I was using wasn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it on at night after my shower, and stay stink free until the following night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to whomever made this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and this really helps you feel protected.  </li>
            <li>but I finally was able to put this deodorant to the test with eight hours of yard work in direct sunlight.</li>
            <li>I even made my own for a while which worked but was messy.</li>
            <li>Jungleman was going to be the last natural deodorant I would ever try and 100% satisfied</li>
            <li>I was using the clinical strength deodorants from the local drug stores and they were not as effective as this all natural deodorant by far.</li>
            <li>After trying SSOOO many natural deodorants, this one finally kept me from needing to reapply every four hours, stinkwise.</li>
            <li>(my deodorant sticks arrived in a foil-type package inside of a box, most likely because the product is heat sensitive).</li>
            <li>I am a grown man with grown man funk and so far the Jungleman got me swinging!!!</li>
            <li>experienced no irritation or rash with this product, and that&#x27;s been an issue with several other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>it goes on better, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it may bother other people.</li>
            <li>But honestly that is a small price to pay for me to smell nice and not have to use harsh chemicals on my skin to do so.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and my wife has NOT complained even once!  </li>
            <li>I was striking out with other products like Toms, which stopped working after about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>It works even better than any other aluminum based antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I did get the slightest bit of a redness around the edges of my pits, probably due to the pH of the baking soda being much more alkaline than my skin</li>
            <li>My personal assumption is that there must be more to the list of ingredients that I am apparently allergic to</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, I have tried &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; deodorants before, with unscented usually meaning a very mild soap or clean smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks, deodorant maker, for providing a decent alternative to those chemical laden deodorizers of the masses.</li>
            <li>A clean, simple product (4 ingredients) that works well.</li>
            <li>In the past year I&#x27;ve been searching a good natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve been looking to use more natural products and that came with accepting the fact I will be a little more sweaty and a smelly.</li>
            <li>Yes 2.5 ounce is pretty small(used it for 2 months and have about 50% left), but no other natural deodorant works better than Jungleman.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as pleasant to apply as any other deodorants as well because of its dry texture.</li>
            <li>AT ALL, nor do you need to apply a lot to cover scents (which seem to fade over time-EVEN WITH A TON OF HIGH PERSPIRING EXERCISES) HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WILL USE FROM HERE UNTIL DISCONTINUED!</li>
            <li>I have tried other natural deodorants that were only marginally effective, but this one kept me completely odor free today in the 90+ degree heat.</li>
            <li>Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had to do a special &#x27;pit wash&#x27; midday, nor have I had to launder still-clean shirts that I&#x27;ve only worn for a couple hours because the pits are smelly.</li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts like most conventional deoderants.</li>
            <li>However, so far my arm pits stay dry for most of the day and at the end of the day do not smell like anything.</li>
            <li>The product itself runs out very quickly, so you will be ordering quite frequently, which is a problem (see items #1 and #2 above).</li>
            <li>Small price to pay for an otherwise AMAZING product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY</li>
            <li>In my book it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience for a spicy free day.</li>
            <li>The only true unscented deodorant in the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different natural/non toxic deodorants and some were okay, others not so much.</li>
            <li>I first switched from antiperspirant/deodorant products like Old Spice and Speed Stick to the Thai crystal deodorant stone.  </li>
            <li>Have never liked the price on this; always wanted it to be $4.99 w/ free shipping and would accept $5.99 w/ free shipping, but it&#x27;s always close to $10 which gives me stomach cramps every time I order it, but obviously really like it since I keep coming back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I have to skip my morning shower I can go a second full day without having to re-apply this product</li>
            <li>They actually ship the product with a cool gel pack.  </li>
            <li>We live in a synthetic world, no doubt!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enter my better half.  </li>
            <li>For a typical work day where I don&#x27;t sweat at all, I have zero issues and I am always pleased with this products results.</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>used this a couple times, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works better than Tom&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I had some perspiration (particularly when I was working out)</li>
            <li>Iong-lasting&lt;br /&gt;+ decent as an anti-perspiration, too&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural deodorant, without aluminum or antiperspirant that would keep me odor free for the entire day without staining my shirts.  </li>
            <li>but I could not wear a tank top or sleeveless because it is gross to see white chunk of power in your armpits.</li>
            <li>Contains mainly baking soda, and tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I can say for sure now that the unfortunately named Jungleman works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried for odour protection.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with putting a few drops of jojoba on it before applying to make it softer, and so far it has been effective.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s also amazing that it&#x27;s all natural and contains so few</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please buy this product, tell others, and create a steady and growing demand for it</li>
            <li>/&gt;After much research, I started using Jungleman and have been very surprised.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied enough that I decided to try using the Jungleman deodorant again to see if things would work out now that my skin was back to normal.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied enough that I decided to try using the Jungleman deodorant again to see if things would work out now that my skin was back to normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I ordered it, it arrived in a short cardboard tube (as it generally does) with a cool pack (sort of like an ice pack?)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product and company.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, upgrading this to a 5 star review.</li>
            <li>sweat like a monster while at work in 90 degree heat and high humidity.</li>
            <li>, I did not have high expectations for Jungleman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this Product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- melts in high heat</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and plan on using it from now on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for change.</li>
            <li>If youwant to avoid this I highly recommend the Earth Science Liken deodorant.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviewers saying to stick the deodorant under warm running water for a second (with the cap off) before applying it.</li>
            <li>Even better is that it all natural and no aluminum or other garbage is in it.</li>
            <li>After using Degree antiperspirant for a while, I decided to find something more natural to avoid the aluminum and other</li>
            <li>Much better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other natural deodorants as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like most other all natural products you sacrifice some type of convenience, in Jungleman&#x27;s case its the ease of application.</li>
            <li>Works better than other natural products.</li>
            <li>The dispenser is all-white and very generic-looking, so rebranding the product with a new look and new name would be worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels a little sandpapery - there are fine grains in the stick and extra work is required to apply it smoothly.</li>
            <li>I spent most of my life using name brands, Old Spice, Right Guard, etc, always causing underarm irritation, and yellow shirts.  </li>
            <li>, you will still perspire (which is healthy) and be &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; a little.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and just because it is called &amp;#34;Jungleman&amp;#34; does NOT mean it is just for men.  </li>
            <li>While I love the odor control (if you sweat a lot, you will find this deodorant running down your arms since it melts with body heat!)</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant, you should really try this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>A lot of natural items don&#x27;t work very well, but this one holds up.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s better than antipersperant / deoderant combos with the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth giving this a try if you don&#x27;t like anti-antiperspirant and actually expect deodorant to work blocking smells and not just covering them with fragrance.</li>
            <li>Unless you want extra-sticky sweat, just stick with the normal stuff</li>
            <li>ridden deodorant and for a long time and finally found it, after trying many brands.</li>
            <li>I did an exhausting amount of research and trials for different deodorants that would work for me and i finally found my best option.</li>
            <li>You still sweat (as there are no crazy chemicals that clogg your pores) but you don&#x27;t smell and your shirts don&#x27;t turn yellow colors in the underarm area!</li>
            <li>A little too much so, as it&#x27;s easy to get too much on.</li>
            <li>I have no BO at the end of the day and showering removes the product with no hard scrubbing.</li>
            <li>My lovely wife is my test subject!</li>
            <li>Alot of people have super sensitive pits, according to a Google search, and the same happened to them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d apply it after my shower and by the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t smell at all, which was nice, but occasionally I had that sore feeling, like somebody had punched me right in the armpit, which was a super weird reaction, and then eventually, I started to itch again.</li>
            <li>No bad smells long through the day!</li>
            <li>Just today I noticed some white stuff under my shirt right under the armpit area when I took it off</li>
            <li>Someone finally got it right.</li>
            <li>You might realize you have odor right after application upon your next use.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t sweat as much as I would have expected being the very first day of use.</li>
            <li>That same day, after I showered, I applied some vitamin E oil under my arms and was fine the next day.</li>
            <li>If you were to do a second application later in the day you would do just fine.</li>
            <li>I wanted a deodorant that was free of aluminum and any other chemical I couldn&#x27;t pronounce and also worked to control odor.  </li>
            <li>Other products either haven&#x27;t worked or caused a light burning skin irritation sensation.</li>
            <li>My husband works as a contractor, we live in north Florida and he is allergic to some of the ingredients in OTC deodorants.</li>
            <li>I live in AZ</li>
            <li>This is a link to the study from the New England Journal of Medicine:</li>
            <li>Then I went shopping and tried on new clothes</li>
            <li>That goes for clothing as well, leaving shirts just like new in the arm pit area.</li>
            <li>I only has FOUR ingredients, and I can hardly believe that it works as good as it does.</li>
            <li>Better than Tom&#x27;s of Maine but still not very effective.  </li>
            <li>At a moderate room temp, applying to the underarms doesn&#x27;t yield a smooth coat of the stuff, but a bunch of tiny semi-solid chunks.</li>
            <li>A bit of a smaller stick than anticipated and a bit harder to apply than anticipated too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall satisfied of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Worthwhile.</li>
            <li>its all natural which is the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, and had just about given up on deodorant.</li>
            <li>addition to being an antiperspirant (which very few organic deodorants can claim), this stuff can even keep you fresh for a full 24</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried since I didn&#x27;t really want to test it to that extreme the first day!</li>
            <li>I would put the shirt on after the application and mystery stains would show up on the left and right side near my stomach.</li>
            <li>I now wash my pits really well with bar soap and just apply a little (1-2 light swipes) of my old style deodorant.</li>
            <li>Like at least one other reviewer has experienced, it seems this product no longer works as well for me as it did before.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for nearly a year and it has exceeded all my expectations!  </li>
            <li>This is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used that actually prevents b.o.</li>
            <li>So I want my deodorants to be ALL natural!</li>
            <li>No odor, no excessive sweating.  </li>
            <li>Finally a natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working through the first stick I purchased back in August!</li>
            <li>First of all, it actually works!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s one flaw which is fatal enough for me to unfortunately never use the product again.  </li>
            <li>My significant other did not have this problem, though, and has used it for months with rave reviews.</li>
            <li>Finally a natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li>I never review products, this is my first time because this stuff actually works.  </li>
            <li>I thought I hit the jackpot of all natural deodorants!</li>
            <li>Without any other acidic ingredients to pH balance it, I can see how this product would not be skin friendly.</li>
            <li>We were elated, however I noticed after the first day that my pits were red from irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone a full 24 hours with absolutely no hint of odour, and that has never happened before.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t streak on clothing, and keeps you smelling clean long after it&#x27;s application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try not to overuse the product by applying too much pressure, but otherwise, this is product that stands above its competition.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve resorted to just using this when I know I will have a very busy, very stressful day, and definitely do not want to stink to high heaven.</li>
            <li>I want to support American companies that make healthy alternatives to conventional products, so I think I will keep buying Jungleman.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other natural deodorants and it seemed like they didn&#x27;t do a good job covering up the sweat smell.  </li>
            <li>but seriously I sweat pretty easily, so</li>
            <li>It was black now its light brown.</li>
            <li>This product has very simple ingredients, but those ingredients aren&#x27;t necessarily suitable for use on skin everyday.</li>
            <li>Well, after a couple weeks of using moisturizers on my armpits and switching full-time to the crystal roll-on deodorant, my itch had pretty much completely disappeared and the red irritation had cleared up.</li>
            <li>Well, after a couple weeks of using moisturizers on my armpits and switching full-time to the crystal roll-on deodorant, my itch had pretty much completely disappeared and the red irritation had cleared up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price aside, it really is a fantastic deodorant that is the combination of all the natural deodorant ingredients you have probably read about independently; does exactly what you want, no odor and last all day long.</li>
            <li>chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon using this the first time, with a small bit of cologne under each arm to go with it, I noticed that after a full day of work, NO SMELL WHATSOEVER.</li>
            <li>for those with EXTREMELY sensitive skin, this doesn&#x27;t break me out (itching or burning) like all of the past deodorants have--even the so called  top &amp;#34;organic ones&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a natural deodorant that works for me, and I haven&#x27;t had much luck.  </li>
            <li>But I used it for several months and never suffered anything more than slight irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(they come right out if you rub it with a dry towel).  </li>
            <li>This is coming from a large, hairy, and sweaty middle eastern man that lives in AZ.  </li>
            <li>He can not use peoducts with certain ingredients such as aluminum in them.  </li>
            <li>It does have an odd consistency and has to be rubbed in rather than just applied, but it&#x27;s worth it for how well it works!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little bit of red irritation from the scratching, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll clear up within a couple days since I&#x27;m tossing the Jungleman deodorant and making a permanent switch to the crystal stuff.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little bit of red irritation from the scratching, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll clear up within a couple days since I&#x27;m tossing the Jungleman deodorant and making a permanent switch to the crystal stuff.</li>
            <li>Jungleman keeps me stink free the whole day, even after a hard run and workout.  </li>
            <li>Jungleman is a deodorant, meaning that it keeps the bacteria that makes you smell bad from growing and it works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>I tried Sam&#x27;s Natural, which worked really well, but totally stained my shirts, even after a couple uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it clearly said on the package to keep it away from sun exposure.</li>
            <li>But after you rub it in, it becomes clear.</li>
            <li>The Jungleman deodorant both works very well and is clear of any potentially unwanted chemicals</li>
            <li>My workout clothes also do not stink as they did with Herbal Clear.  </li>
            <li>I have used all kinds of natural deos before</li>
            <li>So far my skin is not irritated but I will update, once anything happens.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband after trying what seemed to feel like every natural deodorant brand (Crystal Body, Herban Cowboy, Toms of Maine, JÄSON, etc) - none of which worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also made from all natural ingredients and not all those chemicals that there is now</li>
            <li>I always wanted to find a natural deodorant</li>
            <li>so far works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost a holy grail natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have mentioned white residue--I gently rub the product in after I apply it, and there is no whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All natural, lasts for days...</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural deodarant and anti-perspirant and chose this after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t even naturally apply to your pits.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li>If you are taking care of yourself and are committed to using a natural deodorant, then Jungleman should work for you.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this is completely unscented.</li>
            <li>Well tolerated for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The deodorant completely works.</li>
            <li>I like it but for me i guess its a 4 star because its not the ultimate protection I really wanted or what I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the natural ingredients of this product, but after a month of usage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a non-staining all natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>but I do not stink and the deodorant itself is completely odorless.</li>
            <li>So, I wanted a natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it..  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I&#x27;m not a tree hugger or natural</li>
            <li>So I did some reading, wow,</li>
            <li>It really has no smell, especially when applied.  </li>
            <li>I started looking for a natural deodorant and found Jungleman on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>What I am saying is if you are looking around for a natural deodorant</li>
            <li>So far, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but it does the job JUST as well as my old deodorant.  </li>
            <li>(who doesn&#x27;t stink towards the middle/ early evening anyways?</li>
            <li>, I want to find a natural deodorant that work for me.</li>
            <li>From Old Spice, to Gillette, to Dove deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Let me make my return trip to Target, do my test run, look for the same cash register attendant, have him ring me up, see if he rubs his nose in disgust, and then I can raise my arms up in celebration for no longer smelling like</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t think that was natural</li>
            <li>so i went on the hunt for a natural and healthier product to use.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product, unless you HAVE to have something that is natural.</li>
            <li>if you got sensitive skin then i would avoid</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having gotten used to what it feels like to when one&#x27;s armpits sweat naturally, wetness hasn&#x27;t been the issue but odor has.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to try the \\&quot;crystal\\&quot; as I was worried it would be too natural.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t smell like a hung over sailor nor a 14 year old baseball player.</li>
            <li>only thing I notice it is very pasty.</li>
            <li>wife tried it multiple times after shaving and it made her very itchy.</li>
            <li>natural</li>
            <li>I have to enthusiastically recommend this product to anyone who is health and hygiene conscious.</li>
            <li>Somehow this deodorant kills the bacteria with natural salts.  </li>
            <li>Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant?</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t sneak anything in like some natural deodorant makers do too, either.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Only thing I was surprised by is the smell.</li>
            <li>I purchased this deodorant after searching for a natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t contain propylene glycol or alum.</li>
            <li>Women buy beauty products, natural deodorant included.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, which you don&#x27;t one anyway because sweat is your body&#x27;s natural cooling system.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I wore it on and off throughout the summer, using a competitors natural deodorant when not using this one.</li>
            <li>It completely keeps me odor-free all day, even in the summer.</li>
            <li>and/or who are accustomed to the \\&quot;inconvenience\\&quot; of all natural products will have no issues with this product.</li>
            <li>I stumbled on jungleman and so far I haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it seems to keep the stink away all day as promised.</li>
            <li>YES Is it all natural?</li>
            <li>This is an all natural deodorant THAT WORKS.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a completely all-natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>If you look at my reviews from today, you will see that I review three natural deodorants, including this one.  </li>
            <li>I also had my doubts about using an all natural product like Jungleman.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised when I discovered just how well this prouct works.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural deodorant, and tried this one.</li>
            <li>Some people are sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with natural ingredients and aluminum-free.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s all natural but</li>
            <li>It is clearly a natural product.  </li>
            <li>But so far not this one.</li>
            <li>so far....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of all natural deodorants</li>
            <li>I have had to switch to natural deodorant cause</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this does not irritate me and is affective.  </li>
            <li>A lot of these natural deodorants dont work and are sticky.</li>
            <li>I have looked into a lot of natural alternatives to mainstream antiperspirant/deodorant to get away from the aluminum and</li>
            <li>If I had a presentation, I needed to keep on hand the old standby antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>this deodorant, 4 natural Ingredients, and it works wonderfly.</li>
            <li>I used Arm &amp; Hammer, Old Spice, Dove (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m liking it so far but juries still out.</li>
            <li>Running it under water solves that problem completely though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was never the case with my old</li>
            <li>I was ready to go to my local co-op and beg them to carry it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried probably every natural deodorant made.  </li>
            <li>For a natural product, exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t achieve complete odor elimination.</li>
            <li>All I can say is, WOW.</li>
            <li>This deodorant/anti-perspirant is BY FAR</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to combat odor all day, so my first stick is lasting a long time.</li>
            <li>However, I wasnt able to find it through the natural stores in my area or on amazon, when I checked a few months back.</li>
            <li>that unsurprisingly didn&#x27;t keep the product cool long enough to prevent melting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended Jungleman to several friends and all have agreed: it works, it works well, and it&#x27;s the only deodorant worth buying.</li>
            <li>: If product is cool (less than 80 degrees,) apply very slowly to allow body heat to warm it up</li>
            <li>I actually wouldn&#x27;t mind a version in lavender or some other EO, but unscented works just fine.</li>
            <li>Most truly natural/non-toxic deodorants are NOT strong enough for a man and leave me stinky.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that I can consistently use every day without irritation -- and, unlike some other products, it actually seems to work.</li>
            <li>There is actually a slight sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li>The problem with the deodorants that I have used in the past is the strong &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; smell that comes with them.  </li>
            <li>After searching high and low for a natural deodorant (that was really natural)</li>
            <li>It does take me a little longer to clean my underarms in the shower because of the oils used in the product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, quick shipment (arrived a week early) and the 4 and half stars doesn&#x27;t give this deodorant justice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an active guy; I do some kind of workout everyday.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to (you&#x27;ll find yourself checking your pits for a smell the first week or so) but it really does work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s virtually clear and any little white pieces you can easily rub</li>
            <li>I was getting really grossed out by the crusty yellow pit stains on my white undershirts, so I decided to start looking for a new brand.</li>
            <li>But seriously, this is one of my favorite Amazon finds ever.</li>
            <li>be sure to apply a small amount and move your arms back and forth to get it all in the armpit area.</li>
            <li>I could finally end my search after years of cycling through Walgreens, CVS, and Target for a decent deodorant.</li>
            <li>when cold like it is now in my bathroom, and gets a bit softer when warm, and will melt if hot (leave it in your car).  </li>
            <li>* be premium, not pay for the weight of a gel ice pack!--particularly when the USPS just puts in into the blazing hot mailbox anyway (in the middle of a Florida summer)--despite the warning label on the outside.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is that they make the name more unisex and perhaps come out with a small purse sized version.  </li>
            <li>But why would we put a product on our super absorbent pores with some of the same chemicals and heavy metals that we spend so much money every year to avoid in our drinking water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a few weeks now and it is as good as, if not better than, the Dove Men&#x27;s deodorant I had been using for years.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s harder and needs to warm up a little before it spreads easily, but literally all that means is you stick it on your pits, pause for a second, and then sweep like usual.</li>
            <li>My second stick (I still liked it enough to re-order) is just the opposite, and is a little too \\&quot;meltable.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>If you have problems applying this, I recommend doing some trimming in the armpits, it will help it go on smooth and actually help cut down on smells.</li>
            <li>It will probably soften up and be easier to spread in the summer, but right now I find I am using the other products I bought over this one.  </li>
            <li>I am a high school teacher at a girls prison and have never felt self-conscious during class because it wasn&#x27;t working well enough (</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying the high price simply because I feel this product is friendlier to my body than the chemical-laden mainstream brands.</li>
            <li>ordered a few sticks of the Jungleman deodorant because it made the shipping cost a little more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>In general I don&#x27;t have strong body odor or excessive perspiration.</li>
            <li>As for me, it&#x27;s back to plain old baking soda and water (paste) after my morning shower to keep me odor free all day, then witch hazel after my evening shower to work overnight to soothe any irritation that developed from the baking soda.</li>
            <li>When I applied it to my underarm it made a huge mess, a white chalky paste smeared all over my underarm which then ended up all over the inside of my shirt.</li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant I have every used, and I say that because its natural, not an anti-perspirant, doesnt have horrible ingredients like aluminum, and IT WORKS REALLY</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;ll apply this all natural deodorant to my underarms and this keeps me fresh for long periods of time, without having to reapply often (long hikes, etc) or worrying about that odor when sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s important to anyone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s by no means &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; when first applied; You&#x27;ll need to be careful putting on your shirt and check for deodorant streaks</li>
            <li>I normally get rashes from regular deodorant depending on the brand.</li>
            <li>It takes a week or so of use to get used to a product like this, as its very different then the normal options.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little \\&quot;white\\&quot;, but dissipates quickly, and almost immediately if you rub it in.</li>
            <li>Having eschewed anti-perspirants 20+ yrs ago, I&#x27;ve traversed the damp and often smelly path of &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants with little success until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One major plus is that it is a solid, which is not common among deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I would have given this product 5 stars, however, the downfall is when it is hot it melts and when put in the fridge, it gets too hard therefore \\&quot;not too hot, not too cold\\&quot; type of product.</li>
            <li>I find that when switching deodorants, it takes several weeks for my body to adjust to the new deodorant.  </li>
            <li>If necessary I will post an update when my new stick arrives.  </li>
            <li>I tried a new one and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li>I have tried several deodorants, both natural and completely unnatural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an office worker and am not physically active during the day.  </li>
            <li>Only problem is paying so much for shipping bringing the item total to almost $10.00.</li>
            <li>After ruining another expensive polo shirt, I decided to look of natural alternatives that would be easier on my wardrobe but still be effective.</li>
            <li>It has the same thick, chalky consistency that many of the non-natural, aluminum-containing deodorants have.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting really pissed paying shipping for every single piece even if I buy 4 at a time.</li>
            <li>Change can be tuff but for me it had a major payoff.</li>
            <li>used all the major name brand deordorants with problems.</li>
            <li>The major downside is the removal of your armpit hair.</li>
            <li>If it wears off, do not expect your armpits not to smell, put some more (before it is too late)!</li>
            <li>There was just a little to clean up on the outside where it ran out while it was softened.</li>
            <li>This one fits the bill just fine, but for one complaint.  </li>
            <li>Knowing I am not polluting my body with chemicals or other questionable substances is great.</li>
            <li>I tried &amp;#34;Take A Whiff&amp;#34;, DeodoMom Roll-on (which worked for a week or so), and whole bunch of other ones from natural &amp; organic stores.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was a miracle that a natural deodorant could keep me fresh for a day and half (if I were to shower in the morning and then sleep in the next day before showering again).</li>
            <li>Jungle Man is very dry and doesn&#x27;t really have any of what deodorant company&#x27;s call &#x27;glide&#x27;...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey with shipment charges tacked onto each stick, but I think it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It made my armpits itch, left a residue that I had to wash off the next day, and worked decently as an antiperspirant</li>
            <li>It made my armpits itch, left a residue that I had to wash off the next day, and worked decently as an antiperspirant</li>
            <li>If you wear long sleeve everyday and hide your armpit all the time, this product is great (seriously).</li>
            <li>I tried to use it a few more times but again, would not spread--just solid as a rock and very dry.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost laughable, but it&#x27;s amazing in it&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;Baking soda, tea tree oil, corn starch, and palm oil.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it will last long (the whole stick),&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The only problem is because it has baking soda it doesnt go on clear.</li>
            <li>Be careful when applying this if you do have a small scent of odor already (in a case where say maybe you weren&#x27;t able to shower for a day because of hiking, crashing at someone&#x27;s place, etc.).</li>
            <li>usually use Now Foods Long Lasting Deodorant Stick and need to apply it once or twice a week at most.</li>
            <li>Jungleman works very well and has absolutely no toxic ingredients (baking soda, cornstarch, tea tree oil, palm oil).  </li>
            <li>After using this product I have thrown away all my old deodorants and I haven&#x27;t looked back, this is what I use when I work.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this all-natural deodorant after using regular Ax and Old Spice deodorants and anti-persperants all my life.</li>
            <li>My husband put it on the first morning, worked outside in 106 degree weather, and by the next morning before showering (we waited that long to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>That constant searching for a natural deodorant that works is over.</li>
            <li>is one of only two natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried (out of *</li>
            <li>but I have struggled to find a product that I felt was natural and would not harm my body.....and also actually worked.  </li>
            <li>Wanting to avoid aluminum in my deodorant, I&#x27;ve tried natural deodorants, only to discover that they don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>So far the stains have come out in the wash, but the staining is still a big drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its more difficult to apply, because its much firmer than traditional sticks.</li>
            <li>It is the only natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li>Apparently some people have a sensitivity to prolonged contact with baking soda, which is one of the ingredients in this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the salt rock crystal thing and Tom&#x27;s of Maines version of natural deodorant and neither work well or last.</li>
            <li>But sweating is natural and the only way to block sweat is with chemicals that are toxic to your body (aluminum, titanium, etc).</li>
            <li>For having only having 4 ingredients [sodium bicarbonate, corn starch, sustainable palm oil, tea tree oil] and no scent whatsoever, I was genuinely surprised at</li>
            <li>but apparently it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but this product aint really what i expected.</li>
            <li>the way, this isn&#x27;t the only all natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t work for me, as neither</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male who&#x27;s used natural cosmetics for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY one that works 100%, is truly natural/non-toxic and completely unscented.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the heat melts them in the box.  </li>
            <li>I thought that I may have to go back to my old stuff until I found this.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t prevent you from sweating, so your body can do its natural thing, but it totally eliminates odor.</li>
            <li>was worth a try though, sorta worked, but the overall, not worth it.</li>
            <li>Once I made the switch, my clothes smelled FAR less strongly than they had with my previous synthetic deodorant.</li>
            <li>It smells good but is not good if your a heavy sweater.</li>
            <li>When I received the deodorant in the mail, it was broken and defective---I was able to get a replacement.</li>
            <li>Okay, I use unscented speed stick anti-perspirant because my skin reacts poorly to scented deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other natural and chemical deodorants, tea tree oil, and even pure baking soda, with no such adverse effects like jungleman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>various formulas of Tom&#x27;s, Jason, Origins, Kiss My Face, Crystal, etc., even straight coconut oil), is that they either only worked for short durations or  not at all, or were mere &#x27;cover&#x27; for odor--even if I washed my pits at some point during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Jungleman for four days (I know, not exactly a longterm eval), but the difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li>and it left white stain on all the new clothes I try on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve paid two or three times as much for natural deodorants that didn&#x27;t work half as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s all natural, so this makes sense in the absence of a &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; agent).</li>
            <li>This product gets very soft when warm and is shipped to you on a cold pak.</li>
            <li>I just shoved the broken part back in and used as normal, seems to be fine.</li>
            <li>The only bad thing was it was pretty warm when I ordered it</li>
            <li>I used other deodorants that I&#x27;ve purchased from Whole Foods and on the internet</li>
            <li>But as the description says it is shipped in a very protective packaging with a package of &amp;#34;Ice coolant&amp;#34; to help ensure that the contents don&#x27;t liquefy in extreme heat.  </li>
            <li>Turned into a goopy mess in hot weather.</li>
            <li>: I also use this in combination with other natural/light scented deodorants or cologne (since this smells like absolutely nothing).</li>
            <li>I have never before found a natural deodorant that actually prevents me from smelling for at least a full day.  </li>
            <li>My only other complaint is that I have to apply this pretty heavily and it is drying out my skin and leaving my underarms kind of flaky.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, so most deodorants make me break out pretty bad, I&#x27;ve also had trouble getting any of them to work</li>
            <li>This Jungleman deodorant is a white solid that becomes clear when applied.</li>
            <li>The only natural deodorant I know of that actually works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be going back to Gillette and risking Alzheimers until I find another all natural alternative that actually works.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for years for a natural deodorant that actually works and have finally found one!  </li>
            <li>Only deodorant I have ever found that actually works and does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>consistency is flaky (chalky, almost but not dry like chalk), and so you have to grind it over your armpit to get coverage.</li>
            <li>It just takes a little more effort than regular deodorant and goes on a little thicker.  </li>
            <li>First day, applied (it&#x27;s a little sticky), went to work and waited to see what would happen.</li>
            <li>I have tried various ones that I purchased at health stores and even at major chain stores.  </li>
            <li>Note, I have very sensitive skin and almost every single deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried five other \\&quot;natural deodorants\\&quot; (a phrase that is a misnomer, as aluminum and arsenic are natural, but I digress)</li>
            <li>but I think I have finally found the answer to my long search for a quality natural deodorant!</li>
            <li>the first few weeks of using it, my armpits felt...</li>
            <li>It is also my first &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; but is not sticky and you can&#x27;t tell after a few minutes of application.  </li>
            <li>But that is a small price to pay for smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>My first stick broke into a few pieces at times</li>
            <li>Now for a day where I might be sweating heavily or out and about walking on a hot summers day, this product seems to protect me well for 5-6 hours and after that will start to breakdown a bit.</li>
            <li>yes, as some have mentioned, it does go on pretty messy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Eventually, my right armpit was so itchy that I ended up scratching it one night until it actually hurt in the morning and for the next few days.</li>
            <li>All of them, gel, solid, clinical strength, sports, all day ones, womens, mens, natural, not natural, scented and unscented....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how long I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep your armpits dry, it is just some sticky residue  like loose glue, it&#x27;s nothing that special, and it rubs off onto your shirt too after awhile, not worth it IMO.  </li>
            <li>so I have to apply at least one more time during the day, since I get a little stinky, but it&#x27;s generally unnoticeable unless you put your nose in there.</li>
            <li>I am a repeat buyer and have tried EVERY SINGLE natural and chemical-laden product out there.</li>
            <li>it works fine just a small amount once every or every other day.</li>
            <li>However, after a few weeks, I noticed that the product started producing a distinct unpleasant musky smell on its own.</li>
            <li>(The other two major carriers leave packages near doorways as opposed to in mailboxes, fwiw.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(The other two major carriers leave packages near doorways as opposed to in mailboxes, fwiw.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is definitely all natural and last long (throughout the day)</li>
            <li>No unpleasant scents or odors, suppresses body-odor build up for at least 24 hours in my tests so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps I could have done with less coverage, but I was not comfortable with a light dusting (I don&#x27;t like to smell).</li>
            <li>I was super skeptical of this stuff, but it really does work.</li>
            <li>Then I got pregnant and really wanted to at least try a few out.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product, and it is very hard to find a product such as this in any store, including any of the all-natural stores.  </li>
            <li>I usually try to buy deodorants with very minimal light scents, but you can still start to smell it once you sweat.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant keeps me fresh all day, even if I&#x27;m working hard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the other natural deodorants only to be disappointed that they don&#x27;t work or to find that they really aren&#x27;t natural.</li>
            <li>I also liked how they ship it with an ice pack to ensure it doesn&#x27;t arrive at doorstep a sloppy mess..</li>

            <li> Just great!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of the best &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And the best part is, it is odorless, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel slimy or make me feel a bit nauseous</li>

            <li> AWESOME.</li>
            <li> The best thing about it was how it came packaged.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever.  </li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> As a deodorant it is wonderful, but I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> Which I (and my wife) are very happy it doesn&#x27;t contain all the harmful chemicals like others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Out of 10 products, this was the best one.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome at stopping sweat and odor.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  </li>
            <li> Was using Men&#x27;s Science which I loved, but does it have gold bullion chips in it or something!!??  </li>
            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine 24hr was the best I knew of until I tried this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the performance of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> It is the best I&#x27;ve ever used at preventing odor, not even the ones with aluminum worked as well as this has for me...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> And one of the best characteristics of it is that it has no odor</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, despite the name, it works great for WOMEN, too!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!  </li>

            <li> Amazing!!</li>

            <li> This stuff is incredible.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service!  </li>
            <li> Good product!</li>
            <li> Started buying it for my boyfriend, worked so good for him that I now use it as well!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> A lady from Alabama stated that this product worked great for her husband.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> ... works great...</li>
            <li> Was a great value</li>
            <li> skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy when I started using it and the climate was cooler</li>
            <li> Great deodorant to try if you want a truly unscented, odor blocking application.</li>
            <li> My brother was extremely happy about this and is stuck on this deodorant permanatenly.</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> It works great for a deodorant.</li>
            <li> This was a great item</li>
            <li> 24 hrs and still works great.</li>
            <li> This product is a great, all-natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for an all-natural deodorant without aluminum, this is a great one to try.</li>
            <li> but I am happy.  </li>
            <li> I still think this is great product.  </li>
            <li> lol)</li>
            <li> Great stuff - does everything it says.  </li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great</li>
            <li> I was always used to scented deodorants, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I ended up finding Jungleman on Amazon with great reviews, and thought that I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Great</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product works great, eliminates any body odor, and also appears to lessen perspiration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, great product, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for hunters too.  </li>
            <li> Great deodorant.</li>
            <li> My wife is so happy that I found a deodorant that works.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> then switched to Earth Science Liken (lichen) deodorant, which works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I used to buy prescription strength deodorant, and this stuff works great.  </li>
            <li> So happy with this one.</li>
            <li> So happy I found this.</li>
            <li> works great for both sexes.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work great.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with how effective it is.</li>
            <li> Works great, but</li>
            <li> Really great product.</li>
            <li> This is great product.</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> Very effective, lasts all day, no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I used to use the salt crystals which was also very effective.</li>
            <li> product has been very effective for me.</li>
            <li> However, when they got delivered and i tried it out all i can say is IT&#x27;S AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I will be using this product until I make my own!</li>
            <li> I have never found a deodorant that is more perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Mitchum produces fine products that are among the best in the market</li>
            <li> It irks me to pay $6 for a 3oz product + $4 for shipping - but it&#x27;s good nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for 3 days now (including a sweaty beach &amp; street fair day) and there is no smell at all.</li>
            <li> The BEST aluminum free deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> applying, it uses a fair amount</li>
            <li> Quit good</li>
            <li> Good folks.</li>
            <li> This product may be good for some, it just did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> It does a good job neutralizing smells as well.</li>
            <li> after i had a good workout.</li>
            <li> I walked around the fair all day and got home Saturday evening.</li>
            <li> IT is a good product, but not all that it is cracked up to be...&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> not apply good underneath the arms..</li>
            <li> that smelled good (I think).  </li>
            <li> I had a good experience with the Jungleman customer service representative.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think a lot of people would enjoy the fragrance of this soap, but the TEA TREE oil is especially effective at cleansing and killing bacteria just as Jungleman is with the TEA TREE oil it contains.</li>
            <li> Works good as a deodorant, although you will still sweat.  </li>
            <li> Goes on in the morning, and works for a good 10 hours or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to stay away from aluminum and no product over the counter comes close to how good jungleman works.</li>
            <li> good news is I come home and of all places</li>
            <li> What I did find is if you just put it under your arm, and let it warm up for about 10 seconds then apply it works out great.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a lot of money for a good deodorant</li>
            <li> and it does hold up fairly well.</li>
            <li> , as it does not contain baking soda and has good reviews.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and works good.</li>
            <li> That being said, it doesn&#x27;t make me smell good or anything, just not smell at all.</li>
            <li> Loved this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Good product, no irritation with it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many many kinds and this seems to be the best for preventing odor with my chemistry.  </li>
            <li> The shipping is great to, they included an icepack to make sure it got to me in good shape.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> It feels strange to call a deodorant impressive, but I was seriously impressed.  </li>
            <li> Perfect pricing, and COMPLETELY worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased by its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I saw this product had many great reviews</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and will be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> Thank you SO much for a great product &amp; amazing service!!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, feels good on my skin, and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: do not use in heat.</li>
            <li> I am sure it may work perfectly for others, as it is an amazon bestselling deodorant and my situation is pretty uncommon.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit pasty, so it will clump as you apply, but on the bright side, it will keep you smelling good through most of the day.</li>
            <li> Great natural deodorant, happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> In an attempt to see if I could get away without being burned by jungle man, and for the most part it was successful.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love the name too!</li>
            <li> buy more!</li>
            <li> I hope they have not changed their original formula again as I loved it just the way it was!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> To top it all off, it cost me $10 for this deodorant!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It works soo much better than TOMS!</li>
            <li> So healthy!</li>
            <li> It has a beautiful lime scent that works and blends in brilliantly with one&#x27;s natural body odor.</li>
            <li> It works great and lasts me a full day as it does a good job at preventing odor.  </li>
            <li> This stuff if kind of amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aMAZing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AMAZING odor control.</li>
            <li> This one works amazing.</li>
            <li> I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this product is.  </li>
            <li> Its amazing it allows me to sweat</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Jungleman deodorant is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Works great and keeping you odor free.</li>
            <li> for me, amazing product will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> Be honest about your product.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more and am absolutely delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> wore this all day + a sweaty workout and Jungleman was completely effective.</li>
            <li> The deodorant stick fell apart (and kind of melted) in about a month of use.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product that stopped any BO</li>
            <li> It makes me feel uber-manly, which is spectacular since I&#x27;m a chick.</li>
            <li> In fact, you won&#x27;t have any kind of odor at all.</li>
            <li> And after using it for probably a good month or two now, I can safely say that it&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Effective.  </li>
            <li> it makes your armpits kind of sweaty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as effective, but it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so effective, though, that this can be overlooked.</li>
            <li> I never thought it would be SO effective.</li>
            <li> deodorant, effective but I am not a man that perspire a lot.</li>
            <li> The scent always bothered me, so I liked the unscented and I never sweated or smelled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s, Arm and Hammer, and Burt&#x27;s Bees, but none of those are effective on my stinky pits.  </li>
            <li> This product is effective for odor control BUT the abrasive properties of the baking soda make it unsuitable.....</li>
            <li> i was using a popular deodorant that was leaving a slippery film on my shower pouf every time i took a shower.  </li>
            <li> I looked into making my own deodorant, and would have probably tried that,</li>
            <li> all natural&lt;br /&gt;+ effective (</li>
            <li> This deodorant doesnt irritate me, and it is effective against stinky armpit smells.</li>
            <li> As honest as it gets.</li>
            <li> It seems to be equally as effective, with easier application and no staining.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an effective deoderant (not an antipersperant) that didn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell and also worked.</li>
            <li> It is extremely effective.</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews about this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> today\\&quot; kind of tinge,</li>
            <li> I really thought jungleman was going to be \\&quot;the\\&quot; deodorant perfect for myself</li>
            <li> Best of the organic deodorants that I have tried, it really does work.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s how much I liked it.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of going &amp;#34;All Natural&amp;#34; for a deodorant, but this didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> an all-natural deodorant could be so effective.</li>
            <li> the absolute best product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> when on is uhm, not the best and kinda smells like ejaculate but a squirt or two of your favorite cologn or perfume masks right over it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is very effective and is, itself, fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> I even told the guys I was trying a new deodorant and to help me evaluate it by letting me know if it was failing, and believe me, they would lol!</li>
            <li> Works Works Works, and is safe, odor free, and all around a great buy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t glide as easily as most deorderants, but it works a lot better than any that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t because this is one of the best natural deodorants I have tried!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Best all-natural deodorant I have ever purchased by far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair (read: almost albino), so it was very noticeable.</li>
            <li> but this one is the most effective.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best one I have found.  </li>
            <li> On its own, it gets you through most of the day.  </li>
            <li> But the ingredients and effectiveness are so far the best I have seen.</li>
            <li> I also gave a Jungleman to my adult son out of state and he swears its the best he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Anyway, for us it&#x27;s more effective than aluminum antiperspirant for controlling odor.</li>
            <li> far as odor-fighting effectiveness, this deodorant is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> The BEST natural deodorant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is in fact the most effective deodorant I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant ever.  </li>
            <li> Jungle Man is the best Natural Deodorant I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried alot of them.</li>
            <li> Even with those issues it is still the best natural deodorant I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, this is definitely a great great product that is definitely worth the money, and worth trying out.  </li>
            <li> So far, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Weleda Rose Deodorant(which smells great at first</li>
            <li> I have used many deodorants and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This deodorant, however, works the best and uses simple, proven, and effective ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am SO happy to have found a safe deodorant that actually works and with the customer service being so great, I am happy to give my once a month business (at minimum) to such a great company.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy ;)</li>
            <li> After a first couple days, it worked great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to just cover up odor, but rather prevents its development in the first place which is great.</li>
            <li> I wanted something strong and effective and I have found it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easily the best natural deodorant Ive tried.</li>
            <li> Very good ALL natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t just swish it on real quick because it doesn&#x27;t glide.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> If I am going to work out after working all day or if I plan to exert myself for hours on end, I will bring it with me to re-apply once more if needed.</li>
            <li> I forgot to mention that the mfg. sends this product out real quick.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t think it works any better than the OTCs, I think it helps more than others and is better than I&#x27;ve found anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> my Sure did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found this stuff</li>
            <li> keep sweating at bay most of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad to see this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> my favorite deoderant.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but after 6 months it started giving me a rash.  </li>
            <li> I now use it off and on trading days with  DeoMom deodorant and it has started working again, and I don&#x27;t have a rash any more.  </li>
            <li> work ok for the most part</li>
            <li> Jungleman brand deodorant is better at wetness protection, odor control, and doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts.</li>
            <li> A great product that I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Not all that satisfied with this product...stings and  leaves  one itching at times...also does not exit the container</li>
            <li> in all, this product is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> What I also love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t stain any of my shirts.</li>
            <li> This worked well most of the time (but not always).  </li>
            <li> It works, but I&#x27;ve discovered that if I use it 3 days in a row or more, my underarms start itching</li>
            <li> This product works much better than the Kiss</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend, ever since I read a study on how most OTC deodorants has a chemical in them&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s more than I can say for the Jungleman deodorant.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s more than I can say for the Jungleman deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it, and just ordered another one.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> The second order (6 each) was delivered to a PO box, and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love them.  </li>
            <li> I tried putting more product on, but it irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ironically, it is not advised to order this product during the summer months when it would be most needed.  </li>
            <li> In many ways it works better than Mitchum, which is something I would not have believed before I tried it.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING and nothing could mask my odor for more than 5 hours.  </li>
            <li> Besides being free of chemicals &amp; toxic metals.. this is the most effective deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li> I never heard of Jungleman deodorant before, but the more I learned about it</li>
            <li> I thoroughly put on the product just to make sure my underarm areas are fully covered.  </li>
            <li> I had better results with the Thai crystal deodorant stone, but again that contained aluminum.  </li>
            <li> No horrible rash.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a lie - I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> , the corn starch absorbs some sweat, the tea tree oil is anti bacterial, and the palm oil is a safe carrier to mix it all together.  </li>
            <li> It works better than any deodorant or antiperspirant that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more for myself and friends.  </li>
            <li> Pretty nice!</li>
            <li> And I do notice that if I don&#x27;t shower at night, I make sure to shower or wash it off in the AM before putting it on again.</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure what it helps with yet</li>
            <li> It takes more work</li>
            <li> The shirt was touching my pits when I would pull the shirt over my head.</li>
            <li> (going organic, ingesting more greens and superfoods)</li>
            <li> My quality of life improved exponentially after acquiring this deodorant! :) :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for Tom&#x27;s of Maine (which I&#x27;d used for years but started to irritate my skin) and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold this product in more stores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it were able to glide more smoothly, like a gel (a la Old Spice gel) or like Tom&#x27;s unscented deodorant which applies flawlessly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, IMHO, it should never take more than a couple days to get a product into the mail.</li>
            <li> it make more sense to ship in a manner that accommodates buyers from ALL climates at any time of year??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, done with the rant.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> it make more sense to ship in a manner that accommodates buyers from ALL climates at any time of year??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, done with the rant.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and so does he.</li>
            <li> sticks I&#x27;ve been able to find without all the crazy-cancer-talk in the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> Definitely glad I found this baby.</li>
            <li> I am sure it is from the additives.</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic all natural deodorant, I have tried most and this works the best!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The crystal stick (mineral salt) worked ok, but I needed to apply liberally to achieve effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Works much better that way.}</li>
            <li> I love the ingredient profile on this although I ran into some complications.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Very happy overall with this product and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> but it works better than that stuff does.</li>
            <li> I just ordered more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using this, and the cysts stopped after a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> This product still works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I imagine I will continue to use this deodorant for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I used to use suave clinical stregth -this works better</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about the potassium alum in it</li>
            <li> I love most about Jungle Man deodorant</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve either ended up in the trash, or I&#x27;ve kept them but had to reapply more than once throughout the day (which isn&#x27;t always the most convenient thing to do).  </li>
            <li> BEWARE: be sure that when you purchase, it says that it is being shipped from Jungleman Naturals.</li>
            <li> I was using the crystal for a couple of years and then it stopped working, and I learned that it isn&#x27;t completely safe since it still contains aluminum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for a truly healthy invisible deodorant, the search continues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the Jungleman Deodorant.</li>
            <li> i do find myself using more cologne</li>
            <li> Also, I must mention that the item I received was well packaged (came with cooling ice gel to make sure the item didn&#x27;t melt if exposed to heat during shipping).</li>
            <li> One interesting side effect is that my underarm hair seems to have lightened.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but sure does the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am highly satisfied with Jungleman and will buy more, even though it costs more.</li>
            <li> These were better than Jason&#x27;s but just couldn&#x27;t stop the BO.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t think it works as an antiperspirant but overall its an excellent product.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is simply the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> If I use Anti_Perspirants: I dont sweat in my pits most of the time</li>
            <li> most anti-perspirants tend to irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;JUNGLEMAN</li>
            <li> The unscented has tea tree oil which I think adds even more protection.</li>
            <li> tend to defeat most deodorants, and I am not fond of anti-perspirants.  </li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect balance.</li>
            <li> Overall is  excellent!</li>
            <li> I told myself to wait to be cautious and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> After many years in search of the perfect deodorant I finally found it!!!</li>
            <li> I dare say this works better than antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> the ingredients are top notch</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees works a bit better but it stains your undershirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the service has been outstanding and everything you would want from a seller.  </li>
            <li> From my experience, my armpits have lasted 13 hours without smelling (by that time I needed to apply more).</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if it continues to impress, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> The BEST thing I love about this deodorant is that it is VERY easy to rinse off in the shower compared to other brands that literally stick to your hair/skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I guess the lack of chemicals is cool, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any kind of improvement or difference.</li>
            <li> I guess the lack of chemicals is cool, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any kind of improvement or difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and unless it stops working for me or they stop making it, I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> I am now ready to reorder once again and am happy to find Jungleman easily available on Amazon</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant because of all the rave reviews and most of the natural deodorants I tried haven&#x27;t been very effective.</li>
            <li> This is the first and best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried!  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned rubbing a dab of shea butter into the armpits before applying Jungleman; that sounds like it would make the product apply more smoothly</li>
            <li> But more importantly, IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> I was surprised after using this at the great reviews that don&#x27;t seem to mention residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly a year and it works great.  </li>
            <li> but I wish it was more smoothly.  </li>
            <li> and I see they have more varieties available as well.  </li>
            <li> So glad this is available.</li>
            <li> It really is incredible and such a relief that I have found one that I can recommend to others.</li>
            <li> and it really is a great natural deodorant in terms of odor prevention/wetness minimization.</li>
            <li> i use it for the first time, and i&#x27;m very satisfied  </li>
            <li> Smooth long swipes seems to be the best I can do</li>
            <li> The company owners are great people who are clearly invested in their customers.</li>
            <li> There are better deodorants available.</li>
            <li> I got off on Saturday morning expecting to go take a shower, but we ended up going straight to the Ohio State Fair.</li>
            <li> Additionally, what impressed me was how it was scent free, but still left me odor free.</li>
            <li> But I decided to give it a try since the price was good and what did I have to lose really</li>
            <li> This one gets you through the day, feels good on your skin, and is absolutely all-natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From the rave reviews...I really was expecting a superior product.  </li>
            <li> However, the scent I have (Mountain spring) is very light and fresh and the application is very very smooth -</li>
            <li> Even the first stick was usable, and I love the product!</li>
            <li> I have had this stuff on for full days, no reapplying, and there is NO odor at the end of the day!  </li>
            <li> it is the best vs. the competition in every other way.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t apply easily).</li>
            <li> product goes on fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> You also want to make sure your underarms are fully clean and odor-free before putting on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then it applies easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I can go 24  hours easily and this deodorant still works.  </li>
            <li> This dissipates very quickly though.</li>
            <li> it doesnt go on easy.</li>
            <li> applied in the morning and before going to bed, it still had a strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything strong.</li>
            <li> Aluminum has a strong link to causing breast cancer.  </li>
            <li> Should you have any questions in the future, please feel free to contact us and we&#x27;ll be more than happy to help you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants but this stuff is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This one not only doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> First, I received both deodorants nicely packaged with a gel icebag to prevent them from melting.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this you&#x27;re obviously interested in removing all the poisonous toxins so prevalent in the majority of body products out there, yet looking for something that&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3 months and am especially pleased to be able to write a review to say that this is the real deal...</li>
            <li> I ended up working in a very hot school portable moving books around and sweating  pretty good.</li>
            <li> At first she didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d like it, because it goes on kind of pasty</li>
            <li> If you buy more than one, just keep the extras stored in a cool place.  </li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the BEST all-natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is hands down the best at controlling odor.</li>
            <li> it should be good as new.  </li>
            <li> I am a man, but I imagine, because it is unscented and has no musky smell, women would be fine with trying this as well.  </li>
            <li> so it goes on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s one of those people who can forget deodorant and he&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I put the product in the fridge for a couple of hours and it was fine.</li>
            <li> and they all worked fine.</li>
            <li> I am not a small man prone to smelling good at all times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried for YEARS to find a good all natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li> By far the BEST NATURAL deodorant out there!  </li>
            <li> I use almost exclusively natural products on my skin and have gone several years without using any kind of deodorant (Of course, I shower twice a day and have very good hygiene.)</li>
            <li> This is probably the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far out of 3 it seems to stay on longer</li>
            <li> This is by far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or otherwise.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t enjoy paying $9 for deodorant).  </li>
            <li> It does not go on smoothly and can irritate one&#x27;s armpits.  </li>
            <li> I preferred the light mint scent though.</li>
            <li> It does work as a deodorizer and keeps armpits stink free.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality.</li>
            <li> My Face fragrance free roll-on deodorant I used for years</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine that a product so free of chemicals could do that, so I just kept using it.</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, but honestly, that doesn&#x27;t bother me that much anymore.</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, but honestly, that doesn&#x27;t bother me that much anymore.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Not available in retail locations</li>
            <li> Pursuing aluminum free, as we all should, I&#x27;ve tried virtually everything out there...</li>
            <li> the more I thought it was worth giving a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my underarms remain just about odor free.</li>
            <li> , I was about to ask my primary care Physician to prescribe something because NO deodorant/antiperspirant worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I tried all the ones available at CVS and Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> Then come in Jungleman and I have truly been odor free for 2 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> but throughout the day I was odor free.  </li>
            <li> For anyone looking for an alternative to the aluminum-heavy deodorants available at drug stores, this is the answer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have it&#x27;s own smell</li>
            <li> I honestly was just testing this out, and didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> It has a light medicinal herbal scent.</li>
            <li> honestly, I don&#x27;t even care that much about that.</li>
            <li> It starts to get pricey when you include shipping so find a way to make your own or purchase for the whole year.</li>
            <li> I just wish there were free shipping on it.</li>
            <li> aluminum free deodorants with some smelly consequences.  </li>
            <li> I am SO happy that this level of service is provided by this seller as I will be ordering regularly from him from here on out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a really good, unscented natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> As far as natural deodorant goes, this is excellent.</li>
            <li> far as deodorants go, this product does a good job at preventing odor.  </li>
            <li> This product is good because it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> sure if the product comes in larger quantities, but that would be a good idea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been looking for a good, natural deodorant without aluminum or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ive been on the hunt for a good natural deodorant since my crystal roll ons stopped working.</li>
            <li> used to apply all natural deodorants that smelled good but didnt work</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> So far it has worked okay, although hasn&#x27;t been completely effective in eliminating odor.</li>
            <li> Most natural deodorants are very strongly scented.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a strong scent, I just observe far more than most do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty smooth for me, I just make sure to swipe UP</li>
            <li> Definitely worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> However, when you DO get it on - its odorless, lasts long and it works great.</li>
            <li> First let me say that most deodorants irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love it!to the blazing hot mailbox anyway</li>
            <li> The product is definitely worth trying!  </li>
            <li> Now that is success!</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this product, it pulled my hair out, didn&#x27;t control my sweating or stank.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, you want to make sure that the stick of deodorant does not stay in an area that is too hot when you are not using it, or it will melt into an unusable mush form.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth skin issues!</li>
            <li> My original order was damaged in shipping &amp; a replacement was sent no questions asked.  </li>
            <li> the bright side, I ordered this because my skin is sensitive to most deodorants (gets very itchy) and</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an ultra-distance bicyclist who wanted a deodorant that would not interfere with the body&#x27;s cooling system but leave me smelling clean after 50 to 150 miles.</li>
            <li> He also appreciated that the company responded to the reviews about the packaging and took great care and detail and sending it with an icepack and a sealed exposure proof package and clearly labeled about sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how my under-arms never felt completely clean when using Ax, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely the simplest, most effective anti-persperant I&#x27;ve come across yet, can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> Stuff works great as for keeping you dry and smell free,&lt;br</li>
            <li> , no perfume smell at all, and it washes completely clean in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I go by the reviews, for the most part they were positive, so I bought this for him.</li>
            <li> Just tank top it or wear wicking cotton materials when it&#x27;s super hot</li>
            <li> DO NOT apply this deodorant right after shaving!</li>
            <li> It applies decently and washes off great in the shower, so you don&#x27;t get that old antiperspirant smell or feeling.</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I received it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a warm body, and tend to sweat a little more than most.  </li>
            <li> It is 100% natural, with no toxic chemicals or perfume and the best of all: it will keep you dry and fresh all day!</li>
            <li> I ruined a couple of my good shirts which is a bummer, they have white stains that will not come out</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been a dream come true.</li>
            <li> Note this does NOT stain clothes, which is a plus, but it does not keep you smelling sweet either.</li>
            <li> I might try Tom&#x27;s of Maine next; I&#x27;ve heard good things about that brand, though you know how that can</li>
            <li> I might try Tom&#x27;s of Maine next; I&#x27;ve heard good things about that brand, though you know how that can</li>
            <li> Just as good as regular deodorant.  </li>
            <li> :) This all-natural deodorant really works by inhibiting bacterial growth...</li>
            <li> I tried to find a good alternate, non-scented solution.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It keeps &amp;#34;pit stains&amp;#34; off your dress shirts and can survive a trip to the gym after a full day of work.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product that really works.</li>
            <li> Store it somewhere cool and it won&#x27;t be a</li>
            <li> It protects well, but not as good as the regular brands with unnatural products.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me, i.e., does not burn or feel irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from controlling any odor very well, the two things that I like best about Jungleman: what it does contain and, just as equally, what it does not contain.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night after a shower and after a nights sleep, a full day of work, the gym, whatever I throw at it, there is no BO smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I loved the simple ingredients and that it had no smell.</li>
            <li> No bad stuff and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> It came in a special package with an ice pack which was super cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed my rating from a 3 to a 5 because I still think it&#x27;s a good product if you live in a place where you don&#x27;t sweat much.</li>
            <li> Something about putting metal in your pores to stop you from sweating doesn&#x27;t sound right.  </li>
            <li> First off, the package was sent very quickly and was shipped with product care in mind.</li>
            <li> I did read reviews of other people who said it worked great for a couple of days</li>
            <li> Great deodorant that works rather than just masking odor with a scent, perfume, and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Of course different people react differently but for me, this is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> I quickly stopped using it.</li>
            <li> but it goes quick.</li>
            <li> What I do is to wet the top of the stick with warm water before applying it to each armpit, and it goes on a bit easier.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-perspirants/deodorants throughout the years that have destroyed my shirts over time and never left me satisfied.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;re super nervous/</li>
            <li> shipped with a cooling package in it, got it extremely quick.</li>
            <li> Lucky me.</li>
            <li> There is literally no drop off from traditional deodorants, and may even be better than most for oder protection and dryness.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, and I develop an odor quickly.  </li>
            <li> For me it works better than the toxic commercial deodorants and I love the fact that I&#x27;m not using those harmful products on my body.</li>
            <li> However unlike aluminum-based deodorants, Jungleman All-Natural stains come out with a quick wash.  </li>
            <li> so I was very impressed about the short and simple ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I went about a week using no deo and found out quick</li>
            <li> luckily it works well for me, my girlfriend tried one of my spare sticks of jungleman and got rashes.</li>
            <li> I did receive it quickly, so perhaps this company has stepped up it shipping process.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that this stuff knocks out the stink, but some people like myself may not be able to tolerate the main ingredient - baking soda.</li>
            <li> Better than anything made by any major brands and definitely the best natural option.</li>
            <li> They also include a stay cool pack inside the packaging to insure that the deodorant doesn&#x27;t melt during the hot summer months!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an excellent product that can go head to head against any other deodorant, natural or not.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of aluminum free deodorants, and this was the first one that lasted all day without causing</li>
            <li> I have tried Tom&#x27;s, Jason, Bert&#x27;s Bees, and other natural deodorants, but this is the best product for me.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Have used for couple of weeks daily very satisfied will order again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the best deodorant I have ever used, natural and conventional included.</li>
            <li> My new favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and smelling good all day.</li>
            <li> Plus I don&#x27;t think anyone wants to smell strong deodorant coming from another person&#x27;s armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most deodorants give me a rash or don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Jungleman All Natural Deodorant is BEST deodorant I&#x27;ve EVER used, hands down.</li>
            <li> no complaints from the students either and believe me, they are not shy!).  </li>
            <li> Even after intense sweaty workouts I still smell like....NOTHING!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more in a natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> And I have got to say that this stuff REALLY WORKS!!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life i actually rarely have sweat spots in my arm pits!</li>
            <li> but then it becomes more dry when you dab it off and apply more.</li>
            <li> This is only the 3rd aluminum free deodorant I have tried but this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> That really does help it go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The amazing thing about this product is that not only does it work to keep odor at bay, but it doesn&#x27;t have to clog your pores to stop from there being any odor!</li>
            <li> Great for the outdoors or even for an everyday use.</li>
            <li> AMAZING odor protection from this actually all-natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product would absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I settled on making my own that had fairly similar ingredients to jungleman.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that this is completely</li>
            <li> Thank you for a healthy, responsible, alternative, that works so very well.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive armpits and most deodorants either give me a rash or just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My husband liked this and used it for several weeks before breaking out in hives.</li>
            <li> I rarely itch anymore, the skin is a lot healthier, and I don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t tolerate most deodorants.  </li>
            <li> When I was near the end of the Jungleman dispenser/tube, the insert the deodorant gets pushed up on fell out, so I probably missed out on one or two more uses of the product.  </li>
            <li> It actually works, smells great and is all natural.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m thinking I might try the mint, but honestly, after two weeks, my skin isn&#x27;t red anymore, and I think I&#x27;ve adjusted.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I was pursuaded to use a more natural product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many natural deodorants trying to find one without sketchy ingredients that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go so far as to say it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> I ordered it and found it to be extremely simple and effective for me and the rest is history.  </li>
            <li> I love this natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Trader Joes standard antiperspirant stick which kind of works, but Jungleman does wonders.</li>
            <li> Of course, after viewing the simple ingredients list, you may be inclined to make your own deodorant and save yourself some money.</li>
            <li> and it works better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or otherwise.</li>
            <li> Together it&#x27;s a powerful combination.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had body odor for years now, but wanted to try something more natural because I heard about the ill-effects of aluminum.</li>
            <li> But she noticed that after several minutes, the pastiness kind of disappears.</li>
            <li> and I have learned to trust that I won&#x27;t stink just because there isn&#x27;t some absurdly powerful perfume smell attached to it.</li>
            <li> So far, it is okay.  </li>
            <li> Still works though, you just have to let it harden back up and kind of scoop it and rub it in.</li>
            <li> I found this product to actually be quite nice</li>
            <li> There are fraud companies out there (such as Action Development Group) that are taking advantage of a great product and selling it, yet are  unauthorized sellers.</li>
            <li> I had to microwave one of them for 10-12 seconds to warm the product up enough to twist the bottom dial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I even found this, too all those people getting irritation, could it be from the corn starch from what I am able to tell.</li>
            <li> I love this all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to my first use, I got rid of the edges of the product with a tissue, to make it smooth for the first application.</li>
            <li> I love the all natural components.  </li>
            <li> The odor may permanently stay with the stick and then future applications will not be as effective at blocking odor.</li>
            <li> It has completely eliminated bodily scents, which is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> but it tended to make me sweat (not so anti perspiring) and stink more, thus far I do not sweat or stink.</li>
            <li> The only challenge is that it doesn&#x27;t go on as easily and quickly as most deodorants, sometimes pulling out hairs or whatever, but to find something that truly works, even after a long day mountain biking, etc. is amazing.</li>
            <li> : If you live in a hot area like I do, make sure to let the seller know in a note for your order.</li>
            <li> Jungleman is unscented, but it works better than even my old Right gaurd.</li>
            <li> Even better, he didn&#x27;t break out in any rash like he has to so many other brands (both organic and not).</li>
            <li> After a long day working outside, there can start to be a hint of body odor but for most days and scenarios, this stuff is simply the best.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to reapply if you&#x27;re going out in the evening, or before bed if you want to stay sleep in cuddly nice for a significant other, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> but it does not smell and is infinitely superior to all the other products I tried.  </li>
            <li> After just two days, my right armpit started itching again and I caught myself scratching.</li>
            <li> After just two days, my right armpit started itching again and I caught myself scratching.</li>
            <li> right after I shower before applying this.</li>
            <li> does right for me.</li>
            <li> I stopped use right there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just thrilled that it actually works, and works really well!</li>
            <li> Will just have to find a better way to get more of it down here in the subtropics, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Will just have to find a better way to get more of it down here in the subtropics, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Despite the good reviews I just don&#x27;t see these and legitimate replacements for conventional deodorants.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any allergic reactions that some other reviewers experienced (perhaps high ph, or tea tree oil reaction).</li>
            <li> The formula must be lacking whatever it is that allows you to smoothly apply it like a normal deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t just work a little better; it works a lot better.</li>
            <li> know everybody&#x27;s body chemistry is a little different, and what works for one might not work for another, but I am VERY happy with this stuff!</li>
            <li> It is not quite as easy to put on as some of the other deodorants out there; it takes a couple more swipes on the armpits to get it sufficiently</li>
            <li> I certainly do!)  </li>
            <li> (I could tell it was more oil and less dry) but it still worked great for me</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up on natural deodorants; I tried so many and none of them gave me the protection I needed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have particularly sensitive underarms, but if you&#x27;ve had that problem, I recommend giving this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;No strong scent, so</li>
            <li> This works really well for me - and love the fact that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t spread on the skin as easily as it&#x27;s non natural counterparts&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for a deodorant more intense than the natural one I was using.  </li>
            <li> The whole point of using a natural deodorant is that it would be better for my body.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought all of the good reviews here on Amazon were fake -- and I bought the product anyway.</li>
            <li> The very first day, I applied it after taking a shower and went out the whole night including dancing at a club, No smell</li>
            <li> Feels good, prevents smell when exercising and not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> You can stop shopping for a natural, aluminum free deodorant right here.</li>
            <li> when hiking, jogging, working out etc, and after such I&#x27;ve asked my wife to smell my underarms (that&#x27;s love right there...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found yet, though it is a bit stiff to put on; definitely pulls hairs, but I&#x27;ll deal with it.</li>
            <li> Plus it is very, very, very, sticky.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> My wife is using it, too, and likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> Their ingredients are great, truly natural with no imposture chemicals used by other brands.  </li>
            <li> First off, I must say this works very, very well.</li>
            <li> The major drawback of this stuff is that if it gets too warm (e.g., after a hot shower), it will become extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I used to use Old Spice and Right Guard, and this stuff actually seems to work better!  </li>
            <li> Natural was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first time I tried a deodorant that didn&#x27;t have aluminum</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to last most of a day or all day and night depending on activity level.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used consistently without irritation.</li>
            <li> Thus, I more than likely would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The first was a flop</li>
            <li> After my first use, it irritated my underarms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really not totally unscented, like 100%... more like 95%...</li>
            <li> The deodorant is smooth and soft, not slimy, and is completey unscented, definitely works as described and is safe.</li>
            <li> Somehow this odorless bar keeps your underarms completely odor free.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% all-natural, which is the first qualification.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put it through its paces from nervous sweats in office meetings to manual labor sweats in a hot, humid summer.</li>
            <li> He applied it the moment he received the package  (around 11 am) and he didn&#x27;t reapply till the next day; more than twelve hours.</li>
            <li> packaging on the deodorant should be noted: It was very well packaged!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s fine, but man, I couldn&#x27;t be less satisfied with my Jungleman experience.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s fine, but man, I couldn&#x27;t be less satisfied with my Jungleman experience.</li>
            <li> It provides moderate protection and for the price I was expecting a better product.</li>
            <li> Do not order it to be delivered in a hot environment though.</li>
            <li> My first stick was delivered to a hot mailbox, and was melted when I got it.</li>
            <li> I WILL buy more this winter, in order to be stocked for next year.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Very itchy and rashes!  </li>
            <li> Beyond that, I love the product after using it for a month, and will keep using it for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is really unscented!  </li>
            <li> Funny to say that I suffer from anosmia/hyposmia (inability/reduced ability to smell/ detect odor)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After showering and drying myself with a towel, I soak a cotton pad with 90% isopropyl alcohol and wipe both of my underarms to kill most bacteria left.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Jungleman!</li>
            <li> I have been trying different products now for more than 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Most of my T-shirts are colored so this caused a big problem.</li>
            <li> Thanks Jungleman!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think I would like the &amp;#34;no sent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and man I am not sorry one</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;re looking for something that is better than you&#x27;re current deodorant in my opinion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the side affects to my armpits, or any long term problems, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great deodorant stick.  </li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this, my product melted and leaked all over the package.</li>
            <li> , i will definitely buy more soon.</li>
            <li> now, heck I was probably one of their first customers.  </li>
            <li> so I continue to be an avid supporter.  </li>
            <li> I love that you CAN be all natural and odor free at the same time!</li>
            <li> this is what you want for a free and clear product.</li>
            <li> I immediately ordered 2 more after my first purchase to have as a back</li>
            <li> - I am looking at you ;)</li>
            <li> It would make me more likely to repurchase the item if they did...</li>
            <li> Jungleman works all day, and let&#x27;s just say that I am someone who really needs deodorant!</li>
            <li> Upon waking the following morning after having the deodorant on for 24 hrs or more, I NEVER have smelled any body odor.</li>
            <li> I love that it has simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty sweaty guy and have used all sorts of deodorants to-date, including antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Something that actually WORKS, unlike many products sold on the store shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sweating a lot throughout this hot summer, and odor has not been an issue.</li>
            <li> but I was still able to put the pieces back and use them.</li>
            <li> At first I figured that it was just some fluke thing going on with my body</li>
            <li> My most recent order was placed on a Sunday</li>
            <li> To top it off, I&#x27;m still using the same stick from three months ago!</li>
            <li> first then apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought lots of items on Amazon, but this is my first time leaving a review...</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;ve found that if you rub the excess &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; into your skin, it smooths out pretty well</li>
            <li> First of all, I could not get the product to twist up so that I could try it.</li>
            <li> This is true, but I&#x27;ve found that holding the stick on my skin for a few moments before moving it around softens it nicely.  </li>
            <li> Hoping I have better luck with it - I don&#x27;t want to go back to aluminum based deodorant!</li>
            <li> Some customers said beware that it may arrive melted if it&#x27;s hot out.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant exceeded my expectations and I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> but I found using a lighter pressure when applying it makes it flow on and apply pretty well.</li>
            <li> I refuse to smear anything on my body that I don&#x27;t know exactly what each ingredient is and what it does.  </li>
            <li> NOTES TO ALL:&lt;br /&gt;it is more like a solid stick deodorant.</li>
            <li> ONE AND TRY IT FIRST.</li>
            <li> This deodorant blew my mind the first day I used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Keeps your underarm virtually scentless even in hot and humid summer conditions.</li>
            <li> I formerly used the Burts Bees but this is better.  </li>
            <li> When I first found Jungleman deodorant</li>
            <li> works really well and only needs reapplication later in the day when you are sweating a great deal (tropical or desert conditions, no air conditioning or working out</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I am 30 year old man and very satisfied customer from Slovenia (the only disadvantage is that shipping for two sticks costs 10€).</li>
            <li> I am still using the first one that I ordered in december 2012</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how good it is when I perspire heavily after a run.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Jungleman Naturals for creating a natural product that WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> Natural deodorants suck!!!!</li>
            <li> Unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried with the same premise this stuff is by far the very best.  </li>
            <li> I would still highly recommend this product as looking at the reviews many people absolutely love it and my boyfriend uses it everyday with no issues.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it smells fine and works for 18-24 hours (all day and into the next morning), but the spreadability (or lack of it) is worth subtracting one star.</li>
            <li> an ice pack enclosed does not seem optimum, especially when the company only uses the (slower) USPS \\&quot;First</li>
            <li> Trying to limit chemicals on my body, I tried about 4-5 other popular products from the health foods stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, skin friendly, and works for the day.</li>
            <li> Also, you only need apply one or two swipes, no more, so one stick lasts several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: So great I bought 3 more!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m also very happy to leave my old chemical laced deodorant behind.</li>
            <li> I just warmed it up with my hair dryer for a few seconds and applied it hassle and residue free :)</li>
            <li> However, combine it with Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant and you have an effective combo that gets you through the next day.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s completely melted (runny liquid throughout), you can do the same thing, however, you&#x27;ll need to stir it with some kind of stirring</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot to you, then you&#x27;re kinda missing the point of healthy products.</li>
            <li> I waited before writing this review to be sure that my old product had completely worn off.  </li>
            <li> It keeps you smelling nice and absorbs sweat to keep you dry, BUT this product has a high chance of drying out your skin, changing the color and texture, and giving you a rash.</li>
            <li> I do not have to reapply it, and I live in Washington DC, where the summers are very hot and humid.</li>
            <li> Judging by all the positive reviews, I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m the outlier here</li>
            <li> Judging by all the positive reviews, I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m the outlier here</li>
            <li> but then I stumbled across Jungleman and was pleased to see this had the same ingredients as I would have used to make my own except I didn&#x27;t have to go to the trouble.  </li>
            <li> I found many of the popular natural products DID not work (at least according to my wife).  </li>
            <li> : I used to use Gillette gel deodorants, which worked really well, but my armpits would get pretty itchy sometimes</li>
            <li> Yes, much to my disbelief, this stuff REALLY works!  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this is a deodorant, *not* an anti-perspirant, and you should be happy, too, though it does do a decent job keeping my underarms dry during a regular sedentary day (</li>
            <li> Pretty much all you need to know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sweat through pretty much every deodorant on the shelf in the stores.</li>
            <li> Even with the week or so of pimple/cysts that passed, the cost, and the sometimes slightly challenging application, I expect this will be my deodorant of choice for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> am a smelly sweaty guy who rides a bicycle to work to commute, I work in an office, go to meetings, ride a bicycle home and to do errands, and pretty much sweat</li>
            <li> Jungleman on the other hand lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t wreck my shirts, and is overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good alternative to the usual store bought aluminum, alcohol etc.</li>
            <li> Now compared to typical alum based deodorants, this doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well, but for being what it is, it&#x27;s actually pretty good.</li>
            <li> There seems to be more residue when applying to dry underarms that then has to be rubbed in.</li>
            <li> They will contact you directly and quickly if you have any questions.</li>
            <li> A quick wash with hot water and tide removes all of it, whereas aluminum stains being much more difficult to get marginally better.</li>
            <li> but they have all fallen short--they either don&#x27;t properly block odor or they are so strongly scented I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> Whatever they use for their concoction of ingredients certainly seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy or white marks on my clothes, it has a subtle fresh scent, and best of all, it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> Now coincidently at around the same time I started using this deodorant, I started using a new shower soap named Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soap - 18 in 1 Hemp TEA TREE Pure Castile Soap with organic oils.</li>
            <li> I took it with me to basic training and it seemed to work great and lasted me for two and a half months.</li>
            <li> I live in a Los Angeles beach city and right now it is around 70/75 degrees here.</li>
            <li> We live in Texas and it is record heat right now.</li>
            <li> I then left it in the room temperature for a couple hours and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> It looks like they&#x27;re properly addressing this issue because for one, it arrived fine to me (and I&#x27;m in a sunny location), and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little embarrassing, but hey, they were itchy and I was in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> I would have liked some sort of scent in there, bc although it does neutralize smell quite effectively a little bit of scent</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll put a little coconut oil under my arm (which can be used as deodorant on it&#x27;s own)</li>
            <li> I thought, what&#x27;s a little vanity for effective deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfectly good deodorant, my only issue with it is that the stick itself is very dry.</li>
            <li> Works good, but sorta hard on the pits.</li>
            <li> Good natural product, however temp changes can cause changes in the product..will recommend this product though a little expensive...will buy again</li>
            <li> If the price drops &amp; shipping is free (prime or add-on item), I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me I would much rather use a product that I might have to apply twice rather than using a product with aluminum.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this product a try!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to put too much where it rubs off on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female and I imagine that maybe it&#x27;s easier to apply to smooth, hairless skin rather than a hairy pit as it goes for men.</li>
            <li> They used to have a three-pack so shipping was not so much of an additional percentage of the cost.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t perspire that much</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t even come out of the stick anymore because of how much of a mush</li>
            <li> This Jungleman deodorant works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> and I have a much sharper sense of smell than he does</li>
            <li> When the surface of the deodorant stick warms up, it glides onto your armpit much</li>
            <li> I like this stuff so much</li>
            <li> The name implies men, but its not just for men, because its really unscented.  </li>
            <li> And this really works.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to scratch it that much, but you know what itching is like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m lowering my rating of this from three stars to one star because I just can&#x27;t really recommend this to anyone based on my experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m lowering my rating of this from three stars to one star because I just can&#x27;t really recommend this to anyone based on my experience.</li>
            <li> I decided to give Jungleman a try, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much problem with sweating, but with BO.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend  this.</li>
            <li> It applies much easier, but does not work as well.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant really works.  </li>
            <li> This really irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> I like these so much</li>
            <li> I bought a whole bunch of them.</li>
            <li> I got the whole family using this product now..  </li>
            <li> It really stops odor and seems to stave off sweat even though it is not an anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;d think something was working, and by the end of the day, not so much.  </li>
            <li> They worked very well.  </li>
            <li> tried Jungle Man based on the reviews here and wasn&#x27;t expecting much since I never heard of it before.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It smells like absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the real test.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and survived the FL summer sun because it was packed w/an ice packet.</li>
            <li> I am 6&#x27; and 170 pounds and do not sweat that much.</li>
            <li> This works well and does not smell much.</li>
            <li> But if you happen to shave under that area, I doubt this will be much of a bother</li>
            <li> Additionally, it is a smaller size, and seems to go fast - so it is definitely not the most economical option out there - thus the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to that,</li>
            <li> - this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> But if effectiveness is your only criteria, this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The deodorant itself doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
            <li> Really wanted a deodorant after decades of using products with aluminum.  </li>
            <li> It has no smell and works very well.</li>
            <li> I was using regular &amp;#34;Sure&amp;#34; deodorant for years because NOTHING in the organic, paraben and aluminum free section worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There really isn&#x27;t much to say.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I sweat so much during this time period,</li>
            <li> This deodorant really works.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and they packed an ice pack with it(live in AZ).  </li>
            <li> This product really worked for him.</li>
            <li> This product works very well and gives me no irritation.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even make it through one day of sitting at my desk wearing a light t-shirt and doing no physical exertion without sweating and stinking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend trying the holistic deodorant made by Real Purity.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed and awed really.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t roll on as smooth as commercial deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put on too much, it can leave a whitish residue if applied too strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t even seem to leave much, if anything, on clothing if you let it &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; a bit before getting dressed).  </li>
            <li> The real test was just yesterday...</li>
            <li> I bought them for my whole family.</li>
            <li> Thanks You Jungleman &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I has no odor, no residue, and really works!&lt;br /&gt;BUYER</li>
            <li> It does the job, not a big smell to it, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who are very picky about what ingredients go into my body</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really really like Jungleman Deodorant.  </li>
            <li> One star off for the fact that the sticks always get really crumbly over time.  </li>
            <li> so much that&#x27;s not going to stop me from using it</li>
            <li> thanks, delivery folks for not reading the instructions on the box).</li>
            <li> I thought I had found it and really wanted to like this one.  </li>
            <li> but i can tell you that this really really works  </li>
            <li> but there is no odor i will be buying this again thanks</li>
            <li> Either they aren&#x27;t really &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and/or they do not work.  </li>
            <li> It is invisible, almost scentless and works for the whole day.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal for a feminine woman like me.</li>
            <li> I expect some odor when I sweat that much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to their website, I found out that the crystal deodorant I was using wasn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it on at night after my shower, and stay stink free until the following night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to whomever made this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and this really helps you feel protected.  </li>
            <li> but I finally was able to put this deodorant to the test with eight hours of yard work in direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> I even made my own for a while which worked but was messy.</li>
            <li> Jungleman was going to be the last natural deodorant I would ever try and 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> I was using the clinical strength deodorants from the local drug stores and they were not as effective as this all natural deodorant by far.</li>
            <li> After trying SSOOO many natural deodorants, this one finally kept me from needing to reapply every four hours, stinkwise.</li>
            <li> (my deodorant sticks arrived in a foil-type package inside of a box, most likely because the product is heat sensitive).</li>
            <li> I am a grown man with grown man funk and so far the Jungleman got me swinging!!!</li>
            <li> experienced no irritation or rash with this product, and that&#x27;s been an issue with several other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> it goes on better, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it may bother other people.</li>
            <li> But honestly that is a small price to pay for me to smell nice and not have to use harsh chemicals on my skin to do so.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and my wife has NOT complained even once!  </li>
            <li> I was striking out with other products like Toms, which stopped working after about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> It works even better than any other aluminum based antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I did get the slightest bit of a redness around the edges of my pits, probably due to the pH of the baking soda being much more alkaline than my skin</li>
            <li> My personal assumption is that there must be more to the list of ingredients that I am apparently allergic to</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, I have tried &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; deodorants before, with unscented usually meaning a very mild soap or clean smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks, deodorant maker, for providing a decent alternative to those chemical laden deodorizers of the masses.</li>
            <li> A clean, simple product (4 ingredients) that works well.</li>
            <li> In the past year I&#x27;ve been searching a good natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve been looking to use more natural products and that came with accepting the fact I will be a little more sweaty and a smelly.</li>
            <li> Yes 2.5 ounce is pretty small(used it for 2 months and have about 50% left), but no other natural deodorant works better than Jungleman.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as pleasant to apply as any other deodorants as well because of its dry texture.</li>
            <li> AT ALL, nor do you need to apply a lot to cover scents (which seem to fade over time-EVEN WITH A TON OF HIGH PERSPIRING EXERCISES) HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WILL USE FROM HERE UNTIL DISCONTINUED!</li>
            <li> I have tried other natural deodorants that were only marginally effective, but this one kept me completely odor free today in the 90+ degree heat.</li>
            <li> Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had to do a special &#x27;pit wash&#x27; midday, nor have I had to launder still-clean shirts that I&#x27;ve only worn for a couple hours because the pits are smelly.</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts like most conventional deoderants.</li>
            <li> However, so far my arm pits stay dry for most of the day and at the end of the day do not smell like anything.</li>
            <li> The product itself runs out very quickly, so you will be ordering quite frequently, which is a problem (see items #1 and #2 above).</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for an otherwise AMAZING product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY</li>
            <li> In my book it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience for a spicy free day.</li>
            <li> The only true unscented deodorant in the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different natural/non toxic deodorants and some were okay, others not so much.</li>
            <li> I first switched from antiperspirant/deodorant products like Old Spice and Speed Stick to the Thai crystal deodorant stone.  </li>
            <li> Have never liked the price on this; always wanted it to be $4.99 w/ free shipping and would accept $5.99 w/ free shipping, but it&#x27;s always close to $10 which gives me stomach cramps every time I order it, but obviously really like it since I keep coming back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I have to skip my morning shower I can go a second full day without having to re-apply this product</li>
            <li> They actually ship the product with a cool gel pack.  </li>
            <li> We live in a synthetic world, no doubt!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enter my better half.  </li>
            <li> For a typical work day where I don&#x27;t sweat at all, I have zero issues and I am always pleased with this products results.</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> used this a couple times, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works better than Tom&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I had some perspiration (particularly when I was working out)</li>
            <li> Iong-lasting&lt;br /&gt;+ decent as an anti-perspiration, too&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural deodorant, without aluminum or antiperspirant that would keep me odor free for the entire day without staining my shirts.  </li>
            <li> but I could not wear a tank top or sleeveless because it is gross to see white chunk of power in your armpits.</li>
            <li> Contains mainly baking soda, and tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I can say for sure now that the unfortunately named Jungleman works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried for odour protection.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with putting a few drops of jojoba on it before applying to make it softer, and so far it has been effective.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s also amazing that it&#x27;s all natural and contains so few</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please buy this product, tell others, and create a steady and growing demand for it</li>
            <li> /&gt;After much research, I started using Jungleman and have been very surprised.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied enough that I decided to try using the Jungleman deodorant again to see if things would work out now that my skin was back to normal.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The first time I ordered it, it arrived in a short cardboard tube (as it generally does) with a cool pack (sort of like an ice pack?)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product and company.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, upgrading this to a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> sweat like a monster while at work in 90 degree heat and high humidity.</li>
            <li> , I did not have high expectations for Jungleman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this Product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- melts in high heat</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and plan on using it from now on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for change.</li>
            <li> If youwant to avoid this I highly recommend the Earth Science Liken deodorant.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviewers saying to stick the deodorant under warm running water for a second (with the cap off) before applying it.</li>
            <li> Even better is that it all natural and no aluminum or other garbage is in it.</li>
            <li> After using Degree antiperspirant for a while, I decided to find something more natural to avoid the aluminum and other</li>
            <li> Much better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other natural deodorants as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like most other all natural products you sacrifice some type of convenience, in Jungleman&#x27;s case its the ease of application.</li>
            <li> Works better than other natural products.</li>
            <li> The dispenser is all-white and very generic-looking, so rebranding the product with a new look and new name would be worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels a little sandpapery - there are fine grains in the stick and extra work is required to apply it smoothly.</li>
            <li> I spent most of my life using name brands, Old Spice, Right Guard, etc, always causing underarm irritation, and yellow shirts.  </li>
            <li> , you will still perspire (which is healthy) and be &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; a little.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and just because it is called &amp;#34;Jungleman&amp;#34; does NOT mean it is just for men.  </li>
            <li> While I love the odor control (if you sweat a lot, you will find this deodorant running down your arms since it melts with body heat!)</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant, you should really try this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> A lot of natural items don&#x27;t work very well, but this one holds up.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s better than antipersperant / deoderant combos with the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth giving this a try if you don&#x27;t like anti-antiperspirant and actually expect deodorant to work blocking smells and not just covering them with fragrance.</li>
            <li> Unless you want extra-sticky sweat, just stick with the normal stuff</li>
            <li> ridden deodorant and for a long time and finally found it, after trying many brands.</li>
            <li> I did an exhausting amount of research and trials for different deodorants that would work for me and i finally found my best option.</li>
            <li> You still sweat (as there are no crazy chemicals that clogg your pores) but you don&#x27;t smell and your shirts don&#x27;t turn yellow colors in the underarm area!</li>
            <li> A little too much so, as it&#x27;s easy to get too much on.</li>
            <li> I have no BO at the end of the day and showering removes the product with no hard scrubbing.</li>
            <li> My lovely wife is my test subject!</li>
            <li> Alot of people have super sensitive pits, according to a Google search, and the same happened to them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d apply it after my shower and by the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t smell at all, which was nice, but occasionally I had that sore feeling, like somebody had punched me right in the armpit, which was a super weird reaction, and then eventually, I started to itch again.</li>
            <li> No bad smells long through the day!</li>
            <li> Just today I noticed some white stuff under my shirt right under the armpit area when I took it off</li>
            <li> Someone finally got it right.</li>
            <li> You might realize you have odor right after application upon your next use.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t sweat as much as I would have expected being the very first day of use.</li>
            <li> That same day, after I showered, I applied some vitamin E oil under my arms and was fine the next day.</li>
            <li> If you were to do a second application later in the day you would do just fine.</li>
            <li> I wanted a deodorant that was free of aluminum and any other chemical I couldn&#x27;t pronounce and also worked to control odor.  </li>
            <li> Other products either haven&#x27;t worked or caused a light burning skin irritation sensation.</li>
            <li> My husband works as a contractor, we live in north Florida and he is allergic to some of the ingredients in OTC deodorants.</li>
            <li> I live in AZ</li>
            <li> This is a link to the study from the New England Journal of Medicine:</li>
            <li> Then I went shopping and tried on new clothes</li>
            <li> That goes for clothing as well, leaving shirts just like new in the arm pit area.</li>
            <li> I only has FOUR ingredients, and I can hardly believe that it works as good as it does.</li>
            <li> Better than Tom&#x27;s of Maine but still not very effective.  </li>
            <li> At a moderate room temp, applying to the underarms doesn&#x27;t yield a smooth coat of the stuff, but a bunch of tiny semi-solid chunks.</li>
            <li> A bit of a smaller stick than anticipated and a bit harder to apply than anticipated too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall satisfied of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Worthwhile.</li>
            <li> its all natural which is the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, and had just about given up on deodorant.</li>
            <li> addition to being an antiperspirant (which very few organic deodorants can claim), this stuff can even keep you fresh for a full 24</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried since I didn&#x27;t really want to test it to that extreme the first day!</li>
            <li> I would put the shirt on after the application and mystery stains would show up on the left and right side near my stomach.</li>
            <li> I now wash my pits really well with bar soap and just apply a little (1-2 light swipes) of my old style deodorant.</li>
            <li> Like at least one other reviewer has experienced, it seems this product no longer works as well for me as it did before.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for nearly a year and it has exceeded all my expectations!  </li>
            <li> This is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used that actually prevents b.o.</li>
            <li> So I want my deodorants to be ALL natural!</li>
            <li> No odor, no excessive sweating.  </li>
            <li> Finally a natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working through the first stick I purchased back in August!</li>
            <li> First of all, it actually works!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one flaw which is fatal enough for me to unfortunately never use the product again.  </li>
            <li> My significant other did not have this problem, though, and has used it for months with rave reviews.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li> I never review products, this is my first time because this stuff actually works.  </li>
            <li> I thought I hit the jackpot of all natural deodorants!</li>
            <li> Without any other acidic ingredients to pH balance it, I can see how this product would not be skin friendly.</li>
            <li> We were elated, however I noticed after the first day that my pits were red from irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone a full 24 hours with absolutely no hint of odour, and that has never happened before.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t streak on clothing, and keeps you smelling clean long after it&#x27;s application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try not to overuse the product by applying too much pressure, but otherwise, this is product that stands above its competition.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve resorted to just using this when I know I will have a very busy, very stressful day, and definitely do not want to stink to high heaven.</li>
            <li> I want to support American companies that make healthy alternatives to conventional products, so I think I will keep buying Jungleman.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other natural deodorants and it seemed like they didn&#x27;t do a good job covering up the sweat smell.  </li>
            <li> but seriously I sweat pretty easily, so</li>
            <li> It was black now its light brown.</li>
            <li> This product has very simple ingredients, but those ingredients aren&#x27;t necessarily suitable for use on skin everyday.</li>
            <li> Well, after a couple weeks of using moisturizers on my armpits and switching full-time to the crystal roll-on deodorant, my itch had pretty much completely disappeared and the red irritation had cleared up.</li>
            <li> Well, after a couple weeks of using moisturizers on my armpits and switching full-time to the crystal roll-on deodorant, my itch had pretty much completely disappeared and the red irritation had cleared up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price aside, it really is a fantastic deodorant that is the combination of all the natural deodorant ingredients you have probably read about independently; does exactly what you want, no odor and last all day long.</li>
            <li> chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon using this the first time, with a small bit of cologne under each arm to go with it, I noticed that after a full day of work, NO SMELL WHATSOEVER.</li>
            <li> for those with EXTREMELY sensitive skin, this doesn&#x27;t break me out (itching or burning) like all of the past deodorants have--even the so called  top &amp;#34;organic ones&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a natural deodorant that works for me, and I haven&#x27;t had much luck.  </li>
            <li> But I used it for several months and never suffered anything more than slight irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (they come right out if you rub it with a dry towel).  </li>
            <li> This is coming from a large, hairy, and sweaty middle eastern man that lives in AZ.  </li>
            <li> He can not use peoducts with certain ingredients such as aluminum in them.  </li>
            <li> It does have an odd consistency and has to be rubbed in rather than just applied, but it&#x27;s worth it for how well it works!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little bit of red irritation from the scratching, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll clear up within a couple days since I&#x27;m tossing the Jungleman deodorant and making a permanent switch to the crystal stuff.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little bit of red irritation from the scratching, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll clear up within a couple days since I&#x27;m tossing the Jungleman deodorant and making a permanent switch to the crystal stuff.</li>
            <li> Jungleman keeps me stink free the whole day, even after a hard run and workout.  </li>
            <li> Jungleman is a deodorant, meaning that it keeps the bacteria that makes you smell bad from growing and it works incredibly well.</li>
            <li> I tried Sam&#x27;s Natural, which worked really well, but totally stained my shirts, even after a couple uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it clearly said on the package to keep it away from sun exposure.</li>
            <li> But after you rub it in, it becomes clear.</li>
            <li> The Jungleman deodorant both works very well and is clear of any potentially unwanted chemicals</li>
            <li> My workout clothes also do not stink as they did with Herbal Clear.  </li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of natural deos before</li>
            <li> So far my skin is not irritated but I will update, once anything happens.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after trying what seemed to feel like every natural deodorant brand (Crystal Body, Herban Cowboy, Toms of Maine, JÄSON, etc) - none of which worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also made from all natural ingredients and not all those chemicals that there is now</li>
            <li> I always wanted to find a natural deodorant</li>
            <li> so far works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a holy grail natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have mentioned white residue--I gently rub the product in after I apply it, and there is no whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All natural, lasts for days...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural deodarant and anti-perspirant and chose this after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t even naturally apply to your pits.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li> If you are taking care of yourself and are committed to using a natural deodorant, then Jungleman should work for you.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is completely unscented.</li>
            <li> Well tolerated for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The deodorant completely works.</li>
            <li> I like it but for me i guess its a 4 star because its not the ultimate protection I really wanted or what I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the natural ingredients of this product, but after a month of usage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a non-staining all natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> but I do not stink and the deodorant itself is completely odorless.</li>
            <li> So, I wanted a natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it..  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I&#x27;m not a tree hugger or natural</li>
            <li> So I did some reading, wow,</li>
            <li> It really has no smell, especially when applied.  </li>
            <li> I started looking for a natural deodorant and found Jungleman on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> What I am saying is if you are looking around for a natural deodorant</li>
            <li> So far, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but it does the job JUST as well as my old deodorant.  </li>
            <li> (who doesn&#x27;t stink towards the middle/ early evening anyways?</li>
            <li> , I want to find a natural deodorant that work for me.</li>
            <li> From Old Spice, to Gillette, to Dove deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Let me make my return trip to Target, do my test run, look for the same cash register attendant, have him ring me up, see if he rubs his nose in disgust, and then I can raise my arms up in celebration for no longer smelling like</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think that was natural</li>
            <li> so i went on the hunt for a natural and healthier product to use.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product, unless you HAVE to have something that is natural.</li>
            <li> if you got sensitive skin then i would avoid</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having gotten used to what it feels like to when one&#x27;s armpits sweat naturally, wetness hasn&#x27;t been the issue but odor has.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to try the \\&quot;crystal\\&quot; as I was worried it would be too natural.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t smell like a hung over sailor nor a 14 year old baseball player.</li>
            <li> only thing I notice it is very pasty.</li>
            <li> wife tried it multiple times after shaving and it made her very itchy.</li>
            <li> natural</li>
            <li> I have to enthusiastically recommend this product to anyone who is health and hygiene conscious.</li>
            <li> Somehow this deodorant kills the bacteria with natural salts.  </li>
            <li> Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant?</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sneak anything in like some natural deodorant makers do too, either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Only thing I was surprised by is the smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant after searching for a natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t contain propylene glycol or alum.</li>
            <li> Women buy beauty products, natural deodorant included.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, which you don&#x27;t one anyway because sweat is your body&#x27;s natural cooling system.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I wore it on and off throughout the summer, using a competitors natural deodorant when not using this one.</li>
            <li> It completely keeps me odor-free all day, even in the summer.</li>
            <li> and/or who are accustomed to the \\&quot;inconvenience\\&quot; of all natural products will have no issues with this product.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on jungleman and so far I haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it seems to keep the stink away all day as promised.</li>
            <li> YES Is it all natural?</li>
            <li> This is an all natural deodorant THAT WORKS.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a completely all-natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> If you look at my reviews from today, you will see that I review three natural deodorants, including this one.  </li>
            <li> I also had my doubts about using an all natural product like Jungleman.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised when I discovered just how well this prouct works.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural deodorant, and tried this one.</li>
            <li> Some people are sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with natural ingredients and aluminum-free.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s all natural but</li>
            <li> It is clearly a natural product.  </li>
            <li> But so far not this one.</li>
            <li> so far....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of all natural deodorants</li>
            <li> I have had to switch to natural deodorant cause</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this does not irritate me and is affective.  </li>
            <li> A lot of these natural deodorants dont work and are sticky.</li>
            <li> I have looked into a lot of natural alternatives to mainstream antiperspirant/deodorant to get away from the aluminum and</li>
            <li> If I had a presentation, I needed to keep on hand the old standby antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> this deodorant, 4 natural Ingredients, and it works wonderfly.</li>
            <li> I used Arm &amp; Hammer, Old Spice, Dove (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking it so far but juries still out.</li>
            <li> Running it under water solves that problem completely though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was never the case with my old</li>
            <li> I was ready to go to my local co-op and beg them to carry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably every natural deodorant made.  </li>
            <li> For a natural product, exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t achieve complete odor elimination.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, WOW.</li>
            <li> This deodorant/anti-perspirant is BY FAR</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to combat odor all day, so my first stick is lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> However, I wasnt able to find it through the natural stores in my area or on amazon, when I checked a few months back.</li>
            <li> that unsurprisingly didn&#x27;t keep the product cool long enough to prevent melting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended Jungleman to several friends and all have agreed: it works, it works well, and it&#x27;s the only deodorant worth buying.</li>
            <li> : If product is cool (less than 80 degrees,) apply very slowly to allow body heat to warm it up</li>
            <li> I actually wouldn&#x27;t mind a version in lavender or some other EO, but unscented works just fine.</li>
            <li> Most truly natural/non-toxic deodorants are NOT strong enough for a man and leave me stinky.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that I can consistently use every day without irritation -- and, unlike some other products, it actually seems to work.</li>
            <li> There is actually a slight sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li> The problem with the deodorants that I have used in the past is the strong &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; smell that comes with them.  </li>
            <li> After searching high and low for a natural deodorant (that was really natural)</li>
            <li> It does take me a little longer to clean my underarms in the shower because of the oils used in the product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, quick shipment (arrived a week early) and the 4 and half stars doesn&#x27;t give this deodorant justice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an active guy; I do some kind of workout everyday.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to (you&#x27;ll find yourself checking your pits for a smell the first week or so) but it really does work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s virtually clear and any little white pieces you can easily rub</li>
            <li> I was getting really grossed out by the crusty yellow pit stains on my white undershirts, so I decided to start looking for a new brand.</li>
            <li> But seriously, this is one of my favorite Amazon finds ever.</li>
            <li> be sure to apply a small amount and move your arms back and forth to get it all in the armpit area.</li>
            <li> I could finally end my search after years of cycling through Walgreens, CVS, and Target for a decent deodorant.</li>
            <li> when cold like it is now in my bathroom, and gets a bit softer when warm, and will melt if hot (leave it in your car).  </li>
            <li> * be premium, not pay for the weight of a gel ice pack!--particularly when the USPS just puts in into the blazing hot mailbox anyway (in the middle of a Florida summer)--despite the warning label on the outside.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is that they make the name more unisex and perhaps come out with a small purse sized version.  </li>
            <li> But why would we put a product on our super absorbent pores with some of the same chemicals and heavy metals that we spend so much money every year to avoid in our drinking water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a few weeks now and it is as good as, if not better than, the Dove Men&#x27;s deodorant I had been using for years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder and needs to warm up a little before it spreads easily, but literally all that means is you stick it on your pits, pause for a second, and then sweep like usual.</li>
            <li> My second stick (I still liked it enough to re-order) is just the opposite, and is a little too \\&quot;meltable.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> If you have problems applying this, I recommend doing some trimming in the armpits, it will help it go on smooth and actually help cut down on smells.</li>
            <li> It will probably soften up and be easier to spread in the summer, but right now I find I am using the other products I bought over this one.  </li>
            <li> I am a high school teacher at a girls prison and have never felt self-conscious during class because it wasn&#x27;t working well enough (</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying the high price simply because I feel this product is friendlier to my body than the chemical-laden mainstream brands.</li>
            <li> ordered a few sticks of the Jungleman deodorant because it made the shipping cost a little more reasonable.  </li>
            <li> In general I don&#x27;t have strong body odor or excessive perspiration.</li>
            <li> As for me, it&#x27;s back to plain old baking soda and water (paste) after my morning shower to keep me odor free all day, then witch hazel after my evening shower to work overnight to soothe any irritation that developed from the baking soda.</li>
            <li> When I applied it to my underarm it made a huge mess, a white chalky paste smeared all over my underarm which then ended up all over the inside of my shirt.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have every used, and I say that because its natural, not an anti-perspirant, doesnt have horrible ingredients like aluminum, and IT WORKS REALLY</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;ll apply this all natural deodorant to my underarms and this keeps me fresh for long periods of time, without having to reapply often (long hikes, etc) or worrying about that odor when sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s important to anyone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s by no means &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; when first applied; You&#x27;ll need to be careful putting on your shirt and check for deodorant streaks</li>
            <li> I normally get rashes from regular deodorant depending on the brand.</li>
            <li> It takes a week or so of use to get used to a product like this, as its very different then the normal options.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little \\&quot;white\\&quot;, but dissipates quickly, and almost immediately if you rub it in.</li>
            <li> Having eschewed anti-perspirants 20+ yrs ago, I&#x27;ve traversed the damp and often smelly path of &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants with little success until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One major plus is that it is a solid, which is not common among deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars, however, the downfall is when it is hot it melts and when put in the fridge, it gets too hard therefore \\&quot;not too hot, not too cold\\&quot; type of product.</li>
            <li> I find that when switching deodorants, it takes several weeks for my body to adjust to the new deodorant.  </li>
            <li> If necessary I will post an update when my new stick arrives.  </li>
            <li> I tried a new one and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> I have tried several deodorants, both natural and completely unnatural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an office worker and am not physically active during the day.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is paying so much for shipping bringing the item total to almost $10.00.</li>
            <li> After ruining another expensive polo shirt, I decided to look of natural alternatives that would be easier on my wardrobe but still be effective.</li>
            <li> It has the same thick, chalky consistency that many of the non-natural, aluminum-containing deodorants have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting really pissed paying shipping for every single piece even if I buy 4 at a time.</li>
            <li> Change can be tuff but for me it had a major payoff.</li>
            <li> used all the major name brand deordorants with problems.</li>
            <li> The major downside is the removal of your armpit hair.</li>
            <li> If it wears off, do not expect your armpits not to smell, put some more (before it is too late)!</li>
            <li> There was just a little to clean up on the outside where it ran out while it was softened.</li>
            <li> This one fits the bill just fine, but for one complaint.  </li>
            <li> Knowing I am not polluting my body with chemicals or other questionable substances is great.</li>
            <li> I tried &amp;#34;Take A Whiff&amp;#34;, DeodoMom Roll-on (which worked for a week or so), and whole bunch of other ones from natural &amp; organic stores.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a miracle that a natural deodorant could keep me fresh for a day and half (if I were to shower in the morning and then sleep in the next day before showering again).</li>
            <li> Jungle Man is very dry and doesn&#x27;t really have any of what deodorant company&#x27;s call &#x27;glide&#x27;...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey with shipment charges tacked onto each stick, but I think it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It made my armpits itch, left a residue that I had to wash off the next day, and worked decently as an antiperspirant</li>
            <li> It made my armpits itch, left a residue that I had to wash off the next day, and worked decently as an antiperspirant</li>
            <li> If you wear long sleeve everyday and hide your armpit all the time, this product is great (seriously).</li>
            <li> I tried to use it a few more times but again, would not spread--just solid as a rock and very dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost laughable, but it&#x27;s amazing in it&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;Baking soda, tea tree oil, corn starch, and palm oil.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it will last long (the whole stick),&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The only problem is because it has baking soda it doesnt go on clear.</li>
            <li> Be careful when applying this if you do have a small scent of odor already (in a case where say maybe you weren&#x27;t able to shower for a day because of hiking, crashing at someone&#x27;s place, etc.).</li>
            <li> usually use Now Foods Long Lasting Deodorant Stick and need to apply it once or twice a week at most.</li>
            <li> Jungleman works very well and has absolutely no toxic ingredients (baking soda, cornstarch, tea tree oil, palm oil).  </li>
            <li> After using this product I have thrown away all my old deodorants and I haven&#x27;t looked back, this is what I use when I work.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this all-natural deodorant after using regular Ax and Old Spice deodorants and anti-persperants all my life.</li>
            <li> My husband put it on the first morning, worked outside in 106 degree weather, and by the next morning before showering (we waited that long to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> That constant searching for a natural deodorant that works is over.</li>
            <li> is one of only two natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried (out of *</li>
            <li> but I have struggled to find a product that I felt was natural and would not harm my body.....and also actually worked.  </li>
            <li> Wanting to avoid aluminum in my deodorant, I&#x27;ve tried natural deodorants, only to discover that they don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> So far the stains have come out in the wash, but the staining is still a big drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its more difficult to apply, because its much firmer than traditional sticks.</li>
            <li> It is the only natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li> Apparently some people have a sensitivity to prolonged contact with baking soda, which is one of the ingredients in this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the salt rock crystal thing and Tom&#x27;s of Maines version of natural deodorant and neither work well or last.</li>
            <li> But sweating is natural and the only way to block sweat is with chemicals that are toxic to your body (aluminum, titanium, etc).</li>
            <li> For having only having 4 ingredients [sodium bicarbonate, corn starch, sustainable palm oil, tea tree oil] and no scent whatsoever, I was genuinely surprised at</li>
            <li> but apparently it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but this product aint really what i expected.</li>
            <li> the way, this isn&#x27;t the only all natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t work for me, as neither</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male who&#x27;s used natural cosmetics for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY one that works 100%, is truly natural/non-toxic and completely unscented.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the heat melts them in the box.  </li>
            <li> I thought that I may have to go back to my old stuff until I found this.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent you from sweating, so your body can do its natural thing, but it totally eliminates odor.</li>
            <li> was worth a try though, sorta worked, but the overall, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Once I made the switch, my clothes smelled FAR less strongly than they had with my previous synthetic deodorant.</li>
            <li> It smells good but is not good if your a heavy sweater.</li>
            <li> When I received the deodorant in the mail, it was broken and defective---I was able to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> Okay, I use unscented speed stick anti-perspirant because my skin reacts poorly to scented deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other natural and chemical deodorants, tea tree oil, and even pure baking soda, with no such adverse effects like jungleman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> various formulas of Tom&#x27;s, Jason, Origins, Kiss My Face, Crystal, etc., even straight coconut oil), is that they either only worked for short durations or  not at all, or were mere &#x27;cover&#x27; for odor--even if I washed my pits at some point during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Jungleman for four days (I know, not exactly a longterm eval), but the difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li> and it left white stain on all the new clothes I try on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve paid two or three times as much for natural deodorants that didn&#x27;t work half as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s all natural, so this makes sense in the absence of a &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; agent).</li>
            <li> This product gets very soft when warm and is shipped to you on a cold pak.</li>
            <li> I just shoved the broken part back in and used as normal, seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was it was pretty warm when I ordered it</li>
            <li> I used other deodorants that I&#x27;ve purchased from Whole Foods and on the internet</li>
            <li> But as the description says it is shipped in a very protective packaging with a package of &amp;#34;Ice coolant&amp;#34; to help ensure that the contents don&#x27;t liquefy in extreme heat.  </li>
            <li> Turned into a goopy mess in hot weather.</li>
            <li> : I also use this in combination with other natural/light scented deodorants or cologne (since this smells like absolutely nothing).</li>
            <li> I have never before found a natural deodorant that actually prevents me from smelling for at least a full day.  </li>
            <li> My only other complaint is that I have to apply this pretty heavily and it is drying out my skin and leaving my underarms kind of flaky.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, so most deodorants make me break out pretty bad, I&#x27;ve also had trouble getting any of them to work</li>
            <li> This Jungleman deodorant is a white solid that becomes clear when applied.</li>
            <li> The only natural deodorant I know of that actually works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be going back to Gillette and risking Alzheimers until I find another all natural alternative that actually works.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for years for a natural deodorant that actually works and have finally found one!  </li>
            <li> Only deodorant I have ever found that actually works and does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> consistency is flaky (chalky, almost but not dry like chalk), and so you have to grind it over your armpit to get coverage.</li>
            <li> It just takes a little more effort than regular deodorant and goes on a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> First day, applied (it&#x27;s a little sticky), went to work and waited to see what would happen.</li>
            <li> I have tried various ones that I purchased at health stores and even at major chain stores.  </li>
            <li> Note, I have very sensitive skin and almost every single deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried five other \\&quot;natural deodorants\\&quot; (a phrase that is a misnomer, as aluminum and arsenic are natural, but I digress)</li>
            <li> but I think I have finally found the answer to my long search for a quality natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> the first few weeks of using it, my armpits felt...</li>
            <li> It is also my first &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; but is not sticky and you can&#x27;t tell after a few minutes of application.  </li>
            <li> But that is a small price to pay for smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> My first stick broke into a few pieces at times</li>
            <li> Now for a day where I might be sweating heavily or out and about walking on a hot summers day, this product seems to protect me well for 5-6 hours and after that will start to breakdown a bit.</li>
            <li> yes, as some have mentioned, it does go on pretty messy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually, my right armpit was so itchy that I ended up scratching it one night until it actually hurt in the morning and for the next few days.</li>
            <li> All of them, gel, solid, clinical strength, sports, all day ones, womens, mens, natural, not natural, scented and unscented....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how long I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep your armpits dry, it is just some sticky residue  like loose glue, it&#x27;s nothing that special, and it rubs off onto your shirt too after awhile, not worth it IMO.  </li>
            <li> so I have to apply at least one more time during the day, since I get a little stinky, but it&#x27;s generally unnoticeable unless you put your nose in there.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer and have tried EVERY SINGLE natural and chemical-laden product out there.</li>
            <li> it works fine just a small amount once every or every other day.</li>
            <li> However, after a few weeks, I noticed that the product started producing a distinct unpleasant musky smell on its own.</li>
            <li> (The other two major carriers leave packages near doorways as opposed to in mailboxes, fwiw.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The other two major carriers leave packages near doorways as opposed to in mailboxes, fwiw.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely all natural and last long (throughout the day)</li>
            <li> No unpleasant scents or odors, suppresses body-odor build up for at least 24 hours in my tests so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps I could have done with less coverage, but I was not comfortable with a light dusting (I don&#x27;t like to smell).</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical of this stuff, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> Then I got pregnant and really wanted to at least try a few out.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, and it is very hard to find a product such as this in any store, including any of the all-natural stores.  </li>
            <li> I usually try to buy deodorants with very minimal light scents, but you can still start to smell it once you sweat.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant keeps me fresh all day, even if I&#x27;m working hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the other natural deodorants only to be disappointed that they don&#x27;t work or to find that they really aren&#x27;t natural.</li>
            <li> I also liked how they ship it with an ice pack to ensure it doesn&#x27;t arrive at doorstep a sloppy mess..</li>
            <li> for me this natural deodorant still causes some burning but it is manageable and it is probably only a result of the other stuff eating a layer of my skin off, not fully healed skin, and daily shaving.</li>
            <li> I apply it right after a shower and by the time I come home from the office, my BO is not nice.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying four different natural deodorants wanting to eliminate aluminum and other chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried virtually every other natural deodorant on the market and this is the only product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Having tried just about everything else out there; from budget priced deodorants, &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants, to the more expensive department store brands (Menscience costs $17 a pop!)</li>
            <li> There are a few clinical studies (including the one below) that have shown that topical application of tea tree oil can cause high estrogen levels in men, and ultimately lead to gynecomastia (breast development) in males.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go for those other so called natural deodorants</li>
            <li> My experience with other &#x27;natural&#x27; ones (</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the other chemical laden products, and it wont contribute to an early death.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d keep it in the shower and do that before drying off, but the instructions -- and other reviewers -- say it is sensitive to heat.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time with other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants.  </li>
            <li> thought it was just me and my sensitive skin until I read other reviews.</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way when I left the stick of deodorant in my extremely hot car, and it melted the deodorant</li>
            <li> I usually alternate between a fragrant conventional brand of deodorant (not antiperspirant) for work and a natural one on the weekend.</li>
            <li> Same results everyday so far!!</li>
            <li> The main reason why I switched to this product was that it did not contain any compounds with aluminum or any harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I do sweat a bit, nothing major, but there is absolutely no smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This deodorant not only works with only a few swipes, it&#x27;s truly natural!  </li>
            <li> only complaint I have ever had is that if you get a &#x27;stale&#x27; stick it will hurt your under arm hair, otherwise the &#x27;fresh&#x27; sticks kick ass and go on smooth and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No hidden triclosan or other anti-bacterial synthetic products.  </li>
            <li> When you try to rub it on, it&#x27;s hard at first, but your body warms it up</li>
            <li> No more stink or shirt stains, and it keeps me dry all day, even in a hot and humid climate.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of other organic deodorants and had very little success.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, it is very hard and does not like to apply easily, and then flakes of the product will come off in pieces.  </li>
            <li> A single application of Jungleman in the morning is sufficient to last throughout the day (with moderate sweating).  </li>
            <li> I did notice a slight increase in perspiration over the first week or two, but it died down after that.</li>
            <li> This meant it would occasionally pull some hairs out--not painful, but kind of gross on the surface of the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff last really long throughout the day as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also when you choose your address to ship it to, try to ship it to a place where it won&#x27;t be stuck in the heat for a long time, such as your work place.</li>
            <li> I have been a heavy sweater my whole life, and this works so well that the other day when doing heavy lawn work outside on a hot day, I looked at my shirt and noticed it was almost entirely wet and soaked, except for the arm pits.  </li>
            <li> As a few other reviewers noted, it worked for me at first, too.</li>
            <li> I normally work 12-15 hour days, I thought that I would start to smell after a few hours at work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first dispenser/tube of the product I had used only lasted me a little less than a month.  </li>
            <li> I am not really a heavy sweater, but sometimes when you start pacing in the office, you get some beads of sweat running down the sides of you</li>
            <li> It was just a little soft but after a day indoors, it is solid again.</li>
            <li> I switched to Herbal Clear for the past few years, but it only really worked for 4 or 5 hours, and I need to reapply.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty expensive, and coupled with the high aluminum content</li>
            <li> i wanted to start going more natural but after using this product I started to develop a bad rash in my arm pit, so I had to throw it away.  </li>
            <li> The actual product is soOooo dry...</li>
            <li> It is extremely dry and actually hurts sometimes to put it on.</li>
            <li> Leaves a slight white residue when you first put it on, so be careful putting on a dark shirt.</li>
            <li> If not, I&#x27;ll be buying it here or direct, the shipping makes it a bit expensive, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Also, like another reviewer said, processing time is ridiculously slow, especially since practically all online retailers are lightning fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit gritty when you first put it on too, but then it softens within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of a clumpy, thick deodorant, but still worth trying for anyone sensitive to the aluminum and other crap they put in deodorants these days.</li>
            <li> I will admit that the baking soda in this caused me some slight irritation when I first started using it, but after a few days my skin adjusted to it, and now I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because it worked really well, and honestly I&#x27;d be willing to live with the itching and keep using it, if I didn&#x27;t have the rash</li>
            <li> Only other option is to use a commercial deodarant/anti-perspirant and use oral chelation.</li>
            <li> [The other is Miessence roll-on, in case you&#x27;re wondering, but it never really dries completely on me, so I had damp underarms all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to give it 5 stars, if it didn&#x27;t feel like I dragging a giant half dried Elmer&#x27;s glue stick across my pits.</li>
            <li> All the benefits of this deodorant COMPLETELY outweigh that little quibble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didnt work at all, for me, after a few hours of hard work, you feel and smell that isn&#x27;t working, your shirt became wet, and you don&#x27;t feel fine with it.</li>
            <li> There is no more yellowing on my shirts and would highly recommend Jungleman to  anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I does get harder (pretty hard)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very little luck over the years trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works.  </li>
            <li> I had tried DIY deodorants without much success and resulting in some pretty bad rashes.</li>
            <li> at least* a dozen) that keeps body odor at bay for the whole day.</li>
            <li> I really have no idea why, hot or cold i immediately have sweat in my pits at all times.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because my day job is as far from strenuous as you can imagine</li>
            <li> A bit harder to apply than regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works well, all day long.  </li>
            <li> yes days, even after workingout at the gym and only a minimal scent.  </li>
            <li> my wife and I plan to keep on ordering as long as its being made.</li>
            <li> but it was 5.99 not too long ago.</li>
            <li> how long it takes them to get it INTO</li>
            <li> After wearing it overnight,  I spent a weekend transplanting Avocado trees in the Central Valley of California and during this time period I dug two 1m^3 holes in the earth with a shovel.  </li>
            <li> I would even rate this as better for BO and sweat than a regular deodorant but for a few unfortunate downsides.</li>
            <li> a long distance runner, so I sweat.</li>
            <li> Not one smell at all, all day long.</li>
            <li> Jungelman does not leave the strange antiperspirant residue that never seems to fade.  </li>
            <li> I tried out a bunch of natural deodorants and crystals to see what could work and still have just a few ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get the Arm&amp;Hammer Naturals, it contain ingrediants that are not natural.</li>
            <li> Of course, it doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat, but after I developed the aluminum allergy a few years ago, I&#x27;m thinking we shouldn&#x27;t be putting things on our bodies that stop us from sweating, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We sweat when it&#x27;s cold and we live in Texas, so it is hot!</li>
            <li> only down side is it occasionally gets on my shirts as I&#x27;m putting them on.</li>
            <li> Not literally burning, but let down after putting my faith in their odor-deflecting abilities, only to wind up smelling like funk after a short time.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, and many deodorants cause painful skin irritation, and those that don&#x27;t are not strong enough to last all day.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars because those first few weeks were pretty terrible and even now, it doesn&#x27;t seem that much better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the crystal roll-on to anyone though.three stars because those first few weeks were pretty terrible and even now, it doesn&#x27;t seem that much better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had is a slight burn from it, but it&#x27;s not very long lasting, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, so</li>
            <li> I did some research on the ingredients, and found that tea tree oil has been documented to lower testosterone levels and overall mess up the male endocrine system.</li>
            <li> Other reviews also mentioned that the white stain will be disappeared, but in my case its there all day long.</li>
            <li> My undershirts no longer have the yellow grey staining that would happen with other brands despite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not easy to please when it comes to natural deodorants</li>
            <li> but now it has serious contenders in Island Organics and Stinkbug.ve a certain temperature.</li>
            <li> The other products I have tried left me with rash&#x27;s and/or burnt my skin and neither worked that well.  </li>
            <li> one equally - they both work extremely well.  </li>
            <li> My only criticism is that it is more &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; than other deodorants, so it pulls your pit hair upon application which makes it a little uncomfortable to apply.</li>
            <li> It comes as a white solid, but you may have to use your fingers to spread the product evenly after application since you might still see little bits of product.</li>
            <li> So at that time I tried several other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; deodorants from the health food store or online</li>
            <li> That is about standard for my other Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> I needed to leave a feedback on this product after using it for a week and after years of using AXE antiperspirants and various other aluminum based antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> did some research on this, and found lots of other folks who have had the same issue.</li>
            <li> but the label shouldn&#x27;t say &#x27;Invisible Solid Deodorant Stick&#x27; when it absolutely is not invisible!  </li>
            <li> I recommend buying several of these at a time - as other reviewers have noted, the shipping is a bit pricey</li>
            <li> A couple days later I noticed that my skin was scaly, like a rash, and that there were little bumps on the under side of my upper arm where it was coming into contact with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Further, after using this product (like one other reviewer said), I realized that smelly armpits of shirts were often because of deodorant, NOT body odor.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t protect me from sweat and stench nearly last as long as conventional deoderants tho</li>
            <li> You cannot put on dry armpits as it will not slide.  </li>
            <li> It also almost hurt to apply because it was so dry.  </li>
            <li> My pits are not smelly and the baking soda seems to keep me dry also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not chalky but it&#x27;s a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> Feels like trying to rub dry cement under my arm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it after I&#x27;m thoroughly dry and just as I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> and Jungle Man is too dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, you might want to run this stick of deodorant under the running water of a sink before you apply it to your underarm, because if the stick is too dry, it can rip out your underarm hair.  </li>
            <li> white residue doesn&#x27;t bother you then you may have to discount my review, but it bothers me enough that every time I use this (and I don&#x27;t like to waste, so I use it every so often to try to deplete it)</li>
            <li> I picked this stuff because it only has a few ingredients in it and seems like it&#x27;s safer to use than traditional deoderant.  </li>
            <li> The only way you&#x27;re gonna get deodorant that lets you put it on, and be smell-free for the next two days, is if you buy one with harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I only started using it this autumn, so the results could possibly be different when I&#x27;m sweating heavily in summer.</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply compared to normal deodorants.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I switched from conventional deodorants to Tom&#x27;s of Maine because I was worried about the chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I am on my second stick and so far this deodorant works very well as far as keeping sweating down and cutting down on BO.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth the cost over Old Spice (although no free shipping is lame).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the tradeoff of having to go back to itchy armpits.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the tradeoff of having to go back to itchy armpits.</li>
            <li> If you have underarm hair, a very small amount of hair may get pulled out, but this was not all that different of an experience compared tousing the Old Spice and Speed Stick products.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if what I received maybe old or what.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I consider those a small price to pay for a natural deodorant that works and doesn&#x27;t cause a rash.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple remedies (pouring water on it, rubbing a thin layer of lotion of my skin first, etc) to no avail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a full day, if I do the \\&quot;sniff test\\&quot; all I smell is a faint hint of whatever soap I showered with that morning.</li>
            <li> Went on a little thick on the first use.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not a particularly smelly person.</li>
            <li> The tea tree regular formula is actually less reactive than the mint for me.  </li>
            <li> Everybody is different, and there will be that small percentage that have those allergic reactions, so testing is crucial.</li>
            <li> I started having yellow underarm stains on my white shirts and my usual antiperspirants became ineffective.  </li>
            <li> did get my local grocery store to carry it for a while, not sure if they will continue (I was the only buyer).  </li>
            <li> the shipping it runs me about $9, so a slight lead on the extra strength stuff</li>
            <li> only slight downfalls:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> However this goes on very, very dry.  </li>
            <li> It feels very dry and resists being rubbed on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Your underarms may look like a big mess after you put on the deodorant, but the deodorant blends in well.  </li>
            <li> On a hot day application becomes very messy, less chunky, but still a mess in the pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a very hard dense deodorant that does not apply very well.  </li>
            <li> The effects last at least a few hours depending on where you live.</li>
            <li> it definitely does not go on smoothly; It&#x27;s a very dry paste in stick form, so you have to work a little to apply, and it will clump a bit&lt;</li>
            <li> That worked really well, but it also meant that it was hard to turn and the product itself didn&#x27;t rub off so well, so if you live somewhere where it&#x27;s cold or if the product arrives fairly cold you want to let it warm a bit before using it.</li>
            <li> I keep it at room temperature and apply it right out of the shower, otherwise, it can be dry and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> At the beginning my skin became red and little irritated</li>
            <li> Leaves a little white residue when applied.</li>
            <li> Only a little bit of the body wash from the morning, and</li>
            <li> Been wearing it a week with no need to reapply except, I put a little extra on before a workout \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; .</li>
            <li> My solution: put a little bit of essential oil of your choosing on before you apply deodorant&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this short list of ingredients works little miracles under my arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, everyone&#x27;s different, so maybe I&#x27;m just a little tougher customer,</li>
            <li> As weird as this sounds, after having worked all day, I took large whiffs of my pits out of sheer disbelief because I literally could not detect odor!</li>
            <li> I do agree with some other comments that it can darken skin or make it too dry.  </li>
            <li> It is a little dry-ish going on, but i haven&#x27;t found much clumping (as some have complained).</li>
            <li> It lasted all day long too!!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to bad mouth the product, because I&#x27;m sure it does work for some people.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having not found Jungleman in any store near me, I&#x27;ll still have to get it by mail, and that stinks (haha) because its company needs a shipping system</li>
            <li> There is really no reason for anyone to use products with parabens and aluminum on their skin with products like these on the market.</li>
            <li> arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no smell to it and</li>
            <li> Because of the baking soda and cornstarch, the deodorant stick has a lot of drag.  </li>
            <li> Soon as it is back in stock I&#x27;m going to grab a few.</li>
            <li> After wanting to limit myself from the harsh chemicals found in traditional deodorants, I was on the search for something</li>
            <li> you have to press and smear on, ended up having to trim hair so as to stop pulling it out), after a week of use my pits started to itch a bit and finally the skin was dead and peeling off</li>
            <li> those commercial products, especially antiperspirants, and especially the clinical versions (more aluminum) are terrible for you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my underarms hair removed via laser a few years back, so I don&#x27;t shave.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also far too expensive for a deodorant with an ingredient list made of such simple, household items.</li>
            <li> However, the application of the product leaves a bit to be desired, as it is drying and rough to roll on.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later, I emailed the owner of the company for a refund or replacement.</li>
            <li> Such a waste.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use it on days when I was only planning to go out for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, a few weeks after I started using the product, I noticed that the skin where I was applying it was turning red, then brown, and then flaking and peeling off.</li>
            <li> Had the deodorant on for  2 hours my armpits began to  feel  wet</li>
            <li> I wet my underarms AND the deodorant stick, then apply it wet.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these partially melt before I could get it out of the sun (</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea</li>
            <li> The product is messy going on--lots of white goop on my armpits that I have to rub into my skin, before putting my clothes on.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s was too wet...</li>
            <li> i only used this for a few days  it caused a rash  </li>
            <li> It was  bit rough to put on.  </li>
            <li> careful laundering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a few days later I caught sight of my arm pits in the mirror</li>
            <li> Non toxic, non smelling, non sticky, non wet</li>
            <li> started slowly switching all my products to all natural products about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Have tried a few natural brands and this is one of the few that works.</li>
            <li> It is a little different from other deodorants you might be used to--</li>
            <li> only complaints are that my first stick was so thick that it was hard to apply, and even left a hard residue on my shirts.</li>
            <li> Product works extremely well - I was shocked as many deoderants don&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this deodorant if you&#x27;re tired of ruined white shirts and if you don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals on your body</li>
            <li> The result is when the unsuspecting user sticks it beneath the arm, half the stick comes off and creates a massive, soupy mess.</li>
            <li> Jungleman packed it properly, with frozen cold packs, but the day was just too hot.</li>
            <li> It does leave a white residue so it will not work with the little black dress.</li>
            <li> I got used to this and left my pits a little wet or moistened the deodorant a little with water.</li>
            <li> loaded with fragrance and other clever unpronounceable ingredients leaving you smelling worse off than started with.</li>
            <li> While these issues are minor and livable in relation to the amazing job that it does, I have begun to get a very bad rash/cysts in my arm pits.</li>
            <li> This turned my armpits a frightening shade of red (almost purple red) and made the texture of my skin feel rough and itchy by the second day of use.</li>
            <li> In comparison, the Old Spice and Speed Stick products lasted me at least a couple of months, and the Thai crystal deodorant stone lasted me over half a year.  </li>
            <li> I am currently having some hormonal adjustments to medication which is giving me some pretty bad BO, and this helps to eliminate it, but not completely.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again due to the price</li>
            <li> one review mentioned, it does feel like applying glue to your armpits but it doesn&#x27;t last past application.</li>
            <li> They were extremely helpful and took care of me immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am going to try some other product for a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I cannot say this about any other deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy (or a hirsute woman), prepare for a few minor ouches when you apply.  </li>
            <li> but of course it&#x27;s not as efficient as those other toxic deodorants.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, after I finished lifting weights, I had absolutely no BO!  </li>
            <li> I then went to do some yard work and other house work.</li>
            <li> I tend to wear cologne and after deciding I wanted to try and limit the other chemicals I&#x27;m putting in/on my body</li>
            <li> I have tried many &amp;#34;All Natural&amp;#34; products and all of them left me with a nasty rash in my pits the next day.</li>
            <li> I have an allergic reaction to practically every deodorant, and I&#x27;ve never used a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; one that did anything other than cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> Every other non scent deodorant doesn&#x27;t hold up by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> $10 total including shipping for a deodorant that is already on the small size (2.5 oz) compared to drugstore/supermarket</li>
            <li> , while I&#x27;d seen other reviews that mentioned that the product could melt in transit, shipping it w/</li>
            <li> all i noticed was that it made me sweat so much more, which i was disappointed about.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, this is an anti-deodorant, not an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say other than it works.</li>
            <li> Those who are not in the classification of \\&quot;lazy American&#x27;s\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Also, it is small enough to travel with.</li>
            <li> I like a lot of other people have concerns about rubbing all sorts of strange chemicals under my arms everyday.</li>
            <li> (they even go out of their way and use palm oil from non-peatlands, thus not supporting our continuing rainforest deforestation).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a clear liquid roll on, but it only leaves a very small film under your arms.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try because of other people&#x27;s reviews, and I am now a repeat customer.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure if the same will apply to others, but i will take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will try the other brands.</li>
            <li> ive never had any issues with any other products</li>
            <li> sometimes I dont have to reapply until every other day.</li>
            <li> I was never sure whether I actually managed to apply any to my underarms.  </li>
            <li> Matches all the other deodorants without all chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any other deodorant</li>
            <li> I changed to Jungleman after years of using other aluminum based antiperspirants/deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I have NO IDEA how it is done as the other &amp;#34;deodorant only&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Other products I have bought was to stop the odor</li>
            <li> It goes on dry, I rub it in a little, and there&#x27;s no smell.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little dry</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, and the sticks of deodorant were packaged in with a couple of cold packs in order to help keep the deodorant solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of giant companies from 1000+ miles away from me dictating my only choices are 1.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Arm &amp; Hammer active or sport deodorant, but they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> Under heavy use like exercise, you may wanna apply more then once as a scent can leak through, but that has been my experience with all the products unless it has some cheesy ridiculous smell that out weighs it.</li>
            <li> deodorant went out dry and rough, not sure if I  had a reaction, or if it was friction burn, but I broke out under my pits, I kept using it anyways because it worked so well.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly scoured the reviews and gathered that some people LOVE this deo and some people hate it due to irritation and application difficulty.</li>
            <li> the other reviews stated, it&#x27;s not a fancy package and it might be a little harder to put on compared to other brands, but it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m including the conventional anti perspirants in this in that claim.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than expected to receive the deodorant.</li>
            <li> so I expected to have a little funk around 5 PM.</li>
            <li> yes ... it is a little &#x27;rough&#x27; to put on.  </li>
            <li> Goes on a little rough as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using a natural deodorant based on reviews that I had read and friends who have tried other brands of natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little tricky - the stick melts, if it is too hot or applying it leaves white little flakes, if it is too cold.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 due to the non-pH balanced nature and the slight rash</li>
            <li> I rate it 4 stars instead of five because it is a solid block and hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> After about 30 minutes in the freezer, and a little bit of thaw time (it won&#x27;t twist or rub on well until thawed properly- usually at a temp above 60 degrees)</li>
            <li> After about 20 minutes of hard work in the portable went back to my office, and nothing!</li>
            <li> If I use NON-anti-perspirants: I get pit sweats and the deodorants wear off after several hours, so with cycling in the mix of getting around, its hard to reapply all the time, and the deodorant tends to melt and get all over the place in my cycling bags.</li>
            <li> I like that this is non-toxic and absolutely odorless, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t find it that difficult.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is how it melts.  </li>
            <li> The deodorant application was below average because it was crumbly when I put it on</li>
            <li> Also, sorry for too much information.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also unscented (there&#x27;s nothing I hate more than scented deodorant).  </li>
            <li> After switching from the Thai crystal deodorant stone to Jungleman, I noticed the red, irritation lines on my underarms slowly disappeared, and I have not noticed any underarm irritation while using Jungleman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve ever tried has wound up irritating my skin, even natural products like Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is a thick chalky white stick.</li>
            <li> This product is mostly baking soda and baking soda is base.</li>
            <li> This will get more annoying soon.</li>
            <li> Also, Very Dry, not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I will say it definitely keeps the odor down but is like a thick paste that will stain your shirts.</li>
            <li> Hopefully down the line this product gets cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a normal deodorant stick, but it is a little tough going on (takes a few swipes).  </li>
            <li> Not able to use because of the hard solid very dry texture.  </li>
            <li> When I tried both the sticks I ordered, the product was so dry and difficult to apply that it would drag my underarm skin back and forth very roughly.  </li>
            <li> Within three days of use this product caused large, red and painful welts that took days to subside, for both my daughter and myself.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent you from sweating, but I still think I sweat less than if I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> It made yellow stains a thing of the past, perspiration memories of the past even in the Florida heat.  </li>
            <li> They had changed their formula slightly</li>
            <li> People said it has a slight citrus smell, though I find it just smells like baking soda (which makes sense since that&#x27;s the majority of what it&#x27;s made of).</li>
            <li> This product gave me the worst I&#x27;ve ever had in the most recent comparison to Gillette Gel and Mitchum.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight fragrance, if that is of note to someone with allergies.</li>
            <li> It also causes a slight rash when using.</li>
            <li> , I think it could be slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> when I use it, I sweat less in my pits, but it doesnt smell when I sweat.</li>
            <li> During the peak of the sweat I smelled a slight odor.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;ve used Dove for Men, Gilette for Men, Mitchum, and others like them</li>
            <li> Also, I think this is why this deodorant stopped rubbing in well, my skin was just less skin like.</li>
            <li> stick is a bit stiff so it does go on a little rough.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a product that performs well over the long term</li>
            <li> I can not use it long term, I tried really hard</li>
            <li> After searching long and hard for a replacement I came across this.</li>
            <li> It does also leave a caked on mess in some areas which need wiping off</li>
            <li> I can wane to odoriferous levels that rival a billy goat under layers of military gear; no more.  </li>
            <li> NOT true.  </li>
            <li> It will overheat and make a mess.</li>
            <li> My smell was actually being made worse by the other kinds of deodorant.  </li>
            <li> My brother was a bit worried about that because he had read several reviews about poor packaging and the deodorant destroyed in extreme heat.</li>
            <li> I finally got to the register, and the guy started rubbing his nose, and the customer behind me also started rubbing her nose, and the customer in front of me move towards the other end.  </li>
            <li> But FINALLY I Can Play hard, run hard and Sweat Like crazy and Jungleman Deodorant keeps me smelling FRESH,  </li>
            <li> It has a very very faint smell of tree oil but fades away right after application.</li>
            <li> This arrived in bad condition, partially melted, but I kept it anyway (my first mistake).</li>
            <li> , after a few days of use I would get a slight irritation.</li>
            <li> natural\\&quot; products are a poor subsitiute for the average stuff you buy in the store, but this one actually works.  </li>
            <li> Unscented which I prefer something with a little scent but</li>
            <li> They packed it well, with a little coolpack to keep the heat out when it was sitting in front of my door.</li>
            <li> A little goes father than you might think.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Crystal sticks worked for a little bit but as soon as I started sweating, I would immediately start stinking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used other deodorants in the past, they may make it through a day.  </li>
            <li> With the crystal roll-on, I might sweat a little bit, but I don&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> With the crystal roll-on, I might sweat a little bit, but I don&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> I never smelled even a little bit when wearing this stuff--and I wore it while working in a foundry in the Midwest summer, and while working out</li>
            <li> Takes a little while to get use to</li>
            <li> I like a little scent in my deoderant as well, so I don&#x27;t see myself buying this again.</li>
            <li> It does also feel a little grainy from the baking soda, but I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I get a little stinky around hour 7.</li>
            <li> In addition, I was perspiration as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any deodorant, it offered little to no protection from perspiration.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of getting used to.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard/sticky going on.  </li>
            <li> i was a little bit hesitant when buying this</li>
            <li> what-not and have had little luck finding anything that works comparably well.</li>
            <li> The smell of Jungleman is little to none.  </li>
            <li> It can get on clothes but comes off with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; products out there did so little</li>
            <li> I changed from L&#x27;Occitane because it was getting too expensive and didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caution, it can be a little messy.</li>
            <li> Also, its a little harsh putting on (pulls at your hair and skin a bit).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does apply a little messy, but like I have done with all deodorants, I just let it sit while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth and hair and then wipe off the excess using a tissue.  </li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;ve worn this on 10 mile hikes, a 14 hours summer day of traveling on public transit and tough client meetings, and everything else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This deodorant is a total waste of money and I urge everybody--do not buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> I just felt that I should let anyone interested know that there is the chance that there can be some unpleasant side effects.</li>
            <li> 2- they pack it very well, with a label that says to keep out of heat and with a cold insulation lining in addition to the box as well as an ice</li>
            <li> I never ever review products on Amazon because I feel its a waste of time.</li>
            <li> However, when this happened I realized I had probably been applying it too heavily.  </li>
            <li> He was looking for something for heavier sweating and a natural deodorant, which is difficult to find.</li>
            <li> My brother sweats heavily.</li>
            <li> Soften the deodorant stick by holding it against your armpit for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> but they are sticky, messy and leave stains on my undershirts.</li>
            <li> but I will update once I wear this a few times.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few days now and no complaints at all</li>
            <li> There was a period of time a couple years ago when the product was not available</li>
            <li> After a couple months of using these terrible deodorants I again decided I was just going to have to try to make my own.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant stands up to heavy sweating from exercise and lasts all day—and then some.</li>
            <li> I.e., no heavy exercising).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful when dressing after application; I often get white residue on my T-shirts, which is annoying, but can come out with water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy sweater when I exercise and attend 4 yoga classes each week.</li>
            <li> I even asked my wife to validate it just in case I was missing something.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a few days.</li>
            <li> But this product is my go-to everyday choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I had that trouble a couple weeks after I started using it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to try an all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Also, yeah it goes on kinda messy and chalky</li>
            <li> I gave myself a break form using it for a few days, and the started using it again.  </li>
            <li> I read a few articles that say that baking soda changes the PH of your skin, and allows yeast and/or fungus to thrive and set up an infection.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars for the natural and simplistic ingredients, and you can&#x27;t beat it for odor control.  </li>
            <li> few notes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I few weeks ago I found a lump under my armpit.</li>
            <li> But after a few weeks of using it my underarms started itching.</li>
            <li> and none of them worked for longer than a few hours.  </li>
            <li> But this deodorant turned my underarms black!</li>
            <li> Half way through the work day, I went to the bathroom to give myself a scent test, and to my surprise NOTHING!  </li>
            <li> The package is a little small, so this ends up being a little pricey with shipping.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned that the product can be hard to apply.</li>
            <li> found this product, and was skeptical, because I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, such as Toms, which didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this for everyone to at least try!!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant but something in it caused my arm pits to itch real bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, costing about twice what I usually pay for deodorant.  </li>
            <li> But, I will deal with the mess, because it works!  </li>
            <li> favorite part is the fact that I can now protect my clothes from getting nasty pit stains and from permanently having that slight tinge under the pits, (that tinge that never goes away, even after thorough washings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that it is not always the easiest to put on - the stick is very rough and dry and can hurt when applying it.</li>
            <li> after 2 uses i ended up with some pretty bad skin irriation.</li>
            <li> No matter what I would wear, by the end of the day, my pits and shirts smelled pretty bad.</li>
            <li> But I learned to slow it down, and take 3 downward swipes for each arm.</li>
            <li> To start with, i was very heavy into antiperspirants do to my heavy sweating in my arm pits.</li>
            <li> Finally I got tired of it, did a little research, and decided to try something free of all the chemicals that everybody claims are terrible for you.</li>
            <li> The stick does not melt but gets a little hard -</li>
            <li> but it is a little hard to apply</li>
            <li> The only con is that you have to be wary of the white residue it leaves behind especially on dark clothing.</li>
            <li> only thing I can bother to think of registering as a complaint is that in slightly colder temperatures, I find it rather difficult to slide this on under my armpits.</li>
            <li> I wonder if it is due to the tea tree oil ingredient since I find the smell of green tea unappealing, too</li>
            <li> This deodorant is so Very dry &amp; worse</li>
            <li> It does go on a little slow, but I have never had any problems with smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt that was a bit shady and unethical.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it clumps for some people.</li>
            <li> Usually the problem is not the deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Docked one star because it is expensive, especially when you add shipping.</li>
            <li> Extremely skeptical, and had low expectations before buying.  </li>
            <li> but I had to carry a small bottle of it in my purse to reapply through out the day).</li>
            <li> Usually these \\&quot;all</li>
            <li> Plus most run-of-the-mega-mill products are horrible on your skin.</li>
            <li> The second stick I received I was unable to twist up (it was stuck) and took quite some time to fix.</li>
            <li> this stuff is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Within that box the deodorant itself was in a sealed bag, along with a small ice pack to help keep it from melting during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> There is a small issue with application as others have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> It does destroy odor, but it goes on like sandpaper!</li>
            <li> small tip</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spread on the skin the easiest and over time it develops small crystals on the surface that need to be removed or they can cut you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-develops small crystals on the surface that need to be removed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the usual \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products out there (Tom&#x27;s, Desert Essence, Crystals, etc.)</li>
            <li> I tried it, during the end of my menstrual cycle and it seemed to work, I will update next month if I am wrong.</li>
            <li> Tried other all natural deodorants and was consistently disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very few ingredients - check&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice a little irritation but not as serious as the homemade concoction.</li>
            <li> I did some research and found out my skin was reacting to the change in pH due to the baking soda and could get worse or infected.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I recommend spreading this with your fingers, and I would encourage Jungleman Naturals to package this product in a round, shallow &amp;#34;salve&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; container the way</li>
            <li> I was kinda skeptical, so I kept using it and by day 5 I had gotten rid of that problem of having to apply deodorant/antiperspirant right after showering because I would start smelling, or coming out the shower and still smelling dirty armpits.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any bad under-arm odors, and I live in Hawaii, where we tend to sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time, and I appreciate so much that it does not have those nasty chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li> No smell, and just barely starts to fail halfway through day two!</li>
            <li> I hardly write reviews, but felt I needed to make the time for this one.</li>
            <li> but I had to make a switch because Mitchum is REALLY hard on clothes.</li>
            <li> Everyone says it&#x27;s hard to apply</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews, but in this case I had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is as hard as a rock and does not cover odor as I would expect.</li>
            <li> downfalls are that it is too hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> This is surprisingly hard to find.</li>
            <li> At this temperature, this deodorant is rock hard and hard to spread across your underarm.  </li>
            <li> Which I find so hard to believe based on the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This review is from someone who hardly sweats but tends to sweat when nearing/during my menstrual cycle (everything gets accelerated, [growth of hair, sweating, etc]).</li>
            <li> He works hard, and needed some help.  </li>
            <li> At least that is my experience.</li>
            <li> but I never liked the scents.</li>
            <li> I tried Tom&#x27;s, which is probably the worst I&#x27;ve ever smelled in my entire adult life.</li>
            <li> From doing some research the yellowing is secondary to some chemical ingredients just about every product has,</li>
            <li> Probably too late to overcome brain damage now, but couldn&#x27;t hurt, huh?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I probably went through at least a gallon of water.  </li>
            <li> This product is not effective.</li>
            <li> those that are complaining that the Jungleman stick is too hard/waxy and difficult to apply, trying running some water over the stick to wet it before applying.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve never really worn an unscented deodorant before this one, I was a bit insecure about it</li>
            <li> I never liked any of them.  </li>
            <li> Application isnt the smoothest, but at least your not getting any metals or petrochemicals in your body from applying it to your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hope Jungleman eventually qualifies for Amazon Prime because the shipping costs sucks, but still cheaper.  </li>
            <li> so I was shocked that I had one to an all natural one.</li>
            <li> but now i am forced to stop using it for the reasons I mentioned</li>
            <li> Some customers said this goes on thick like paste.</li>
            <li> I usually smell horrible quick if I don&#x27;t use any deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a few days of using it I started to feel weak and just generally not good.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product!</li>
            <li> I mean, it is not a problem if nobody can see my armpit</li>
            <li> Not sure how I&#x27;ll travel with it!  </li>
            <li> I mean there was just nothing, it smelled like emptiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I mean I would rather that</li>
            <li> I decided on trying natural deodorants and came up disappointed.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days where my deodorant would fail halfway through an average day.</li>
            <li> I used it for three days and began to develop serious pimples in my armpits.</li>
            <li> This deodorant kicks serious ass.</li>
            <li> so why use a product that doesn&#x27;t work and has ingredients that are ridiculous to allow your body to absorb.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t take all-natural deodorants seriously after trying both products.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get tired of the fake smells in other deodorants.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that I can tell that even if I forget to put deodorant on my body actually doesn&#x27;t even smell as bad as it used to.  </li>
            <li> After the job was done, I only smelled slightly bad.  </li>
            <li> Regular deodorant is SO bad for you.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this wouldn&#x27;t be as bad, and it definitely hasn&#x27;t been</li>
            <li> I was so paranoid and hated that I couldn&#x27;t find anything that really worked.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Every time I would apply it, it would painfully rip out my armpit hair as I dragged it back and forth on my under arm.  </li>
            <li> I sweat way less and the smell is completely masked (and i have terrible BO).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  be afraid to use it on places OTHER than just your underarms</li>
            <li> that being said, this deoodrant has one MAJOR annoying flaw, which prevents me from buying it again any time soon.</li>
            <li> He would smell horribly after sitting at a computer all day - they didn&#x27;t work and we were ready to give up on the idea until we found this!</li>
            <li> The product has mostly no smell, just a faint scent of sea salt.  </li>
            <li> my armpits have the least odor!</li>
            <li> Works well at first but after continued use it have me a bad underarm rash!!</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s to the point where I have a bumpy, red rash under my arms and it itches like crazy!</li>
            <li> if you got tough skin</li>
            <li> Very thick, and at times caused my underarms to chafe.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub on well- very thick... but keeps the scent away...</li>
            <li> No more checking for stinky armpits!!</li>
            <li> : Because it&#x27;s a cornstarch and oil base, it&#x27;s a little rough to put on when it&#x27;s cold and hard.</li>
            <li> It also left a horrible rash after using for a few days.</li>
            <li> have even spoken to the company&#x27;s customer service after receiving some broken deodorants.  </li>
            <li> the deodorant fell out of its socket because the rotating handle at the bottom of the bottle was broken.</li>
            <li> The Thai crystal deodorant stone worked well, but it was irritating to my skin at times.  </li>
            <li> They hurt and promised to get worse.</li>
            <li> but while I was target shopping this one time, I was running in the store because I was behind on time.  </li>
            <li> My B.O. becomes even worse than before</li>
            <li> Ofcourse some of the unhealthy products for you work...</li>
            <li> Jungleman achieves this without ingredients linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s, without irritating additives, and without synthetic fragrances.</li>
            <li> Not happy about that.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me as a deodorizer, and was irritating to my underarms.</li>
            <li> NOT UNCOMMON.</li>
            <li> I kept using it because it worked so well, but the itching has gotten worse.</li>
            <li> It progressively got worse on day two.</li>
            <li> but I now have a painful cyst the size of a marble under one arm, a rash that rivals the chicken pox and talk about some major itching.</li>
            <li> I kept having a horrible reaction to the normal stuff.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to get rid of my nasty chemically powerful deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed a bit of bad odor also after a few hours have gone by.</li>
            <li> All that other crap is in the garbage</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to apply because the product is hard, but it does the job well.</li>
            <li> The unscented deodorants I have used before sometimes smell weird after I sweat, but not Jungleman.</li>
            <li> I feel sorry for anyone who has armpit hair.</li>
            <li> It kinda masks the scent, but has some weird scent to it after awhile.  </li>
            <li> Fails the expectations</li>
            <li> Like I said, record heat in Texas and their wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with the packaging, or the deodorant</li>
            <li> It was weird.</li>
            <li> they all failed.  </li>
            <li> The feeling of it on was uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical to switch my deodorant though because I sweat sooo</li>
            <li> 8/19/12: Unfortunately, the product doesn&#x27;t work with my body anymore.</li>
            <li> This is not an \\&quot;invisible solid\\&quot;  and it makes your armpits feel sticky and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had to downgrade my rating.  </li>
            <li> so it melted and resolidified at some point into a weird shape.  </li>
            <li> threw this deodorant away as it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I have stopped using this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I literally thought something was wrong with my sense of smell.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product and have never bought non-scented deodorant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I was skeptical when I saw the name</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t disappear or fail.  </li>
            <li> Very poor.</li>
            <li> He either would break out in a rash or have like little bumps that were very painful.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible reaction to the oils in here, but it may work for other people!</li>
            <li> I explained to him what happened, gave him all the info about the purchase, but he was being difficult and not helpful at all--extremely bad customer service from this company.</li>
            <li> Jungleman ships your product with a thermally reflective &amp;#34;blanket&amp;#34; and cold packs.</li>
            <li> I was getting desperate</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be easier to just order and stock up when it&#x27;s cold out.</li>
            <li> but this deodorant just stinks.</li>
            <li> It will burn like crazy and irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I work with all kinds of crazy chemicals anyway.</li>
            <li> It still works when it solidifies again but it can be inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the unscented flavor.</li>
            <li> I wish they mad it softer.</li>
            <li> was I proven wrong!</li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;ve been using Jungleman for over a month now and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet!</li>
            <li> problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is unscented with just a very faint scent of tea tree (which is one of the ingredients).</li>
            <li> Plus, it &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; up into pieces after each application which makes it virtually impossible to use when you are applying it.  </li>
            <li> It made me think that the product itself might be doing something bad to my body.</li>
            <li> seems to do the job, and doesnt smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to the bad deodorants, give this a shot.  </li>
            <li> a bit from it, about a month or two after switching from the bad stuff, that lasted about three weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you will not smell bad.</li>
            <li> when i tried ARM &amp; HAMMER, i got a bad rash from the baking soda content, for some reason, jungleman has baking soda in it, but, doesnt irritate me UNLESS I re-apply 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> It lasted a couple weeks with one or two painful cysts under each arm at a time that would come and go.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say is completely awful but is not  great either.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by toxic natural-impostures like rock/liquid rock containing potassium alum which is neurotoxic aluminum and sticks containing propylene glycol which is an oxygen-starving toxin made from carcinogenic crude oil.</li>
            <li> the name is tragic, as is the ugly packaging.</li>
            <li> I sweat like crazy (drenched!)</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> From the scorching summer heat , to the frigid winter cold of the North.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be nothing, but it was a wake up call for me to STOP using aluminum base deos which I knew were bad for me.</li>
            <li> Worthless for me.  </li>
            <li> I hate that it has aluminum in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with anything except the company&#x27;s terrible choice of names.</li>
            <li> and I hated them all.  </li>
            <li> Horrible deodorant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT application is terrible.</li>
            <li> and then they formed a horrible rash.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is terrible!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> - just wish they would find a way to resolve that issue without adding any nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li> eventually started using crystal deodorant, and it didn&#x27;t make me break out under my armpits, and kept me from smelling horrible.</li>
            <li> Both my son and I broke out horribly with this product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really liked this product.  It irks me to pay $6 for a 3oz product + $4 for shipping - but it&#x27;s good nonetheless.  I won&#x27;t buy this again due to the price (I don&#x27;t enjoy paying $9 for deodorant).  If the price drops &amp; shipping is free (prime or add-on item), I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time I tried a deodorant that didn&#x27;t have aluminum and I was very pleased with the results.  I did notice a slight increase in perspiration over the first week or two, but it died down after that.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect but it actually does work.  Unscented which I prefer something with a little scent but a dash of cologne goes along nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to last most of a day or all day and night depending on activity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difficulty is application which takes some trial and error.  You cannot put on dry armpits as it will not slide.  Either a recently washed body with water still present or dunk the stick under water/faucet running for each up/down motion seems to work but it still drags with effort.  It does also leave a caked on mess in some areas which need wiping off but it you apply enough across the entire area it does in fact work.  Even with some sweat it still remained stink free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see it there are any irritation effects once used for a while and if I still agree with this post.</li>
            <li> A bit harder to apply than regular deodorant. I can&#x27;t just swish it on real quick because it doesn&#x27;t glide. But I learned to slow it down, and take 3 downward swipes for each arm. After that - it does the trick. Good product!</li>
            <li> I like that this is non-toxic and absolutely odorless, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Now Foods Long Lasting Deodorant Stick and need to apply it once or twice a week at most. So I&#x27;m not a particularly smelly person. This product didn&#x27;t last a day. Yikes! I&#x27;m going back to Now.</li>
            <li> The product works and trust me I have used all kinds of natural deos before but this one is the most effective. I wish though they wouldn&#x27;t lie about the amount you are getting, it is not 3 oz but rather 2.5. I felt that was a bit shady and unethical. Be honest about your product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a few weeks now and it is as good as, if not better than, the Dove Men&#x27;s deodorant I had been using for years. I was skeptical at first because my day job is as far from strenuous as you can imagine but I finally was able to put this deodorant to the test with eight hours of yard work in direct sunlight. It held up marvelously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one review mentioned, it does feel like applying glue to your armpits but it doesn&#x27;t last past application.</li>
            <li> I never ever review products on Amazon because I feel its a waste of time. This deodorant however needs to be given some attention. Works Works Works, and is safe, odor free, and all around a great buy. Going to recommend this to my local store and see if I can keep this company in business for years to come.</li>
            <li> The only true unscented deodorant in the market. Excellent performing deodorant and the best I have used with odor control. This is coming from a large, hairy, and sweaty middle eastern man that lives in AZ.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it does result in yellow stains on white shirts; however this is not the same type of yellow stain you get with aluminum deodorants. A quick wash with hot water and tide removes all of it, whereas aluminum stains being much more difficult to get marginally better.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  I have tried many many kinds and this seems to be the best for preventing odor with my chemistry.  It also lasts a long time, and I appreciate so much that it does not have those nasty chemicals in it.  The only thing I would change would be that it can have a tendency to leave white stains on my clothes (they come right out if you rub it with a dry towel).  But honestly that is a small price to pay for me to smell nice and not have to use harsh chemicals on my skin to do so.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different deodorants including &amp;#34;all-naturals&amp;#34;, etc. but it has always ended up the same way. This is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used consistently without irritation. Plus, the name is just awesome.</li>
            <li> This is only the 3rd aluminum free deodorant I have tried but this stuff is great.  The other products I have tried left me with rash&#x27;s and/or burnt my skin and neither worked that well.  This product is great.  If I am going to work out after working all day or if I plan to exert myself for hours on end, I will bring it with me to re-apply once more if needed. Otherwise this stuff works great. Of course different people react differently but for me, this is the best I have tried. To me I would much rather use a product that I might have to apply twice rather than using a product with aluminum. Great stuff, I highly recommend this product. I forgot to mention that the mfg. sends this product out real quick. I have received both of my orders within 2-3 days. At least that is my experience. They also include a stay cool pack inside the packaging to insure that the deodorant doesn&#x27;t melt during the hot summer months!</li>
            <li> My husband works as a contractor, we live in north Florida and he is allergic to some of the ingredients in OTC deodorants. A lady from Alabama stated that this product worked great for her husband. After it arrived, I kept it in the frig until it was needed, then we had to thaw it to room temps to use it, not a big problem. However, even though it does help, sweat stink is sweat stink, period. My husband doesn&#x27;t think it works any better than the OTCs, I think it helps more than others and is better than I&#x27;ve found anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the scoop: I ordered this deodorant and it was shipped the next day and received 3 days later. They packed it well, with a little coolpack to keep the heat out when it was sitting in front of my door. I tried it for 3 days now (including a sweaty beach &amp; street fair day) and there is no smell at all. The consistency is a little tricky - the stick melts, if it is too hot or applying it leaves white little flakes, if it is too cold. I live in a Los Angeles beach city and right now it is around 70/75 degrees here. The stick does not melt but gets a little hard - I just warmed it up with my hair dryer for a few seconds and applied it hassle and residue free :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars only because of the consistency. It feels a little sandpapery - there are fine grains in the stick and extra work is required to apply it smoothly. So far my skin is not irritated but I will update, once anything happens. Love it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different natural/non toxic deodorants and some were okay, others not so much. This one works great! Keeps me dry and smelling good all day. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have tried several deodorants, both natural and completely unnatural. I have never found a deodorant that leaves me with ZERO odor at the end of the day. I am not a small man prone to smelling good at all times. I&#x27;ve tried Arm and Hammer Essentials, Speed Stick and Toms of Maine deodorants in the last 3 months. Only Jungleman left me stank-free. I keep it at room temperature and apply it right out of the shower, otherwise, it can be dry and difficult to apply. I&#x27;ve read other reviewers saying to stick the deodorant under warm running water for a second (with the cap off) before applying it. That really does help it go on smoothly. I just ordered two more and am absolutely delighted with this product. No bad stuff and not tested on animals. Awesome.</li>
            <li> In the past year I&#x27;ve been searching a good natural deodorant. I settled on making my own that had fairly similar ingredients to jungleman. However after having burned my armpits with the baking soda present in the deodorant I had to stop using it. Alot of people have super sensitive pits, according to a Google search, and the same happened to them. In an attempt to see if I could get away without being burned by jungle man, and for the most part it was successful. I did notice a little irritation but not as serious as the homemade concoction. It didn&#x27;t protect me from sweat and stench nearly last as long as conventional deoderants tho and I don&#x27;t care for the clay like smell of it. Thus, I more than likely would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The BEST aluminum free deodorant I have ever used. Very effective, lasts all day, no skin irritation. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after trying what seemed to feel like every natural deodorant brand (Crystal Body, Herban Cowboy, Toms of Maine, JÄSON, etc) - none of which worked. He would smell horribly after sitting at a computer all day - they didn&#x27;t work and we were ready to give up on the idea until we found this! It works. That&#x27;s all there is to it. It&#x27;s unscented, which he loves because he gets to choose his cologne scent which didn&#x27;t compete with musky deodorant smells - which I&#x27;ve always found to be overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: it works and he doesn&#x27;t smell anymore - even after a workout!</li>
            <li> I recently started using this and I really like it. I actually like it better than regular deodorant. There is no scent... even after sweating. The unscented deodorants I have used before sometimes smell weird after I sweat, but not Jungleman. It&#x27;s also made from all natural ingredients and not all those chemicals that there is now research can cause cancer. Definitely worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like this stuff but it is great!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have used it for nearly a year and it has exceeded all my expectations!  I am a high school teacher at a girls prison and have never felt self-conscious during class because it wasn&#x27;t working well enough (no complaints from the students either and believe me, they are not shy!).  I also used Jungleman very successfully last summer while hiking and camping in Yellowstone.  I do agree with some other comments that it can darken skin or make it too dry.  However, when this happened I realized I had probably been applying it too heavily.  A little goes father than you might think.  I highly recommend giving this product a try!</li>
            <li> I always wanted to find a natural deodorant but I was having to use cynical strength deodorants during the summer and honestly didn&#x27;t think anything else would work.  Then I got pregnant and really wanted to at least try a few out.  The first was a flop but then I found Jungleman and I went all summer using it even at the beach and just purchased my second one.  It totally works!  Not to mention that I can tell that even if I forget to put deodorant on my body actually doesn&#x27;t even smell as bad as it used to.  My smell was actually being made worse by the other kinds of deodorant.  I Highly recommend this for everyone to at least try!!!</li>
            <li> After my first use, it irritated my underarms. Caused discomfort. I quickly stopped using it. I can not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Does not work like my Sure did. Does not hold up. Put me in an embarrassing situation. Also, Very Dry, not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I also liked how they ship it with an ice pack to ensure it doesn&#x27;t arrive at doorstep a sloppy mess.. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I applied this once in the morning, 6 hours later I did a 2-hour Muay Thai session. I still couldn&#x27;t smell my armpits, and I sweat a lot. I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found this stuff, it&#x27;s worth the cost over Old Spice (although no free shipping is lame).</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely all natural and last long (throughout the day) but I don&#x27;t think it will last long (the whole stick),&lt;br /&gt;When applying, it uses a fair amount but it goes quick. This stuff last really long throughout the day as well.&lt;br /&gt;I applied in the morning and before going to bed, it still had a strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT* Just today I noticed some white stuff under my shirt right under the armpit area when I took it off, I suspect it is the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to apply a small amount and move your arms back and forth to get it all in the armpit area. You don&#x27;t want to put too much where it rubs off on your clothes. Just a warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT** So after using this product after 1-2 months, I will stop. This deodorant leaves white stains on my clothes. It gets on and off them when I put on or take off shirts. I ruined a couple of my good shirts which is a bummer, they have white stains that will not come out and they are from the deodorant! UGH!</li>
            <li> I thoroughly scoured the reviews and gathered that some people LOVE this deo and some people hate it due to irritation and application difficulty. Personally, I&#x27;m impressed by this stuff. It is a little dry-ish going on, but i haven&#x27;t found much clumping (as some have complained). I&#x27;m female and I imagine that maybe it&#x27;s easier to apply to smooth, hairless skin rather than a hairy pit as it goes for men. Not sure why it clumps for some people. And I think those who get irritated pits are allergic to tea tree oil. I guess I&#x27;m not, because I&#x27;m not experiencing any irritation. I LOVE that this is completely unscented!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this all day + a sweaty workout and Jungleman was completely effective. I switch between this brand and the Herban Cowboy brand. There is really no reason for anyone to use products with parabens and aluminum on their skin with products like these on the market.</li>
            <li> i wanted to start going more natural but after using this product I started to develop a bad rash in my arm pit, so I had to throw it away.  Maybe im allergic to something in it, I dunno</li>
            <li> Quit good... works great... keep sweating at bay most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;It is really not totally unscented, like 100%... more like 95%...</li>
            <li> Jungleman is starting to price itself out of consideration. Was a great value but now it has serious contenders in Island Organics and Stinkbug.ve a certain temperature. Jungleman ships your product with a thermally reflective &amp;#34;blanket&amp;#34; and cold packs. This is a legitimate company with an excellent product. Jungleman, do NOT change your formulation, this works. Thank you for a healthy, responsible, alternative, that works so very well. Well Done!</li>
            <li> arrived as expected. Absolutely no smell to it and so far works well.</li>
            <li> Glad to see this product on Amazon. Was introduced to it through a friend a while back and it&#x27;s easily the best natural deodorant Ive tried. However, I wasnt able to find it through the natural stores in my area or on amazon, when I checked a few months back. The deodorant is smooth and soft, not slimy, and is completey unscented, definitely works as described and is safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many natural deodorants.  Jungleman works very well and has absolutely no toxic ingredients (baking soda, cornstarch, tea tree oil, palm oil).  I do not have to reapply it, and I live in Washington DC, where the summers are very hot and humid. I still sweat, but I do not smell.  It&#x27;s almost a holy grail natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However ... applying it can be an issue.  Because of the baking soda and cornstarch, the deodorant stick has a lot of drag.  It does not go on smoothly and can irritate one&#x27;s armpits.  What I do is to wet the top of the stick with warm water before applying it to each armpit, and it goes on a bit easier.  Another reviewer mentioned rubbing a dab of shea butter into the armpits before applying Jungleman; that sounds like it would make the product apply more smoothly so I might try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have mentioned white residue--I gently rub the product in after I apply it, and there is no whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really good, unscented natural deodorant.  I just wish it were a bit easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Works well, all day long.  I&#x27;m a warm body, and tend to sweat a little more than most.  This deodorant keeps me fresh all day, even if I&#x27;m working hard.</li>
            <li> my favorite deoderant.</li>
            <li> I have had no odor or sweat problems using this for almost a year. They used to have a three-pack so shipping was not so much of an additional percentage of the cost. I will note that they claim it doesn&#x27;t contain glycerol laurate or stearate, however palm oil, one of the ingredients, has both.</li>
            <li> This stuff if kind of amazing.  Somehow this odorless bar keeps your underarms completely odor free.  It feels strange to call a deodorant impressive, but I was seriously impressed.  Soon as it is back in stock I&#x27;m going to grab a few.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but after 6 months it started giving me a rash.  I now use it off and on trading days with  DeoMom deodorant and it has started working again, and I don&#x27;t have a rash any more.  It is hard to find a product that performs well over the long term but this one does.</li>
            <li> I have used many deodorants and this one is by far the best. I do have sweaty armpits and the drugstore brands work ok for the most part but I never liked the scents. Jungleman brand deodorant is better at wetness protection, odor control, and doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts. Highly recommend this deodorant if you&#x27;re tired of ruined white shirts and if you don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals on your body</li>
            <li> I finally found something that does what it says! A great product that I would highly recommend to anyone! Simply awesome..</li>
            <li> Not all that satisfied with this product...stings and  leaves  one itching at times...also does not exit the container that well. Doubt I would reorder this product...there are others on the market that do the  job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E. David Brewer</li>
            <li> Works good, but sorta hard on the pits. I wish they mad it softer.</li>
            <li> The amazing thing about this product is that not only does it work to keep odor at bay, but it doesn&#x27;t have to clog your pores to stop from there being any odor! It&#x27;s aMAZing. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is a slight burn from it, but it&#x27;s not very long lasting, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, so I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s something that happens every time I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is FANTASTIC! I&#x27;m definitely gonna buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Product works extremely well - I was shocked as many deoderants don&#x27;t work well for me. I preferred the light mint scent though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  All natural, lasts for days...yes days, even after workingout at the gym and only a minimal scent.  36-48 hours and a workout or two later with ZERO BO...that&#x27;s better than antipersperant / deoderant combos with the harsh chemicals.  The scent it does have when on is uhm, not the best and kinda smells like ejaculate but a squirt or two of your favorite cologn or perfume masks right over it.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the BEST all-natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. After wanting to limit myself from the harsh chemicals found in traditional deodorants, I was on the search for something all-natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal sticks worked for a little bit but as soon as I started sweating, I would immediately start stinking. I tried Tom&#x27;s, which is probably the worst I&#x27;ve ever smelled in my entire adult life. I tried Sam&#x27;s Natural, which worked really well, but totally stained my shirts, even after a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Google search landed me on Jungleman all-natural deodorant and it&#x27;s been a dream come true. It&#x27;s 100% all-natural, which is the first qualification. But more importantly, IT WORKS. I&#x27;ve put it through its paces from nervous sweats in office meetings to manual labor sweats in a hot, humid summer. After a long day working outside, there can start to be a hint of body odor but for most days and scenarios, this stuff is simply the best. What I also love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t stain any of my shirts. It&#x27;s an amazing deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick is a bit stiff so it does go on a little rough. But that still doesn&#x27;t affect the 5-star rating. All the benefits of this deodorant COMPLETELY outweigh that little quibble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my wife and I plan to keep on ordering as long as its being made.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural deodarant and anti-perspirant and chose this after reading all the reviews. I will say it definitely keeps the odor down but is like a thick paste that will stain your shirts. Only other option is to use a commercial deodarant/anti-perspirant and use oral chelation.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that this does anything except make white pit marks on darker shirts. I think I&#x27;ll stick to my regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> baking soda and sandpaper feel</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer and have tried EVERY SINGLE natural and chemical-laden product out there. I even made my own for a while which worked but was messy. Thank you Jungleman Naturals for creating a natural product that WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> The actual product is soOooo dry... it doesn&#x27;t even naturally apply to your pits. I have to run water on it - before applying just to get the product to smear on my skin. I feel sorry for anyone who has armpit hair. However, when you DO get it on - its odorless, lasts long and it works great.</li>
            <li> It kinda masks the scent, but has some weird scent to it after awhile.  It doesn&#x27;t keep your armpits dry, it is just some sticky residue  like loose glue, it&#x27;s nothing that special, and it rubs off onto your shirt too after awhile, not worth it IMO.  was worth a try though, sorta worked, but the overall, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Horrible deodorant. It left stains on my clothes. I couldn&#x27;t get the smell out of tshirts after laundering. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. It also left a horrible rash after using for a few days.</li>
            <li> After using this product I have thrown away all my old deodorants and I haven&#x27;t looked back, this is what I use when I work.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try out this deodorant to see how well it performed.  It has been awesome!  It does go on a little slow, but I have never had any problems with smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used other deodorants in the past, they may make it through a day.  But I have actually gone two days with Jungleman without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even spoken to the company&#x27;s customer service after receiving some broken deodorants.  They were extremely helpful and took care of me immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product and company.  Good folks.</li>
            <li> It does work as a deodorizer and keeps armpits stink free. But it also becomes pasty in the summer months and is now causing some acne on my armpits, oily products don&#x27;t work on my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy when I started using it and the climate was cooler but now i am forced to stop using it for the reasons I mentioned</li>
            <li> This is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used that actually prevents b.o. It doesn&#x27;t stop sweat though.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality. The deodorant stick fell apart (and kind of melted) in about a month of use. I don&#x27;t perspire that much so I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything strong. I just didn&#x27;t like having the stains under my shirts from using industrial stuff from aluminum. Even if the stuff works well or not, I&#x27;d still expect it to remain intact after use, but a month of use and it doesn&#x27;t even come out of the stick anymore because of how much of a mush it&#x27;s become.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how well this works. I have tried other natural deodorants that were only marginally effective, but this one kept me completely odor free today in the 90+ degree heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an ultra-distance bicyclist who wanted a deodorant that would not interfere with the body&#x27;s cooling system but leave me smelling clean after 50 to 150 miles. This works! I&#x27;m on my fourth order.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant to try if you want a truly unscented, odor blocking application. No bad smells long through the day! I&#x27;m very impressed! Definitely worth giving this a try if you don&#x27;t like anti-antiperspirant and actually expect deodorant to work blocking smells and not just covering them with fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product that stopped any BO but it is a little hard to apply (doesn&#x27;t glide on you have to press and smear on, ended up having to trim hair so as to stop pulling it out), after a week of use my pits started to itch a bit and finally the skin was dead and peeling off so I am going to try some other product for a deodorant.</li>
            <li> This worked well most of the time (but not always).  It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.  If you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;ll have to use something stronger on occassion.</li>
            <li> Only deodorant I use!</li>
            <li> the deodorant fell out of its socket because the rotating handle at the bottom of the bottle was broken. Fails the expectations</li>
            <li> Several years ago I switched from conventional deodorants to Tom&#x27;s of Maine because I was worried about the chemicals.  Tom&#x27;s gives me a red rash under both pits but it works.  This Jungleman deodorant works very well for me.  I find that when switching deodorants, it takes several weeks for my body to adjust to the new deodorant.  Also, overall health and hydration impacts sweat and body odor.  Usually the problem is not the deodorant.  If you are taking care of yourself and are committed to using a natural deodorant, then Jungleman should work for you.  It might take several weeks for your body to adjust to the lack of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered my second stick of Jungleman.  I&#x27;m now trying to convert my wife.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is completely unscented. I bought this for my brother and he said he couldn&#x27;t smell anything and I have a much sharper sense of smell than he does and I automatically said it smells like it has tea tree oil and low and behold we look a the ingredients and it does! It isn&#x27;t a strong scent, I just observe far more than most do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother loves this deodorant. He was looking for something for heavier sweating and a natural deodorant, which is difficult to find. If anyone is looking for a deodorant that lasts, this does. My brother sweats heavily. It&#x27;s a family curse. We sweat when it&#x27;s cold and we live in Texas, so it is hot! He applied it the moment he received the package  (around 11 am) and he didn&#x27;t reapply till the next day; more than twelve hours. We live in Texas and it is record heat right now. 104 degrees with a 100 percent humidity and he didn&#x27;t sweat through it, no body order or anything. He said he gets a white residue from the deodorant but doesn&#x27;t mind it. It doesn&#x27;t transfer or leave stains on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging on the deodorant should be noted: It was very well packaged! Like I said, record heat in Texas and their wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with the packaging, or the deodorant and it clearly said on the package to keep it away from sun exposure. My brother was a bit worried about that because he had read several reviews about poor packaging and the deodorant destroyed in extreme heat. My brother was extremely happy about this and is stuck on this deodorant permanatenly. He also appreciated that the company responded to the reviews about the packaging and took great care and detail and sending it with an icepack and a sealed exposure proof package and clearly labeled about sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, quick shipment (arrived a week early) and the 4 and half stars doesn&#x27;t give this deodorant justice.</li>
            <li> This is the 5th time ordering jungle man for me from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This time I bought 15 sticks, just to stock up so I dont have to keep paying shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have ever had is that if you get a &#x27;stale&#x27; stick it will hurt your under arm hair, otherwise the &#x27;fresh&#x27; sticks kick ass and go on smooth and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;I work outside every day from 9-6 every day except sunday. This product works.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive armpits and most deodorants either give me a rash or just don&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve gone through two sticks now and plan to keep on using this stuff. I love the name too! It makes me feel uber-manly, which is spectacular since I&#x27;m a chick. But seriously, this is one of my favorite Amazon finds ever.</li>
            <li> This product may be good for some, it just did not work well for me. Plus it is very, very, very, sticky. Note this does NOT stain clothes, which is a plus, but it does not keep you smelling sweet either.</li>
            <li> I hardly write reviews, but felt I needed to make the time for this one. It is hands down the best at controlling odor. In fact, you won&#x27;t have any kind of odor at all. But this deodorant turned my underarms black! It works, but I&#x27;ve discovered that if I use it 3 days in a row or more, my underarms start itching, I get red rashes all over it, then it darkens A LOT. While I love the odor control (if you sweat a lot, you will find this deodorant running down your arms since it melts with body heat!), I&#x27;ve resorted to just using this when I know I will have a very busy, very stressful day, and definitely do not want to stink to high heaven. After every use of this, I need to apply vitamin E oil to my underarms to help with the itching and lessen the darkening effects.&lt;br /&gt;** I&#x27;ve used other natural and chemical deodorants, tea tree oil, and even pure baking soda, with no such adverse effects like jungleman&#x27;s. My personal assumption is that there must be more to the list of ingredients that I am apparently allergic to**</li>
            <li> Been looking for a fragrance-free &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that actually eliminates body odor. This product is excellent. AMAZING odor control. Very gentle on my skin. This product works much better than the Kiss My Face fragrance free roll-on deodorant I used for years before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can detect no fragrance in this product. Doesn&#x27;t even smell like tea tree oil. Just nothing. Which is just how I want it to smell - like nothing. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Because it&#x27;s a cornstarch and oil base, it&#x27;s a little rough to put on when it&#x27;s cold and hard. Soften the deodorant stick by holding it against your armpit for a few seconds. When the surface of the deodorant stick warms up, it glides onto your armpit much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just finished a stick of this stuff, been using it for the last couple of months. Still performs well when the temperature rises! I like this stuff so much, I might just buy multiples so I have some travel.</li>
            <li> The name implies men, but its not just for men, because its really unscented.  It works great.  Most natural deodorants are very strongly scented.  And this really works.  Don&#x27;t  be afraid to use it on places OTHER than just your underarms - nuff said</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend, ever since I read a study on how most OTC deodorants has a chemical in them&lt;br /&gt;which can cause cancer! So I want my deodorants to be ALL natural! It also smells WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> Works!!! Even after intense sweaty workouts I still smell like....NOTHING!! I couldn&#x27;t ask for more in a natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> My husband liked this and used it for several weeks before breaking out in hives. I don&#x27;t know if it was the product or coincidence, but they went away when he stopped.</li>
            <li> **NOTE: I added an update to the review at the bottom.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL: I used to use Gillette gel deodorants, which worked really well, but my armpits would get pretty itchy sometimes and I&#x27;d end up scratching them up a bit at night before bed. It&#x27;s a little embarrassing, but hey, they were itchy and I was in the comfort of my own home. Finally I got tired of it, did a little research, and decided to try something free of all the chemicals that everybody claims are terrible for you. This product sounded perfect and had a ton of great reviews, so I bought it. And after using it for probably a good month or two now, I can safely say that it&#x27;s... okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first few weeks of using it, my armpits felt... I don&#x27;t know. Sore? It was weird. I couldn&#x27;t imagine that a product so free of chemicals could do that, so I just kept using it. I&#x27;d apply it after my shower and by the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t smell at all, which was nice, but occasionally I had that sore feeling, like somebody had punched me right in the armpit, which was a super weird reaction, and then eventually, I started to itch again. I tried trimming my hair in case that was exasperating the issue, but it was still happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, my right armpit was so itchy that I ended up scratching it one night until it actually hurt in the morning and for the next few days. I didn&#x27;t want to scratch it that much, but you know what itching is like. It&#x27;s maddening. You can&#x27;t help it. I stopped using it for a couple weeks and switched to a crystal roll-on deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have any sort of anti-perspirant in it and my armpits stopped feeling sore and eventually the itch died down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the solution I came up with is to use moisturizer on my armpits before applying the Jungleman deodorant. I don&#x27;t know if it was drying out my armpits or whatever, but it&#x27;s helped a lot. I rarely itch anymore, the skin is a lot healthier, and I don&#x27;t smell. Everything has worked out. I give it three stars because those first few weeks were pretty terrible and even now, it doesn&#x27;t seem that much better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. I guess the lack of chemicals is cool, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any kind of improvement or difference. I might try Tom&#x27;s of Maine next; I&#x27;ve heard good things about that brand, though you know how that can backfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/26: Well, after a couple weeks of using moisturizers on my armpits and switching full-time to the crystal roll-on deodorant, my itch had pretty much completely disappeared and the red irritation had cleared up. I was satisfied enough that I decided to try using the Jungleman deodorant again to see if things would work out now that my skin was back to normal. After just two days, my right armpit started itching again and I caught myself scratching. There&#x27;s a little bit of red irritation from the scratching, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll clear up within a couple days since I&#x27;m tossing the Jungleman deodorant and making a permanent switch to the crystal stuff. No, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, but honestly, that doesn&#x27;t bother me that much anymore. Everybody sweats a bit. With the crystal roll-on, I might sweat a little bit, but I don&#x27;t smell and I don&#x27;t itch, and that&#x27;s more than I can say for the Jungleman deodorant. I&#x27;m still planning on trying Tom&#x27;s of Maine soon, especially now that this Jungleman stuff is out of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m lowering my rating of this from three stars to one star because I just can&#x27;t really recommend this to anyone based on my experience. It made my armpits itch, left a residue that I had to wash off the next day, and worked decently as an antiperspirant but it&#x27;s not worth the tradeoff of having to go back to itchy armpits. Judging by all the positive reviews, I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m the outlier here and that&#x27;s fine, but man, I couldn&#x27;t be less satisfied with my Jungleman experience. I&#x27;d recommend the crystal roll-on to anyone though.three stars because those first few weeks were pretty terrible and even now, it doesn&#x27;t seem that much better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.

            <li> It is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant. It works great for a deodorant. You still sweat but it prevents the odor. That is all.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this all-natural deodorant after using regular Ax and Old Spice deodorants and anti-persperants all my life. I didn&#x27;t like how my under-arms never felt completely clean when using Ax, etc. I also did not like how regular anti-persperants had warnings on them saying not to use them if you have kidney issues. It made me think that the product itself might be doing something bad to my body. I decided to give Jungleman a try, and I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t prevent you from sweating, but I still think I sweat less than if I didn&#x27;t use it. It does a good job neutralizing smells as well. I have not noticed any bad under-arm odors, and I live in Hawaii, where we tend to sweat a lot. I also like that it is odorless. I tend to get tired of the fake smells in other deodorants. I&#x27;m glad I tried and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this product...No scent and actually works without constant reapplication. I am allergic to anti-perspirant and used to have to keep deodorant in my purse so I could reapply. This product lasts all day. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it since August. I tried &amp;#34;Take A Whiff&amp;#34;, DeodoMom Roll-on (which worked for a week or so), and whole bunch of other ones from natural &amp; organic stores.  None of them worked. I don&#x27;t have much problem with sweating, but with BO. This one works amazing. I absolutely recommend  this. It&#x27;s been 3 months and I love it, and just ordered another one.</li>
            <li> This product is not as efficient as it advertises. It provides moderate protection and for the price I was expecting a better product.</li>
            <li> As far as natural deodorant goes, this is excellent. I never smelled even a little bit when wearing this stuff--and I wore it while working in a foundry in the Midwest summer, and while working out every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is flaky (chalky, almost but not dry like chalk), and so you have to grind it over your armpit to get coverage. Perhaps I could have done with less coverage, but I was not comfortable with a light dusting (I don&#x27;t like to smell). This meant it would occasionally pull some hairs out--not painful, but kind of gross on the surface of the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after a few days of use I would get a slight irritation. It wasn&#x27;t a rash, and it went away if I didn&#x27;t use deodorant for a day, so I&#x27;m thinking it was from the friction of rubbing the flaky surface across my armpit (it doesn&#x27;t apply easily). But I used it for several months and never suffered anything more than slight irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a similar product at Wal-Mart (Tom&#x27;s of Maine). It applies much easier, but does not work as well. I will be returning to Jungleman as soon as I&#x27;m out of the Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t tolerate most deodorants.  This works very well.  Well tolerated for my sensitive skin.  Unscented.  Effective.  Docked one star because it is expensive, especially when you add shipping.</li>
            <li> I was surprised after using this at the great reviews that don&#x27;t seem to mention residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this a couple times, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works better than Tom&#x27;s for sure. And it&#x27;s aluminum free/natural, so it&#x27;s got that going for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT application is terrible. At a moderate room temp, applying to the underarms doesn&#x27;t yield a smooth coat of the stuff, but a bunch of tiny semi-solid chunks. (It&#x27;s all natural, so this makes sense in the absence of a &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; agent). On a hot day application becomes very messy, less chunky, but still a mess in the pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If white residue doesn&#x27;t bother you then you may have to discount my review, but it bothers me enough that every time I use this (and I don&#x27;t like to waste, so I use it every so often to try to deplete it) I need to wipe all the excess off.</li>
            <li> I hardily recommend this product! Do not order it to be delivered in a hot environment though. My first stick was delivered to a hot mailbox, and was melted when I got it. The second order (6 each) was delivered to a PO box, and was in perfect condition. Even the first stick was usable, and I love the product! I WILL buy more this winter, in order to be stocked for next year.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t glide as easily as most deorderants, but it works a lot better than any that I have ever used! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-perspirants/deodorants throughout the years that have destroyed my shirts over time and never left me satisfied. Well-known brands like Mitchum&#x27;s, Old-Spice, and the like either were always overpowering and ineffective at the end of the day. Showering and trying to remove the products would require hard-scrubbing to the point of red welts. I decided on trying natural deodorants and came up disappointed. These included Razorock, Tom&#x27;s, alum-block, and others, that caused my body odor to flactuate throughout the day. Jungleman was going to be the last natural deodorant I would ever try and 100% satisfied I took the chance. I could finally end my search after years of cycling through Walgreens, CVS, and Target for a decent deodorant. I have no BO at the end of the day and showering removes the product with no hard scrubbing. There is no more yellowing on my shirts and would highly recommend Jungleman to  anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Works&lt;br /&gt;-Unscented&lt;br /&gt;-No aluminum zirconium&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Pasty application&lt;br /&gt;-Would prefer larger size&lt;br /&gt;-Not available in retail locations</li>
            <li> This deodorant really works.  You may sweat a bit, but you will not smell odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution, it can be a little messy.</li>
            <li> The tea tree regular formula is actually less reactive than the mint for me.  But my husband likes this version.  It&#x27;s really a personal skin reaction thing.  You need to try both unfortunately to figure it out and have someone who can use the one you can&#x27;t :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t over apply - yes, you will still perspire (which is healthy) and be &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; a little.  Just tank top it or wear wicking cotton materials when it&#x27;s super hot or you&#x27;re super nervous/excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It beats getting Alzheimer&#x27;s from aluminum!&lt;br /&gt;There is zero smell.  The deodorant completely works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product, you could still smell the body oder after i had a good workout. It smells good but is not good if your a heavy sweater.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th bar of these &amp; I love them.  Takes a little while to get use to but once you use them you won&#x27;t use anything else.  I would like to see a cheaper price tho.</li>
            <li> This really irritated my skin.  Very itchy and rashes!  It also almost hurt to apply because it was so dry.  I won&#x27;t purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> I m not going to lie this deodorant is a 4 star. it makes your armpits kind of sweaty but then it becomes more dry when you dab it off and apply more. I like it but for me i guess its a 4 star because its not the ultimate protection I really wanted or what I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the natural ingredients of this product, but after a month of usage it&#x27;s just not working for me.  I apply it right after a shower and by the time I come home from the office, my BO is not nice.  I tried putting more product on, but it irritates my skin. I would not purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of context:  I&#x27;m an office worker and am not physically active during the day.  In general I don&#x27;t have strong body odor or excessive perspiration.</li>
            <li> shipped with a cooling package in it, got it extremely quick. seems to do the job, and doesnt smell bad at all. great organic deodorant!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works well for me, controls odor and doesn&#x27;t discolor shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, it is not advised to order this product during the summer months when it would be most needed.  The second order I received had melted during shipping (see images).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped with an ice pack (?) that unsurprisingly didn&#x27;t keep the product cool long enough to prevent melting.</li>
            <li> Very good ALL natural deodorant. Highly recommend. My pits are not smelly and the baking soda seems to keep me dry also.</li>
            <li> This was a great item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants but this stuff is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I used other deodorants that I&#x27;ve purchased from Whole Foods and on the internet but they are sticky, messy and leave stains on my undershirts. This deodorant allows you to sweat but doesn&#x27;t allow you to smell. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a non-staining all natural deodorant.  So far, this is the best one I have found.  It is a bit pasty, so it will clump as you apply, but on the bright side, it will keep you smelling good through most of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum my entire life. Mitchum produces fine products that are among the best in the market but I had to make a switch because Mitchum is REALLY hard on clothes. After ruining another expensive polo shirt, I decided to look of natural alternatives that would be easier on my wardrobe but still be effective. Man did I hit the jackpot with Jungleman! In many ways it works better than Mitchum, which is something I would not have believed before I tried it. It&#x27;s just as effective, but it lasts longer. It&#x27;s also unscented (there&#x27;s nothing I hate more than scented deodorant).  But best of all it doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts or degrade the fabric in the underarm area like Mitchum does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product that can go head to head against any other deodorant, natural or not.</li>
            <li> Pursuing aluminum free, as we all should, I&#x27;ve tried virtually everything out there...they all failed.  Aluminum literally clogs your sweat glands; no system of our bodies should be clogged, ever.  To this deodorant, it works and works in all conditions.  I can wane to odoriferous levels that rival a billy goat under layers of military gear; no more.  I shall never go back to another and the seller ships it immediately and with a cooling pack to ensure it retains it&#x27;s quality.  You can stop shopping for a natural, aluminum free deodorant right here.</li>
            <li> I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this product is.  I have tried EVERYTHING and nothing could mask my odor for more than 5 hours.  this product is a lifesaver.  Everyone says it&#x27;s hard to apply but I really don&#x27;t find it that difficult.  It just takes a little more effort than regular deodorant and goes on a little thicker.  I sweat way less and the smell is completely masked (and i have terrible BO).</li>
            <li> I like these so much I bought a whole bunch of them. Great for the outdoors or even for an everyday use. 24 hrs and still works great.</li>
            <li> Besides being free of chemicals &amp; toxic metals.. this is the most effective deodorant I have ever used. I was using the clinical strength deodorants from the local drug stores and they were not as effective as this all natural deodorant by far. I have no doubt that I will not stink at the end of the day when using jungle man deodorant..  I cannot say this about any other deodorant I have ever used. Its amazing it allows me to sweat but I do not stink and the deodorant itself is completely odorless. I got the whole family using this product now..  men and women.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to (you&#x27;ll find yourself checking your pits for a smell the first week or so) but it really does work.  No odor, no excessive sweating.  It&#x27;s like a normal deodorant stick, but it is a little tough going on (takes a few swipes).  If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to the bad deodorants, give this a shot.  I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is very effective and is, itself, fragrance free.  It really stops odor and seems to stave off sweat even though it is not an anti-perspirant.  I rate it 4 stars instead of five because it is a solid block and hard to apply.  If you&#x27;re a guy (or a hirsute woman), prepare for a few minor ouches when you apply.  It&#x27;s so effective, though, that this can be overlooked.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, and many deodorants cause painful skin irritation, and those that don&#x27;t are not strong enough to last all day. I have tried a number of aluminum free deodorants, and this was the first one that lasted all day without causing irritation.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that my first stick was so thick that it was hard to apply, and even left a hard residue on my shirts. My second stick (I still liked it enough to re-order) is just the opposite, and is a little too \\&quot;meltable.\\&quot; Beyond that, I love the product after using it for a month, and will keep using it for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> This product is a great, all-natural deodorant.  The main reason why I switched to this product was that it did not contain any compounds with aluminum or any harsh chemicals.  I first switched from antiperspirant/deodorant products like Old Spice and Speed Stick to the Thai crystal deodorant stone.  The Thai crystal deodorant stone worked well, but it was irritating to my skin at times.  And, as it turned out, the Thai crystal deodorant stones are comprised of aluminum salts, so after learning that I started to search again for a deodorant without any aluminum compounds.  I never heard of Jungleman deodorant before, but the more I learned about it the more I thought it was worth giving a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a few sticks of the Jungleman deodorant because it made the shipping cost a little more reasonable.  The product arrived quickly, and the sticks of deodorant were packaged in with a couple of cold packs in order to help keep the deodorant solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of the product probably should be changed so that it is not gender-specific.  There are no ingredients in the product that are meant only for men.  The dispenser is all-white and very generic-looking, so rebranding the product with a new look and new name would be worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first dispenser/tube of the product I had used only lasted me a little less than a month.  In comparison, the Old Spice and Speed Stick products lasted me at least a couple of months, and the Thai crystal deodorant stone lasted me over half a year.  When I was near the end of the Jungleman dispenser/tube, the insert the deodorant gets pushed up on fell out, so I probably missed out on one or two more uses of the product.  A slightly larger dispenser with a deodorant shelf that does not fall out would be a big improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on fairly easily.  If you have underarm hair, a very small amount of hair may get pulled out, but this was not all that different of an experience compared tousing the Old Spice and Speed Stick products.  I thoroughly put on the product just to make sure my underarm areas are fully covered.  Your underarms may look like a big mess after you put on the deodorant, but the deodorant blends in well.  If necessary, you can help blend the deodorant into your underarms with your hand or a tissue.  It does take me a little longer to clean my underarms in the shower because of the oils used in the product.  You also want to make sure your underarms are fully clean and odor-free before putting on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as deodorants go, this product does a good job at preventing odor.  I had better results with the Thai crystal deodorant stone, but again that contained aluminum.  After switching from the Thai crystal deodorant stone to Jungleman, I noticed the red, irritation lines on my underarms slowly disappeared, and I have not noticed any underarm irritation while using Jungleman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an all-natural deodorant without aluminum, this is a great one to try.</li>
            <li> One word...Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried about 10 different natural/organic deodorants and none of them stopped me from smelling.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer smell and feel great about using this deodorant on my body!</li>
            <li> First let me say that most deodorants irritate my skin.  This one did not, but the product was too sticky and chalky for me.  The feeling of it on was uncomfortable.  For me personally, I do not like this product.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deodorant that works! I was ready to give up on natural deodorants; I tried so many and none of them gave me the protection I needed. I will admit that the baking soda in this caused me some slight irritation when I first started using it, but after a few days my skin adjusted to it, and now I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. No more stink or shirt stains, and it keeps me dry all day, even in a hot and humid climate. I absolutely recommend this.</li>
            <li> So, I wanted a natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it..  Something about putting metal in your pores to stop you from sweating doesn&#x27;t sound right.  Especially since your anatomy says you should sweat there.  I first tried this Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant but something in it caused my arm pits to itch real bad.  I am allergic to a lot of plants which that deodorant had a bunch of plant oils in it.  So I am trying this guy out.  First of all, it is really unscented!  I put it on and it had no perfume smell to it.  Then today I ended up mowing the lawn and doing yard work, which I sweat a tons from doing all of that.  After the job was done, I only smelled slightly bad.  I have tried a few other natural deodorants and it seemed like they didn&#x27;t do a good job covering up the sweat smell.  I have only used this for one day but I am happy.  I did read reviews of other people who said it worked great for a couple of days and then they formed a horrible rash.  I will update this post later this week if this occurs.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t because this is one of the best natural deodorants I have tried!  I am a man, but I imagine, because it is unscented and has no musky smell, women would be fine with trying this as well.  Update 7/15/2015:  No horrible rash.  I still think this is great product.  It actually lasts even after being outside for hours. Just as good as regular deodorant.  Highly recommend, upgrading this to a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> Wow! I never thought it would be SO effective. There is NO smell at all!</li>
            <li> This product is good because it&#x27;s all natural but it gave me itching and it&#x27;s not as pleasant to apply as any other deodorants as well because of its dry texture.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It actually works, smells great and is all natural. I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Very few ingredients - check&lt;br /&gt;Actually works - check&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is it occasionally gets on my shirts as I&#x27;m putting them on.</li>
            <li> Hi there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good deodorant, effective but I am not a man that perspire a lot. A bit of a smaller stick than anticipated and a bit harder to apply than anticipated too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall satisfied of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Not sure if what I received maybe old or what.  However this goes on very, very dry.  It is a very hard dense deodorant that does not apply very well.  Not able to use because of the hard solid very dry texture.  Definitely would not buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> Have never liked the price on this; always wanted it to be $4.99 w/ free shipping and would accept $5.99 w/ free shipping, but it&#x27;s always close to $10 which gives me stomach cramps every time I order it, but obviously really like it since I keep coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price aside, it really is a fantastic deodorant that is the combination of all the natural deodorant ingredients you have probably read about independently; does exactly what you want, no odor and last all day long.</li>
            <li> I used it for three days and began to develop serious pimples in my armpits. They hurt and promised to get worse. I threw the product in the trash can.</li>
            <li> He can not use peoducts with certain ingredients such as aluminum in them.  This works well.  Will order again soon.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant that works rather than just masking odor with a scent, perfume, and other chemicals. I didn&#x27;t experience any allergic reactions that some other reviewers experienced (perhaps high ph, or tea tree oil reaction). Everybody is different, and there will be that small percentage that have those allergic reactions, so testing is crucial. Funny to say that I suffer from anosmia/hyposmia (inability/reduced ability to smell/ detect odor), so how do I know this works? My lovely wife is my test subject! I sweat like crazy (drenched!) when hiking, jogging, working out etc, and after such I&#x27;ve asked my wife to smell my underarms (that&#x27;s love right there...lol) and she says that it works. Even to the point that I&#x27;ve gone without a shower til the next day and my underarms remain just about odor free. *AGAIN EVERYONE&#x27;S DIFFERENT* as some people sweat more/less that others, harbor more/less bacteria in their underarms etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering and drying myself with a towel, I soak a cotton pad with 90% isopropyl alcohol and wipe both of my underarms to kill most bacteria left. I let the alcohol dry/ evaporate. Then I&#x27;ll apply this all natural deodorant to my underarms and this keeps me fresh for long periods of time, without having to reapply often (long hikes, etc) or worrying about that odor when sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review is helpful to everyone who reads this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a lie - I love this stuff.  At the age of 58 I started having yellow underarm stains on my white shirts and my usual antiperspirants became ineffective.  From doing some research the yellowing is secondary to some chemical ingredients just about every product has, that is except for &amp;#34;Jungleman&amp;#34;.  The only downside  was the cost and shipping cost.  But as the description says it is shipped in a very protective packaging with a package of &amp;#34;Ice coolant&amp;#34; to help ensure that the contents don&#x27;t liquefy in extreme heat.  It is also my first &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; but is not sticky and you can&#x27;t tell after a few minutes of application.  It made yellow stains a thing of the past, perspiration memories of the past even in the Florida heat.  Great stuff - does everything it says.  Now if only I could buy it locally.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this deodorant (and so do I)!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviews stated, it&#x27;s not a fancy package and it might be a little harder to put on compared to other brands, but it works! My husband put it on the first morning, worked outside in 106 degree weather, and by the next morning before showering (we waited that long to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; the product), he still didn&#x27;t smell! Even better, he didn&#x27;t break out in any rash like he has to so many other brands (both organic and not). Thanks, Jungleman!</li>
            <li> Yes, much to my disbelief, this stuff REALLY works!  I was getting desperate, I was about to ask my primary care Physician to prescribe something because NO deodorant/antiperspirant worked for me.  I have been trying different products now for more than 2 years.  I tried all the ones available at CVS and Walgreens.  All of them, gel, solid, clinical strength, sports, all day ones, womens, mens, natural, not natural, scented and unscented....an NOT ONE worked.  Sometimes I&#x27;d think something was working, and by the end of the day, not so much.  And my problem isn&#x27;t sweat or stains on shirts.....I just get smelly.  I&#x27;d constantly check to see if I smelled, and yes I did.  I was so paranoid and hated that I couldn&#x27;t find anything that really worked.  Then come in Jungleman and I have truly been odor free for 2 weeks now.  I love that it&#x27;s natural and I do not smell...AT ALL.  At the beginning my skin became red and little irritated so I&#x27;m thinking I might try the mint, but honestly, after two weeks, my skin isn&#x27;t red anymore, and I think I&#x27;ve adjusted. If I had to mention one thing is that I wish it would glide on easier.  It&#x27;s not chalky but it&#x27;s a bit dry.  But other than that, I LOVE this stuff.  I did not think this would work, but I&#x27;m a believer now and will use it faithfully!  No more checking for stinky armpits!!</li>
            <li> I will be using this product until I make my own! It works great I have no complaints about the deodorant.</li>
            <li> Holy moly - this deodorant is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;m not a tree hugger or natural whatever sort of person.  For years I&#x27;ve used commercial deodorants and antiperspirants, and for the last five plus have used Michum unscented, and the last two or so Michum unscented clinical.  They worked very well.  The scent always bothered me, so I liked the unscented and I never sweated or smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter my better half.  Let&#x27;s just say I was pursuaded to use a more natural product.  So I did some reading, wow, those commercial products, especially antiperspirants, and especially the clinical versions (more aluminum) are terrible for you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I picked this up from Amazon.  There are four ingredients - baking soda, corn starch, palm oil (sustainably harvested), and tea tree oil.  It looks like a white solid.  I does get harder (pretty hard) when cold like it is now in my bathroom, and gets a bit softer when warm, and will melt if hot (leave it in your car).  It works well for me, I just take it in the plane with me if I travel so it won&#x27;t melt.  The baking soda aborbs your oder, the corn starch absorbs some sweat, the tea tree oil is anti bacterial, and the palm oil is a safe carrier to mix it all together.  It really has no smell, especially when applied.  It does put on a white residue, but it disappears throughout the day.  I do sweat a bit, nothing major, but there is absolutely no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;detoxed&amp;#34; a bit from it, about a month or two after switching from the bad stuff, that lasted about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get my local grocery store to carry it for a while, not sure if they will continue (I was the only buyer).  If not, I&#x27;ll be buying it here or direct, the shipping makes it a bit expensive, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far out of 3 it seems to stay on longer but of course it&#x27;s not as efficient as those other toxic deodorants.</li>
            <li> Tried other all natural deodorants and was consistently disappointed. I sweat a lot and would often have to reapply them during the day to deal with odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Jungle Man based on the reviews here and wasn&#x27;t expecting much since I never heard of it before. I&#x27;m simply amazed on how well it works. I apply once in the morning and it works all day. It works better than any deodorant or antiperspirant that I&#x27;ve ever used. Even better is that it all natural and no aluminum or other garbage is in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write product reviews that often, but I had to say something about Jungleman Deodorant.  I&#x27;m an active guy; I do some kind of workout everyday.  Yesterday, after I finished lifting weights, I had absolutely no BO!  Today, after running 10 miles, again no arm pit odor at all!  Amazing!!  I use almost exclusively natural products on my skin and have gone several years without using any kind of deodorant (Of course, I shower twice a day and have very good hygiene.) Though sometimes at work (on those stressful days), it can get embarrassing. I started looking for a natural deodorant and found Jungleman on Amazon.  Lucky me. :) This all-natural deodorant really works by inhibiting bacterial growth...of course it&#x27;s the bacteria that cause odor not our sweat.  I plan on buying more for myself and friends.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I know that different deodorant works differently for everyone, but I wanted to share my experiences with it. First off, the package was sent very quickly and was shipped with product care in mind. There was a cold pack taped to the outside of the deodorant to prevent any kind of melting - I didn&#x27;t even specifically ask for them to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have tried &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; deodorants before, with unscented usually meaning a very mild soap or clean smell. This deodorant truly is unscented. It smells like absolutely nothing. It is not quite as easy to put on as some of the other deodorants out there; it takes a couple more swipes on the armpits to get it sufficiently covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the real test. I woke up on a Friday morning, took a shower, and applied the deodorant. I then went to do some yard work and other house work. I took a nap Friday afternoon, woke up, and went to work Friday night. I got off on Saturday morning expecting to go take a shower, but we ended up going straight to the Ohio State Fair. I walked around the fair all day and got home Saturday evening. The result: I didn&#x27;t stink one bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife had a very similar experience. In fact, my wife has never found a deodorant that could prevent her from smelling. The clinical strength deodorants at the store that contain aluminum can&#x27;t even work for her all day. But somehow, the Jungleman help up. It has literally changed my wife&#x27;s life; she doesn&#x27;t have to walk around worrying that people can smell her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying that you will have a similar result with this deodorant. What I am saying is if you are looking around for a natural deodorant and you don&#x27;t know which one will work, definitely buy some of this and try it out. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible reaction to the oils in here, but it may work for other people! I recommend Terrasentials, that is the only deodorant that I don&#x27;t have a reaction to.</li>
            <li> On its own, it gets you through most of the day.  However, combine it with Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant and you have an effective combo that gets you through the next day.</li>
            <li> I have finally found something that works! It doesn&#x27;t mask it. It arrived fast and survived the FL summer sun because it was packed w/an ice packet. Pretty nice! It was just a little soft but after a day indoors, it is solid again. After a week of using it, I did feel it burning. I think it was that I did not wash it off at the end of the day and the next day, I added another layer. That same day, after I showered, I applied some vitamin E oil under my arms and was fine the next day. I don&#x27;t mind sweating. I just do not want the smell and this WORKS! I&#x27;ve had my underarms hair removed via laser a few years back, so I don&#x27;t shave. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s important to anyone. And I do notice that if I don&#x27;t shower at night, I make sure to shower or wash it off in the AM before putting it on again.</li>
            <li> 7.99?!? This deodorant is great and I&#x27;ve been buying for over a year now but it was 5.99 not too long ago. Not good.</li>
            <li> So I tried this and it does indeed not smell. I am not quite sure what it helps with yet but I will update once I wear this a few times.</li>
            <li> Very thick, and at times caused my underarms to chafe. I like a little scent in my deoderant as well, so I don&#x27;t see myself buying this again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant kicks serious ass. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll change deodorants now. If I can&#x27;t use this. I won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I used this deodorant for 3 months. It is hard to apply compared to normal deodorants. I got used to this and left my pits a little wet or moistened the deodorant a little with water. It takes more work but I got used to it. The biggest problem with the product is the staining of my T-shirts. I would put the shirt on after the application and mystery stains would show up on the left and right side near my stomach. The shirt was touching my pits when I would pull the shirt over my head. Most of my T-shirts are colored so this caused a big problem. I then started applying the product after I put on the T-shirt. The staining still continued in different areas. Stain remover would have to be used 1-2 times before laundering. I am 6&#x27; and 170 pounds and do not sweat that much. I now wash my pits really well with bar soap and just apply a little (1-2 light swipes) of my old style deodorant. This works well and does not smell much. I threw the Jungleman stuff in the garbage. I say go ahead and try it if you think you can avoid the staining problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, and had just about given up on deodorant. Everything I&#x27;ve ever tried has wound up irritating my skin, even natural products like Tom&#x27;s. This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that I can consistently use every day without irritation -- and, unlike some other products, it actually seems to work. Well done!</li>
            <li> The only natural deodorant I know of that actually works.  I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s, Arm and Hammer, and Burt&#x27;s Bees, but none of those are effective on my stinky pits.  This one does the trick, works well.  Thanks Jungleman!</li>
            <li> This is totally amazing!!  I have never before found a natural deodorant that actually prevents me from smelling for at least a full day.  I like this one and the mint one equally - they both work extremely well.  It does have an odd consistency and has to be rubbed in rather than just applied, but it&#x27;s worth it for how well it works!</li>
            <li> I have been trying four different natural deodorants wanting to eliminate aluminum and other chemicals.  I was amazed how well Jungleman worked.  I started out after my shower in the morning and worked all day ...followed by my physical workout when I got home.  I had some perspiration (particularly when I was working out) but throughout the day I was odor free.  Amazing!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles. I tend to wear cologne and after deciding I wanted to try and limit the other chemicals I&#x27;m putting in/on my body (going organic, ingesting more greens and superfoods) I tried to find a good alternate, non-scented solution.&lt;br /&gt;This is it.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this are so simple and basic it&#x27;s almost laughable, but it&#x27;s amazing in it&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;Baking soda, tea tree oil, corn starch, and palm oil.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to being an antiperspirant (which very few organic deodorants can claim), this stuff can even keep you fresh for a full 24+ hours provided you&#x27;re not overly sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can bother to think of registering as a complaint is that in slightly colder temperatures, I find it rather difficult to slide this on under my armpits. But if you happen to shave under that area, I doubt this will be much of a bother anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely the simplest, most effective anti-persperant I&#x27;ve come across yet, can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> That constant searching for a natural deodorant that works is over. Here it is. It doesn&#x27;t just work a little better; it works a lot better. I&#x27;m so happy ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very little luck over the years trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works.  This deodorant not only works with only a few swipes, it&#x27;s truly natural!  No hidden triclosan or other anti-bacterial synthetic products.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many natural deodorants trying to find one without sketchy ingredients that gets the job done. So far, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of only two natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried (out of *at least* a dozen) that keeps body odor at bay for the whole day. [The other is Miessence roll-on, in case you&#x27;re wondering, but it never really dries completely on me, so I had damp underarms all day. It also caused scaling and irritation with prolonged use.]&lt;br /&gt;I experienced no irritation or rash with this product, and that&#x27;s been an issue with several other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t know if I have particularly sensitive underarms, but if you&#x27;ve had that problem, I recommend giving this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;No strong scent, so it&#x27;s definitely unisex.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve paid two or three times as much for natural deodorants that didn&#x27;t work half as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives I&#x27;d cite are:&lt;br /&gt;1. it definitely does not go on smoothly; It&#x27;s a very dry paste in stick form, so you have to work a little to apply, and it will clump a bit&lt;br /&gt;2. it&#x27;s by no means &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; when first applied; You&#x27;ll need to be careful putting on your shirt and check for deodorant streaks&lt;br /&gt;However, I consider those a small price to pay for a natural deodorant that works and doesn&#x27;t cause a rash.</li>
            <li> I normally get rashes from regular deodorant depending on the brand. I was very skeptical about using a natural deodorant based on reviews that I had read and friends who have tried other brands of natural deodorant. I normally work 12-15 hour days, I thought that I would start to smell after a few hours at work. Have been using it for a few days now and no complaints at all I don&#x27;t stink and my under arms don&#x27;t burn!</li>
            <li> This is the great deodorant I&#x27;ve ever had! My quality of life improved exponentially after acquiring this deodorant! :) :)</li>
            <li> This product is effective for odor control BUT the abrasive properties of the baking soda make it unsuitable.....I can not use it long term, I tried really hard but my arm pits are &amp;#34;highly&amp;#34; irritated.</li>
            <li> My new favorite deodorant. At first I didn&#x27;t think I would like the &amp;#34;no sent&amp;#34;. I was always used to scented deodorants, but this stuff is great. There is literally no drop off from traditional deodorants, and may even be better than most for oder protection and dryness. It keeps &amp;#34;pit stains&amp;#34; off your dress shirts and can survive a trip to the gym after a full day of work. Love it.</li>
            <li> IT is a good product, but not all that it is cracked up to be...&lt;br /&gt;Does not apply good underneath the arms..</li>
            <li> Not much to say here... I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly a year and it works great.  Leaves a little white residue when applied. Keeps you from smelling, works all day.</li>
            <li> For anyone looking for an alternative to the aluminum-heavy deodorants available at drug stores, this is the answer. It goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t streak on clothing, and keeps you smelling clean long after it&#x27;s application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try not to overuse the product by applying too much pressure, but otherwise, this is product that stands above its competition.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sweat like a monster while at work in 90 degree heat and high humidity. After using Degree antiperspirant for a while, I decided to find something more natural to avoid the aluminum and other chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon using this the first time, with a small bit of cologne under each arm to go with it, I noticed that after a full day of work, NO SMELL WHATSOEVER. Of course I did sweat, but not even that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance of this product actually exceeded Degree Antiperspirant, and has no chemicals whatosever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Made me break out under my arms BIG TIME. Tossed out.</li>
            <li> I have tried many &amp;#34;All Natural&amp;#34; products and all of them left me with a nasty rash in my pits the next day. This one did NOT. Additionally, what impressed me was how it was scent free, but still left me odor free. And I&#x27;m in Public Safety in Arizona and I used it in the middle of June at work! I even told the guys I was trying a new deodorant and to help me evaluate it by letting me know if it was failing, and believe me, they would lol! My only criticism is that it is more &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; than other deodorants, so it pulls your pit hair upon application which makes it a little uncomfortable to apply. Additionally, it is a smaller size, and seems to go fast - so it is definitely not the most economical option out there - thus the 4 stars instead of 5. But the ingredients and effectiveness are so far the best I have seen. Outstanding product that really works.</li>
            <li> Contains cornstarch, probably a gmo since no no GMO label on it.</li>
            <li> Works on smell but I wish it was more smoothly.  I feel  like is sanding  off my skin when I apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started slowly switching all my products to all natural products about a year ago.  I was skeptical to switch my deodorant though because I sweat sooo much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m talking....walk outside and instant butt crack sweat...okay i&#x27;m exaggerating but seriously I sweat pretty easily, so I was afraid to get rid of my nasty chemically powerful deodorant.  But I decided to give it a try since the price was good and what did I have to lose really and man I am not sorry one bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No its not a miracle product that stopped all my sweat but it does the job JUST as well as my old deodorant.  I still have to apply it twice a day probably for the best protection but I was doing that already.  (who doesn&#x27;t stink towards the middle/ early evening anyways? I certainly do!)  And I don&#x27;t mind that its not scented it may not be for everyone but I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;re looking for something that is better than you&#x27;re current deodorant in my opinion it&#x27;s probably not. BUT it works just as well AND its all natural which is the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for Tom&#x27;s of Maine (which I&#x27;d used for years but started to irritate my skin) and I love it. It is a little different from other deodorants you might be used to--it&#x27;s harder and needs to warm up a little before it spreads easily, but literally all that means is you stick it on your pits, pause for a second, and then sweep like usual. It does also feel a little grainy from the baking soda, but I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work too, my boyfriend always asks if I forgot deodorant on the days that I did indeed forget deodorant...</li>
            <li> I didnt work at all, for me, after a few hours of hard work, you feel and smell that isn&#x27;t working, your shirt became wet, and you don&#x27;t feel fine with it., I want to find a natural deodorant that work for me.</li>
            <li> Extremely skeptical, and had low expectations before buying.  Jungleman, you have made me a believer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tested out all sorts of deodorants throughout the years.  From Old Spice, to Gillette, to Dove deodorants.  Even to the Axe body sprays.  The problem with the deodorants that I have used in the past is the strong &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; smell that comes with them.  I usually try to buy deodorants with very minimal light scents, but you can still start to smell it once you sweat.  I am not really a heavy sweater, but sometimes when you start pacing in the office, you get some beads of sweat running down the sides of you body.  I &amp;#34;though&amp;#34; that I didn&#x27;t smell, but I started to notice that people would rub their noses when I entered the room.  I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to that, but while I was target shopping this one time, I was running in the store because I was behind on time.  I finally got to the register, and the guy started rubbing his nose, and the customer behind me also started rubbing her nose, and the customer in front of me move towards the other end.  I was like... &amp;#34;OMG, maybe I do smell!&amp;#34;  That was the straw that broke the camels back so to speak.  I still don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s my BO, but a mixture of deodorant with BO that kills it.  Plus I don&#x27;t think anyone wants to smell strong deodorant coming from another person&#x27;s armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up finding Jungleman on Amazon with great reviews, and thought that I would give it a try.  Great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Unscented Jungleman Deodorant stick.  Half way through the work day, I went to the bathroom to give myself a scent test, and to my surprise NOTHING!  I actually didn&#x27;t smell anything at all.  Only a little bit of the body wash from the morning, and that smelled good (I think).  Then I also went to the gym after work, I did not have to put on any extra Jungleman.  I know it&#x27;s gross, but there was also no smell after my workout!  Amazing.  This productreally works great!  I don&#x27;t know about the side affects to my armpits, or any long term problems, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great deodorant stick.  It&#x27;s a little pricey with shipment charges tacked onto each stick, but I think it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for about a week, and I also noticed that people are no longer &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; their noses when I am talking to them.  Let me make my return trip to Target, do my test run, look for the same cash register attendant, have him ring me up, see if he rubs his nose in disgust, and then I can raise my arms up in celebration for no longer smelling like onions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Jungleman!</li>
            <li> Liked it a lot in the beginning, but it flakes like crazy from the container and I get a little stinky around hour 7.</li>
            <li> Best there is.  Don&#x27;t go for those other so called natural deodorants - this is the real deal.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought all of the good reviews here on Amazon were fake -- and I bought the product anyway. I have an allergic reaction to practically every deodorant, and I&#x27;ve never used a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; one that did anything other than cost a fortune. This one not only doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it works beautifully. I&#x27;d go so far as to say it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My criticisms: the name is tragic, as is the ugly packaging. I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking calling something Jungleman, especially something they claim is unisex. Also, like another reviewer said, processing time is ridiculously slow, especially since practically all online retailers are lightning fast. But if effectiveness is your only criteria, this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> this deodorant is INCREDIBLE!  i was using a popular deodorant that was leaving a slippery film on my shower pouf every time i took a shower.  i didn&#x27;t think that was natural so i went on the hunt for a natural and healthier product to use.  and, the product had to work.  after searching, i purchased Jungleman and tried it out for myself.  it works!  i haven&#x27;t had any odor problem since i&#x27;ve started using the deodorant and no film!  buy this product!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the best deodorant I have ever used, natural and conventional included. It comes as a white solid, but you may have to use your fingers to spread the product evenly after application since you might still see little bits of product. But after you rub it in, it becomes clear. The effects last at least a few hours depending on where you live. I live in AZ so I have to apply at least one more time during the day, since I get a little stinky, but it&#x27;s generally unnoticeable unless you put your nose in there. The BEST part about this product is when I reapply, I don&#x27;t have to wash my pits beforehand. I can just apply as is and the B.O. disappears!!!! No mixed in deodorant smell or anything! The deodorant itself doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell. It has a teeny tea tree oil scent, but it won&#x27;t interfere with perfumes or colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant, you should really try this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you live in a hot area like I do, make sure to let the seller know in a note for your order. The first time I ordered this, my product melted and leaked all over the package. Also when you choose your address to ship it to, try to ship it to a place where it won&#x27;t be stuck in the heat for a long time, such as your work place. If you don&#x27;t have a work place, keep your eye on the tracking so you can try to pick it up when the mail person comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your product melted, here&#x27;s the info the seller told me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;If the deodorant is still semi-solid, (only partly melted or butter-like), you can simply stick it in the freezer.  After about 30 minutes in the freezer, and a little bit of thaw time (it won&#x27;t twist or rub on well until thawed properly- usually at a temp above 60 degrees) it should be good as new.  If it&#x27;s completely melted (runny liquid throughout), you can do the same thing, however, you&#x27;ll need to stir it with some kind of stirring implement so that the ingredients inside don&#x27;t separate prior to freezing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 8/19/12: Unfortunately, the product doesn&#x27;t work with my body anymore. My B.O. becomes even worse than before and so I&#x27;ve stopped using it. I&#x27;ve changed my rating from a 3 to a 5 because I still think it&#x27;s a good product if you live in a place where you don&#x27;t sweat much. But for me in AZ, it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product! I will never use another deodorant again! Recommended to everyone. I wish they sold this product in more stores.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  Really wanted a deodorant after decades of using products with aluminum.  Probably too late to overcome brain damage now, but couldn&#x27;t hurt, huh?&lt;br /&gt;Product works great, eliminates any body odor, and also appears to lessen perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if the product comes in larger quantities, but that would be a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to get used to the solid (stick) deodorant - of Jungleman, versus the roll-on liquid deodorant I&#x27;ve always used.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, great product, and I had a good experience with the Jungleman customer service representative.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more!</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than expected to receive the deodorant. However, when they got delivered and i tried it out all i can say is IT&#x27;S AMAZING! It has no smell and works very well. I stay odourless all day, i will definitely buy more soon.</li>
            <li> This turned my armpits a frightening shade of red (almost purple red) and made the texture of my skin feel rough and itchy by the second day of use. I didn&#x27;t have this problem before using this and it cleared up about a week after discontinuing use. I sent a question to the company/seller to ask what ingredient might have caused this reaction, so I could avoid it in the future, but got no reply.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub on well- very thick... but keeps the scent away...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over four years, maybe five now, heck I was probably one of their first customers.  I wanted a deodorant that was free of aluminum and any other chemical I couldn&#x27;t pronounce and also worked to control odor.  I looked into making my own deodorant, and would have probably tried that, but then I stumbled across Jungleman and was pleased to see this had the same ingredients as I would have used to make my own except I didn&#x27;t have to go to the trouble.  I ordered it and found it to be extremely simple and effective for me and the rest is history.  There was a period of time a couple years ago when the product was not available (I think the owners were reevaluating their business or something).  I had used up my last stick and needed to reorder but couldn&#x27;t find it.  So at that time I tried several other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; deodorants from the health food store or online and I hated them all.  None of them ever came close to the odor control power of Jungleman.  After a couple months of using these terrible deodorants I again decided I was just going to have to try to make my own.  I tried one last search for Jungleman at the time and there it was, back on the market!  I ordered like 5 sticks at once and thanked the owners profusely for bringing it back.  They had changed their formula slightly (I could tell it was more oil and less dry) but it still worked great for me so I continue to be an avid supporter.  I am now ready to reorder once again and am happy to find Jungleman easily available on Amazon and I see they have more varieties available as well.  I hope they have not changed their original formula again as I loved it just the way it was!  If necessary I will post an update when my new stick arrives.  I love that you CAN be all natural and odor free at the same time!</li>
            <li> This is the best non scent deodorant that I have ever used.  Every other non scent deodorant doesn&#x27;t hold up by the end of the day.  This does!  It&#x27;s great for hunters too.  Try it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant feels and looks like you are smearing lard on your armpits.  This is not an \\&quot;invisible solid\\&quot;  and it makes your armpits feel sticky and uncomfortable.  I would not recommend this product, unless you HAVE to have something that is natural.</li>
            <li> Stuff works great as for keeping you dry and smell free,&lt;br /&gt;unfortunatly my skin isnt liking it. after 2 uses i ended up with some pretty bad skin irriation. if you got tough skin this is what you want for a free and clear product. if you got sensitive skin then i would avoid</li>
            <li> I ordered the deodorant on Thursday, Dec. 13th and received it on Tuesday, Dec. 18th.  That is about standard for my other Amazon purchases. Perhaps they are working on bettering their shipping procedures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I have been using the product for a week now and am 100% impressed!  No rash like with Tom&#x27;s and no odor.  It goes on pretty smooth for me, I just make sure to swipe UP so I don&#x27;t go against the &#x27;grain&#x27; and pull underarm hairs out.  I still have to test this at work (I have been on vacation for the holidays) but I think I have finally found the answer to my long search for a quality natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> Having tried just about everything else out there; from budget priced deodorants, &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants, to the more expensive department store brands (Menscience costs $17 a pop!), I did not have high expectations for Jungleman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I proven wrong! Believe the hype in all the reviews here, this stuff WORKS! Someone finally got it right. Gone are the days where my deodorant would fail halfway through an average day. Gone are also the days of deodorant stained undershirts! This deodorant lasts a while too. I&#x27;m still working through the first stick I purchased back in August! I immediately ordered 2 more after my first purchase to have as a back-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have found that the product goes on easier with damp underarms after a shower. There seems to be more residue when applying to dry underarms that then has to be rubbed in. Small price to pay for an otherwise AMAZING product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS DEODORANT! You&#x27;ll be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Jungleman!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to write this review, because I appreciate the company&#x27;s willingness to create a simple, aluminum-free &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that doesnt smell like an industrial cleaner (Kiss My Face - I am looking at you ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this deoodrant has one MAJOR annoying flaw, which prevents me from buying it again any time soon. It feels like you are rubbing a candle on your skin when you apply it. It is extremely dry and actually hurts sometimes to put it on. I have tried a couple remedies (pouring water on it, rubbing a thin layer of lotion of my skin first, etc) to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also far too expensive for a deodorant with an ingredient list made of such simple, household items. $10 total including shipping for a deodorant that is already on the small size (2.5 oz) compared to drugstore/supermarket deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did remove my body odor though.</li>
            <li> I love this natural deodorant. First of all, it actually works! It has a beautiful lime scent that works and blends in brilliantly with one&#x27;s natural body odor. However, the application of the product leaves a bit to be desired, as it is drying and rough to roll on. It ends up tugging and pulling armpit hair. I wish it were able to glide more smoothly, like a gel (a la Old Spice gel) or like Tom&#x27;s unscented deodorant which applies flawlessly. This deodorant, however, works the best and uses simple, proven, and effective ingredients. I just hope they could add an ingredient to help make the application of the product smoother and easier! It would make me more likely to repurchase the item if they did...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine. I&#x27;ve tried Weleda Rose Deodorant(which smells great at first but I had to carry a small bottle of it in my purse to reapply through out the day). I&#x27;ve Thai Crystal Spray, and had to reapply it through out the day as well. Not the Jungleman! Been wearing it a week with no need to reapply except, I put a little extra on before a workout \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; . It&#x27;s awesome and unless it stops working for me or they stop making it, I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time. Great natural deodorant, happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> Jungleman All Natural Deodorant is BEST deodorant I&#x27;ve EVER used, hands down. Having eschewed anti-perspirants 20+ yrs ago, I&#x27;ve traversed the damp and often smelly path of &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants with little success until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having gotten used to what it feels like to when one&#x27;s armpits sweat naturally, wetness hasn&#x27;t been the issue but odor has. My experience with other &#x27;natural&#x27; ones (various formulas of Tom&#x27;s, Jason, Origins, Kiss My Face, Crystal, etc., even straight coconut oil), is that they either only worked for short durations or  not at all, or were mere &#x27;cover&#x27; for odor--even if I washed my pits at some point during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Jungleman for four days (I know, not exactly a longterm eval), but the difference is remarkable. No smell! Zero. It goes on dry, I rub it in a little, and there&#x27;s no smell. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had to do a special &#x27;pit wash&#x27; midday, nor have I had to launder still-clean shirts that I&#x27;ve only worn for a couple hours because the pits are smelly. I&#x27;m totally sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having not found Jungleman in any store near me, I&#x27;ll still have to get it by mail, and that stinks (haha) because its company needs a shipping system overhaul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, IMHO, it should never take more than a couple days to get a product into the mail. Period. (Not the actual shipping time via USPS or whomever, I&#x27;m talking about the time after a seller receives the order--and payment--from Amazon and how long it takes them to get it INTO the mail.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, while I&#x27;d seen other reviews that mentioned that the product could melt in transit, shipping it w/an ice pack enclosed does not seem optimum, especially when the company only uses the (slower) USPS \\&quot;First Class\\&quot; as opposed to \\&quot;Priority\\&quot; or \\&quot;Overnight\\&quot; services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, if I&#x27;m paying an extra Hamilton for shipping, I&#x27;d rather have the carrier *service* be premium, not pay for the weight of a gel ice pack!--particularly when the USPS just puts in into the blazing hot mailbox anyway (in the middle of a Florida summer)--despite the warning label on the outside. (The other two major carriers leave packages near doorways as opposed to in mailboxes, fwiw.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to ship in a manner that accommodates buyers from ALL climates at any time of year??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, done with the rant. Love the product. Will just have to find a better way to get more of it down here in the subtropics, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit Sept. 23 2012: A month later...Jungleman still obliterating odor daily.

            <li> Edit:  Like at least one other reviewer has experienced, it seems this product no longer works as well for me as it did before.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had to downgrade my rating.  I am sure it may work perfectly for others, as it is an amazon bestselling deodorant and my situation is pretty uncommon.  The product is definitely worth trying!  As for me, it&#x27;s back to plain old baking soda and water (paste) after my morning shower to keep me odor free all day, then witch hazel after my evening shower to work overnight to soothe any irritation that developed from the baking soda.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried a lot of products.  Ofcourse some of the unhealthy products for you work...but I have struggled to find a product that I felt was natural and would not harm my body.....and also actually worked.  That is the problem...I found many of the popular natural products DID not work (at least according to my wife).  Well...it has now been 2 months and my wife has NOT complained even once!  Now that is success!</li>
            <li> I picked this stuff because it only has a few ingredients in it and seems like it&#x27;s safer to use than traditional deoderant.  Usually these \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; products are a poor subsitiute for the average stuff you buy in the store, but this one actually works.  I only have to use it once every two days or so.  It doesn&#x27;t really have it&#x27;s own smell, it just seems to eliminate oder and that&#x27;s it.  The only bad thing was it was pretty warm when I ordered it so it melted and resolidified at some point into a weird shape.  I had to reheat it and let it form back into it&#x27;s intended shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be easier to just order and stock up when it&#x27;s cold out.</li>
            <li> So glad this is available. All of the over the counter products just don&#x27;t work for my boyfriend. I didn&#x27;t want to try the \\&quot;crystal\\&quot; as I was worried it would be too natural. I love this product and so does he. He doesn&#x27;t smell like a hung over sailor nor a 14 year old baseball player. Just great!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different deodorants over the years from Clarins to the Crystal Rock stuff. And I have got to say that this stuff REALLY WORKS!!  I was using regular &amp;#34;Sure&amp;#34; deodorant for years because NOTHING in the organic, paraben and aluminum free section worked. I was getting really grossed out by the crusty yellow pit stains on my white undershirts, so I decided to start looking for a new brand. This stuff is definitely different. I only has FOUR ingredients, and I can hardly believe that it works as good as it does. And for the price.... you should try this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Been looking for a good, natural deodorant without aluminum or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that its unscented, and since using it my shirts no longer have yellow stains.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I notice it is very pasty. When applying, the deodorant gets on the side of the container, so you have to be moving the deodorant container to get what is on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried it multiple times after shaving and it made her very itchy. Maybe, because her skin was irritated.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews, but in this case I had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really isn&#x27;t much to say. I work out 6 days a week, and sweat a lot. Jungleman is unscented, but it works better than even my old Right gaurd. I never have B.O. after my workouts, even after sweating like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of giant companies from 1000+ miles away from me dictating my only choices are 1. Their Chemicals &amp; Aluminum or 2. Their Chemicals or Aluminum. Plus most run-of-the-mega-mill products are horrible on your skin. That burn you&#x27;re feeling when you put on generic deodorant shouldn&#x27;t be there. I&#x27;ve tried the Trader Joes standard antiperspirant stick which kind of works, but Jungleman does wonders. The smell is soapy-pleasant and overall it&#x27;s one of the best &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; sticks I&#x27;ve been able to find without all the crazy-cancer-talk in the ingredients list. Definitely glad I found this baby.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is terrible!  Applying it feels like you are using sandpaper.  Plus, it &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; up into pieces after each application which makes it virtually impossible to use when you are applying it.  I bought three of them, I threw out two unused.  Anyone who says they like this deodorant is either half-gorilla or works for the company.  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all-natural deodorant. I was striking out with other products like Toms, which stopped working after about 3 hours. Jungleman works all day, and let&#x27;s just say that I am someone who really needs deodorant! I used to use Old Spice and Right Guard, and this stuff actually seems to work better!  It is odorless to my nose.  Great deodorant.</li>
            <li> I needed to leave a feedback on this product after using it for a week and after years of using AXE antiperspirants and various other aluminum based antiperspirants. First, I received both deodorants nicely packaged with a gel icebag to prevent them from melting. The very first day, I applied it after taking a shower and went out the whole night including dancing at a club, No smell and I didn&#x27;t sweat as much as I would have expected being the very first day of use. The next morning I woke up and my underarms did not have ANY smell at all. I was kinda skeptical, so I kept using it and by day 5 I had gotten rid of that problem of having to apply deodorant/antiperspirant right after showering because I would start smelling, or coming out the shower and still smelling dirty armpits.I Highly recommend this Product. It works even better than any other aluminum based antiperspirant. It has a very very faint smell of tree oil but fades away right after application. This stuff just works!</li>
            <li> The rundown:&lt;br /&gt;+ all natural&lt;br /&gt;+ effective (no funky smells!)&lt;br /&gt;+ Iong-lasting&lt;br /&gt;+ decent as an anti-perspiration, too&lt;br /&gt;+ no perfumes&lt;br /&gt;+ made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;- leaves white residue on clothing&lt;br /&gt;- melts in high heat&lt;br /&gt;- pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been burned by all-natural deodorants before, both homemade and store bought. Not literally burning, but let down after putting my faith in their odor-deflecting abilities, only to wind up smelling like funk after a short time. I apply Jungleman with that weariness every time, yet 5 months of daily use later, I must let my fears die and declare myself a believer. This deodorant stands up to heavy sweating from exercise and lasts all day—and then some. I apply it after a shower in the morning and still smell funk-free by night time. Jungleman achieves this without ingredients linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s, without irritating additives, and without synthetic fragrances. I actually wouldn&#x27;t mind a version in lavender or some other EO, but unscented works just fine. Keep in mind that this is a deodorant, *not* an anti-perspirant, and you should be happy, too, though it does do a decent job keeping my underarms dry during a regular sedentary day (I.e., no heavy exercising).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful when dressing after application; I often get white residue on my T-shirts, which is annoying, but can come out with water. I&#x27;d compare this to Oyin Handmade&#x27;s Funk Butter (which comes in various scents, though the consistency in thickness is lacking). Of course, after viewing the simple ingredients list, you may be inclined to make your own deodorant and save yourself some money. I want to support American companies that make healthy alternatives to conventional products, so I think I will keep buying Jungleman. Buying in bulk will help justify the shipping costs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the other natural deodorants only to be disappointed that they don&#x27;t work or to find that they really aren&#x27;t natural. If you&#x27;re reading this you&#x27;re obviously interested in removing all the poisonous toxins so prevalent in the majority of body products out there, yet looking for something that&#x27;s effective. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3 months and am especially pleased to be able to write a review to say that this is the real deal...natural and it works better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or otherwise. I&#x27;m a heavy sweater when I exercise and attend 4 yoga classes each week. Upon waking the following morning after having the deodorant on for 24 hrs or more, I NEVER have smelled any body odor. I even asked my wife to validate it just in case I was missing something. Now coincidently at around the same time I started using this deodorant, I started using a new shower soap named Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soap - 18 in 1 Hemp TEA TREE Pure Castile Soap with organic oils. I don&#x27;t think a lot of people would enjoy the fragrance of this soap, but the TEA TREE oil is especially effective at cleansing and killing bacteria just as Jungleman is with the TEA TREE oil it contains. Together it&#x27;s a powerful combination. I don&#x27;t find I have body odor at all anywhere on my body day to day using Jungleman and Dr. Bonner&#x27;s TEA TREE Soap. Just a coincidence I happened to buy around the same time. I also gave a Jungleman to my adult son out of state and he swears its the best he&#x27;s ever used. The only challenge is that it doesn&#x27;t go on as easily and quickly as most deodorants, sometimes pulling out hairs or whatever, but to find something that truly works, even after a long day mountain biking, etc. is amazing.</li>
            <li> I come from a family with a history of hyperhidrosis.  I sweat a lot, and I develop an odor quickly.  I have used several different types of antiperspirants over the years, but I do not like the idea of putting triclosan:    [...]    and    [...]    Aluminum chlorohydrate into contact with my skin over extended periods of time.    The ultimate test:    After I received the deodorant, I put it on before I went to bed to see if it would stop me from developing body odor during my sleep, because thats something that happens to me almost every time.  After wearing it overnight,  I spent a weekend transplanting Avocado trees in the Central Valley of California and during this time period I dug two 1m^3 holes in the earth with a shovel.  I sweat so much during this time period, 12 hours.that I probably went through at least a gallon of water.  And, yes the deodorant worked.  I didn&#x27;t develop body odor overnight or after/during my yard work.  And the best part is, it is odorless, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel slimy or make me feel a bit nauseous all the commercial deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.    I have to enthusiastically recommend this product to anyone who is health and hygiene conscious.</li>
            <li> AMAZING odor protection from this actually all-natural deodorant. It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found yet, though it is a bit stiff to put on; definitely pulls hairs, but I&#x27;ll deal with it. Thanks, deodorant maker, for providing a decent alternative to those chemical laden deodorizers of the masses.</li>
            <li> This deodorant doesnt irritate me, and it is effective against stinky armpit smells. The BEST thing I love about this deodorant is that it is VERY easy to rinse off in the shower compared to other brands that literally stick to your hair/skin.</li>
            <li> Ive been on the hunt for a good natural deodorant since my crystal roll ons stopped working. I have found it. This deodorant really works. Best in its class. I love that it has simple ingredients. The only problem is because it has baking soda it doesnt go on clear. But that is a small price to pay for smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and they packed an ice pack with it(live in AZ).  So I have been using for around a month and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I am concerned with some reviews that mention &amp;#34;it stops working&amp;#34; but that has not happened to me.  I am ordering another one and will continue to use it! Great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> Simple and work....NO Chemicals...NO Pain...NO Burn...For people who care for them body they need to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;I like to pay for the product like that not for fancy package...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day 3, so I will update this review if there are any changes. However, so far my arm pits stay dry for most of the day and at the end of the day do not smell like anything. I am a pretty sweaty guy and have used all sorts of deodorants to-date, including antiperspirants. Recently, I&#x27;ve been looking to use more natural products and that came with accepting the fact I will be a little more sweaty and a smelly. I usually alternate between a fragrant conventional brand of deodorant (not antiperspirant) for work and a natural one on the weekend. Then I tried this. I honestly was just testing this out, and didn&#x27;t expect much. The reviews were glowing, but it is all-natural so I expected to have a little funk around 5 PM. Nope. This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or not. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. all i noticed was that it made me sweat so much more, which i was disappointed about.</li>
            <li> Works good as a deodorant, although you will still sweat.  The product has mostly no smell, just a faint scent of sea salt.  Glides on easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary : It&#x27;s not anti-perspirant, you still sweat somewhat.  However, that sweat will not become smelly bacteria.  Somehow this deodorant kills the bacteria with natural salts.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months.</li>
            <li> It works great! You will still sweat because it is not an antipersperant but you will not smell bad. My wife is so happy that I found a deodorant that works. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is not effective. It is as hard as a rock and does not cover odor as I would expect.</li>
            <li> My son has an issue with deodorant. He either would break out in a rash or have like little bumps that were very painful. I am sure it is from the additives. This product really worked for him. I go by the reviews, for the most part they were positive, so I bought this for him. It was packaged well and came when it was supposed to.Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best that I have tried. I have tried Tom&#x27;s, Jason, Bert&#x27;s Bees, and other natural deodorants, but this is the best product for me. First day, applied (it&#x27;s a little sticky), went to work and waited to see what would happen. I ended up working in a very hot school portable moving books around and sweating  pretty good. I was a bit worried since I didn&#x27;t really want to test it to that extreme the first day! I had meetings scheduled later. After about 20 minutes of hard work in the portable went back to my office, and nothing! No smell, pit marks, NOTHING!! Simply amazing!!! Came home and worked out....nothing! Can&#x27;t believe it. Same results everyday so far!! We&#x27;ll see if it continues to impress, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Wanting to avoid aluminum in my deodorant, I&#x27;ve tried natural deodorants, only to discover that they don&#x27;t work.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine? Worthless for me.  Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant? Better than Tom&#x27;s of Maine but still not very effective.  I was going to return to aluminum-based deodorants for the summer when I discovered Jungleman on Amazon.  After reading the rave reviews, I ordered a stick...and I&#x27;ve been impressed.  A single application of Jungleman in the morning is sufficient to last throughout the day (with moderate sweating).  And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  The stick has just 4 ingredients: sodium bicarbonate, corn starch, palm oil, and tea tree oil.  As other reviewers have noted, this is an anti-deodorant, not an antiperspirant.  This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made from  basically nothing, so no adverse skin/health effects. They don&#x27;t sneak anything in like some natural deodorant makers do too, either.  Despite all this, it works perfectly. Goes on in the morning, and works for a good 10 hours or so. If that doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot to you, then you&#x27;re kinda missing the point of healthy products. The only way you&#x27;re gonna get deodorant that lets you put it on, and be smell-free for the next two days, is if you buy one with harsh chemicals. This one gets you through the day, feels good on your skin, and is absolutely all-natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I was surprised by is the smell. People said it has a slight citrus smell, though I find it just smells like baking soda (which makes sense since that&#x27;s the majority of what it&#x27;s made of).</li>
            <li> For me it works better than the toxic commercial deodorants and I love the fact that I&#x27;m not using those harmful products on my body. Love it.  Dr. CMC</li>
            <li> Fantastic all natural deodorant, I have tried most and this works the best!!! I have very sensitive skin and most deodorants give me a rash or don&#x27;t work well. This product works very well and gives me no irritation.</li>
            <li> As honest as it gets. for those with EXTREMELY sensitive skin, this doesn&#x27;t break me out (itching or burning) like all of the past deodorants have--even the so called  top &amp;#34;organic ones&amp;#34; loaded with fragrance and other clever unpronounceable ingredients leaving you smelling worse off than started with. Perfect pricing, and COMPLETELY worth it. NO SCENT AT ALL, nor do you need to apply a lot to cover scents (which seem to fade over time-EVEN WITH A TON OF HIGH PERSPIRING EXERCISES) HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WILL USE FROM HERE UNTIL DISCONTINUED!</li>
            <li> I wanted to find an unscented deodorant that isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant (I&#x27;m allergic to antiperspirant).  Something that actually WORKS, unlike many products sold on the store shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crystal stick (mineral salt) worked ok, but I needed to apply liberally to achieve effectiveness.  I&#x27;m talking 30 to 45 seconds of rubbing back and forth under each arm.  Not practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then switched to Earth Science Liken (lichen) deodorant, which works great, however it gave me a rash each time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jungleman deodorant is amazing.  It lasts forever, doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, and I don&#x27;t have to use half the stick in one application just to achieve decent results.  I go all day without a hint of BO, and the next day my underarms still smell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use anything else.  Customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{For those that are complaining that the Jungleman stick is too hard/waxy and difficult to apply, trying running some water over the stick to wet it before applying.  Works much better that way.}</li>
            <li> I love the ingredient profile on this although I ran into some complications. Note, I have very sensitive skin and almost every single deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried has given me some sort of rash. This product gave me the worst I&#x27;ve ever had in the most recent comparison to Gillette Gel and Mitchum. In addition, I was perspiration as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any deodorant, it offered little to no protection from perspiration. I&#x27;ll be going back to Gillette and risking Alzheimers until I find another all natural alternative that actually works.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a few days. I couldn&#x27;t even make it through one day of sitting at my desk wearing a light t-shirt and doing no physical exertion without sweating and stinking. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. when applied it leaves your armpits sticky and I used a lot, just to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had body odor for years now, but wanted to try something more natural because I heard about the ill-effects of aluminum. However, if the trade-off is being stinky and sweaty, what&#x27;s the point. I might as well wear nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw this deodorant away as it&#x27;s useless. It&#x27;s a good thing it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> After trying SSOOO many natural deodorants, this one finally kept me from needing to reapply every four hours, stinkwise. It is definitely unscented - if it had a modicum of a scent, it would be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, my stick broke apart, fell out - I just shoved the broken part back in and used as normal, seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with the quality. I had never tried it before, and will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Feels like trying to rub dry cement under my arm.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell, and keeps me from smelling all day.  My wife is using it, too, and likes it very much.  Much better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant after searching for a natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t contain propylene glycol or alum. I have been very pleased by its effectiveness. I&#x27;ve been sweating a lot throughout this hot summer, and odor has not been an issue. The only time I reapply is before I start my workout at the gym. I don&#x27;t even think that&#x27;s necessary, but I do it just for insurance. I&#x27;ve convinced my wife to try it. At first she didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d like it, because it goes on kind of pasty and she didn&#x27;t want it on her clothes. But she noticed that after several minutes, the pastiness kind of disappears. Anyway, for us it&#x27;s more effective than aluminum antiperspirant for controlling odor. So we will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for years for a natural deodorant that actually works and have finally found one!  My only suggestion is that they make the name more unisex and perhaps come out with a small purse sized version.  Women buy beauty products, natural deodorant included.  Just saying.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried five other \\&quot;natural deodorants\\&quot; (a phrase that is a misnomer, as aluminum and arsenic are natural, but I digress) and Jungleman is the only product that has worked. It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, which you don&#x27;t one anyway because sweat is your body&#x27;s natural cooling system. Jungleman is a deodorant, meaning that it keeps the bacteria that makes you smell bad from growing and it works incredibly well. Other products either haven&#x27;t worked or caused a light burning skin irritation sensation. I&#x27;ve recommended Jungleman to several friends and all have agreed: it works, it works well, and it&#x27;s the only deodorant worth buying.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised with this stuff. A lot of natural items don&#x27;t work very well, but this one holds up. I wore it on and off throughout the summer, using a competitors natural deodorant when not using this one. I highly recommend this product and plan on using it from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the first and best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried!  It works great and lasts me a full day as it does a good job at preventing odor.  The only thing I noticed is that when I go to the gym and sweat the product leaves a yellowish stain on my shirts.  However unlike aluminum-based deodorants, Jungleman All-Natural stains come out with a quick wash.  All in all a good product!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say other than it works. Yes 2.5 ounce is pretty small(used it for 2 months and have about 50% left), but no other natural deodorant works better than Jungleman. Hopefully down the line this product gets cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for a couple months.  I have tried many other natural deodorants as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as odor-fighting effectiveness, this deodorant is one of the best.  Whatever they use for their concoction of ingredients certainly seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downfalls are that it is too hard to apply.  As other reviewers mentioned, it is very hard and does not like to apply easily, and then flakes of the product will come off in pieces.  Additionally, I have found that it makes yellow stains on (white) shirts.  So far the stains have come out in the wash, but the staining is still a big drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying the holistic deodorant made by Real Purity.  It seems to be equally as effective, with easier application and no staining.  It does have a slight fragrance, if that is of note to someone with allergies.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Started buying it for my boyfriend, worked so good for him that I now use it as well!</li>
            <li> Turned into a goopy mess in hot weather. Unless you want extra-sticky sweat, just stick with the normal stuff</li>
            <li> I have an aluminum sensitivity so I&#x27;ve been avoiding mainstream deodorants. I&#x27;ve worked my way through everything at the health food store and NOTHING worked! I resorted to perfume. Let me tell you. This stuff totally works. I am amazed and awed really. All that other crap is in the garbage but I may invest in a case of this. I&#x27;m a woman if that matters... There is no odor to this. Has no scent. Doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. Works... Pretty much all you need to know.</li>
            <li> Trying to limit chemicals on my body, I tried about 4-5 other popular products from the health foods stores. Nothing worked for odor until I found this product. It completely keeps me odor-free all day, even in the summer. It does NOT prevent sweating as it is not an anti-perspirant - so heads up - but it&#x27;s the chemical that prevents sweating that is what I&#x27;m trying to avoid. This product gets very soft when warm and is shipped to you on a cold pak. When you try to rub it on, it&#x27;s hard at first, but your body warms it up and then it applies easily. A little too much so, as it&#x27;s easy to get too much on. It does leave a white residue so it will not work with the little black dress. I don&#x27;t mind using traditional anti-perspirants every once in a while for those occasions. But this product is my go-to everyday choice. As for the name,&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Jungleman,\\&quot; it DOES NOT smell like a man. It has no smell actually. Very happy overall with this product and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> This deodorant definitely has both pros and cons. I am on my second stick and so far this deodorant works very well as far as keeping sweating down and cutting down on BO. I would even rate this as better for BO and sweat than a regular deodorant but for a few unfortunate downsides. My first stick broke into a few pieces at times but I was still able to put the pieces back and use them. The second stick I received I was unable to twist up (it was stuck) and took quite some time to fix. While these issues are minor and livable in relation to the amazing job that it does, I have begun to get a very bad rash/cysts in my arm pits. At first I figured that it was just some fluke thing going on with my body and it would go away, but I now have a painful cyst the size of a marble under one arm, a rash that rivals the chicken pox and talk about some major itching. Needless to say I have stopped using this product. I&#x27;m  not sure if the batches vary because I had no side effects with the first stick that I used. I would still highly recommend this product as looking at the reviews many people absolutely love it and my boyfriend uses it everyday with no issues. I just felt that I should let anyone interested know that there is the chance that there can be some unpleasant side effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to stay away from aluminum and no product over the counter comes close to how good jungleman works. It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Best stuff on earth I don&#x27;t like to write reviews but this truly deserves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing I have ever tried in my life compares to this product I work in remodeling and am constantly doing physical work throughout my day good news is I come home and of all places my armpits have the least odor!</li>
            <li> Its more difficult to apply, because its much firmer than traditional sticks. Like most other all natural products you sacrifice some type of convenience, in Jungleman&#x27;s case its the ease of application. Those who are not in the classification of \\&quot;lazy American&#x27;s\\&quot; and/or who are accustomed to the \\&quot;inconvenience\\&quot; of all natural products will have no issues with this product. It works just as well as the other chemical laden products, and it wont contribute to an early death.</li>
            <li> The BEST natural deodorant that I have ever used. I plan on being a lifetime customer. It doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy or white marks on my clothes, it has a subtle fresh scent, and best of all, it&#x27;s all natural and I NEVER have BO with this product. Ever. You rock, Jungleman!</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of getting used to.  It doesn&#x27;t roll on as smooth as commercial deodorant.  What I did find is if you just put it under your arm, and let it warm up for about 10 seconds then apply it works out great.  I used to buy prescription strength deodorant, and this stuff works great.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for about 5 months, so I figured it was about time I wrote a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long distance runner, so I sweat. A lot. I&#x27;ve sweat through pretty much every deodorant on the shelf in the stores. Starting last year the only thing I found that worked was the extra-strength stuff that runs about $12 a stick. That&#x27;s pretty expensive, and coupled with the high aluminum content I figured I would start shopping around to see what I could find. I stumbled on jungleman and so far I haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ordered it, it arrived in a short cardboard tube (as it generally does) with a cool pack (sort of like an ice pack?) inside to keep the product from melting. That worked really well, but it also meant that it was hard to turn and the product itself didn&#x27;t rub off so well, so if you live somewhere where it&#x27;s cold or if the product arrives fairly cold you want to let it warm a bit before using it. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it melting, but I have read reviews to that effect. Store it somewhere cool and it won&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is unscented with just a very faint scent of tea tree (which is one of the ingredients). As I&#x27;ve never really worn an unscented deodorant before this one, I was a bit insecure about it but now I don&#x27;t even think about it. It works really well and I have learned to trust that I won&#x27;t stink just because there isn&#x27;t some absurdly powerful perfume smell attached to it. It holds up through all my runs and even works after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the shipping it runs me about $9, so a slight lead on the extra strength stuff but it works better than that stuff does. Also, given that it&#x27;s not prime I&#x27;m impressed with the speed at which it arrives to me. My most recent order was placed on a Sunday and I received the order via USPS on Tuesday afternoon. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  Lasts all day. No Scent. No aluminum. No Zinc. No chemicals. No irritation.  No odor. No problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for all-natural, aluminum-free deodorants for some time.  I have tried various ones that I purchased at health stores and even at major chain stores.  I never liked any of them.  They all had similar gel-like consistencies and didn&#x27;t last for longer than 6-8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is different.  It has the same thick, chalky consistency that many of the non-natural, aluminum-containing deodorants have.  I like that powdery, chalky texture.  It lasts a lot longer than the gel.  In fact, I can go 24  hours easily and this deodorant still works.  It has no fragrance and leaves me smelling totally neutral.  This is the best aluminum-free deodorant out there.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, costing about twice what I usually pay for deodorant.  But other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this deodorant. It looked very good from the description. When I received the deodorant in the mail, it was broken and defective---I was able to get a replacement. When I finally got around to using it, the deodorant wouldn&#x27;t spread under my arms---it was just ripping my underarm hair off. I tried to use it a few more times but again, would not spread--just solid as a rock and very dry. A few weeks later, I emailed the owner of the company for a refund or replacement. I explained to him what happened, gave him all the info about the purchase, but he was being difficult and not helpful at all--extremely bad customer service from this company. I then filed a claim through Amazon for a refund---they wouldn&#x27;t do anything about it either. To top it all off, it cost me $10 for this deodorant! That&#x27;s a lot of money for a good deodorant let alone one that doesn&#x27;t work. This deodorant is a total waste of money and I urge everybody--do not buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> So far, it is okay.  Dispenses a bit mushy, and then you have to rub it in. Not happy about that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. I hesitated because of the lack of antiperspirant, because I sweat a lot. But, I&#x27;ve worn this on 10 mile hikes, a 14 hours summer day of traveling on public transit and tough client meetings, and everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t switch to this stuff sooner. To top it off, I&#x27;m still using the same stick from three months ago!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an effective deoderant (not an antipersperant) that didn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell and also worked. This is surprisingly hard to find. This has almost no scent at all. Leaves a slight white residue when you first put it on, so be careful putting on a dark shirt. This dissipates very quickly though. So far it seems to keep the stink away all day as promised. I will definitely buy this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/10/13--&lt;br /&gt;STILL AWESOME. Works as promised. I just ordered more. This is by far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or otherwise. No smell, and just barely starts to fail halfway through day two! Some people have claimed it gives them boils/cysts under their arms. I&#x27;ll admit, I had that trouble a couple weeks after I started using it. It lasted a couple weeks with one or two painful cysts under each arm at a time that would come and go. I&#x27;m still using this, and the cysts stopped after a couple more weeks. This product still works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. The package is a little small, so this ends up being a little pricey with shipping. The product will melt in the heat, so don&#x27;t leave it in the car. Still works though, you just have to let it harden back up and kind of scoop it and rub it in. It goes on a little \\&quot;white\\&quot;, but dissipates quickly, and almost immediately if you rub it in. Remember, this is NOT an antiperspirant. You&#x27;ll still sweat, but you won&#x27;t smell AT ALL. After a full day, if I do the \\&quot;sniff test\\&quot; all I smell is a faint hint of whatever soap I showered with that morning. Even with the week or so of pimple/cysts that passed, the cost, and the sometimes slightly challenging application, I expect this will be my deodorant of choice for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to try an all natural deodorant. I found this product to actually be quite nice and it does hold up fairly well. Now compared to typical alum based deodorants, this doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well, but for being what it is, it&#x27;s actually pretty good. For a typical work day where I don&#x27;t sweat at all, I have zero issues and I am always pleased with this products results. Now for a day where I might be sweating heavily or out and about walking on a hot summers day, this product seems to protect me well for 5-6 hours and after that will start to breakdown a bit. If you were to do a second application later in the day you would do just fine. Overall I am very pleased with this product and I&#x27;m also very happy to leave my old chemical laced deodorant behind. I imagine I will continue to use this deodorant for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Does it work? YES Is it all natural? YES! only slight downfalls:&lt;br /&gt;1) I would have liked some sort of scent in there, bc although it does neutralize smell quite effectively a little bit of scent would help cover up any smell that manages to squeeze through. My solution: put a little bit of essential oil of your choosing on before you apply deodorant&lt;br /&gt;2) Application isnt the smoothest, but at least your not getting any metals or petrochemicals in your body from applying it to your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to apply all natural deodorants that smelled good but didnt work so I would put the deodorant on and then powder myself with baking soda. It is extremely effective. Now this takes a 2 step process and turns it into 1. Also, it is small enough to travel with. Yay!</li>
            <li> A clean, simple product (4 ingredients) that works well. No unpleasant scents or odors, suppresses body-odor build up for at least 24 hours in my tests so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: If product is cool (less than 80 degrees,) apply very slowly to allow body heat to warm it up so it goes on easily and smoothly. Don&#x27;t put on too much, it can leave a whitish residue if applied too strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to ordering a larger batch.</li>
            <li> This is an all natural deodorant THAT WORKS. This is in fact the most effective deodorant I have ever bought. I&#x27;m including the conventional anti perspirants in this in that claim. I used to use suave clinical stregth -this works better and it&#x27;s all natural. I used to use the salt crystals which was also very effective. I just wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about the potassium alum in it and I wanted a completely all-natural deodorant. My skin is a little dry so I&#x27;ll put a little coconut oil under my arm (which can be used as deodorant on it&#x27;s own) first then apply. I love most about Jungle Man deodorant is that there&#x27;s no scent. Men and women can use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought lots of items on Amazon, but this is my first time leaving a review...that should tell you something!  I have been searching high and low for a natural deodorant that works for me, and I haven&#x27;t had much luck.  They&#x27;ve either ended up in the trash, or I&#x27;ve kept them but had to reapply more than once throughout the day (which isn&#x27;t always the most convenient thing to do).  So, I gave this stuff a shot...and yes, as some have mentioned, it does go on pretty messy.  But, I&#x27;ve found that if you rub the excess &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; into your skin, it smooths out pretty well (doesn&#x27;t even seem to leave much, if anything, on clothing if you let it &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; a bit before getting dressed).  But, I will deal with the mess, because it works!  I have had this stuff on for full days, no reapplying, and there is NO odor at the end of the day!  The real test was just yesterday...I went for a 20 mile bicycle ride, sweated quite a bit...NO smell afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;I know everybody&#x27;s body chemistry is a little different, and what works for one might not work for another, but I am VERY happy with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Very poor. The best thing about it was how it came packaged. Didn&#x27;t even work over night and I never have night odor problems</li>
            <li> If you look at my reviews from today, you will see that I review three natural deodorants, including this one.  I wanted a natural deodorant, without aluminum or antiperspirant that would keep me odor free for the entire day without staining my shirts.  This one fits the bill just fine, but for one complaint.  In the winter, we keep our house at about 69 degrees.  At this temperature, this deodorant is rock hard and hard to spread across your underarm.  It will probably soften up and be easier to spread in the summer, but right now I find I am using the other products I bought over this one.  On the plus side, it smells fine and works for 18-24 hours (all day and into the next morning), but the spreadability (or lack of it) is worth subtracting one star.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever.  I bought them for my whole family. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I like a lot of other people have concerns about rubbing all sorts of strange chemicals under my arms everyday. I also had my doubts about using an all natural product like Jungleman. I was happily surprised when I discovered just how well this prouct works. If I have to skip my morning shower I can go a second full day without having to re-apply this product and I still show no signs of body odor. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried Toms, I have tried Trader Joe&#x27;s and with Both I smelled musky....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But FINALLY I Can Play hard, run hard and Sweat Like crazy and Jungleman Deodorant keeps me smelling FRESH,  Thanks You Jungleman &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> So happy with this one. I&#x27;ve tried everything else under the sun. I put this on at 8AM and don&#x27;t have to worry about a thing for the next 24 hrs. Can&#x27;t believe this isn&#x27;t sold in every pharmacy. So happy I found this.</li>
            <li> From the scorching summer heat , to the frigid winter cold of the North. this stuff is unbelievable. Not one smell at all, all day long. works great for both sexes.</li>
            <li> It is the only natural deodorant that works. It really is incredible and such a relief that I have found one that I can recommend to others. Why is this not being sold in Ireland and the UK?</li>
            <li> I have never found a deodorant that is more perfect for me. I has no odor, no residue, and really works!&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE: be sure that when you purchase, it says that it is being shipped from Jungleman Naturals. There are fraud companies out there (such as Action Development Group) that are taking advantage of a great product and selling it, yet are  unauthorized sellers. My product from them arrived damaged - and they provided no recourse or customer service. Jungleman Naturals however picked up the slack and took care of me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works great and keeping you odor free. And it also helped the &amp;#34;darkness&amp;#34; on my armpits to disappear!</li>
            <li> This works well for me and doesnt cause the surrounding skin to be zapped of moisture like traditional deodorants. I don&#x27;t mind paying the high price simply because I feel this product is friendlier to my body than the chemical-laden mainstream brands.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It works soo much better than TOMS! I do still get sweaty sometimes, but I dont stink! It&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant ever.  I&#x27;m not easy to please when it comes to natural deodorants and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of them.</li>
            <li> Nothing works on me so I was excited to try this product, it pulled my hair out, didn&#x27;t control my sweating or stank. Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> I saw this product had many great reviews and I have no idea why. First of all, I could not get the product to twist up so that I could try it. I could not dislodge either one I received--I got two. I had to microwave one of them for 10-12 seconds to warm the product up enough to twist the bottom dial. It has a light medicinal herbal scent. This is a thick chalky white stick. When I applied it to my underarm it made a huge mess, a white chalky paste smeared all over my underarm which then ended up all over the inside of my shirt. Finally, this product did nothing to mask odor or help reduce sweating. This stuff is awful. I would NEVER recommend and I&#x27;m going to try to return mine, bc I tried it once &amp; won&#x27;t every be using them again. Such a waste. DON&#x27;T BOTHER</li>
            <li> This deodorant is so Very dry &amp; worse you still have BO at the end of the day. I tried it several times thinking it would work the next time but this deodorant just stinks.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural deodorant, and tried this one. After a few days of using it I started to feel weak and just generally not good. I did some research on the ingredients, and found that tea tree oil has been documented to lower testosterone levels and overall mess up the male endocrine system. There are a few clinical studies (including the one below) that have shown that topical application of tea tree oil can cause high estrogen levels in men, and ultimately lead to gynecomastia (breast development) in males.    This is a link to the study from the New England Journal of Medicine: [...]    Bottom line: I don&#x27;t believe that men should be topical skin care products that contain tea tree oil. Unless this company changes the formula, I would stay away.</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews about this product and decided to give it a try. It came in a special package with an ice pack which was super cool. It was frozen and could not even twist up. I then left it in the room temperature for a couple hours and it worked fine. After a first couple days, it worked great. I did not smell and my clothes didn&#x27;t either. Then I went shopping and tried on new clothes and I can see chunk of white powder in there and it left white stain on all the new clothes I try on. I mean, it is not a problem if nobody can see my armpit but I could not wear a tank top or sleeveless because it is gross to see white chunk of power in your armpits. If you wear long sleeve everyday and hide your armpit all the time, this product is great (seriously). But if you want to wear something that make your armpit visible to others, avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;PS. Other reviews also mentioned that the white stain will be disappeared, but in my case its there all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I even found this, too all those people getting irritation, could it be from the corn starch from what I am able to tell. Some people are sensitive to it. Go search online &#x27;corn starch armpit&#x27; you are not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for me, amazing product will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> It does the job, not a big smell to it, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue. Natural was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> The product itself works, but I have several complaints:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It takes FOREVER for this company to ship its product.  You place the order, and the deodorant won&#x27;t ship for like five or six days later.  No clue why it takes so long.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Shipping cost is absurd.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The product itself runs out very quickly, so you will be ordering quite frequently, which is a problem (see items #1 and #2 above).</li>
            <li> This deoderant works well and is odorless. It is very difficult to apply because the product is hard, but it does the job well.</li>
            <li> This product is basically everything I wanted it to be with the exception of it&#x27;s one flaw which is fatal enough for me to unfortunately never use the product again.  The formula must be lacking whatever it is that allows you to smoothly apply it like a normal deodorant.  Every time I would apply it, it would painfully rip out my armpit hair as I dragged it back and forth on my under arm.  I&#x27;ve never thought about the \\&quot;glide on smooth\\&quot; catch phrase from deodorant ads before this.  After each use, a dozen or so arm pit hairs would be left on the deodorant which had just been torn out.  If they correct they issue, I would eagerly start using Jungleman again.</li>
            <li> First off, I must say this works very, very well. The only problem is that it gives me a red, itchy rash. My significant other did not have this problem, though, and has used it for months with rave reviews. As a deodorant it is wonderful, but I can&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s too bad! I would still recommend trying it out, not everyone will be irritated by it and it really is a great natural deodorant in terms of odor prevention/wetness minimization. I have to stick with lemon juice and baby powder, though.</li>
            <li> Good natural product, however temp changes can cause changes in the product..will recommend this product though a little expensive...will buy again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to bad mouth the product, because I&#x27;m sure it does work for some people.  I was hoping to use it on days when I was only planning to go out for a few hours.  I saw no difference between using it, and using nothing at all.  I had no irritation either though.  It did come well packaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for about a month and it&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found so far. I was using the crystal for a couple of years and then it stopped working, and I learned that it isn&#x27;t completely safe since it still contains aluminum. I had tried DIY deodorants without much success and resulting in some pretty bad rashes. After searching long and hard for a replacement I came across this. I am one of those people who are very picky about what ingredients go into my body so I was very impressed about the short and simple ingredient list. As a woman, I will point out a couple of things. DO NOT apply this deodorant right after shaving! It will burn like crazy and irritate your skin. I am currently having some hormonal adjustments to medication which is giving me some pretty bad BO, and this helps to eliminate it, but not completely. Also, yeah it goes on kinda messy and chalky but if you just rub it in with your fingers it won&#x27;t get all over your clothes and the white residue will disappear! My only other complaint is that I have to apply this pretty heavily and it is drying out my skin and leaving my underarms kind of flaky. I guess I will have to start moisturizing with coconut oil right after I shower before applying this. All in all I will keep buying this deodorant until it stops working or they stop making it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this deodorant because I didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 for the Menscience/Malin and Goetz deodorants that were made without aluminum.  When I tried both the sticks I ordered, the product was so dry and difficult to apply that it would drag my underarm skin back and forth very roughly.  Multiple times it actually ripped hair off with it.  I stopped using this after 3 attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a deodorant for the same price WITHOUT aluminum (which was the big thing for me), look into Tom&#x27;s deodorant.  It&#x27;s made with natural ingredients and aluminum-free.  The only downside is that I have not found one that is unscented.  However, the scent I have (Mountain spring) is very light and fresh and the application is very very smooth - it is literally slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review saves underarm pain!</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, I absolutely loved it.  I could apply it in the morning, and still have no odor by bedtime that night and even into the next day.  Other reviewers have mentioned that the product can be hard to apply. This is true, but I&#x27;ve found that holding the stick on my skin for a few moments before moving it around softens it nicely.  The product melts into the skin and has not residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a few weeks after I started using the product, I noticed that the skin where I was applying it was turning red, then brown, and then flaking and peeling off. I&#x27;m very fair (read: almost albino), so it was very noticeable. I gave myself a break form using it for a few days, and the started using it again.  The problem returned, along with a itchy sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research on this, and found lots of other folks who have had the same issue. Apparently some people have a sensitivity to prolonged contact with baking soda, which is one of the ingredients in this deodorant. I read a few articles that say that baking soda changes the PH of your skin, and allows yeast and/or fungus to thrive and set up an infection. That my be what is causing my issue. I&#x27;m going to treat with rash ointment, and hope that this all clears up.  I&#x27;m also ditching my jungleman deodorant and am going to try [[ASIN:B0012FEXMI Yodora Deodorant Cream 2 oz (56.7 g)]], as it does not contain baking soda and has good reviews. Hoping I have better luck with it - I don&#x27;t want to go back to aluminum based deodorant! I&#x27;ll write another review for the Yodora product after I have used it for while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really really like Jungleman Deodorant.  I give it 5 stars for the natural and simplistic ingredients, and you can&#x27;t beat it for odor control.  I&#x27;ve tried the deodorant crystal , Toms of Maine, Aubrey Organics, Weleda - nothing comes close to this product in terms of effectiveness. Unfortunately, I just can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me. &#x27;caused itching and redness on my skin</li>
            <li> Had the deodorant on for  2 hours my armpits began to  feel  wet and I began to smell. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Okay, I use unscented speed stick anti-perspirant because my skin reacts poorly to scented deodorant. I hate that it has aluminum in it. I&#x27;ve tried the salt rock crystal thing and Tom&#x27;s of Maines version of natural deodorant and neither work well or last. I&#x27;m not a profuse sweater, but summer is summer and they just don&#x27;t work. This stuff works well...almost as well as the speed stick. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This works really well for me - and love the fact that it&#x27;s natural.  One star off for the fact that the sticks always get really crumbly over time.  I like it so much that&#x27;s not going to stop me from using it - just wish they would find a way to resolve that issue without adding any nasty chemicals.  I think the product may be drying out, which causes the crumbliness.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical of this stuff, but it really does work. I have a tendency to just get ripe for some reason. My husband and I joke about my &amp;#34;manstank.&amp;#34; (We&#x27;re so romantic!) He&#x27;s one of those people who can forget deodorant and he&#x27;s fine. If I forget deodorant, everyone around me knows it within the hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a 24-hour deodorant for me, but whatever. I shower every morning anyway. I wear sleeveless shirts a lot, and I work in close proximity to clients, and I don&#x27;t worry about the manstank anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awesome that it&#x27;s all natural but honestly, I don&#x27;t even care that much about that. I work with all kinds of crazy chemicals anyway. I&#x27;m just thrilled that it actually works, and works really well!</li>
            <li> They are now using organic corn starch. Just got this email from the company:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great news.  As promised, we have begun using 100% organic corn starch (which is 100% non-GMO by default) in our products.  Our product information pages and FAQ have been updated accordingly to reflect that.  Should you have any questions in the future, please feel free to contact us and we&#x27;ll be more than happy to help you.</li>
            <li> I love this all natural deodorant. It protects well, but not as good as the regular brands with unnatural products. It also causes a slight rash when using.</li>
            <li> This Deodorant works well but the label shouldn&#x27;t say &#x27;Invisible Solid Deodorant Stick&#x27; when it absolutely is not invisible!  I&#x27;m still looking for a truly healthy invisible deodorant, the search continues.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good alternative to the usual store bought aluminum, alcohol etc. etc. ridden deodorant and for a long time and finally found it, after trying many brands. The Jungleman deodorant both works very well and is clear of any potentially unwanted chemicals (they even go out of their way and use palm oil from non-peatlands, thus not supporting our continuing rainforest deforestation). They also have scented ones if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was unsure of my shipment&#x27;s status they wanted to go above and beyond to try and locate it (turns out I missed the shipping email).</li>
            <li> It is clearly a natural product.  Jungelman does not leave the strange antiperspirant residue that never seems to fade.  It works well and meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> Natural deodorants suck!!!! But so far not this one. I am a grown man with grown man funk and so far the Jungleman got me swinging!!! Don&#x27;t change a thing. And thank you for the solution to the Funk...so far....</li>
            <li> Deodorizes without scent. Feels like it&#x27;s ripping the hair out of my armpits when I tried using it. Switched to &amp;#34;kiss my face&amp;#34; unscented roll on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the Jungleman Deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried virtually every other natural deodorant on the market and this is the only product that has worked for me. I recommend buying several of these at a time - as other reviewers have noted, the shipping is a bit pricey (my deodorant sticks arrived in a foil-type package inside of a box, most likely because the product is heat sensitive).</li>
            <li> i like it ..&lt;br /&gt;- i use it for the first time, and i&#x27;m very satisfied  .. i raccommend it</li>
            <li> After using this, i will not go back to commercial deodorant. It starts to get pricey when you include shipping so find a way to make your own or purchase for the whole year. one stick lasts me about 2.5  to 3.0 months. i do find myself using more cologne so i can have a scent</li>
            <li> This product seems to work great. Which I find so hard to believe based on the ingredients. Which I (and my wife) are very happy it doesn&#x27;t contain all the harmful chemicals like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;d really like to give it 5 stars, if it didn&#x27;t feel like I dragging a giant half dried Elmer&#x27;s glue stick across my pits. I&#x27;ve tried using it after I&#x27;m thoroughly dry and just as I get out of the shower. Smooth long swipes seems to be the best I can do but still.....feels like glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing this again though.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!!!!  I&#x27;ve tried for YEARS to find a good all natural deodorant!  Regular deodorant is SO bad for you. Aluminum has a strong link to causing breast cancer.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of all natural deodorants but they have all fallen short--they either don&#x27;t properly block odor or they are so strongly scented I can&#x27;t stand it. Not this one! It blocks odor SO well and is unscented.  Only 4 ingredients: Corn starch, palm oil, baking soda, and tea tree oil.  So healthy! I can&#x27;t believe this short list of ingredients works little miracles under my arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some customers said this goes on thick like paste. I was scared that this was going to be goopey under my arms.  NOT true.  It&#x27;s not a clear liquid roll on, but it only leaves a very small film under your arms. No big deal at all. It&#x27;s virtually clear and any little white pieces you can easily rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some customers said beware that it may arrive melted if it&#x27;s hot out.  It looks like they&#x27;re properly addressing this issue because for one, it arrived fine to me (and I&#x27;m in a sunny location), and 2- they pack it very well, with a label that says to keep out of heat and with a cold insulation lining in addition to the box as well as an ice pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Last- while this blocks odor, you may still sweat. But sweating is natural and the only way to block sweat is with chemicals that are toxic to your body (aluminum, titanium, etc).</li>
            <li> Works better than other natural products. Salt rocks do well for some people in the family, but not others....that is all I will say. This deodorant exceeded my expectations and I will purchase more in the future. Also, I must mention that the item I received was well packaged (came with cooling ice gel to make sure the item didn&#x27;t melt if exposed to heat during shipping).</li>
            <li> It does definitely work. I still sweat but there is no smell. This Jungleman deodorant is a white solid that becomes clear when applied. As others have mentioned, it is a bit sticky going on but I found using a lighter pressure when applying it makes it flow on and apply pretty well. I did get the slightest bit of a redness around the edges of my pits, probably due to the pH of the baking soda being much more alkaline than my skin but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me, i.e., does not burn or feel irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from controlling any odor very well, the two things that I like best about Jungleman: what it does contain and, just as equally, what it does not contain. Knowing I am not polluting my body with chemicals or other questionable substances is great. As a note, mine arrived in a box. Within that box the deodorant itself was in a sealed bag, along with a small ice pack to help keep it from melting during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to my first use, I got rid of the edges of the product with a tissue, to make it smooth for the first application. I give it a 4 due to the non-pH balanced nature and the slight rash it causes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Feb 26, 2915: The rash/redness in my pits is no longer occurring or visible. Not sure why, but hopefully it stays that way.</li>
            <li> I never review products, this is my first time because this stuff actually works.  I tried out a bunch of natural deodorants and crystals to see what could work and still have just a few ingredients.  Out of 10 products, this was the best one.  Feels good, prevents smell when exercising and not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, have re-ordered several of these already. It smells good, and works good. One interesting side effect is that my underarm hair seems to have lightened. It was black now its light brown.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome at stopping sweat and odor. I know its not an antiperspirant but it does stop sweating. I have had to switch to natural deodorant cause I kept having a horrible reaction to the normal stuff. I would itch and burn and it would last for up to a week after I quit using anything. for me this natural deodorant still causes some burning but it is manageable and it is probably only a result of the other stuff eating a layer of my skin off, not fully healed skin, and daily shaving. I am impressed with how effective it is.</li>
            <li> This arrived in bad condition, partially melted, but I kept it anyway (my first mistake). It did not work for me as a deodorizer, and was irritating to my underarms. I tried it. Left it alone a while...tried it again, with the same results, then threw it out.</li>
            <li> Works great, but yes ... it is a little &#x27;rough&#x27; to put on.  I wet my underarms AND the deodorant stick, then apply it wet.  I&#x27;d keep it in the shower and do that before drying off, but the instructions -- and other reviewers -- say it is sensitive to heat.  Not sure how I&#x27;ll travel with it!  Additional information (11-11-2015): I had one of these partially melt before I could get it out of the sun (thanks, delivery folks for not reading the instructions on the box). Jungleman packed it properly, with frozen cold packs, but the day was just too hot. Anyway, I put the product in the fridge for a couple of hours and it was fine. There was just a little to clean up on the outside where it ran out while it was softened. The plan, now, is to stock up in cooler months so I don&#x27;t have to worry about non-reading deliver-ers :-&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Have tried a few natural brands and this is one of the few that works. I just wish there were free shipping on it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  I have sensitive skin, and this does not irritate me and is affective.  I love the all natural components.  They actually ship the product with a cool gel pack.  If you buy more than one, just keep the extras stored in a cool place.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So far so good... Was using Men&#x27;s Science which I loved, but does it have gold bullion chips in it or something!!??  Way too pricey.  I hope Jungleman eventually qualifies for Amazon Prime because the shipping costs sucks, but still cheaper.  There is a small issue with application as others have mentioned.  It&#x27;s a little hard/sticky going on.  If they tweaked their formula it would be 5stars but I&#x27;m giving it 4.5 stars but that&#x27;s not an option.  I do find if I apply it while my under arms are still damp after shower it goes on better, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it may bother other people.</li>
            <li> Works well at first but after continued use it have me a bad underarm rash!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Goes on easy, feels good on my skin, and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: do not use in heat. Don&#x27;t put this in your gym back and leave it in the trunk of your car. It will overheat and make a mess.</li>
            <li> Love this product. No smell but sure does the job. Fantastic product would absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> After searching high and low for a natural deodorant (that was really natural) I thought I had found it and really wanted to like this one.  I didn&#x27;t even mind the cost or additional handling time if it worked.  But after several attempts, I continue to develop a rash under my arms after a couple of days of use.  Back to the drawing board.  Think next I will be trying DIY.</li>
            <li> i was a little bit hesitant when buying this but i can tell you that this really really works  and i have had no problems yes you do still sweat but there is no odor i will be buying this again thanks</li>
            <li> It does destroy odor, but it goes on like sandpaper! Have to hold it there awhile until body heat melts it. I used to use the Arm &amp; Hammer active or sport deodorant, but they stopped making it. I just use this unscented one and put some cologne on now, and it works.</li>
            <li> For having only having 4 ingredients [sodium bicarbonate, corn starch, sustainable palm oil, tea tree oil] and no scent whatsoever, I was genuinely surprised at just how well it works.  I gave it a try because of other people&#x27;s reviews, and I am now a repeat customer.  It&#x27;s the only deodorant I use. I refuse to smear anything on my body that I don&#x27;t know exactly what each ingredient is and what it does.  Do not waste your time with other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants.  Either they aren&#x27;t really &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and/or they do not work.  It&#x27;s at least worth a try.</li>
            <li> A lot of these natural deodorants dont work and are sticky. This one stops odor and sweat. It has almost no smell to it. I am very pleased and will be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> I few weeks ago I found a lump under my armpit. It turned out to be nothing, but it was a wake up call for me to STOP using aluminum base deos which I knew were bad for me. People in my family have gotten breast cancer so I knew that I couldn&#x27;t play around with this. I went about a week using no deo and found out quick that wasn&#x27;t going to work. I smelled musty, even if I didn&#x27;t sweat much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research, I started using Jungleman and have been very surprised. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does. If you have problems applying this, I recommend doing some trimming in the armpits, it will help it go on smooth and actually help cut down on smells. Hair can hold odors, bacteria, and holds in heat, which leads to sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am highly satisfied with Jungleman and will buy more, even though it costs more. Don&#x27;t get the Arm&amp;Hammer Naturals, it contain ingrediants that are not natural. The crystal deos also have alum in them... I am giving this product 5-stars, but considering what the ingredients are, I think it could be slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> I did an exhausting amount of research and trials for different deodorants that would work for me and i finally found my best option. To start with, i was very heavy into antiperspirants do to my heavy sweating in my arm pits. I really have no idea why, hot or cold i immediately have sweat in my pits at all times. Its been that way for all 27 years of my life. So i tried literally anything and everything i found. Then i got to a point that i realized antiperspirant or not, I&#x27;m gonna sweat so why use a product that doesn&#x27;t work and has ingredients that are ridiculous to allow your body to absorb. We live in a synthetic world, no doubt! Somethings we will never step away from. But why would we put a product on our super absorbent pores with some of the same chemicals and heavy metals that we spend so much money every year to avoid in our drinking water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been very effective for me. One major plus is that it is a solid, which is not common among deodorants.  It takes a week or so of use to get used to a product like this, as its very different then the normal options. Change can be tuff but for me it had a major payoff. For the first time in my life i actually rarely have sweat spots in my arm pits! I have absolutely no idea why or how, but dropping the antiperspirant for this deodorant seems to have cause some sort of a change for me. Im not sure if the same will apply to others, but i will take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It applies decently and washes off great in the shower, so you don&#x27;t get that old antiperspirant smell or feeling. That goes for clothing as well, leaving shirts just like new in the arm pit area. Under heavy use like exercise, you may wanna apply more then once as a scent can leak through, but that has been my experience with all the products unless it has some cheesy ridiculous smell that out weighs it. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for change.</li>
            <li> These were better than Jason&#x27;s but just couldn&#x27;t stop the BO.  I just can&#x27;t take all-natural deodorants seriously after trying both products.  Despite the good reviews I just don&#x27;t see these and legitimate replacements for conventional deodorants.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I will try the other brands. Only problem is paying so much for shipping bringing the item total to almost $10.00. I will try to find in store next time.</li>
            <li> This product initially works for masking odor, but I find myself stinky toward the middle and end of the day. The product is messy going on--lots of white goop on my armpits that I have to rub into my skin, before putting my clothes on.</li>
            <li> Jungle Man is the best Natural Deodorant I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried alot of them. Tom&#x27;s of Maine 24hr was the best I knew of until I tried this one. Tom&#x27;s was too wet...and Jungle Man is too dry. Jungle Man is very dry and doesn&#x27;t really have any of what deodorant company&#x27;s call &#x27;glide&#x27;...but I can forgive it b/c it is the best vs. the competition in every other way. It is invisible, almost scentless and works for the whole day. I would recommend everyone give it a try.</li>
            <li> i only used this for a few days  it caused a rash  ive never had any issues with any other products</li>
            <li> I have looked into a lot of natural alternatives to mainstream antiperspirant/deodorant to get away from the aluminum and what-not and have had little luck finding anything that works comparably well. This stuff works amazingly well!! I put it on at night after a shower and after a nights sleep, a full day of work, the gym, whatever I throw at it, there is no BO smell whatsoever. I&#x27;m so impressed with this stuff. That being said, it doesn&#x27;t make me smell good or anything, just not smell at all. Also, its a little harsh putting on (pulls at your hair and skin a bit). Also, I don&#x27;t think it works as an antiperspirant but overall its an excellent product.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is simply the best I have ever used.  I spent most of my life using name brands, Old Spice, Right Guard, etc, always causing underarm irritation, and yellow shirts.  I switched to Herbal Clear for the past few years, but it only really worked for 4 or 5 hours, and I need to reapply.  If I had a presentation, I needed to keep on hand the old standby antiperspirants.  Jungleman keeps me stink free the whole day, even after a hard run and workout.  My workout clothes also do not stink as they did with Herbal Clear.  You still sweat, but no stench.  The smell of Jungleman is little to none.  Also, you only need apply one or two swipes, no more, so one stick lasts several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: So great I bought 3 more!</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have every used, and I say that because its natural, not an anti-perspirant, doesnt have horrible ingredients like aluminum, and IT WORKS REALLY WELL.&lt;br /&gt;I am a smelly sweaty guy who rides a bicycle to work to commute, I work in an office, go to meetings, ride a bicycle home and to do errands, and pretty much sweat all the time if I am in motion. I sweat a lot, i sweat on my computer mouse, I sweat while driving, I sweat a ton while playing drums and riding a bicycle,.....I think ive made the point that I sweat and smell all day.&lt;br /&gt;Ive used all the major name brand deordorants with problems. If I use NON-anti-perspirants: I get pit sweats and the deodorants wear off after several hours, so with cycling in the mix of getting around, its hard to reapply all the time, and the deodorant tends to melt and get all over the place in my cycling bags. If I use Anti_Perspirants: I dont sweat in my pits most of the time BUT I start to smell around my pits, and sometimes i sweat in rings around my pits. most anti-perspirants tend to irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;JUNGLEMAN does right for me. I put it on and I litterally dont smell ALL DAY. sometimes I dont have to reapply until every other day. when I use it, I sweat less in my pits, but it doesnt smell when I sweat. It doesnt leave marks on my shirts, it just works well.&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTES TO ALL:&lt;br /&gt;it is more like a solid stick deodorant. it doesnt go on easy. but considering how often you have to apply to get results, its not a hassle. Yes it goes on chalky, but you can rub it in with you fingers to make it invisible.&lt;br /&gt;BUY ONE AND TRY IT FIRST. luckily it works well for me, my girlfriend tried one of my spare sticks of jungleman and got rashes. NOT UNCOMMON. when i tried ARM &amp; HAMMER, i got a bad rash from the baking soda content, for some reason, jungleman has baking soda in it, but, doesnt irritate me UNLESS I re-apply 3 times a day. I did that once and got a noticeable itch. it works fine just a small amount once every or every other day. everyones body chemistry is different, so dont be suprised if it doesnt work for you.&lt;br /&gt;Love this deodorant, 4 natural Ingredients, and it works wonderfly.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal for a feminine woman like me. It has no odor, actually works at keeping me unscented, and is affordable. The only con is that you have to be wary of the white residue it leaves behind especially on dark clothing. Apply the deodorant AFTER you put your shirt on</li>
            <li> Some of you may like this and it may actually work, but I had such difficulty with application that I soon gave up on it.  It feels very dry and resists being rubbed on your skin.  I was never sure whether I actually managed to apply any to my underarms.  Unscented, by the way.</li>
            <li> Matches all the other deodorants without all chemicals. Have used for couple of weeks daily very satisfied will order again.</li>
            <li> Only deodorant I have ever found that actually works and does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin. Really great product. The unscented has tea tree oil which I think adds even more protection.</li>
            <li> This deodorant blew my mind the first day I used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to defeat most deodorants, and I am not fond of anti-perspirants.  No matter what I would wear, by the end of the day, my pits and shirts smelled pretty bad. I used Arm &amp; Hammer, Old Spice, Dove (what garbage Dove is), and Degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this once, I came home and did a pit check. I literally thought something was wrong with my sense of smell. As weird as this sounds, after having worked all day, I took large whiffs of my pits out of sheer disbelief because I literally could not detect odor! I mean there was just nothing, it smelled like emptiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is the fact that I can now protect my clothes from getting nasty pit stains and from permanently having that slight tinge under the pits, (that tinge that never goes away, even after thorough washings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a month, my body has learned to overcome the powerfulness of Jungleman, but only in the slightest way. Be careful when applying this if you do have a small scent of odor already (in a case where say maybe you weren&#x27;t able to shower for a day because of hiking, crashing at someone&#x27;s place, etc.). The odor may permanently stay with the stick and then future applications will not be as effective at blocking odor. You might realize you have odor right after application upon your next use. To prevent that, only apply after thoroughly washing your pits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can smell some odor after a day&#x27;s use, but it is like the slightest faintest funk and I can totally accept that. It is just a \\&quot;hey, yeah you went out today\\&quot; kind of tinge, but I mean I would rather that then smelling like a gym locker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small tip: I also use this in combination with other natural/light scented deodorants or cologne (since this smells like absolutely nothing). I have finally found the perfect balance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking it so far but juries still out. It does seem to kill the odor</li>
            <li> Better than anything made by any major brands and definitely the best natural option. I put this on in the morning, work all day, hit the gym, and I still don&#x27;t smell at the end of the day. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts like most conventional deoderants. The company owners are great people who are clearly invested in their customers. They will contact you directly and quickly if you have any questions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the performance of this deodorant. It does not irritate my skin, it controls odor well, and it has no harmful ingredients. The major drawback of this stuff is that if it gets too warm (e.g., after a hot shower), it will become extremely soft. The result is when the unsuspecting user sticks it beneath the arm, half the stick comes off and creates a massive, soupy mess. For that reason, I recommend spreading this with your fingers, and I would encourage Jungleman Naturals to package this product in a round, shallow &amp;#34;salve&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; container the way Truly&#x27;s does.</li>
            <li> I really thought jungleman was going to be \\&quot;the\\&quot; deodorant perfect for myself but apparently it wasn&#x27;t. I wouldn&#x27;t say is completely awful but is not  great either. I would apply jm everytime after i shower and 15 minutes later after just taking a walk i sweat under my arms ridicously. You should see when i workout. I also noticed a bit of bad odor also after a few hours have gone by. I don&#x27;t know if it only happens to me but this product aint really what i expected.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product and have never bought non-scented deodorant. Went on a little thick on the first use. Now that I apply it correctly, no complaints. Best all-natural deodorant I have ever purchased by far! I will never buy another.</li>
            <li> Wore it at work all day then came home and did some moving for about 2 hours.  Since we are selling our home.  During the peak of the sweat I smelled a slight odor.  Once I stopped for the day it went back to basically no odor.  I expect some odor when I sweat that much.  Overall is  excellent!</li>
            <li> Loved this deodorant. I took it with me to basic training and it seemed to work great and lasted me for two and a half months. However there are a couple of issues. It doesn&#x27;t spread on the skin the easiest and over time it develops small crystals on the surface that need to be removed or they can cut you. Even with those issues it is still the best natural deodorant I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;-Seems to protect well&lt;br /&gt;-All natural&lt;br /&gt;-Great customer service and shipping packaging (shipped with an ice pack so heat doesn&#x27;t effect it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t spread on the skin as easily as it&#x27;s non natural counterparts&lt;br /&gt;-develops small crystals on the surface that need to be removed&lt;br /&gt;-A bit pricey</li>
            <li> Keeps your underarm virtually scentless even in hot and humid summer conditions. Also, it does not irritate the skin at all. Contains mainly baking soda, and tea tree oil. It is kind of a clumpy, thick deodorant, but still worth trying for anyone sensitive to the aluminum and other crap they put in deodorants these days. Doesn&#x27;t seem to just cover up odor, but rather prevents its development in the first place which is great.</li>
            <li> The protection was there as well as no scent.  It was  bit rough to put on.  However, I am used to a gel and this is a solid.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, so most deodorants make me break out pretty bad, I&#x27;ve also had trouble getting any of them to work anyways.&lt;br /&gt;I eventually started using crystal deodorant, and it didn&#x27;t make me break out under my armpits, and kept me from smelling horrible. I usually smell horrible quick if I don&#x27;t use any deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product, and was skeptical, because I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, such as Toms, which didn&#x27;t work. Thanks to their website, I found out that the crystal deodorant I was using wasn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant went out dry and rough, not sure if I  had a reaction, or if it was friction burn, but I broke out under my pits, I kept using it anyways because it worked so well. I put it on at night after my shower, and stay stink free until the following night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through one stick and have another on the way. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, and it is very hard to find a product such as this in any store, including any of the all-natural stores.  I have been using this product for about three months, and I have never once had any issue with body odor whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two tips to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you might want to run this stick of deodorant under the running water of a sink before you apply it to your underarm, because if the stick is too dry, it can rip out your underarm hair.  Running it under water solves that problem completely though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, you want to make sure that the stick of deodorant does not stay in an area that is too hot when you are not using it, or it will melt into an unusable mush form.  I learned that the hard way when I left the stick of deodorant in my extremely hot car, and it melted the deodorant content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is definitely a great great product that is definitely worth the money, and worth trying out.  Thanks to whomever made this product.</li>
            <li> I formerly used the Burts Bees but this is better.  So far, this is the best I&#x27;ve found. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Within three days of use this product caused large, red and painful welts that took days to subside, for both my daughter and myself.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best of the organic deodorants that I have tried, it really does work.  Goes on a little rough as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I use it once daily and i don&#x27;t notice its on. I haven&#x27;t had to reapply it and i have to reapply the Degree Women&#x27;s 2 times a day from the store.  This is great product. It can get on clothes but comes off with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realized that even when i wash my clothes, this stuff doesn&#x27;t come off some materials.  It actually spreads out and leaves water looking white marks. I have the wash clothes a second time and it comes out after that. Kind of inconvenient.</li>
            <li> When I first found Jungleman deodorant I thought I hit the jackpot of all natural deodorants! I loved the simple ingredients and that it had no smell. It is the best I&#x27;ve ever used at preventing odor, not even the ones with aluminum worked as well as this has for me... But after a few weeks of using it my underarms started itching. I kept using it because it worked so well, but the itching has gotten worse. Now it&#x27;s to the point where I have a bumpy, red rash under my arms and it itches like crazy! I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any other deodorant so I was shocked that I had one to an all natural one. I&#x27;m so disappointed because it worked really well, and honestly I&#x27;d be willing to live with the itching and keep using it, if I didn&#x27;t have the rash, that&#x27;s how much I liked it. So I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it does work, I just can&#x27;t use it. Some have said that it might be a reaction to the baking soda.</li>
            <li> I changed to Jungleman after years of using other aluminum based antiperspirants/deodorants.  My undershirts no longer have the yellow grey staining that would happen with other brands despite careful laundering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works really well and only needs reapplication later in the day when you are sweating a great deal (tropical or desert conditions, no air conditioning or working out excessively).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is how it melts.  It is not a problem for the stick I have at home in the bathroom.  However, the stick that is in my gym bag will melt when the gym bag is in the trunk of the car during the day.  It still works when it solidifies again but it can be inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;ve used Dove for Men, Gilette for Men, Mitchum, and others like them and they all worked fine. I&#x27;ve been looking for a cruelty-free deodorant for about a year now to replace those.  I&#x27;ve tried all of the usual \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products out there (Tom&#x27;s, Desert Essence, Crystals, etc.) and none of them worked for longer than a few hours.  I waited before writing this review to be sure that my old product had completely worn off.  I can say for sure now that the unfortunately named Jungleman works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried for odour protection.  I&#x27;ve gone a full 24 hours with absolutely no hint of odour, and that has never happened before.  I do a check every day, and there is never any odour at all on me or my clothes.  This was never the case with my old stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does apply a little messy, but like I have done with all deodorants, I just let it sit while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth and hair and then wipe off the excess using a tissue.  It&#x27;s a little bit gritty when you first put it on too, but then it softens within a few minutes.  I&#x27;ve experimented with putting a few drops of jojoba on it before applying to make it softer, and so far it has been effective.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of going &amp;#34;All Natural&amp;#34; for a deodorant, but this didn&#x27;t work for me.  I guess you could say that I ended up smelling &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this isn&#x27;t the only all natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t work for me, as neither did the Tom&#x27;s brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it one star, as it didn&#x27;t do any harm, either.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for a deodorant more intense than the natural one I was using.  That was a mistake. This product has very simple ingredients, but those ingredients aren&#x27;t necessarily suitable for use on skin everyday. I was super excited when I received it. I did receive it quickly, so perhaps this company has stepped up it shipping process. I thought it was a miracle that a natural deodorant could keep me fresh for a day and half (if I were to shower in the morning and then sleep in the next day before showering again). I was ready to go to my local co-op and beg them to carry it. I told myself to wait to be cautious and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few days later I caught sight of my arm pits in the mirror and they were visibly darker. It almost looked like I didn&#x27;t shave. I thought, what&#x27;s a little vanity for effective deodorant. A couple days later I noticed that my skin was scaly, like a rash, and that there were little bumps on the under side of my upper arm where it was coming into contact with this deodorant. Also, I think this is why this deodorant stopped rubbing in well, my skin was just less skin like. I stopped use right there. It wasn&#x27;t worth skin issues! The whole point of using a natural deodorant is that it would be better for my body. I didn&#x27;t even make it seven days! I can&#x27;t imagine the damage it would do with prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was just me and my sensitive skin until I read other reviews. This product is mostly baking soda and baking soda is base. Skin has a pH around 5.4 - 5.9 and baking soda is about 8. Without any other acidic ingredients to pH balance it, I can see how this product would not be skin friendly. They might want to think about adding vinegar to pH balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR? This product works. It keeps you smelling nice and absorbs sweat to keep you dry, BUT this product has a high chance of drying out your skin, changing the color and texture, and giving you a rash. If youwant to avoid this I highly recommend the Earth Science Liken deodorant. It&#x27;s natural, skin friendly, and works for the day. You&#x27;ll have to reapply if you&#x27;re going out in the evening, or before bed if you want to stay sleep in cuddly nice for a significant other, but it&#x27;s worth it. You can also buy it in stores or on Amazon in discounted packs to save on shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male who&#x27;s used natural cosmetics for over 20 years.  I&#x27;ve tried probably every natural deodorant made.  This is the ONLY one that works 100%, is truly natural/non-toxic and completely unscented.  Most truly natural/non-toxic deodorants are NOT strong enough for a man and leave me stinky.  With Jungleman, I have no stink even at the end of the day, even after sweating, with no scent/perfume masking over me.  Their ingredients are great, truly natural with no imposture chemicals used by other brands.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by toxic natural-impostures like rock/liquid rock containing potassium alum which is neurotoxic aluminum and sticks containing propylene glycol which is an oxygen-starving toxin made from carcinogenic crude oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a year now. It&#x27;s awesome! You still sweat (as there are no crazy chemicals that clogg your pores) but you don&#x27;t smell and your shirts don&#x27;t turn yellow colors in the underarm area! For a natural product, exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;m now a regular. Just wish they would get on Amazon Prime. I&#x27;m getting really pissed paying shipping for every single piece even if I buy 4 at a time. This will get more annoying soon.</li>
            <li> my wife and I tried this out this week. We were both amazed that it lasted all day and nary a stink between us. This stuff really works! We were elated, however I noticed after the first day that my pits were red from irritation. It progressively got worse on day two. I did some research and found out my skin was reacting to the change in pH due to the baking soda and could get worse or infected. My wife&#x27;s skin has had no reaction to the pH. So she is blissfully continuing to use the deodorant. The bottom line is that this stuff knocks out the stink, but some people like myself may not be able to tolerate the main ingredient - baking soda.</li>
            <li> After many years in search of the perfect deodorant I finally found it!!! Non toxic, non smelling, non sticky, non wet and it works too!</li>
            <li> Both my son and I broke out horribly with this product. Used 1 day and thrown in the trash. Stick with Crystal Rock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these deodorants several times and they always melt.  Apparently the heat melts them in the box.  What a hassle.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how long I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant that actually works! Don&#x27;t be afraid of the unscented flavor. There is actually a slight sweet smell to it. I ride my bicycle 20 miles a day and never have to reapply. I dare say this works better than antiperspirants. GET THIS, you wont regret it. The shipping is great to, they included an icepack to make sure it got to me in good shape. I&#x27;ll be buying this for a life time if I can.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant because of all the rave reviews and most of the natural deodorants I tried haven&#x27;t been very effective. The deodorant application was below average because it was crumbly when I put it on and I had to rub it in. So far it has worked okay, although hasn&#x27;t been completely effective in eliminating odor. 3/5 stars - the ingredients are top notch but it doesn&#x27;t achieve complete odor elimination.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, WOW. I had no idea an all-natural deodorant could be so effective. The product does not have a scent, which means your skin is scent-neutral. It has lasted all day in my experience, and I ride my bike to and from school. I only started using it this autumn, so the results could possibly be different when I&#x27;m sweating heavily in summer. It has completely eliminated bodily scents, which is great. Further, after using this product (like one other reviewer said), I realized that smelly armpits of shirts were often because of deodorant, NOT body odor. Once I made the switch, my clothes smelled FAR less strongly than they had with my previous synthetic deodorant. Give this product a shot. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with anything except the company&#x27;s terrible choice of names.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine and it just doesn&#x27;t do the job. You can make it to the end of the day but there&#x27;s some spicy aroma there. Burt&#x27;s Bees works a bit better but it stains your undershirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was skeptical when I saw the name ~ it works. The major downside is the removal of your armpit hair. The deodorant stick catches your hair. In my book it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience for a spicy free day.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  Unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried with the same premise this stuff is by far the very best.  It lasted all day long too!!!  I don&#x27;t know how good it is when I perspire heavily after a run.  I&#x27;ll do an update as to how it did.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This deodorant/anti-perspirant is BY FAR the absolute best product I have ever used.  I have been a heavy sweater my whole life, and this works so well that the other day when doing heavy lawn work outside on a hot day, I looked at my shirt and noticed it was almost entirely wet and soaked, except for the arm pits.  And one of the best characteristics of it is that it has no odor, no perfume smell at all, and it washes completely clean in the shower.  So it&#x27;s not just covering over odor like some products, it is eliminating it.  And it&#x27;s also amazing that it&#x27;s all natural and contains so few ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please buy this product, tell others, and create a steady and growing demand for it so it doesn&#x27;t disappear or fail.  It&#x27;s worth every penny and then some.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service!  I am a woman that had literally tried about 7+ aluminum free deodorants with some smelly consequences.  I thought that I may have to go back to my old stuff until I found this.  By far the BEST NATURAL deodorant out there!  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and just because it is called &amp;#34;Jungleman&amp;#34; does NOT mean it is just for men.  I wanted something strong and effective and I have found it.  I have NO IDEA how it is done as the other &amp;#34;deodorant only&amp;#34; products out there did so little and this really helps you feel protected.  There is, on occasion, some wetness as this is not an antipersperant but it does not smell and is infinitely superior to all the other products I tried.  Also, the service has been outstanding and everything you would want from a seller.  My original order was damaged in shipping &amp; a replacement was sent no questions asked.  I am SO happy that this level of service is provided by this seller as I will be ordering regularly from him from here on out.  I am SO happy to have found a safe deodorant that actually works and with the customer service being so great, I am happy to give my once a month business (at minimum) to such a great company.  Thank you SO much for a great product &amp; amazing service!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfectly good deodorant, my only issue with it is that the stick itself is very dry. When I apply the deodorant, it rips out my underarm hair, which then sticks to the deodorant. It&#x27;s annoying.&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, I ordered this because my skin is sensitive to most deodorants (gets very itchy) and I was hoping this wouldn&#x27;t be as bad, and it definitely hasn&#x27;t been, I have no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I changed from L&#x27;Occitane because it was getting too expensive and didn&#x27;t last very long. Jungleman on the other hand lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t wreck my shirts, and is overall a great product. The only bad thing about it is that it is not always the easiest to put on - the stick is very rough and dry and can hurt when applying it.</li>
            <li> As a few other reviewers noted, it worked for me at first, too. I gave it 5 stars. However, after a few weeks, I noticed that the product started producing a distinct unpleasant musky smell on its own. This had not been there at the beginning. I tried a new one and the same thing happened. I am puzzled since almost every reviewer said the product is odorless (one said it had \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; smell). I wonder if it is due to the tea tree oil ingredient since I find the smell of green tea unappealing, too (although I do not know if tea tree oil has a similar smell). Perhaps it works for most but, unfortunately, it did not for me.</li>
            <li> From the rave reviews...I really was expecting a superior product.  It&#x27;s not.  I was hoping to find something I could recommend to my hubby - not this product.  There are better deodorants available.</li>
            <li> Good product, no irritation with it.  There are not a lot of deodorants out there that will not irritate sensitized skin, this works as advertised.</li>
            <li> For those of us who can&#x27;t wear antiperspirant/deodorant because of the aluminum, or whatever makes us break out in a rash, this deodorant is heaven sent. I tried a couple of other organic deodorants and had very little success. Basically, they worked for part of the day, but eventually the underarm smell broke through. Now, everyone&#x27;s different, so maybe I&#x27;m just a little tougher customer, but, I&#x27;ve been using Jungleman for over a month now and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet! It&#x27;s odorless, and blocks your body odor as well. Of course, it doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat, but after I developed the aluminum allergy a few years ago, I&#x27;m thinking we shouldn&#x27;t be putting things on our bodies that stop us from sweating, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a life-changer. Do yourself a favor and try it out!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, despite the name, it works great for WOMEN, too!!</li>
            <li> This product works great. It doesn&#x27;t take much to combat odor all day, so my first stick is lasting a long time. It doesn&#x27;t prevent you from sweating, so your body can do its natural thing, but it totally eliminates odor. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars, however, the downfall is when it is hot it melts and when put in the fridge, it gets too hard therefore \\&quot;not too hot, not too cold\\&quot; type of product. If it wears off, do not expect your armpits not to smell, put some more (before it is too late)! From my experience, my armpits have lasted 13 hours without smelling (by that time I needed to apply more). I did not buy this product to stop sweat, but to stop the odor. Other products I have bought was to stop the odor but it tended to make me sweat (not so anti perspiring) and stink more, thus far I do not sweat or stink. This review is from someone who hardly sweats but tends to sweat when nearing/during my menstrual cycle (everything gets accelerated, [growth of hair, sweating, etc]). I tried it, during the end of my menstrual cycle and it seemed to work, I will update next month if I am wrong. Also, sorry for too much information.</li>
            <li> It is 100% natural, with no toxic chemicals or perfume and the best of all: it will keep you dry and fresh all day! I am 30 year old man and very satisfied customer from Slovenia (the only disadvantage is that shipping for two sticks costs 10€). But it&#x27;s worth it! I am still using the first one that I ordered in december 2012 and I am using it every day.</li>
            <li> My man has allergies too all over the counter deodorants.  He works hard, and needed some help.  I went on line, and found Jungle Man , it works ,and doesn&#x27;t bother him at all.</li>
