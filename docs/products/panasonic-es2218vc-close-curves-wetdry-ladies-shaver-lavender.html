            <li>it is nice.  </li>
            <li>The bikini attachment was excellent too and it too gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li>The bikini option does a really nice job as well.  </li>
            <li>I use a Wahl beard and mustache trimmer with a guard now that works perfectly, so that really wasn&#x27;t anything I anticipated</li>
            <li>I use a Wahl beard and mustache trimmer with a guard now that works perfectly, so that really wasn&#x27;t anything I anticipated using.    </li>
            <li>It is a good product, value for money and easy for even teens to use.</li>
            <li>If you have any kind of condition that gives you thicker hair growth, this shaver is OK.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable pivot on this one is great, it really hugs the curves nicely.</li>
            <li>It also has the easy clean up and is great in the shower.</li>
            <li>At first, this was a great shaver.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have owned many shavers-but I will never order Panasonic again.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this product except the head tends to scratch.  </li>
            <li>Love the pivoting head...</li>
            <li>The reviews I read online of this Panasonic model were mostly favorable, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I am able to shave my legs, underarms and bikini area in one use.  </li>
            <li>It stays standing upright better than both of my Remington stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shave is not as close as you would get with a razor, but then, you can just shave more often.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an OK razor.</li>
            <li>I also love the pop up bikini shaver.</li>
            <li>I mostly bought it for pubic shaving, and it works quite well for that, since I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>Much better than the Remington shaver it replaced.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get a real super close shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for what I need it for.</li>
            <li>I think the best feature was that it could be used both wet/ dry.     </li>
            <li>Well this razor is better than my last one but still not as good as my husbands electric razor!</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, I&#x27;m sure it will do the job just fine.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to hold and</li>
            <li>My hair grows very quickly</li>
            <li>, I love it, now i&#x27;m starting to forget to shave lol.</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed that this product did actually give the close shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am so far very pleased with the razor and think I will like it more than my Remington shavers.  </li>
            <li>works great for underarms and back of knees!</li>
            <li>the adjustable floating head comfortably fits into the contours of my leg to shave close.   </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great razors and last for years.  </li>
            <li>so I am not getting that smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>I have fewer ingrown hairs to deal with and it leaves a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>and I could still never get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different electric shavers and knowing that none will give you as close a shave as a razor, this is by far the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>Electric shavers have improved a great deal since the last time I used one!!  </li>
            <li>I find it easy to recharge and to clean.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about it but does not make my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a great electric shaver, I have No bad news about the product at all, actually I bought it for my Mother</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied so far.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>It does an adequate job, and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>On August 1, 2007, I mailed the razor in it&#x27;s original carton, with sales receipt, to the service address indicated in the product paperwork.</li>
            <li>I also like that you can just run it under the faucet to clean the hairs off when you are done using it.  </li>
            <li>I also get a better shave, in that I can see my legs the whole time I am shaving.</li>
            <li>The shave is not as close as a blade or depilatory product, but it&#x27;s good enough for every day.</li>
            <li>It is not a close shave by any means but is good enough for her.</li>
            <li>I have used it for the last month and must say that I am delighted with this product.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, just kind of in the middle of the road compromise to get that shave, even if not as easily as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as close as a razor, but still good enough for quick shaves.</li>
            <li>super close razor shaves as I break out.  </li>
            <li>According to the instructions, the shave should get closer over the first three weeks of use; however, the shave out of the box is a smooth one</li>
            <li>This shaver cuts very very close without giving me any fear it going to cut me!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am so far very pleased with the razor and think I will like it more than my Remington shavers.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my wife and she barley used the device attempting to make it last; the unit still looks new out of the box and its DEAD.I can&#x27;t believe this PANASONIC died with minumim use and Panasonic is suppose to make a great product however I don&#x27;t think so and could and would not recomend their product.</li>
            <li>and she says she really likes it and does the Job just fine.</li>
            <li>This version has a few more features like a multi-tilt head that make it more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>No matter how lightly I pressed with the Remington, I would still get razor burn as if I had shaved with a real razor.  </li>
            <li>For instance, the head is larger which I liked but for some reason the edges on the razor&#x27;s head are noticeable when you shave.</li>
            <li>Included attachment for trimming \\&quot;longer hair\\&quot; is useful.</li>
            <li>The shaver head moves in so many directions that it stays in contact with your skin better than other shavers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just got one that wasn&#x27;t assembled right.</li>
            <li>Why do they continually come out with new and better men&#x27;s razors but they have yet to make one decent women&#x27;s razor!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s working fine and doing the job.</li>
            <li>My wife likes this for in between regular shaves as it is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>In the first few weeks, I loved this shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is a necessary, convenient device that I cannot do without and on top of that, it looks pretty sitting on the counter(I bought the lavender).</li>
            <li>I never got a close shave, no matter how many times I went over the same area</li>
            <li>However, this one comes pretty close.  </li>
            <li>It gives a pretty close shave without leaving my skin irritated or feeling \\&quot;scraped\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>first, Panasonic&#x27;s webpage claims this razor has the sharpest blades (based on a 2004 comparison</li>
            <li>shaver sucks, reviews from others were great, but shaver doesn&#x27;t work, wish i could return it</li>
            <li>This razor has provided me with a clean shave and allows me to shave frequently without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You still can&#x27;t beat a regular blade, it&#x27;s not as good as regular razor.  </li>
            <li>OK, this is fine, except unless you are keeping close track of your minutes used, it will suddenly die in the middle of a shave.</li>
            <li>It worked OK but charges never lasted very long.  </li>
            <li>Fast, close(ish) shave, quiet, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good, not as close as the other method, but close enough that you can&#x27;t see anything.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great little shaver, and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li>It shaves  very closely without a hint of irritation.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always \\&quot;ready to use,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This shaver does a reasonable job of removing hair.  </li>
            <li>The rotating head really serves no function.</li>
            <li>I was always borrowing my DH&#x27;s Norelco, much to his dismay.  </li>
            <li>Well, it is much quieter than my Remington razors.  </li>
            <li>It is just a nylon bag that really doesn&#x27;t protect it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>do really like the pivoting head, though.  </li>
            <li>I was undecided whether that would really make a difference, since I&#x27;d never had one that pivoted before.  </li>
            <li>Well, it really does make it easier to shave around your knees and ankles.  </li>
            <li>Hey, maybe it&#x27;s me, but nothing seems to shave real close.</li>
            <li>The one thing that really improved is it does shave leg hairs easier and closer.</li>
            <li>Although it is not the absolute closeness of a razor, it is darned close.  </li>
            <li>(I purchased the lavendar) and holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all who took the time to review this product and helped make my decision to purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver because I wanted a quick &amp; easy way to shave without a bunch of mess.</li>
            <li>There is a plastic roller between the two blades which makes the levels between them uneven and gives you a very stubbly shave instead of a clean smooth one.</li>
            <li>This works better than any other women&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic is better than any other electric she has had to date</li>
            <li>Dry is easy and faster.</li>
            <li>and I often use it in place of my standard rasor just because it&#x27;s more comfortable to shave sitting down!</li>
            <li>The same is true of when I shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My 5-year-old Remington shaver with a used blade gave me a smoother shave than this brand new, never-been-used shaver!</li>
            <li>There is no need to buy a more expensive model, this Panasonic is \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot;  at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>This shaver is better than the more expensive one I used to have.</li>
            <li>This is decent.  </li>
            <li>It is only two years old and lightly used.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, though you have to be a little bit careful to make sure both ends snap on.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the lack of irritation on longer hairs and in tight spots such as under the arms.  </li>
            <li>have not tried the bikini trimmer yet, as I am a little nervous to, after reading how many people had issues with it.  </li>
            <li>I much preferred my old shaver, which never scratched.</li>
            <li>My last two electric razors have been Remington, the most recent being the one with the gold foil for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and it worked OK as long as you took a lot of extra time going over your legs twice.  </li>
            <li>I definitely think this product is worth the price paid and would recommend it for purchase for those who want the convenience and safety of an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver and was pleased with it until the trimmer blade broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I love the closeness of a straight razor shave, but now have issues trying to bend to reach due to back issues.  </li>
            <li>Many people purchase an electric razor expecting it to shave as close as a standard razor and that&#x27;s not realistic.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and cannot use anything but an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and need to use an electric razor on my underarms to avoid razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Also I have been using this in the shower and find that it takes a great deal longer to shave with this than it did the other way, although from what I hear, once you are used to it, it actually takes less time.</li>
            <li>The first shaver-stopped charging after only 3 months.  </li>
            <li>, I wished it was more recent) and the fact that the replacement blades for my Venus razor seem to get more expensive each time I purchase them.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t decided if using it wet with lather works better than dry.</li>
            <li>of the reviews I saw talked about how loud this razor is and to never use it when you have company.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and the eyes just aren&#x27;t what they used to be.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet, but I like it just fine used dry.</li>
            <li>I had to keep going over &amp; over the same spot repeatedly, it irritated my skin almost immediately, and it was very loud.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product after a knee injury because I couldn&#x27;t bend my knee or stand in the shower long enough to shave with a real razor.</li>
            <li>Regular razors did give me a close shave but always caused irritation to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s barely anything there</li>
            <li>I have been using electric razors for years due to very sensitive skin &amp; thought I would try something new.</li>
            <li>This one is not irritating, and does a reasonable cutting job, far better than past razors.  </li>
            <li>With the pivoting head, I no long nick the raised scar on my leg.</li>
            <li>It takes work though to really trim that hair down.  </li>
            <li>This electric shaver doesn&#x27;t shave as close as previous reviews that I read, but I can&#x27;t complain too much - while I still feel stubbly</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very smooth, close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have owned many shavers-but I will never order Panasonic again.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product except the head tends to scratch.  </li>
            <li> Love the pivoting head...</li>
            <li> The reviews I read online of this Panasonic model were mostly favorable, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I am able to shave my legs, underarms and bikini area in one use.  </li>
            <li> It stays standing upright better than both of my Remington stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shave is not as close as you would get with a razor, but then, you can just shave more often.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s an OK razor.</li>
            <li> I also love the pop up bikini shaver.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought it for pubic shaving, and it works quite well for that, since I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> Much better than the Remington shaver it replaced.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get a real super close shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> I think the best feature was that it could be used both wet/ dry.     </li>
            <li> Well this razor is better than my last one but still not as good as my husbands electric razor!</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, I&#x27;m sure it will do the job just fine.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to hold and</li>
            <li> My hair grows very quickly</li>
            <li> , I love it, now i&#x27;m starting to forget to shave lol.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed that this product did actually give the close shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am so far very pleased with the razor and think I will like it more than my Remington shavers.  </li>
            <li> works great for underarms and back of knees!</li>
            <li> the adjustable floating head comfortably fits into the contours of my leg to shave close.   </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great razors and last for years.  </li>
            <li> so I am not getting that smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> I have fewer ingrown hairs to deal with and it leaves a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> and I could still never get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different electric shavers and knowing that none will give you as close a shave as a razor, this is by far the best I have used.  </li>
            <li> Electric shavers have improved a great deal since the last time I used one!!  </li>
            <li> I find it easy to recharge and to clean.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about it but does not make my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric shaver, I have No bad news about the product at all, actually I bought it for my Mother</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied so far.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> It does an adequate job, and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> On August 1, 2007, I mailed the razor in it&#x27;s original carton, with sales receipt, to the service address indicated in the product paperwork.</li>
            <li> I also like that you can just run it under the faucet to clean the hairs off when you are done using it.  </li>
            <li> I also get a better shave, in that I can see my legs the whole time I am shaving.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as close as a blade or depilatory product, but it&#x27;s good enough for every day.</li>
            <li> It is not a close shave by any means but is good enough for her.</li>
            <li> I have used it for the last month and must say that I am delighted with this product.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, just kind of in the middle of the road compromise to get that shave, even if not as easily as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor, but still good enough for quick shaves.</li>
            <li> super close razor shaves as I break out.  </li>
            <li> According to the instructions, the shave should get closer over the first three weeks of use; however, the shave out of the box is a smooth one</li>
            <li> This shaver cuts very very close without giving me any fear it going to cut me!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am so far very pleased with the razor and think I will like it more than my Remington shavers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and she barley used the device attempting to make it last; the unit still looks new out of the box and its DEAD.I can&#x27;t believe this PANASONIC died with minumim use and Panasonic is suppose to make a great product however I don&#x27;t think so and could and would not recomend their product.</li>
            <li> and she says she really likes it and does the Job just fine.</li>
            <li> This version has a few more features like a multi-tilt head that make it more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> No matter how lightly I pressed with the Remington, I would still get razor burn as if I had shaved with a real razor.  </li>
            <li> For instance, the head is larger which I liked but for some reason the edges on the razor&#x27;s head are noticeable when you shave.</li>
            <li> Included attachment for trimming \\&quot;longer hair\\&quot; is useful.</li>
            <li> The shaver head moves in so many directions that it stays in contact with your skin better than other shavers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got one that wasn&#x27;t assembled right.</li>
            <li> Why do they continually come out with new and better men&#x27;s razors but they have yet to make one decent women&#x27;s razor!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s working fine and doing the job.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this for in between regular shaves as it is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> In the first few weeks, I loved this shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is a necessary, convenient device that I cannot do without and on top of that, it looks pretty sitting on the counter(I bought the lavender).</li>
            <li> I never got a close shave, no matter how many times I went over the same area</li>
            <li> However, this one comes pretty close.  </li>
            <li> It gives a pretty close shave without leaving my skin irritated or feeling \\&quot;scraped\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> first, Panasonic&#x27;s webpage claims this razor has the sharpest blades (based on a 2004 comparison</li>
            <li> shaver sucks, reviews from others were great, but shaver doesn&#x27;t work, wish i could return it</li>
            <li> This razor has provided me with a clean shave and allows me to shave frequently without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You still can&#x27;t beat a regular blade, it&#x27;s not as good as regular razor.  </li>
            <li> OK, this is fine, except unless you are keeping close track of your minutes used, it will suddenly die in the middle of a shave.</li>
            <li> It worked OK but charges never lasted very long.  </li>
            <li> Fast, close(ish) shave, quiet, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, not as close as the other method, but close enough that you can&#x27;t see anything.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great little shaver, and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> It shaves  very closely without a hint of irritation.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always \\&quot;ready to use,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This shaver does a reasonable job of removing hair.  </li>
            <li> The rotating head really serves no function.</li>
            <li> I was always borrowing my DH&#x27;s Norelco, much to his dismay.  </li>
            <li> Well, it is much quieter than my Remington razors.  </li>
            <li> It is just a nylon bag that really doesn&#x27;t protect it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> do really like the pivoting head, though.  </li>
            <li> I was undecided whether that would really make a difference, since I&#x27;d never had one that pivoted before.  </li>
            <li> Well, it really does make it easier to shave around your knees and ankles.  </li>
            <li> Hey, maybe it&#x27;s me, but nothing seems to shave real close.</li>
            <li> The one thing that really improved is it does shave leg hairs easier and closer.</li>
            <li> Although it is not the absolute closeness of a razor, it is darned close.  </li>
            <li> (I purchased the lavendar) and holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to all who took the time to review this product and helped make my decision to purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because I wanted a quick &amp; easy way to shave without a bunch of mess.</li>
            <li> There is a plastic roller between the two blades which makes the levels between them uneven and gives you a very stubbly shave instead of a clean smooth one.</li>
            <li> This works better than any other women&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic is better than any other electric she has had to date</li>
            <li> Dry is easy and faster.</li>
            <li> and I often use it in place of my standard rasor just because it&#x27;s more comfortable to shave sitting down!</li>
            <li> The same is true of when I shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My 5-year-old Remington shaver with a used blade gave me a smoother shave than this brand new, never-been-used shaver!</li>
            <li> There is no need to buy a more expensive model, this Panasonic is \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot;  at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This shaver is better than the more expensive one I used to have.</li>
            <li> This is decent.  </li>
            <li> It is only two years old and lightly used.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily, though you have to be a little bit careful to make sure both ends snap on.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the lack of irritation on longer hairs and in tight spots such as under the arms.  </li>
            <li> have not tried the bikini trimmer yet, as I am a little nervous to, after reading how many people had issues with it.  </li>
            <li> I much preferred my old shaver, which never scratched.</li>
            <li> My last two electric razors have been Remington, the most recent being the one with the gold foil for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and it worked OK as long as you took a lot of extra time going over your legs twice.  </li>
            <li> I definitely think this product is worth the price paid and would recommend it for purchase for those who want the convenience and safety of an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver and was pleased with it until the trimmer blade broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I love the closeness of a straight razor shave, but now have issues trying to bend to reach due to back issues.  </li>
            <li> Many people purchase an electric razor expecting it to shave as close as a standard razor and that&#x27;s not realistic.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot use anything but an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and need to use an electric razor on my underarms to avoid razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Also I have been using this in the shower and find that it takes a great deal longer to shave with this than it did the other way, although from what I hear, once you are used to it, it actually takes less time.</li>
            <li> The first shaver-stopped charging after only 3 months.  </li>
            <li> , I wished it was more recent) and the fact that the replacement blades for my Venus razor seem to get more expensive each time I purchase them.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t decided if using it wet with lather works better than dry.</li>
            <li> of the reviews I saw talked about how loud this razor is and to never use it when you have company.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and the eyes just aren&#x27;t what they used to be.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet, but I like it just fine used dry.</li>
            <li> I had to keep going over &amp; over the same spot repeatedly, it irritated my skin almost immediately, and it was very loud.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after a knee injury because I couldn&#x27;t bend my knee or stand in the shower long enough to shave with a real razor.</li>
            <li> Regular razors did give me a close shave but always caused irritation to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s barely anything there</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for years due to very sensitive skin &amp; thought I would try something new.</li>
            <li> This one is not irritating, and does a reasonable cutting job, far better than past razors.  </li>
            <li> With the pivoting head, I no long nick the raised scar on my leg.</li>
            <li> It takes work though to really trim that hair down.  </li>
            <li> This electric shaver doesn&#x27;t shave as close as previous reviews that I read, but I can&#x27;t complain too much - while I still feel stubbly</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after it has charged the light should turn green and not stay red.  </li>
            <li> I have started holding the shaver rotated so taht its dorsal side faces teh skin ( the opposite of the natural ergonomic position to hold), coz that gives me a slightly less stubbly shave.</li>
            <li> Works well dry and wet for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So, short term this is five stars but long term</li>
            <li> Charge doenst last long inspite of what they claim.</li>
            <li> The cut doesn&#x27;t last as long as a razor either.</li>
            <li> It is long enough that even with Arthritis, you can reach all over your body.</li>
            <li> After a few years of reliable use I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this razor dry up to this point</li>
            <li> With this razor you are able to feel that you have shaved every bit of skin without worrying about cutting yourself.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin and past electrics always scraped her.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this shave due to the mixed reviews, but decided to give it a chance for two reasons-</li>
            <li> and I have stopped getting razor burn and ingrown hairs, and the razor is not loud!  </li>
            <li> so I can buy a new one without feeling too guilty of buying a new shaver so soon!</li>
            <li> I use it dry for my bikini area and under arms.</li>
            <li> should you use it dry.  </li>
            <li> Shaving dry did not work either as it scratched my skin.</li>
            <li> This razor worked well for only a few months and then suddenly stopped.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because of the tiny bit of scratching and the very slight razor burn.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because of the tiny bit of scratching and the very slight razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister-in-law who is a stroke victim and cannot use her dominant hand.</li>
            <li> For me it was the choice of a close shave, with a red rash or what I have with this shaver, perhaps not quite as close, but good enough and no rash, which is not attractive and is painful.  </li>
            <li> However as it got older it shaved more slowly until it barely worked (&#x3D;pulled hair painfully) after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Not a big problem, just something of a pain to be half shaved when it dies.     </li>
            <li> I thought I wanted to buy a different brand, but after reading previous reviews, I decided to give this shaver a try.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous that something like this would last such a short time.</li>
            <li> But really there is no need to press very hard at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My last one finally died after at least 5 years of use.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot comment on how it performs wet.  </li>
            <li> have only been using this Panasonic razor for less than a month, but I have already noticed significantly less razor burn.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is really slow, took long time to shave her legs.</li>
            <li> She has not used the other feature of the shaver as she does not need too.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to other people.</li>
            <li> I sometimes press a little harder on my legs to try to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> It does last through at least fives shaves before I could tell it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she uses it but likes her old one which was broken.</li>
            <li> With my Remington shaver, sometimes i would shave everyday or every other day.</li>
            <li> I owned the previous model of this shaver.  </li>
            <li> &amp; so I gave up after about half an hour of trying.  </li>
            <li> This gets the job done in half the time.  </li>
            <li> Not as close of a shave but little irritation.</li>
            <li> You can change it from pivoting a lot to just a little.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my Panasonic Shaver for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of $$$ and time...</li>
            <li> We are working towards going green, and decided that I would switch to an electric razor in an attempt to save the landfill space (and our cash) from all of those disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> I tried it a few times with and without cream and soap and whatever else I could think of.</li>
            <li> only real complaint is that the little green strip that goes in between the foil can scratch a little if you&#x27;re pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> , at least people can&#x27;t see that there is stubble left behind.</li>
            <li> Wife has never really liked electric razors, but likes safety razors and shaving soap even less.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what the problem is, but if the blades get blunt after just 3 shaves, then I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The fact that I wear glasses and can&#x27;t see in the shower well enough to shave close, and that I have an uncomfortable shower for shaving, forces me to look at alternatives.  </li>
            <li> Another issue, though small, is the travel pouch it comes in.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty disapointed with the product and will go back to my boring shavers.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem was, but I tossed it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it a lot as I usually shave w/a blade.  </li>
            <li> Spring of 2007 I got a Remington and was very unhappy with it, as it caused much skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to do that in the tub, and I always would end up with some part of my leg not shaved.</li>
            <li> If I press too hard, it will still cause it.  </li>
            <li> She has an ongoing problem with facial hair and it became impossible for me to remove the hair with tweezers or depilatories</li>
            <li> Was pretty disappointed, I do not get a close shave at ALL!</li>
            <li> (I try to get that delicate balance between razor burn and closeness!)  </li>
            <li> It does give a close shave without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> This was never a great product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it stopped working well after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Not excellent.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the razor breaking but was even more disappointed with the God awful customer service from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This razor gave me a horrible shave (wet using a soothing lather).</li>
            <li> I bought this after a disappointing experience with the Remington women&#x27;s electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I was also sick of the razor burn on my bikini line, as well as the ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> BAD IDEA!     </li>
            <li> Hate it!</li>
            <li> I hated to shave!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using my Panasonic Shaver for a few months now.  I have very sensitive skin and cannot use anything but an electric razor.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the performance and results.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have owned many shavers-but I will never order Panasonic again. The first shaver-stopped charging after only 3 months.  The second replacement shaver-the metal shaver pieces inside broke.</li>
            <li> In the first few weeks, I loved this shaver.  However as it got older it shaved more slowly until it barely worked (&#x3D;pulled hair painfully) after a few months.  So, short term this is five stars but long term it&#x27;s one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to use it for a long time. Unfortunately, it stopped working well after 3 uses. The shaver would slide across the skin but all the hair would still be intact. I am not sure what the problem is, but if the blades get blunt after just 3 shaves, then I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with a rechargeable electric shaver so I could stop adding to landfills. I love it! With the pivoting head, I no long nick the raised scar on my leg. I also get a better shave, in that I can see my legs the whole time I am shaving. It&#x27;s hard to do that in the tub, and I always would end up with some part of my leg not shaved. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product except the head tends to scratch.  When I touch it with my hand I don&#x27;t find pointed parts or anything, but when I shave my legs it definitely scratches me.  Otherwise, it has a wonderful close shave.  Love the pivoting head...works great for underarms and back of knees!</li>
            <li> The name of Panasonic&#x27;s Wet/Dry Electric Shaver for women \\&quot;CLOSE CURVES\\&quot; perfectly describes this wonderful tool.  It shaves  very closely without a hint of irritation.  This is a necessary, convenient device that I cannot do without and on top of that, it looks pretty sitting on the counter(I bought the lavender).</li>
            <li> I owned the previous model of this shaver.  After a few years of reliable use I needed a new one.  I didn&#x27;t consider another brand.  My mom stayed for Christmas and after using it she had to buy one too.  It stays powered up in the charging cradle so it&#x27;s always \\&quot;ready to use,\\&quot; it&#x27;s easy to hold and the adjustable floating head comfortably fits into the contours of my leg to shave close.   There is no need to buy a more expensive model, this Panasonic is \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot;  at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after she was diagnosed and operated for stage two breast cancer. Shaver seems to work well but only time will tell if the battery holds up. Will update in 6 months after it has been used for awhile.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she uses it but likes her old one which was broken. the only thing is really slow, took long time to shave her legs.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Panasonic wet/dry razor i&#x27;ve purchased.  They&#x27;re great razors and last for years.  My last one finally died after at least 5 years of use.  This version has a few more features like a multi-tilt head that make it more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric shaver, I have No bad news about the product at all, actually I bought it for my Mother and she says she really likes it and does the Job just fine. She has not used the other feature of the shaver as she does not need too. I am even thinking of purchasing one.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for years due to very sensitive skin &amp; thought I would try something new. The reviews I read online of this Panasonic model were mostly favorable, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  BAD IDEA!     This razor gave me a horrible shave (wet using a soothing lather). I had to keep going over &amp; over the same spot repeatedly, it irritated my skin almost immediately, and it was very loud.  I never got a close shave, no matter how many times I went over the same area &amp; so I gave up after about half an hour of trying.  My 5-year-old Remington shaver with a used blade gave me a smoother shave than this brand new, never-been-used shaver!</li>
            <li> My wife likes this for in between regular shaves as it is quick and easy. Not as close of a shave but little irritation.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and she barley used the device attempting to make it last; the unit still looks new out of the box and its DEAD.I can&#x27;t believe this PANASONIC died with minumim use and Panasonic is suppose to make a great product however I don&#x27;t think so and could and would not recomend their product. What a waste of $$$ and time...</li>
            <li> This razor shaves great. I have very senitive skin and this razor was perfect. The head pivots so it reaches all parts of the leg. I would recommend this razor to other people.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a reasonable job of removing hair.  However, it feels like it is scratching my legs.  It doesn&#x27;t actually break the skin, but it does leave white streaks that last for several minutes after shaving.  I much preferred my old shaver, which never scratched.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, value for money and easy for even teens to use.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time in the shower. Not as close as a razor, but still good enough for quick shaves.</li>
            <li> This razor is nice for what it does.  I was a waxer so I am not getting that smooth finish.  For a ladies wet/dry it is nice.  A good price.  My only complaint is that after it has charged the light should turn green and not stay red.  It does last through at least fives shaves before I could tell it needed to be charged again.</li>
            <li> I found this shaver to be excellent; skin is very smooth, burn-free and comfortable after each use.  This is the best ladies&#x27; shaver I have ever purchased and would recommend without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Many people purchase an electric razor expecting it to shave as close as a standard razor and that&#x27;s not realistic.  However, this one comes pretty close.  The fact that I wear glasses and can&#x27;t see in the shower well enough to shave close, and that I have an uncomfortable shower for shaving, forces me to look at alternatives.  This shaver works great for touching up areas I missed and I often use it in place of my standard rasor just because it&#x27;s more comfortable to shave sitting down!</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed that this product did actually give the close shave it boasted- shaved just as close as my Venus, and  without the razor bumps and burn as well as the $$ it cost for venus refills. The bikini attachment was excellent too and it too gives a really close shave. I think the best feature was that it could be used both wet/ dry.     However, i&#x27;ve now been using it for about four months and one of the blades just fell off. It&#x27;s the blade from the pop-up trimmer part of the thing but it no longer works without this part. Not a big problem, I thought, until of course I found out that they make no replacements for this part. I&#x27;ve even checked the Panasonic site and there is nothing of the sort. All I find is replacement inner blades and replacement foil but no outer trimmer blades. Such a shame too, this was actually a great product. But seeing as I got only about 4 months use out of it, I doubt I&#x27;ll be getting another panasonic.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a joke. The rotating head really serves no function. There is a plastic roller between the two blades which makes the levels between them uneven and gives you a very stubbly shave instead of a clean smooth one. You have to go over and over the same section and you still can&#x27;t get rid of the stubble. Charge doenst last long inspite of what they claim. I have started holding the shaver rotated so taht its dorsal side faces teh skin ( the opposite of the natural ergonomic position to hold), coz that gives me a slightly less stubbly shave. I will be happy when this shaver conks off so I can buy a new one without feeling too guilty of buying a new shaver so soon! Hate it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after a great deal of research.  We are working towards going green, and decided that I would switch to an electric razor in an attempt to save the landfill space (and our cash) from all of those disposable razors.  It works pretty good, not as close as the other method, but close enough that you can&#x27;t see anything.  Also I have been using this in the shower and find that it takes a great deal longer to shave with this than it did the other way, although from what I hear, once you are used to it, it actually takes less time.</li>
            <li> This shaver is better than the more expensive one I used to have. It gives a pretty close shave without leaving my skin irritated or feeling \\&quot;scraped\\&quot;. Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but none of them do. If you want perfect silky smoothness, stick to razors. (and cuts and nicks and bumps...) The adjustable pivot on this one is great, it really hugs the curves nicely. Overall, it&#x27;s a great little shaver, and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because I wanted a quick &amp; easy way to shave without a bunch of mess. It fills the bill. I like that it&#x27;s 100% immersible, so I can use it in the shower. The shave is not as close as a blade or depilatory product, but it&#x27;s good enough for every day.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair on my legs.  My hair grows very quickly so I have to shave every day.  Regular razors did give me a close shave but always caused irritation to my sensitive skin.  This razor has provided me with a clean shave and allows me to shave frequently without any irritation.  I also have a problem with ingrown hairs and since using this razor I have noticed a decrease.  The bikini option does a really nice job as well.  I have only used this razor dry up to this point so I cannot comment on how it performs wet.  I keep mine on charge and only pull it off when in use...I am able to shave my legs, underarms and bikini area in one use.  I would definately recommend this product to others and when this one needs to be replaced I will purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. It is her 1st razor. It is not a close shave by any means but is good enough for her. We&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now and it is still holding up so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Just as good as a razor! The only problem is if you&#x27;re trying to get into nooks and cranies this is too bulky for that. The cut doesn&#x27;t last as long as a razor either. I use it dry for my bikini area and under arms. I have fewer ingrown hairs to deal with and it leaves a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This works better than any other women&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  It does give a close shave without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> This product does not shave well and it scratches the skin should you use it dry.  I tried it a few times with and without cream and soap and whatever else I could think of. It just does not work well.  Shaving dry did not work either as it scratched my skin.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this shave due to the mixed reviews, but decided to give it a chance for two reasons- first, Panasonic&#x27;s webpage claims this razor has the sharpest blades (based on a 2004 comparison, I wished it was more recent) and the fact that the replacement blades for my Venus razor seem to get more expensive each time I purchase them.  I was also sick of the razor burn on my bikini line, as well as the ingrown hairs.  I am very satisfied so far.  According to the instructions, the shave should get closer over the first three weeks of use; however, the shave out of the box is a smooth one and I have stopped getting razor burn and ingrown hairs, and the razor is not loud!  I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Although I prefer a non-electric razor with shaving cream for my legs, there are times &amp; places when that is not practical.  I was always borrowing my DH&#x27;s Norelco, much to his dismay.  Spring of 2007 I got a Remington and was very unhappy with it, as it caused much skin irritation.  I thought I had left it somewhere on a trip and considered it a bit of fortune to be rid of the thing.    Came on to Amazon, and got the Panasonic ES2218VC, based in part on the comments here. Very pleased with the lack of irritation on longer hairs and in tight spots such as under the arms.  The flexibility of the head and the attachment over the razor head keep the blades from nicking &amp; causing a rash. For me it was the choice of a close shave, with a red rash or what I have with this shaver, perhaps not quite as close, but good enough and no rash, which is not attractive and is painful.  I hated to shave! I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far, so good.  (One week after the Panasonic arrived, I found the Remmington, LOL!)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and need to use an electric razor on my underarms to avoid razor burn.  My last two electric razors have been Remington, the most recent being the one with the gold foil for sensitive skin.  No matter how lightly I pressed with the Remington, I would still get razor burn as if I had shaved with a real razor.  The same is true of when I shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this Panasonic razor for less than a month, but I have already noticed significantly less razor burn.  If I press too hard, it will still cause it.  But really there is no need to press very hard at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews I saw talked about how loud this razor is and to never use it when you have company.  Well, it is much quieter than my Remington razors.  Yes, you can hear it when it is on.  But it&#x27;s not like a jet engine or anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that the little green strip that goes in between the foil can scratch a little if you&#x27;re pressing too hard.  I sometimes press a little harder on my legs to try to get a closer shave.  (I try to get that delicate balance between razor burn and closeness!)  Another issue, though small, is the travel pouch it comes in.  It is just a nylon bag that really doesn&#x27;t protect it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like the pivoting head, though.  I was undecided whether that would really make a difference, since I&#x27;d never had one that pivoted before.  Well, it really does make it easier to shave around your knees and ankles.  You can change it from pivoting a lot to just a little.  I also like that you can just run it under the faucet to clean the hairs off when you are done using it.  The head comes off so you can rinse it.  It goes on easily, though you have to be a little bit careful to make sure both ends snap on.  The charger is sturdy and not too bulky.  It stays standing upright better than both of my Remington stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried the bikini trimmer yet, as I am a little nervous to, after reading how many people had issues with it.  I use a Wahl beard and mustache trimmer with a guard now that works perfectly, so that really wasn&#x27;t anything I anticipated using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am so far very pleased with the razor and think I will like it more than my Remington shavers.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because of the tiny bit of scratching and the very slight razor burn.  I have to have something be PERFECT to give five stars!  I think you can definitely see the difference between this mid-priced razor and the cheaper $20 store versions.  I&#x27;d recommend spending the extra money!y people had issues with it.

            <li> I bought this after a disappointing experience with the Remington women&#x27;s electric shaver.  That shaver gave me razor burns.  This shaver is excellent, no pinching, pulling, redness.  Good for both underarms and legs.  The shave is not as close as you would get with a razor, but then, you can just shave more often.  Works well dry and wet for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a while now and it&#x27;s an OK razor. Good value for the price. It says to charge it and use it, not to use it and put it back on the charger. OK, this is fine, except unless you are keeping close track of your minutes used, it will suddenly die in the middle of a shave. Not a big problem, just something of a pain to be half shaved when it dies.     Hey, maybe it&#x27;s me, but nothing seems to shave real close. Not this, not blades. It does an adequate job, and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I found myself having to go over and over and over the same spot on my leg and I could still never get a smooth shave.  I was pretty disapointed with the product and will go back to my boring shavers.</li>
            <li> This razor worked well for only a few months and then suddenly stopped.  On August 1, 2007, I mailed the razor in it&#x27;s original carton, with sales receipt, to the service address indicated in the product paperwork. Only after an inquiry, I got a reply stating they were \\&quot;waiting for parts.\\&quot;  Four months later I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THE REPAIRED RAZOR OR HEARD FROM PANASONIC AGAIN.  Therefore, I would NEVER buy another razor from that company.</li>
            <li> Did not last. Already bit the dust.</li>
            <li> My husband got me this razor as a replacement for the Panasonic ladies razor I had for ten years. In the interim Panasonic has made some improvements on the razor. For instance, the head is larger which I liked but for some reason the edges on the razor&#x27;s head are noticeable when you shave. I didn&#x27;t care for the head&#x27;s swivel mode either for the same reason. The one thing that really improved is it does shave leg hairs easier and closer. It also has the easy clean up and is great in the shower.</li>
            <li> Was pretty disappointed, I do not get a close shave at ALL! I was really excited about it but does not make my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> shaver sucks, reviews from others were great, but shaver doesn&#x27;t work, wish i could return it</li>
            <li> Worked great when it was operational. Water got into the electronics and corroded the inside.</li>
            <li> I have used many different electric shavers and knowing that none will give you as close a shave as a razor, this is by far the best I have used.  My last was a remington and it worked OK as long as you took a lot of extra time going over your legs twice.  This gets the job done in half the time.  I also love the pop up bikini shaver.</li>
            <li> If you have any kind of condition that gives you thicker hair growth, this shaver is OK.  It takes work though to really trim that hair down.  It will do it, but you need several passes.  If you have fine hair, I&#x27;m sure it will do the job just fine.  As someone who has hirsutism, I need something that can cut cut cut all over.  This is decent.  Not excellent.  Not bad, just kind of in the middle of the road compromise to get that shave, even if not as easily as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You still can&#x27;t beat a regular blade, it&#x27;s not as good as regular razor.  I mostly bought it for pubic shaving, and it works quite well for that, since I don&#x27;t like super close razor shaves as I break out.  This helps shave it to skin but not beneath.</li>
            <li> This shaver works beautifully.  I am 60 years old and the eyes just aren&#x27;t what they used to be.  I can&#x27;t see the hair on my legs or underarms anymore.  With this razor you are able to feel that you have shaved every bit of skin without worrying about cutting yourself.  It is long enough that even with Arthritis, you can reach all over your body.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Remington shaver it replaced.  Doesn&#x27;t get a real super close shave but I knew that with electric shavers anyway.  It&#x27;s ok for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> At first, this was a great shaver. However, towards 6 months, there wasn&#x27;t enough energy in it even though I kept it in the charger. I even switched outlets, just in case that was an issue. Not sure what the problem was, but I tossed it. Maybe I just got one that wasn&#x27;t assembled right.</li>
            <li> A very good electric shaver. The shaver head moves in so many directions that it stays in contact with your skin better than other shavers I&#x27;ve had. Fast, close(ish) shave, quiet, easy to use. I haven&#x27;t decided if using it wet with lather works better than dry. Dry is easy and faster. Included attachment for trimming \\&quot;longer hair\\&quot; is useful.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. I thought I wanted to buy a different brand, but after reading previous reviews, I decided to give this shaver a try. I&#x27;m impressed. It shaves close and holds a charge well. I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet, but I like it just fine used dry.</li>
            <li> I have not used an electric razor for years as I never cared for the results achieved. I love the closeness of a straight razor shave, but now have issues trying to bend to reach due to back issues.  I read the reviews of the Panasonic and decided to give it a try.  I have used it for the last month and must say that I am delighted with this product.  Although it is not the absolute closeness of a razor, it is darned close.  No nicks or cuts or razor burn to deal with!  It is great for the underarm and bikini area also.  Attractive too (I purchased the lavendar) and holds a charge very well.  I definitely think this product is worth the price paid and would recommend it for purchase for those who want the convenience and safety of an electric shaver. Electric shavers have improved a great deal since the last time I used one!!  Thanks to all who took the time to review this product and helped make my decision to purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver and was pleased with it until the trimmer blade broke after a few uses. I called Panasonic to get a replacement and they gave me nothing but a run around. I was disappointed with the razor breaking but was even more disappointed with the God awful customer service from Panasonic. If you buy is razor, just cross your fingers it never breaks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after a knee injury because I couldn&#x27;t bend my knee or stand in the shower long enough to shave with a real razor. This electric shaver doesn&#x27;t shave as close as previous reviews that I read, but I can&#x27;t complain too much - while I still feel stubbly, at least people can&#x27;t see that there is stubble left behind.</li>
            <li> This shaver cuts very very close without giving me any fear it going to cut me! With my Remington shaver, sometimes i would shave everyday or every other day. With this panasonic shaver, I go to shave and there&#x27;s barely anything there, I love it, now i&#x27;m starting to forget to shave lol. The pivoting head is great, it hugs every curve, plus it shaves perfectly both ways, which is great for armpits because hair grows in all directions. and of course after all this i don&#x27;t have to mention.. Great Value. Great Price!!</li>
            <li> This was never a great product.  It worked OK but charges never lasted very long.  I didn&#x27;t use it a lot as I usually shave w/a blade.  I tried to charge it recently but it wouldn&#x27;t recharge.  It is only two years old and lightly used.  Ridiculous that something like this would last such a short time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister-in-law who is a stroke victim and cannot use her dominant hand. She has an ongoing problem with facial hair and it became impossible for me to remove the hair with tweezers or depilatories so I bought this razor. So far, it&#x27;s working fine and doing the job. I find it easy to recharge and to clean. She&#x27;s happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Bought shaver for my daughter (16) for Christmas, found it at bottom of cabinet today (6 weeks later).</li>
            <li> This is definately one I&#x27;d recommend!  I&#x27;ve had a number of electric shavers, and this is definately the best.  Very smooth, close shave.  When I have to replace it, I will definately be back for this one!</li>
            <li> Wife has never really liked electric razors, but likes safety razors and shaving soap even less.  She has very sensitive skin and past electrics always scraped her.  This one is not irritating, and does a reasonable cutting job, far better than past razors.  If this is not a ringing endorsement, with her skin no razor will get one.  This Panasonic is better than any other electric she has had to date</li>
            <li> Why do they continually come out with new and better men&#x27;s razors but they have yet to make one decent women&#x27;s razor!  Who makes these things, men?  Well this razor is better than my last one but still not as good as my husbands electric razor!</li>
