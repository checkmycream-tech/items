            <li>I used Tescom products for over a decade and thought they were great until I tried this KURUKURU.  </li>
            <li>Good product for the price.  </li>

            <li>Price amazing for the value.</li>
            <li>handy and I am keeping it on my travel case</li>
            <li>and I liked how it wasn&#x27;t noisy</li>
            <li>This is perfect for young girls who want to have a brush type blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It would be a great product, but because of the difference between Japan and US electric, it gets so hot you can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I wish more of my black/ethnic sisters were hip to this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m copying and pasting my review on as many as these as I can find.  </li>
            <li>In some cases they seem to work ok, but the one we bought shot out sparks  </li>
            <li>They love it and they use it every day.</li>
            <li>It does most of what is needed for the high-end ones do.  </li>
            <li>blow drying my hair has never been so easy</li>
            <li>I basically purchased this because I wanted something low noise, and for that it is great.</li>
            <li>it has a sound when it runs,and i do not like it.</li>
            <li>I liked that it is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used--super fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>I love using Japanese hair dryers because they are slim, lightweight, and the brush makes it easy to style hair.</li>
            <li>It worked well while it lasted &amp; for what it was worth.</li>
            <li>and he said using it on US 120V system means the power is 40% higher</li>
            <li>It smells like hot plastic&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and I was made aware of that with each use--I can smell the burning plastic each time it was on</li>
            <li>Straightened my hair like no other dryer, wish it was sold locally but glad it available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>my natural hair quickly love the denman brush on it grest dryer so far.</li>
            <li>But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you&#x27;d need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this happened once and am purely guessing it could be a safety feature for when it overheats.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>I still have to use a flat iron, but it does dry it easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>It does result is less fly away hair; so I tried my regular dryer on medium heat and medium air speed and got similar results but Panasonic&#x27;s brush on the dryer head does help.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I first tried this style of dryer while living in Japan back in 2009</li>
            <li>As I expected with fast delivery !!</li>
            <li>am going to put it aside to use as my travel hair dryer since it is lighter and smaller (straight).</li>
            <li>being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them.</li>
            <li>Did not work for me in the winter though because the heat was too hot and the dry air made my hair break and frizzle.  </li>
            <li>I recommend for fast drying and especially if you have to dry your self.</li>
            <li>When running on high it turned its air volume down to low</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s pretty loud but no more than other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> The bristles get soft due to the heat</li>
            <li> and I limited its use for short bursts.  </li>
            <li> electrical system is roughly the same as the US&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My daughter has the same type hair as I do and this stops the tears from flowing and gets her hair dried in no time.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, black, natural hair and this blower dry gives me life.  </li>
            <li> Look at all your other hair dyers and electrical appliances.</li>
            <li> There may be other brands; just look for hair straightening dryer or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As stated in other reviews, it&#x27;s not meant for US voltage</li>
            <li> My expert opinion is I would stay away from using any appliance that generates heat...such as a hairdryer (as previously mentioned) or a kotatsu or a boiler for tea water...unless you know what you are doing!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it broke after less than 30 uses by short circuiting - but it definitely made doing my hair a breeze while it worked.  </li>
            <li> It claims low noise but that is false.  </li>
            <li> There is a cold setting that is just room temperature air, a lower heat setting for styling, and a high heat setting for drying hair.</li>
            <li> I did not notice it being faster nor slower than my usual hair dryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s past the time to return it, but it&#x27;s not useable it sparks and arks not safe to use.  </li>
            <li> They usually say 120V or 125V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are now worn, I tired look for this as I had to share with my other siblings</li>

            <li> I basically purchased this because I wanted something low noise, and for that it is great. It doesn&#x60;t style my hair I still have to use a flat iron, but it does dry it easily and quickly. I liked that it is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> This is my second one and I like, like, like it!  I have thick, black, natural hair and this blower dry gives me life.  I first tried this style of dryer while living in Japan back in 2009 and I fell in like.  My daughter has the same type hair as I do and this stops the tears from flowing and gets her hair dried in no time.  This dryer takes place of having to use a comb at the same time because the bristles are strong/plastic and it pulls through the hair like that of a comb.  I wish more of my black/ethnic sisters were hip to this dryer.  It will give them life as well!!!</li>
            <li> the stars says it all.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is designed to work on a Japanese power system of 100V so I asked an electrical engineer and he said using it on US 120V system means the power is 40% higher (I&#x27;ll skip the power formula). Whether this is outside the design specs, I don&#x27;t know. I plugged it in and here is what I observed:&lt;br /&gt;* It smells like hot plastic&lt;br /&gt;* The bristles get soft due to the heat and when I stored the brush on the bristles they deformed but reformed when reheated.&lt;br /&gt;* When running on high it turned its air volume down to low, I don&#x27;t know if it also decreased the heat setting - this happened once and am purely guessing it could be a safety feature for when it overheats. After this I used it in the low heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;* I did not notice it being faster nor slower than my usual hair dryer but I didn&#x27;t time it.&lt;br /&gt;* It does result is less fly away hair; so I tried my regular dryer on medium heat and medium air speed and got similar results but Panasonic&#x27;s brush on the dryer head does help.&lt;br /&gt;* It is lighter weight than my regular dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to put it aside to use as my travel hair dryer since it is lighter and smaller (straight). If it fails then I won&#x27;t blame Panasonic since I am using it beyond the stated design parameters.</li>
            <li> Best on out there. Styles and does hair at the same time. Great to use whenever or to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> It stopped working within 4 month. I contacted maker, but they told that this product is made only for Japan voltage AC100V. They may repair if you bring it to one of their repair shop in Japan.</li>
            <li> I have this since Jan. It&#x27;s past the time to return it, but it&#x27;s not useable it sparks and arks not safe to use.  Unfortunately I needed to throw it out.  A safety hazard!!!!</li>
            <li> It is replacement of 10 year old similar model.&lt;br /&gt;it is not very powerful, but handy and I am keeping it on my travel case</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m copying and pasting my review on as many as these as I can find.  In some cases they seem to work ok, but the one we bought shot out sparks  so I called Panasonic and they said that these were made for use in Japan. They say 100Volts on them. Look at all your other hair dyers and electrical appliances. They usually say 120V or 125V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve copied and pasted this from a blog where someone asked if you can use Japanese appliances in the U.S.: &amp;#34;Can you use Japanse appliances in the US?&lt;br /&gt;I am an electrical engineer. My expert opinion is I would stay away from using any appliance that generates heat...such as a hairdryer (as previously mentioned) or a kotatsu or a boiler for tea water...unless you know what you are doing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japan&#x27;s electrical system is roughly the same as the US&#x27;s. However, the US&#x27;s voltage is 120Vac RMS (60Hz)while Japan&#x27;s is 100Vac RMS (50 or 60Hz depending on region).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, any heat generating device from Japan that is used in the US will get 20% hotter than it&#x27;s design intended. The risk is damage to the device and/or fire...or injury of a person. Please be careful!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them. But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you&#x27;d need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do have another of these dryers that&#x27;s a slightly different model that hasn&#x27;t sparked, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put a link below to a similar dryer that&#x27;s Conair brand that we&#x27;ve bought before and which is what I&#x27;m replacing this unit with. There may be other brands; just look for hair straightening dryer or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ME2YWG/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> This dryer is great! I love using Japanese hair dryers because they are slim, lightweight, and the brush makes it easy to style hair. I like the three settings. There is a cold setting that is just room temperature air, a lower heat setting for styling, and a high heat setting for drying hair.</li>
            <li> My sister lived in Japan for years and she send me back one of this dryer years back. The bristles are now worn, I tired look for this as I had to share with my other siblings, I have bought similar items but non work like this. Now I finally found it, I have ordered 2. I recommend for fast drying and especially if you have to dry your self.</li>
            <li> Straightened my hair like no other dryer, wish it was sold locally but glad it available through Amazon. Price amazing for the value.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my daughter and for her mom.  They love it and they use it every day.</li>
            <li> Best hair brush style blowdryer I&#x27;ve ever used--super fast and easy.  Did not work for me in the winter though because the heat was too hot and the dry air made my hair break and frizzle.  As stated in other reviews, it&#x27;s not meant for US voltage and I was made aware of that with each use--I can smell the burning plastic each time it was on and I limited its use for short bursts.  Unfortunately it broke after less than 30 uses by short circuiting - but it definitely made doing my hair a breeze while it worked.  I will probably purchase one meant for US use next time...hope I can find one that works just as well without costing over $100</li>
            <li> It would be a great product, but because of the difference between Japan and US electric, it gets so hot you can&#x27;t use it. I couldn&#x27;t even finish using it on my hair ONCE--it burned my hand and hair. They refunded my money, but need to quit selling it. They already know about this problem and I guess figure not everyone will make the effort to get their money back. Its a scam.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have English instructions, but way back in the 70&#x27;s I had one some what like it so it didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> As I expected with fast delivery !!</li>
            <li> I used Tescom products for over a decade and thought they were great until I tried this KURUKURU.  So much more power!  It claims low noise but that is false.  It&#x27;s pretty loud but no more than other hair dryers.  great product!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks.  Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.  It does most of what is needed for the high-end ones do.  This is perfect for young girls who want to have a brush type blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It was delivered in good Condition I only used it once and I liked how it wasn&#x27;t noisy and it blew out my natural hair quickly love the denman brush on it grest dryer so far.</li>
            <li> blow drying my hair has never been so easy</li>
            <li> It worked well while it lasted &amp; for what it was worth. The heat from the dryer combined with the heat that my hair holds was not a good combo for this dryer which cause the bristles on the brush to melt. Needless to say, I had to upgrade. Hopefully I will get the bang for my buck!</li>
            <li> No instructions in English</li>
            <li> This is not good becuse of  it has a sound when it runs,and i do not like it. That  is my opinion</li>
