    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will monitor any side effects with my continued use.</li>
            <li>awesome</li>
            <li>I tried product as stated 6 capsules for better results and results are ZERO!!!!!</li>
            <li>it great!!!  </li>
            <li>The best hair vitamin I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I am happy they give 100 capsules.</li>
            <li>Was hoping I could give this product a great review</li>
            <li>Love it, awesome shipping!</li>
            <li>but I would advise buyers to buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I have to be completely honest and say that taking 2 supplements per day did not yield any results for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is alot softer, it holds moisture alot better, and I can say it made my natural hair look wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I made sure to take my fish oils and continued to drink plenty of water when I re added these supplements to my regiment.  </li>
            <li>I notice my nails grew longer and my skin looks good, but my hair did not grow as fast as I would liked it to.</li>
            <li>The Best thing about these vitamins is that I noticed growth within the second week of taking them by week 3, I had 1 1/2&amp;#34; of growth.  </li>
            <li>Truthfully, I feel they work for me</li>
            <li>Yea.....I actually love it, I take two in the morning &amp; two at night for noticeable results</li>
            <li>ðŸ˜† love it ðŸ’¯</li>
            <li>ok product...moderate results</li>
            <li>My hair is more shinny and stronger and my nails have stop breaking.  </li>
            <li>which is why I wanted to try this product in the first place :-)  </li>
            <li>However, when I take 6 supplements, workout, and eat healthy they grow my hair really fast.</li>
            <li>You have to figure out quickly in what way they work for you.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels different and better!  </li>
            <li>right here</li>
            <li>Need to learn more about that before I take what&#x27;s left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, the next 30 days I will see better results for hair growth.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to several of my friends and they love the product too.</li>
            <li>Funny how it made my eyebrows grow in really fast at first....</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and it did nothing for my hair</li>
            <li>my hair has grown so much people compliment my fro also</li>
            <li>So this is really bothering me.</li>
            <li>It made my thinning hair grow really thick and full on top of my head.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend this to people a fro rock fro stronger  and beautifier than ever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised but the mixture didn&#x27;t work well with my body.</li>
            <li>I purchased it hoping my hair would grow quicker since going natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s likely a combination of all of the natural supplements I&#x27;m taking, my diet, and hair care regiment that has caused my hair to grow and thicken with a 3 week period.  </li>
            <li>Also, it says to take it on an empty stomach, don&#x27;t know why that matters much.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and it did nothing for my hair but my nails grew. I won&#x27;t buy this one again..</li>
            <li> I love this product. It made my thinning hair grow really thick and full on top of my head. I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m concerned about the horsetail that I read can cause liver damage, over time. Need to learn more about that before I take what&#x27;s left in the bottle.  Update 5/14/15 I did the research.  I made sure to take my fish oils and continued to drink plenty of water when I re added these supplements to my regiment.  It&#x27;s likely a combination of all of the natural supplements I&#x27;m taking, my diet, and hair care regiment that has caused my hair to grow and thicken with a 3 week period.  I&#x27;m only taking 2 pills a day and will continue with this dosage.  My hair looks and feels different and better!  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will monitor any side effects with my continued use.</li>
            <li> my hair has grown so much people compliment my fro also I bet they not hatin now kmsl awesome I  highly recommend this to people a fro rock fro stronger  and beautifier than ever</li>
            <li> I just start taking these vitamins a week ago and I already see some results. I am happy they give 100 capsules. I only take 2 a day. I will come back in 30 days for an update review.  Here is my 30 day review. I notice my nails grew longer and my skin looks good, but my hair did not grow as fast as I would liked it to. However, I will continue to take the pills because I paid for them but I will not order again. Hopefully, the next 30 days I will see better results for hair growth. Here I am day 60 and still no good results. I will try something else.</li>
            <li> Love it, awesome shipping!</li>
            <li> I tried product as stated 6 capsules for better results and results are ZERO!!!!! Nothing happened after taking this product for over 2 months!  I would not recommend this to anyone and I will never buy this again!  I will try Hairfinity this time!!!</li>
            <li> Was hoping I could give this product a great review but I cant. Please keep in my everyone is different and my results may be opposite from yours. I have experienced a terrible breakout. I have never had any issues with acne etc. So this is really bothering me. I have taken other products as well as b12 and no breakouts. I&#x27;m very surprised but the mixture didn&#x27;t work well with my body.</li>
            <li> I am not one for writing reviews but this stuff right here it great!!!  Funny how it made my eyebrows grow in really fast at first....now it&#x27;s working on my edges which is why I wanted to try this product in the first place :-)  I&#x27;ve changed my eating habits as well....I think that&#x27;s part of it too!  You can&#x27;t take these vitamins or any other for that matter and expect to see results if you eat poorly.  Kudos to You &#x27;Fro!  You rock!!</li>
            <li> Having to take 6 pills instead of 2, is the only issue. It works within days!</li>
            <li> Definitely thickness your hair but be very careful because I read that this product contains horseleaf powder and if taken for a long time it can cause liver failure</li>
            <li> Have me diarrhea!! Was very very upset to waste my money and time on buying this crap!!! Never again will I be fooled by these stupid posts!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a month ago. I only take two capsules a day. I did see some changes, but growth wasn&#x27;t one of them. My hair is alot softer, it holds moisture alot better, and I can say it made my natural hair look wonderful. I purchased it hoping my hair would grow quicker since going natural. To my disappointment it didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m hoping after my second month I will see the results I&#x27;ve been hoping for. The product isn&#x27;t a total letdown it also helps with nails and it softened my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product but I would advise buyers to buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I have to be completely honest and say that taking 2 supplements per day did not yield any results for me. However, when I take 6 supplements, workout, and eat healthy they grow my hair really fast. I noticed my hair is thicker and sheds less.  I took Hair Finity for 3 months and did not see noticeable results.  The Best thing about these vitamins is that I noticed growth within the second week of taking them by week 3, I had 1 1/2&amp;#34; of growth.  I hate that these pills give me diarrhea and they are too expensive. You have to figure out quickly in what way they work for you. Truthfully, I feel they work for me b/c I take the maximum dosage and get the blood circulating through my scalp by working out. Also, it says to take it on an empty stomach, don&#x27;t know why that matters much.</li>
            <li> Yea.....I actually love it, I take two in the morning &amp; two at night for noticeable results fastðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜† love it ðŸ’¯</li>
            <li> ok product...moderate results</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I can see the difference.. My hair is more shinny and stronger and my nails have stop breaking.  Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The best hair vitamin I have purchased. I am 52 and with this product, my hair has grown 4 inches in six months. I have recommended it to several of my friends and they love the product too.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these!I am planning on ordering again</li>
            <li> To be honets I was expecting a lot from this product,  but the only thing it gave me was stomach ache and a lot of digestive problems. I wont use it again. I didn&#x27;t even use half the bottle.</li>
