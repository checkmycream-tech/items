            <li>I have skin that is fair and combination in type.  </li>
            <li>This product its really good.</li>
            <li>The product is good but the container is not working - nothing iscoming out.  </li>
            <li>Good price for product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many products before and this is the best I have seen for the fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>On top of all this my forehead for whatever reason gets darker in the summer than the rest of my face!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to wear sunscreen or you will burn and reverse all of your efforts!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>They are mostly gone!  </li>
            <li>, I tried it and love it!</li>
            <li>I love VVT!</li>
            <li>and it does a nice job of keeping my skin tone in check.</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely effective product that truly recharges you skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it a couple times and didn&#x27;t like how it made me look jaundiced (or like an &amp;#34;umpah-lumpah&amp;#34;) as I have very fair skin with some freckles.</li>
            <li>So glad you provide this product love it!</li>
            <li>By far the best product on the market.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get allergic reactions very easily, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned, and I&#x27;m glad I kept up with using it.  </li>
            <li>At that rate, the cost works out to $1.40 per day, which isn&#x27;t much for skin that is so beautiful.    </li>
            <li>Well, very soon, my skin was quickly looking healthier, toned and rather beautiful!</li>
            <li>but I noticed a huge difference in about 2 days!</li>
            <li>The vibrance therapy however I found is just okay.</li>
            <li>and I was told mostly the Vivite Vibrance Therapy that I purchased</li>
            <li>the best facial scrub ever created!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love how it has evened my skin tone already.</li>
            <li>Love that I can get it at a better price on Amazon and with reliable merchants.  </li>
            <li>Like it much better than Triluma which my doctor had prescribed.</li>
            <li>I love this product line.</li>
            <li>It was sent to me directly from the Brilliant Distinctions Corporation that manufactures this product.</li>
            <li>just a lovely, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>I just love the results, I couldn&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
            <li>No amount of thumping would allow more than a drop of the product out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Ever the optimist, I will try one more bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love my vivite vibrance Therapy</li>
            <li>I never had any problems with any of the vivite products - plus I feel confident that I will benefit since Allergan is so well regarded in skin care.</li>
            <li>I have to take the top off each time to get to the creme.</li>
            <li>and it seemed ok.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>But I also have many freckles and age spots, along with discoloration from the sun.  </li>
            <li>However, I would love to find a product that improved both of my problems.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try again because I love the product.  </li>
            <li>this product  remains  the  best  treatment for softer, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>I personally love this</li>
            <li>i love this product.  </li>
            <li>Gave this 4 stars because it&#x27;s a bit pricey but just love this..</li>
            <li>Love this and love the vivite line.</li>
            <li>They all agree it makes their skin look much better.</li>
            <li>I called the sellers and they responded in a reasonable period of time and were quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>I then found the perfect balance and would first apply my normal routine of a night cream moisturizer, followed by using this V. Vibrance.</li>
            <li>I love that it keeps my skin smooth, no valleys any more</li>
            <li>I got a free full size sample of this and fell in love!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Not as good as hydroquinone but look promising.</li>
            <li>you can find good zinc oxide sunscreens at whole foods,etc that are not as pricey as the \\&quot;spa\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li>Vivite was introduced to me by a plastic surgeon, I am very happy Amazon is helping me get it in such a speedy way, for a much better price right at my door.  </li>
            <li>Easy to go on and eliminates wrinkles</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This product is the best I have used for providing an even tone for my dark skin.  </li>
            <li>the shipping is very fast, the communication is very good, so far I have not seen any result yet.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent as well...and just one pump of the product covers my whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product since my free sample ran out.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using it so many friends asked what I was doing to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I originally got this product from my dermatologist and it worked well.</li>
            <li>I out it on clean skin overnight, then again under makeup in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It was a solid product, not as good as hydroquinine-based products, but it did the job.  </li>
            <li>and the receptionist was surprised saying it really is quite popular with many of his patients</li>
            <li>its worthy for sure![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I started developing melasma while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always taken extremely good care of my skin by wearing sunscreen and keeping it hydrated but VVT has ensured that my 40 year old face is even, clear, and free of those pesky fine lines that begin to happen as you get older.</li>
            <li>I was already using Vivite facial cleanser/scrub &amp; love it!  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I really see a difference in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my friend&#x27;s skin suddenly looked amazing and asked what she was using on her face.  </li>
            <li>This one is a keeper-- Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford such high-end products if not for the fabulous prices offered here.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>A rare problem but</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So after consulting with my local skin/laser people (and always make sure they have a real live, working doctor running the place!)</li>
            <li>And I love the moisturizer and cant say enough about it.</li>
            <li>Even people who can&#x27;t put their finger on how exactly I&#x27;ve changed will tell me that I look rested or relaxed and refreshed.      </li>
            <li>my skin looks more even overall.</li>
            <li>Helped fade sun spots pretty well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for a couple of years</li>
            <li>Really a first</li>
            <li>My dermotogist suggested this product (because they sold it for more than double at their office???)  </li>
            <li>All I can say is, if you purchase it from Amazon, and it works for you, make sure it always comes from the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that when I bought it the first time, was a miracle.</li>
            <li>my face shows me love back all day</li>
            <li>Love this product, have used it for several years now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li>I suspect the positive reviews are fakes written by the company itself.   </li>
            <li>Product is sold in high end spas at more than double the price.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see Vivite Vibrance Therapy offered on Amazon at half the price my dermatologist charges for it.  </li>
            <li>Its nice because I don&#x27;t have to use as much of the moisturizer, like half the amount.</li>
            <li>I initially started using it for dark spots, and while it doesn&#x27;t really get rid of those (I&#x27;ve been using do over 6 months), it gives an amazing complexion that is smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li>I really hoped this product would get rid of my brown spots.  </li>
            <li>I had some light acne scars from having been afflicted with the skin condition as a teen.  </li>
            <li>Nothing has really helped with my scarring until I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gave my skin a much improved, glowing look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very diligent about using a high-quality sunscreen, from a competitor, that I also purchased through Amazon and saved quite a bit of money doing so.</li>
            <li>my skin sometimes has difficulty absorbing products.</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely much nicer with and without makeup.</li>
            <li>Terrific night cream which I began to use when Trilateral was no longer available.</li>
            <li>It really works to diminish brown spots and lighten the skin.  </li>
            <li>I didnt see much difference b/c</li>
            <li>It really does fade the spots and mine</li>
            <li>Very inconsistent.</li>
            <li>Very calming to skin</li>
            <li>See much improvement.</li>
            <li>This product does an outstanding job of evening skin tone, fading sun spots and sloughing off dead skin cells for a fresh look.  </li>
            <li>The compliments are coming fast &amp; furious now -- a few weeks ago I met up with a friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in about 8 months, and he raved about how good I look and went so far as to say that my skin looks like a cosmetics ad.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found better results with other products/lines.</li>
            <li>an older appearance- @ 16 people always thought I was twenty something, now @ 34 people think I&#x27;m in my twenties.  </li>
            <li>and then definitely  noticed more of a difference after the 2nd bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 or so years and it has truly made my skin vibrant.</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend this product as well)...</li>
            <li>Daily usage results in removal of rough spots that come with age fairly quickly; it requires longer use for smooth brown spots.</li>
            <li>I thought this cream was ok but was kinda weirded out by the box that it came in as it looked a little off in coloring.</li>
            <li>but I would think if you kept up w/ this product and wore zinc oxide sunscreen, it would prevent it from becoming too dark.  </li>
            <li>I bought from Forever Young and think I got the \\&quot;real thing.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>After I stopped using it, my face returned to normal.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it for 3 months because I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the cost, but went back to it.</li>
            <li>To use more just wastes the product.</li>
            <li>This product did not seem to be the same color, texture, or as effective as the one I had previously purchased from my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>and though i still have dark spots on my face due to hormones it feels good and works well with my make up.</li>
            <li>I received it free when I bought some other products from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>This product is obviously very old, is discolored and smells rancid.  </li>
            <li>When I bought the second time it didn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than a distant relative of what I bought the first time.</li>
            <li>During this time I have been carded many times buying alcoholic drinks &amp;</li>
            <li>I am now using it regularly and really do like it!</li>
            <li>It comes in a kit, however this facial serum runs out twice as quickly as the rest of the kit, so be prepared to buy an extra tube.     </li>
            <li>After just a few weeks there was a noticable difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>After 4 weeks i could see a huge difference, the dark spots were almost gone!</li>
            <li>I had two huge dark spots on my forehead!</li>
            <li>In a manner of hours, my face turned beet-red and developed blisters on my cheekbones and near my mouth.  </li>
            <li>the product is old.</li>
            <li>So far have not experience any side effects.</li>
            <li>Unlike Abzoo, Forever Young Beauty cannot be contacted directly</li>
            <li>For reference, I&#x27;m 34 years old.</li>
            <li>I am 59 years old.  </li>
            <li>I am 69 years old and have been using this product for about 5 years.  </li>
            <li>It gives your skin a soft glo..</li>
            <li>This product has a yellowish color and a funny smell and it stings and/or itches for the first few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a few weeks but love how my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>I prob didnt use them long enough due to the controversial ingred.</li>
            <li>but I have seen no other changes.</li>
            <li>color of serum is slightly darker than ones in the past but other than that amazing!</li>
            <li>Too bad because it was amazing at first.</li>
            <li>This price is 1/2 of what my dermatologist charges for the exact same product ... and worth every cent, if you purchase the kit you can expect it to last at least six months.</li>
            <li>it does occasionally sting when i first put it on, but this doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>However, in the last 6 months, I received two bottles ordered through Amazon, one from Abzoo and one from Forever Young Beauty, with defective pumps.  </li>
            <li>were pretty dark.  </li>
            <li>9 months and have noticed an distinct improvement in my skin after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I have used other items in this line, but I really do think it brightens  and evens your skin and complexion.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it really works, but it remains very compatible to my skin type....which is mature and on the dry side.  </li>
            <li>Dont give up if you are not seeing results after the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth every single penny!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it seemed ok.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> But I also have many freckles and age spots, along with discoloration from the sun.  </li>
            <li> However, I would love to find a product that improved both of my problems.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try again because I love the product.  </li>
            <li> this product  remains  the  best  treatment for softer, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I personally love this</li>
            <li> i love this product.  </li>
            <li> Gave this 4 stars because it&#x27;s a bit pricey but just love this..</li>
            <li> Love this and love the vivite line.</li>
            <li> They all agree it makes their skin look much better.</li>
            <li> I called the sellers and they responded in a reasonable period of time and were quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I then found the perfect balance and would first apply my normal routine of a night cream moisturizer, followed by using this V. Vibrance.</li>
            <li> I love that it keeps my skin smooth, no valleys any more</li>
            <li> I got a free full size sample of this and fell in love!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Not as good as hydroquinone but look promising.</li>
            <li> you can find good zinc oxide sunscreens at whole foods,etc that are not as pricey as the \\&quot;spa\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li> Vivite was introduced to me by a plastic surgeon, I am very happy Amazon is helping me get it in such a speedy way, for a much better price right at my door.  </li>
            <li> Easy to go on and eliminates wrinkles</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have used for providing an even tone for my dark skin.  </li>
            <li> the shipping is very fast, the communication is very good, so far I have not seen any result yet.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent as well...and just one pump of the product covers my whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product since my free sample ran out.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using it so many friends asked what I was doing to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I originally got this product from my dermatologist and it worked well.</li>
            <li> I out it on clean skin overnight, then again under makeup in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It was a solid product, not as good as hydroquinine-based products, but it did the job.  </li>
            <li> and the receptionist was surprised saying it really is quite popular with many of his patients</li>
            <li> its worthy for sure![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I started developing melasma while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken extremely good care of my skin by wearing sunscreen and keeping it hydrated but VVT has ensured that my 40 year old face is even, clear, and free of those pesky fine lines that begin to happen as you get older.</li>
            <li> I was already using Vivite facial cleanser/scrub &amp; love it!  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I really see a difference in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my friend&#x27;s skin suddenly looked amazing and asked what she was using on her face.  </li>
            <li> This one is a keeper-- Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford such high-end products if not for the fabulous prices offered here.</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> A rare problem but</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So after consulting with my local skin/laser people (and always make sure they have a real live, working doctor running the place!)</li>
            <li> And I love the moisturizer and cant say enough about it.</li>
            <li> Even people who can&#x27;t put their finger on how exactly I&#x27;ve changed will tell me that I look rested or relaxed and refreshed.      </li>
            <li> my skin looks more even overall.</li>
            <li> Helped fade sun spots pretty well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for a couple of years</li>
            <li> Really a first</li>
            <li> My dermotogist suggested this product (because they sold it for more than double at their office???)  </li>
            <li> All I can say is, if you purchase it from Amazon, and it works for you, make sure it always comes from the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that when I bought it the first time, was a miracle.</li>
            <li> my face shows me love back all day</li>
            <li> Love this product, have used it for several years now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I suspect the positive reviews are fakes written by the company itself.   </li>
            <li> Product is sold in high end spas at more than double the price.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see Vivite Vibrance Therapy offered on Amazon at half the price my dermatologist charges for it.  </li>
            <li> Its nice because I don&#x27;t have to use as much of the moisturizer, like half the amount.</li>
            <li> I initially started using it for dark spots, and while it doesn&#x27;t really get rid of those (I&#x27;ve been using do over 6 months), it gives an amazing complexion that is smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li> I really hoped this product would get rid of my brown spots.  </li>
            <li> I had some light acne scars from having been afflicted with the skin condition as a teen.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has really helped with my scarring until I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> gave my skin a much improved, glowing look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very diligent about using a high-quality sunscreen, from a competitor, that I also purchased through Amazon and saved quite a bit of money doing so.</li>
            <li> my skin sometimes has difficulty absorbing products.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely much nicer with and without makeup.</li>
            <li> Terrific night cream which I began to use when Trilateral was no longer available.</li>
            <li> It really works to diminish brown spots and lighten the skin.  </li>
            <li> I didnt see much difference b/c</li>
            <li> It really does fade the spots and mine</li>
            <li> Very inconsistent.</li>
            <li> Very calming to skin</li>
            <li> See much improvement.</li>
            <li> This product does an outstanding job of evening skin tone, fading sun spots and sloughing off dead skin cells for a fresh look.  </li>
            <li> The compliments are coming fast &amp; furious now -- a few weeks ago I met up with a friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in about 8 months, and he raved about how good I look and went so far as to say that my skin looks like a cosmetics ad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found better results with other products/lines.</li>
            <li> an older appearance- @ 16 people always thought I was twenty something, now @ 34 people think I&#x27;m in my twenties.  </li>
            <li> and then definitely  noticed more of a difference after the 2nd bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 or so years and it has truly made my skin vibrant.</li>
            <li> and i highly recommend this product as well)...</li>
            <li> Daily usage results in removal of rough spots that come with age fairly quickly; it requires longer use for smooth brown spots.</li>
            <li> I thought this cream was ok but was kinda weirded out by the box that it came in as it looked a little off in coloring.</li>
            <li> but I would think if you kept up w/ this product and wore zinc oxide sunscreen, it would prevent it from becoming too dark.  </li>
            <li> I bought from Forever Young and think I got the \\&quot;real thing.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> After I stopped using it, my face returned to normal.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it for 3 months because I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the cost, but went back to it.</li>
            <li> To use more just wastes the product.</li>
            <li> This product did not seem to be the same color, texture, or as effective as the one I had previously purchased from my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> and though i still have dark spots on my face due to hormones it feels good and works well with my make up.</li>
            <li> I received it free when I bought some other products from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> This product is obviously very old, is discolored and smells rancid.  </li>
            <li> When I bought the second time it didn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than a distant relative of what I bought the first time.</li>
            <li> During this time I have been carded many times buying alcoholic drinks &amp;</li>
            <li> I am now using it regularly and really do like it!</li>
            <li> It comes in a kit, however this facial serum runs out twice as quickly as the rest of the kit, so be prepared to buy an extra tube.     </li>
            <li> After just a few weeks there was a noticable difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> After 4 weeks i could see a huge difference, the dark spots were almost gone!</li>
            <li> I had two huge dark spots on my forehead!</li>
            <li> In a manner of hours, my face turned beet-red and developed blisters on my cheekbones and near my mouth.  </li>
            <li> the product is old.</li>
            <li> So far have not experience any side effects.</li>
            <li> Unlike Abzoo, Forever Young Beauty cannot be contacted directly</li>
            <li> For reference, I&#x27;m 34 years old.</li>
            <li> I am 59 years old.  </li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and have been using this product for about 5 years.  </li>
            <li> It gives your skin a soft glo..</li>
            <li> This product has a yellowish color and a funny smell and it stings and/or itches for the first few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a few weeks but love how my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> I prob didnt use them long enough due to the controversial ingred.</li>
            <li> but I have seen no other changes.</li>
            <li> color of serum is slightly darker than ones in the past but other than that amazing!</li>
            <li> Too bad because it was amazing at first.</li>
            <li> This price is 1/2 of what my dermatologist charges for the exact same product ... and worth every cent, if you purchase the kit you can expect it to last at least six months.</li>
            <li> it does occasionally sting when i first put it on, but this doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> However, in the last 6 months, I received two bottles ordered through Amazon, one from Abzoo and one from Forever Young Beauty, with defective pumps.  </li>
            <li> were pretty dark.  </li>
            <li> 9 months and have noticed an distinct improvement in my skin after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used other items in this line, but I really do think it brightens  and evens your skin and complexion.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it really works, but it remains very compatible to my skin type....which is mature and on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> Dont give up if you are not seeing results after the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> the pump doesn&#x27;t work as it arrived loose inside and apparently damaged.  </li>
            <li> Of course, she sells it for over twice as much, so I purchased it here instead along with some other skin products and paid less than 1/2 of what it would&#x27;ve cost me from a medical office.</li>
            <li> When I ordered Vibrance therapy here on Amazon, the color from the pump is a strange yellow color that stains clothing.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin, it appears much smoother and the discoloration is slowly fading.</li>
            <li> I received a promotional full size sample from the manufacturer and I doubt that I would have ever tried it otherwise, and I certainly didn&#x27;t expect to notice any results, but within a few weeks, friends started to randomly compliment me on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I started out using it twice a day for the first few weeks and then went down to once a day.  </li>
            <li> Of the last 3 orders one was a congealed gooey substance (not normal) and one arrived without the pump used to get the product out of the container.  </li>
            <li> i am 28 years old and have fairly clear skin, but i have a few brown sun spots, and it has made those less noticeable.</li>
            <li> When hormones set in after the birth if my daughter, I developed a little acne too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long its going to take to see the result for my malesma.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I developed uneven tones on my face.</li>
            <li> I have only seen minimal improvement in this.</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old, have the typical wrinkles, the occasional pimple, typical drab complexion.</li>
            <li> I tend to get oily on the forehead and nose &amp; dry on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I have been battling dry skin for over a year</li>
            <li> I have refilled several times - it lasts a LONG time, so I&#x27;ve been on it about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> This product evened out the color, got rid of dark sports, reduced pores, helped with breakouts and overall</li>
            <li> and it also keeps the red tone down.  </li>
            <li> This is either not the same product I have purchased in the past at my local dermatologist or</li>
            <li> I was 1st taken back from the yellowish tinge it had and the odd (but not offensive) odor.</li>
            <li> Buyers be careful.</li>
            <li> I started using this 2 yrs ago @ age 32 when I told my local skin clinic about my uneven combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I think I received a close to empty container.</li>
            <li> initially it seemed to leave my skin feeling a bit dried out.</li>
            <li> However, my bottles are almost empty and I am planning to reorder because of the wrinkle advantage.  </li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser does not work and when I took the dispenser apart the product was a deep yellow color and very thick and dry.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t have the skin problems that other people do and thats why I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not having the problem that other people may have with the orange color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any other skin care product in my life.   </li>
            <li> I know others who have reviewed this product gave other opinions and to just get it from your dermatologist</li>
            <li> Instead, I think I received a bogus product from this distributor - a fake that didn&#x27;t contain pure ingredients and in fact contained allergenic ones.</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t seem to notice any fading of dark spots, or any bleaching effect at all for that matter.</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders for the dark spots and wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> Dark spots and acne gone in about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I store mine upside down, and whack it on the palm of my hand about 4 times before pumping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with dark skin</li>
            <li> and I even break out less</li>
            <li> I get it for half of what I used to pay for it at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Additionally a little dab will do you as a little will do a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money unless you get the product from a Vivite retailer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sold it quite a few times to friends and family.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a dif in a few days..</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s half as expensive here (at a Dr&#x27;s office, it&#x27;s $119), you aren&#x27;t getting the actual product.</li>
            <li> Not going to repurchase after this bottle runs out, especially since it&#x27;s relatively expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m red as a beet, swollen like a balloon and feel ill.  </li>
            <li> Not sure,</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and this time the product seemed sticky which is not how I remember it to be.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a dramatic improvement and plan to try other products from their line.  </li>
            <li> even then hardly anything comes out.</li>
            <li> If I had read about these negative reactions I would never have used it.</li>
            <li> I think the reason it is difficult to get out of the container is that it comes out in a pre-measured dose, so nothing is wasted.</li>
            <li> Everyone has to try this product at least once!  </li>
            <li> BTW, Abzoo replaced the broken bottle with another</li>
            <li> I have to wonder if it wasn&#x27;t a bootleg copy.  </li>
            <li> I believe the product is outdated.</li>
            <li> A lot of money to spend for a product that does not work and is outdated.</li>
            <li> and, when I put it on, I developed horrible rash on my face.  </li>
            <li> was a fake product.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I guess it just comes with age.  </li>
            <li> I remarked how I was not impressed</li>
            <li> Like the product, but the dispenser does not work unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I think it is a fake product.</li>
            <li> After 3 pregnancies, I still had it and it was way worse!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I got a fake.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t take a chance with your appearance or your life by buying this dangerous product.  </li>
            <li> and they said that there are fake bottles being sold on Amazon and that I might of have bought one!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I was shocked to hear this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So I use several of the Vivite Products. And I love the moisturizer and cant say enough about it. The vibrance therapy however I found is just okay. I use it in conjunction with the facial serum (like they recommend) and have not seen any results. I think these two products help moisturize but I have seen no other changes. Its nice because I don&#x27;t have to use as much of the moisturizer, like half the amount. But I don&#x27;t think I will buy these two products again. Maybe I don&#x27;t have the skin problems that other people do and thats why I don&#x27;t see a difference. I was just looking to even out my skin tone. And after one month in, no changes.</li>
            <li> I thought this cream was ok but was kinda weirded out by the box that it came in as it looked a little off in coloring. I than called the company to inquire about the box I received and they said that there are fake bottles being sold on Amazon and that I might of have bought one! I was shocked to hear this.</li>
            <li> I really hoped this product would get rid of my brown spots.  I have been using it twice a day on my face and arms.  So far, it has made absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Vivite Vibrance Therapy for over a year now.  It was a solid product, not as good as hydroquinine-based products, but it did the job.  In March I ordered a refill from a different distributor than I had been using.  Abzoo Corporation sent me a bottle and, when I put it on, I developed horrible rash on my face.  In a manner of hours, my face turned beet-red and developed blisters on my cheekbones and near my mouth.  The dermatologist said it was an allergic reaction to something in the product.  After I stopped using it, my face returned to normal.  Since this was my third bottle of the product, I don&#x27;t think it was the actual cream.  Instead, I think I received a bogus product from this distributor - a fake that didn&#x27;t contain pure ingredients and in fact contained allergenic ones.</li>
            <li> Vivite makes the very best skin care products!  Wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else on my face.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and think this product is wonderful and I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> People have been telling me that my skin is just glowing since I started using this product.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because the product is orange (LOL).  I&#x27;m black with dark skin so I&#x27;m not having the problem that other people may have with the orange color.</li>
            <li> I contacted the maker of Vivite and I was told mostly the Vivite Vibrance Therapy that I purchased was a fake product. Buyers be careful.</li>
            <li> This product does an outstanding job of evening skin tone, fading sun spots and sloughing off dead skin cells for a fresh look.  Have used it for two years now and am a big fan.</li>
            <li> the shipping is very fast, the communication is very good, so far I have not seen any result yet. I don&#x27;t know how long its going to take to see the result for my malesma. I will finish this bottle to see what happens.</li>
            <li> I got a free full size sample of this and fell in love!  I have skin that is fair and combination in type.  I had some light acne scars from having been afflicted with the skin condition as a teen.  Nothing has really helped with my scarring until I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been smoother, the scars have faded, it maintains moisture and I even break out less (my acne flared up again as I entered middle age).  It has a nice scent as well...and just one pump of the product covers my whole face and neck.  I started out using it twice a day for the first few weeks and then went down to once a day.  I have noticed a dramatic improvement and plan to try other products from their line.  I have purchased this product since my free sample ran out.  It&#x27;s amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I can feel it tingle sometimes when I put it on, but I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now &amp; I don&#x27;t seem to notice any fading of dark spots, or any bleaching effect at all for that matter. I&#x27;ve found better results with other products/lines.</li>
            <li> By far the best product on the market.  This was my second purchase--my skin is definitely tighter and brighter--visible difference.  Notice by others--including my physician.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approx. 9 months and have noticed an distinct improvement in my skin after just a few weeks. I am 53 years old, have the typical wrinkles, the occasional pimple, typical drab complexion. This product evened out the color, got rid of dark sports, reduced pores, helped with breakouts and overall gave my skin a much improved, glowing look. Trust me when I say I have tried EVERYTHING on the market spanning 20 years. This one is a keeper-- Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Vivite was introduced to me by a plastic surgeon, I am very happy Amazon is helping me get it in such a speedy way, for a much better price right at my door.  This product does wonders for my skin.  THANK YOU AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> The product did not arrive timely for starters. I believe the product is outdated. The pump dispenser does not work and when I took the dispenser apart the product was a deep yellow color and very thick and dry.  This is either not the same product I have purchased in the past at my local dermatologist or the product is old. A lot of money to spend for a product that does not work and is outdated.</li>
            <li> I started using this 2 yrs ago @ age 32 when I told my local skin clinic about my uneven combination skin.  I tend to get oily on the forehead and nose &amp; dry on my cheeks.  On top of all this my forehead for whatever reason gets darker in the summer than the rest of my face!  I was already using Vivite facial cleanser/scrub &amp; love it!  Sidetrack- the best facial scrub ever created!  Everyone has to try this product at least once!  The scrub evened out my scruffy spots and kept my face from breaking out from time to time.  Before the age of 30 I didn&#x27;t even bother with my skin.  I washed it with hand soap and living in Seattle never occurred to me to use sun screen.  So after consulting with my local skin/laser people (and always make sure they have a real live, working doctor running the place!) I am currently using the Vivite facial scrub, Vivite Vibrance lotion &amp; the Tizo3 tinted sun screen (in place of makeup!).  During this time I have been carded many times buying alcoholic drinks &amp; yes, even lottery tickets!  I have always had an older appearance- @ 16 people always thought I was twenty something, now @ 34 people think I&#x27;m in my twenties.  If that isn&#x27;t results then I don&#x27;t know what is!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  This is the best product I use on my face.</li>
            <li> I am 58 and this stuff has taken years off my face/skin. In my case, it wasn&#x27;t about fading spots - just about texture, wrinkles, overall tone.  I out it on clean skin overnight, then again under makeup in the morning.  I have refilled several times - it lasts a LONG time, so I&#x27;ve been on it about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vibrance Therapy for about 4 months now.  I received a promotional full size sample from the manufacturer and I doubt that I would have ever tried it otherwise, and I certainly didn&#x27;t expect to notice any results, but within a few weeks, friends started to randomly compliment me on my skin.  The compliments are coming fast &amp; furious now -- a few weeks ago I met up with a friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in about 8 months, and he raved about how good I look and went so far as to say that my skin looks like a cosmetics ad.  Even people who can&#x27;t put their finger on how exactly I&#x27;ve changed will tell me that I look rested or relaxed and refreshed.      This product has a yellowish color and a funny smell and it stings and/or itches for the first few weeks of use.  I don&#x27;t get allergic reactions very easily, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned, and I&#x27;m glad I kept up with using it.  Now I&#x27;m hooked.    By the way, the 1 ounce bottle lasts me about 2 months.  I use about 1 1/2 pumps in the morning and about the same before bed if I&#x27;m alone.  If my boyfriend is staying over, I don&#x27;t use it at night.  At that rate, the cost works out to $1.40 per day, which isn&#x27;t much for skin that is so beautiful.    I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product...! This product was endorsed by my Plastic Surgon so I tried it and it worked wonderfully!  I purchased it for $120 and to my surprise I found it here on Amazon for only $50!!! Great product amd great price!t I would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist/Botox doc recommended that I use this for sun damage. Of course, she sells it for over twice as much, so I purchased it here instead along with some other skin products and paid less than 1/2 of what it would&#x27;ve cost me from a medical office. I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin, it appears much smoother and the discoloration is slowly fading. I&#x27;ve only used it for about 3 wks and ordered another bottle so I don&#x27;t run out. I think the reason it is difficult to get out of the container is that it comes out in a pre-measured dose, so nothing is wasted. I store mine upside down, and whack it on the palm of my hand about 4 times before pumping. I&#x27;m also very diligent about using a high-quality sunscreen, from a competitor, that I also purchased through Amazon and saved quite a bit of money doing so. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford such high-end products if not for the fabulous prices offered here.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a few weeks but love how my skin feels.  I have been battling dry skin for over a year and I immediately noticed a difference.  My dermatologist recommended this to minimize some age spots and I haven&#x27;t seen any change yet but understand that can take 8-10 weeks.  I love how it has evened my skin tone already.</li>
            <li> Vivite Vibrance Therapy makes my skin glow.  I get compliments on my skin when I use this product.  Love that I can get it at a better price on Amazon and with reliable merchants.  My dermatologist recommended it about 2 years ago.  I get it for half of what I used to pay for it at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I like this product. i started using it about six months ago and have noticed a difference in my skin. my skin looks more even overall. i am 28 years old and have fairly clear skin, but i have a few brown sun spots, and it has made those less noticeable. i use this only at night. i tried to use it in the mornings as well, but it didnt blend well with my morning products (tinted intellishade made by revision skincare...it has spf 45 and i highly recommend this product as well)...my skin sometimes has difficulty absorbing products. but, i do know women who wear it under their makeup...but i dont. i think that my skin looks noticeably improved in the mornings. it does occasionally sting when i first put it on, but this doesn&#x27;t last long. using this only at night, this product lasts me about 6 months--i only use one squirt.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a plastic surgeon  at the hospital I work at. I initially started using it for dark spots, and while it doesn&#x27;t really get rid of those (I&#x27;ve been using do over 6 months), it gives an amazing complexion that is smooth and radiant. I stopped using it for 3 months because I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the cost, but went back to it. My skin is definitely much nicer with and without makeup. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to even out my skin tone and to diminish age spots.  Been using it for a month and hasn&#x27;t made the slightest difference.  Not going to repurchase after this bottle runs out, especially since it&#x27;s relatively expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I received this product and after pumping and pumping one tiny drop was expelled. I called the sellers and they responded in a reasonable period of time and were quite pleasant. They told me to slap the container against my palm about ten times. I did this and it seems that my problem was solved. Well I have used it a total of three times and with each use I had to go through the slapping routine and even then hardly anything comes out. I think I received a close to empty container. Returning things is such a hassle but I think I will call Amazon and see what they have to say. I will not be buying this product again, even if they replace it.</li>
            <li> Started using this product approx. 3 months ago. Not as good as hydroquinone but look promising. Helped fade sun spots pretty well but I don&#x27;t think it will work on melasma. So far have not experience any side effects. Will continue using it a while longer.</li>
            <li> Terrific night cream which I began to use when Trilateral was no longer available. Like it much better than Triluma which my doctor had prescribed. Easy to go on and eliminates wrinkles</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t spend your money on this product unless you are getting it from a doctor. Even though it&#x27;s half as expensive here (at a Dr&#x27;s office, it&#x27;s $119), you aren&#x27;t getting the actual product. It&#x27;s a waste of money unless you get the product from a Vivite retailer.</li>
            <li> I love this product line. Over the years, I developed uneven tones on my face. Sadly, I guess it just comes with age.  This product is the best I have used for providing an even tone for my dark skin.  Simply, it&#x27;s great, Great, GREAT!</li>
            <li> This product its really good. After 4 weeks i could see a huge difference, the dark spots were almost gone! i also used this product on my back, shoulders and chest. its worthy for sure![[ASIN:B002LAS26Q Vivite Vibrance Therapy, 1-Ounce Pump]]</li>
            <li> Product is sold in high end spas at more than double the price. Daily usage results in removal of rough spots that come with age fairly quickly; it requires longer use for smooth brown spots.</li>
            <li> I got this through a promo offer from my dermatologists office. It was sent to me directly from the Brilliant Distinctions Corporation that manufactures this product. I was 1st taken back from the yellowish tinge it had and the odd (but not offensive) odor. I tried it a couple times and didn&#x27;t like how it made me look jaundiced (or like an &amp;#34;umpah-lumpah&amp;#34;) as I have very fair skin with some freckles. I stopped using it and basically ignored it for 6 months. When I went back to the doctors office I remarked how I was not impressed and the receptionist was surprised saying it really is quite popular with many of his patients so I decided to give it another go.  Well, I figured I would use it only at night (so not to go out publicly with yellow skin) and initially it seemed to leave my skin feeling a bit dried out. I then found the perfect balance and would first apply my normal routine of a night cream moisturizer, followed by using this V. Vibrance. Well, very soon, my skin was quickly looking healthier, toned and rather beautiful! I am now using it regularly and really do like it! I don&#x27;t see any glimpse of yellow in the morning...just a lovely, glowing skin. I will definitely replace this product once finished.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year, along with the rest of the vivite products. I just love the results, I couldn&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see Vivite Vibrance Therapy offered on Amazon at half the price my dermatologist charges for it.  It really works to diminish brown spots and lighten the skin.  However, in the last 6 months, I received two bottles ordered through Amazon, one from Abzoo and one from Forever Young Beauty, with defective pumps.  No amount of thumping would allow more than a drop of the product out of the bottle.  Ever the optimist, I will try one more bottle.  BTW, Abzoo replaced the broken bottle with another but it took 6 weeks to get it.  Unlike Abzoo, Forever Young Beauty cannot be contacted directly but I spoke with Amazon and will be given a credit for the defective bottle.  In both cases, I had to return the defective bottle.</li>
            <li> I noticed my friend&#x27;s skin suddenly looked amazing and asked what she was using on her face.  She told me her dermatologist recommended this product. It has worked wonders for the dark spots and wrinkles on my face. Well worth every penny. For reference, I&#x27;m 34 years old. Be sure to wear sunscreen or you will burn and reverse all of your efforts!</li>
            <li> Worth the cost. Been using the line for 6 months and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products out there for your skin.  I used it in the morning under my moisturizer then again at night.  The results are incredible.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for a couple of years and it does a nice job of keeping my skin tone in check.</li>
            <li> I love my vivite vibrance Therapy the price was a big diff then last year</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it really works, but it remains very compatible to my skin type....which is mature and on the dry side.  I never had any problems with any of the vivite products - plus I feel confident that I will benefit since Allergan is so well regarded in skin care.</li>
            <li> Vivite is the best skin care product I have ever used. It comes in a kit, however this facial serum runs out twice as quickly as the rest of the kit, so be prepared to buy an extra tube.     This price is 1/2 of what my dermatologist charges for the exact same product ... and worth every cent, if you purchase the kit you can expect it to last at least six months.</li>
            <li> This product did not seem to be the same color, texture, or as effective as the one I had previously purchased from my dermatologist.  I have to wonder if it wasn&#x27;t a bootleg copy.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing here again.</li>
            <li> color of serum is slightly darker than ones in the past but other than that amazing! Thank you! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Like the product, but the dispenser does not work unfortunately. I have to take the top off each time to get to the creme.</li>
            <li> So glad you provide this product love it!</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;skin care\\&quot; product needs to be removed from the market by the FDA. I received it free when I bought some other products from my dermatologist. If I had read about these negative reactions I would never have used it. I suspect the positive reviews are fakes written by the company itself.   I used this once  and it seemed ok. Today I used it for the 2nd time and I&#x27;m red as a beet, swollen like a balloon and feel ill.  I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any other skin care product in my life.   Please don&#x27;t take a chance with your appearance or your life by buying this dangerous product.  Amazon should remove it from their store immediately.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love it.  Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I think it is a fake product. It looks a very yellow and smells rancid. I would like to return it.</li>
            <li> This definitely brightens your face as advertised. I use it morning and night. Additionally a little dab will do you as a little will do a lot. To use more just wastes the product.</li>
            <li> A rare problem but the pump doesn&#x27;t work as it arrived loose inside and apparently damaged.  Really a first and otherwise this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks there was a noticable difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  The darks spots faded somewhat; my husband says they are lighter.  I can see that the lighter spots were noticably reduced.</li>
            <li> I had melasma yrs ago from the pill.  After 3 pregnancies, I still had it and it was way worse!  It was on my upper lip and both sides of my face(upper cheek bone).  I tried the bleaching cream w/ hydroq. 4%, retin a, and another prod called Blanche.  I didnt see much difference b/c I prob didnt use them long enough due to the controversial ingred. called hydroquinone(sp?).  A beauty product specialist at a skin spa recommended Vivite(I still used retin a at times, but not too often).  I decided to try it out and after the 1st bottle I noticed a difference and then definitely  noticed more of a difference after the 2nd bottle.  Dont give up if you are not seeing results after the first few weeks.  It really does fade the spots and mine were pretty dark.  I also always wear sunscreen w/ zinc oxide/titanium oxide and sun hats.  I am also not on the pill but I would think if you kept up w/ this product and wore zinc oxide sunscreen, it would prevent it from becoming too dark.  Also- you can find good zinc oxide sunscreens at whole foods,etc that are not as pricey as the \\&quot;spa\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the Vivite Moisturizer with Suncreen SPF 30 and the Vibrance Therapy about 3 months ago.  I am 59 years old.  Honestly, I really see a difference in fine lines.  They are mostly gone!  I&#x27;ve used so many products before and this is the best I have seen for the fine wrinkles.  But I also have many freckles and age spots, along with discoloration from the sun.  I have only seen minimal improvement in this. However, my bottles are almost empty and I am planning to reorder because of the wrinkle advantage.  However, I would love to find a product that improved both of my problems.  Any suggestions?  My dermotogist suggested this product (because they sold it for more than double at their office???)  I bought from Forever Young and think I got the \\&quot;real thing.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  One of the last times I ordered 2 of these, they were defective.  I sent back to the company and 4 months later they came back with no such address.  I decided to try again because I love the product.  Not sure, but I think this is a different distributor, as the last time and this time, they are working properly.  The product is great. I think I must have ordered from the one person selling defects when I had the problem.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the container is not working - nothing iscoming out.  I need to reach out to the vendor.</li>
            <li> Can anyone tell me what color this product is?  I&#x27;m wondering if I got a fake.  When I ordered Vibrance therapy here on Amazon, the color from the pump is a strange yellow color that stains clothing.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely effective product that truly recharges you skin. I am using based on my dermatologist&#x27;s  recommendation and it still is one of the best products in my regimen. I&#x27;ve changed others but  this product  remains  the  best  treatment for softer, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and have been using this product for about 5 years.  When I first started using it so many friends asked what I was doing to my skin.  I&#x27;ve sold it quite a few times to friends and family.  I love that it keeps my skin smooth, no valleys any more and it also keeps the red tone down.  I always have an extra on hand just so I wont run out.  ITS THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li> I order this for my wife from Amazon as an alternative to buying from her doctor.  Of the last 3 orders one was a congealed gooey substance (not normal) and one arrived without the pump used to get the product out of the container.  The third was as advertised.  Very inconsistent.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and this time the product seemed sticky which is not how I remember it to be.</li>
            <li> This product is obviously very old, is discolored and smells rancid.  Also, the expiration date is blacked out on the box.  I would like to return it.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for years and though i still have dark spots on my face due to hormones it feels good and works well with my make up.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended Vivite Vibrance. , I tried it and love it! I&#x27;m 65 and look much younger! I recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I originally got this product from my dermatologist and it worked well. I always search out products on Amazon if I can and there it was. I know others who have reviewed this product gave other opinions and to just get it from your dermatologist but I have never had a problem. All I can say is, if you purchase it from Amazon, and it works for you, make sure it always comes from the same manufacturer. I personally love this but as with any product what works for some may not for others.</li>
            <li> I try to use this every evening before bed. My skin feels wonderful,soft in the morning. Also I think it tightens which is one reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased this product. I have used other items in this line, but I really do think it brightens  and evens your skin and complexion. Amazon has great pricing and I will order again.</li>
            <li> I love VVT! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 or so years and it has truly made my skin vibrant. I&#x27;ve always taken extremely good care of my skin by wearing sunscreen and keeping it hydrated but VVT has ensured that my 40 year old face is even, clear, and free of those pesky fine lines that begin to happen as you get older. It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that when I bought it the first time, was a miracle. When I bought the second time it didn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than a distant relative of what I bought the first time. Too bad because it was amazing at first.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 6 months and have already had compliments about my skin.  I, too, have noticed the smoothness of my skin especially around the nose area.</li>
            <li> I started developing melasma while I was pregnant. I had two huge dark spots on my forehead! When hormones set in after the birth if my daughter, I developed a little acne too. I started using Vivite as soon as I read about it. It&#x27;s a God send! Dark spots and acne gone in about 2 weeks but I noticed a huge difference in about 2 days! I can&#x27;t live without it now. It makes your skin radiant!</li>
            <li> Good price for product.  Has made a difference to my skin.  Would definitely buy from again. Came promptly.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> i love this product.  i use the daily wash, followed by Inova (Inova 4/1 (benzoyl peroxide / salicylic acid) for Acne) and vitamin e treatment, then the vivite anti oxidant, the eye rejuvination cream, and the spf daily moisturizer finished with the vibrance therapy my face shows me love back all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the evening i use the daily wash, the inova night prep, the eye rejuvination cream, the vivite night renewal and finish with the vivite vibrance therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product, have used it for several years now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and have been out for awhile, tried different similar products, they never quite measured up to Vibrance, will not be out again!!</li>
            <li> Gave this 4 stars because it&#x27;s a bit pricey but just love this.. It gives your skin a soft glo.. Very calming to skin and it shows in a short time.. I noticed a dif in a few days..</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this and love the vivite line. Great stuff. See much improvement. Will reorder and keep using to wipe away some of the years.</li>
            <li> My wife and mother use this product and convinced my sister to try it.  They all agree it makes their skin look much better.</li>
            <li> It does help to reduce brown sun/age spots.  My dermatologist recommended the product to me and I use it every day.</li>
