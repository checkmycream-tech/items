            <li>/&gt;This has permanently made its way to my list of Top 5 mascaras.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t clump your lashes.</li>

            <li>This is one of my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it&#x27;s one of my favs.</li>
            <li>Been using this for a long time, it&#x27;s the best at keeping lashes curled.</li>
            <li>No clumping, comes off easy with soap and water, does not irritate eyes.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I love Great Lash and Lash Stiletto, however, this mascara didn&#x27;t add amymore volume or flare to my thinnish and shortish lashes than regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>It clumped so easily, and although the point of the \\&quot;spoon\\&quot; brush was to make applying it easier, it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>It glides on smooth for quite a while.</li>
            <li>The result is simply fabulous.</li>
            <li>but compared to the regular falsies mascara, it&#x27;s not as great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;plus this arrived at my house after a few days of ordering. :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found a great product to offset the cost of the other one</li>
            <li>my new favorite mascara :)</li>
            <li>And I was so excited too to find a mascara that was supposed to give that flared look, but it didn&#x27;t even do that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and stays fresh all day.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>I had used the regular falsies mascara for my brother&#x27;s wedding and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>this product gives me long nice lashes!</li>
            <li>: Went back to my Korres Volcanic Lash, but had a good run with the Maybelline Falsies mascara.</li>
            <li>Maybelline has a few good mascaras, but this is NOT one of them!</li>
            <li>it does what it said I like I am buying more it worth my money thanks.</li>
            <li>, it goes away rather quickly</li>
            <li>This gives good volume if you already have long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It really does make my lashes flared and look full!</li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I thought it had more of a curved brush, but it&#x27;s pretty straight.</li>
            <li>Probably will buy the original one I got in the first place.</li>
            <li>Kind of basic.</li>
            <li>I bought this type to get away from the smell of the last kind</li>
            <li>This mascara is so good that even though I like nicer markup brands for my other products, I still go for this drugstore formula.</li>
            <li>I carry a makeup remover pen with me and it comes right off.</li>
            <li>my lashes more look long and full</li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the really expensive stuff, but this is perfect for me&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used many brands of mascara but keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li>Hope to have better luck next time.</li>
            <li>i really like this mascara!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products, but this one really seems to make my lashes look the fullest and longest.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look so sexy and long</li>
            <li>The color is nice and dark.</li>
            <li>It was smudging more than usual and wasn&#x27;t holding my curl anymore, which is a huge deciding factor for me.</li>
            <li>Love it, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of &amp;quot;flared&amp;quot; lashes at the outside corners of my eyes for that doe-eyed look.</li>
            <li>It really irritated my eyes as well.</li>
            <li>Really does give my lashes a &amp;#34;flare&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The flared brush really helps.</li>
            <li>dono why everyone here hates it so much, but it&#x27;s perfect for my thin asian lashes.</li>
            <li>It coats and separates, creating a great false lash look.</li>
            <li>lot of people like the waterproof version of it more, but I didn&#x27;t notice the difference other than it is REALLY waterproof.</li>
            <li>I love purchasing makeup and I am often tempted by other brands and formulations.</li>
            <li>We love every other mascara from Maybelline but we will never buy this one again.</li>
            <li>Holds a decent curl.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended mascara</li>
            <li>This stuff sucks, to be completely honest.</li>
            <li>I later went on to buy the Maybelline The Colossal Volum&#x27; Express</li>
            <li>But the smell really makes me mad even though it works great to me.</li>
            <li>I had used the regular falsies mascara before when it first came out.</li>
            <li>The first thing I notice about this the moment I open</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this if you&#x27;re going for a low-key, natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only negative thing is that it dries more quickly than other mascara.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes to begin with but this product did not seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>These make my eyelashes look so long, and it especially makes them look really pretty after you use an eyelash curler on them.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this one since I usually prefer a curved brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every kind of mascara--department-store expensive kinds and drugstore varieties.</li>
            <li>It gives me long, dark, pretty lashes.</li>

            <li> It gives me long, dark, pretty lashes.</li>
            <li> Like any other mascara in this price-range, it adds a little to your natural lashes, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the label, nothing much to it.</li>
            <li> : Make sure you wiggle the mascara at the base of your lashes and it will give you more volume and will almost give a subtle &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very dark black, and it makes my lashes look long and pretty.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Falsies Flared one for long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I have gotten several compliments and other girls</li>
            <li> Never pump the mascara wand in the tube either, all it&#x27;s doing is getting air in there and causing it to dry out quicker.</li>
            <li> The brush is a weird spiky thing and when you pull out the wand, it&#x27;s clumped with so much mascara that I cringed at the thought of even putting it near my eye without first wiping at least half of it off...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t getting the same results anymore, maybe the formula has slightly changed?</li>
            <li> and you will be fluttering your big fluffy lashes all day long at everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does dry out quicker than other mascara&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It also seemed to clump after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> and I still have two others I use for different occasions, but this one has become my everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> The formula was drier than what I was used to and thus felt rough on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I tried it because it did not seem to give me the same results as the original formula.  </li>
            <li> It does tend to start to flake towards the end of the day, but other than that I have no complaints and have subscribed to this product to receive it periodically</li>
            <li> I curl my lashes and then use this, &amp; there are no clumps like with other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I first comb my lashes and then apply a clear gel mascara base, and let it dry for 1 minute or so.</li>
            <li> I found no difference from my previous mascara (not Maybelline).  </li>
            <li> I thought it was odd that the mascara smelled like burnt rubber</li>
            <li> With thin lashes, you have to find a dry formula, which is hard to find in drug store brands, but I finally found one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY black, which is nice, but it flakes like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and is horribly clumpy and hard to brush out</li>
            <li> I usually stick with higher-end mascaras</li>
            <li> I am not sure why Mabelline thinks it needs to put scent in their mascara</li>
            <li> Thick.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t usually have ot brush out my mascaras, but this called for it!).</li>
            <li> Pun intended....but seriously, volume,length,no flakes...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does smudge a little throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It does clump after two coats so if you are not fond of the thick clumped lashes look you will want to stick to one or two thin</li>
            <li> and the little flakes get into my eyes, very irritating</li>
            <li> ( and i have bought name brand mascara at Sephora for $15+, only to be disappointed).</li>
            <li> I found it to be flaky and irritating as well.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> and it is just as bad as worse.</li>
            <li> Disappointing as I&#x27;ve never encountered that when purchased in a store.  </li>
            <li> I hate the smell so bad and am so sad that I won&#x27;t be using it bc of the smell.</li>
            <li> Sadly disappointed and will stick with L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous for that purpose for now.</li>
            <li> Buy this, you will not be disappointed for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I hate waterproof mascara becsuse</li>
            <li> but the wand broke inside the tube making my investment worthless.  </li>
            <li> but this mascara isn&#x27;t bad at all!</li>
            <li> it was the awful smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful and does not fade, I could smell it all day.</li>
            <li> This mascara was awful.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love purchasing makeup and I am often tempted by other brands and formulations. However, I keep coming back to Maybelline&#x27;s falsies flared time and time again. I would compare this to Lancome&#x27;s best selling mascara which is 4 - 6x the cost of this one.</li>
            <li> I didnt like it at all. it flakes and is clumpy, it make my lashes look like i havent washed the mascara off for weeks and the little flakes get into my eyes, very irritating</li>
            <li> This mascara is great. My eyelashes look so sexy and long when I put this on.</li>
            <li> Best mascara for the money. I recommend the Falsies Flared one for long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This gives good volume if you already have long eyelashes. Kind of basic. If you pair with a lengthening mascara to add on the tips of lashes it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I had used the regular falsies mascara for my brother&#x27;s wedding and I loved it.  I was excited to try this one since I usually prefer a curved brush.  I was disappointed when I tried it because it did not seem to give me the same results as the original formula.  It is okay.  I have long lashes to begin with but this product did not seem to do much.  It also seemed to clump after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Aweome price&lt;br /&gt;Dry formula&lt;br /&gt;Makes my lashes more look long and full&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Nothing I can think of &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dono why everyone here hates it so much, but it&#x27;s perfect for my thin asian lashes. With thin lashes, you have to find a dry formula, which is hard to find in drug store brands, but I finally found one! It&#x27;s amazing and cheap too! It really does make my lashes flared and look full! Of course it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the really expensive stuff, but this is perfect for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people like the waterproof version of it more, but I didn&#x27;t notice the difference other than it is REALLY waterproof.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so short and stubby this product gives me long nice lashes! My new favorite mascara. Hope they don&#x27;t change this formula.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks, to be completely honest. The brush is a weird spiky thing and when you pull out the wand, it&#x27;s clumped with so much mascara that I cringed at the thought of even putting it near my eye without first wiping at least half of it off...but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try anyways. It&#x27;s VERY black, which is nice, but it flakes like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and is horribly clumpy and hard to brush out (I don&#x27;t usually have ot brush out my mascaras, but this called for it!). It really irritated my eyes as well. Maybelline has a few good mascaras, but this is NOT one of them! I&#x27;d recomend the one in the coral tube (One by one, I believe it&#x27;s called).</li>
            <li> I had used the regular falsies mascara before when it first came out. But ran out of that one and for the longest time I haven&#x27;t bought another one. Went and check it out so I can buy another one. Bought this one out of the 4 or 5 options they have of the falsies. The first thing I notice about this the moment I open it was the awful smell. I hate the smell so bad and am so sad that I won&#x27;t be using it bc of the smell. Probably will buy the original one I got in the first place. But the smell really makes me mad even though it works great to me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the package advertising \\&quot;volumizes lashes up and out\\&quot;.  I found no difference from my previous mascara (not Maybelline).  The smell is awful and does not fade, I could smell it all day. It made my eyes burn and tear. I only used it twice and had flakes both times.  I will be returning this!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but I&#x27;m on my second tube and wanted to leave a review anyway. I usually stick with higher-end mascaras and I still have two others I use for different occasions, but this one has become my everyday mascara. It gives me long, dark, pretty lashes. I am a HUGE fan of &amp;quot;flared&amp;quot; lashes at the outside corners of my eyes for that doe-eyed look. I only use one coat, so I&#x27;ve never had issues with clumping. Holds a decent curl. Unfortunately, it does smudge a little throughout the day. I carry a makeup remover pen with me and it comes right off. I&#x27;d recommend this if you&#x27;re going for a low-key, natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/17/14 edit: Went back to my Korres Volcanic Lash, but had a good run with the Maybelline Falsies mascara. I wasn&#x27;t getting the same results anymore, maybe the formula has slightly changed? It was smudging more than usual and wasn&#x27;t holding my curl anymore, which is a huge deciding factor for me. Oh well!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Have used many brands of mascara but keep coming back to this. I don&#x27;t have issues with clumping, it separates my lashes well, and it lasts. It&#x27;s not waterproof but I hate waterproof mascara becsuse it&#x27;s so challenging to remove. This mascara is so good that even though I like nicer markup brands for my other products, I still go for this drugstore formula. Winner.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it flaking. Nor did it have a funky smell. It didn&#x27;t clump either, and the wand also wasn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my sister and I both discovered that when you try to wash this supposed-washable stuff off, our eyelashes actually started coming out! We love every other mascara from Maybelline but we will never buy this one again. And I was so excited too to find a mascara that was supposed to give that flared look, but it didn&#x27;t even do that.</li>
            <li> No clumping, comes off easy with soap and water, does not irritate eyes. Lasts all day long. Highly recommended mascara</li>
            <li> There are so many designer brand mascaras out there, but none of them that I&#x27;ve tried compare to Falsies Flared. It coats and separates, creating a great false lash look. I love love love it! This is my 3rd tube.</li>
            <li> I tried so many but this one I really love  it does what it said I like I am buying more it worth my money thanks.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara a lot. It doesn&#x27;t deposit itself around or beneath my eyes throughout the day.  It glides on smooth for quite a while. It does dry out quicker than other mascara&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products, but this one really seems to make my lashes look the fullest and longest. It does tend to start to flake towards the end of the day, but other than that I have no complaints and have subscribed to this product to receive it periodically so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> An excellent product.</li>
            <li> Really does give my lashes a &amp;#34;flare&amp;#34; effect which makes them appear fuller and thicker. Great product!</li>
            <li> These make my eyelashed look longer andf fuller.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Like most mascaras they over promise. the supposed fibers don;t do much, I actually question if there are any. the brush is too bendy. Like any other mascara in this price-range, it adds a little to your natural lashes, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the label, nothing much to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love Great Lash and Lash Stiletto, however, this mascara didn&#x27;t add amymore volume or flare to my thinnish and shortish lashes than regular mascara.  I found it to be flaky and irritating as well.  Sadly disappointed and will stick with L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous for that purpose for now.</li>
            <li> Generally I love this mascara brand but the wand broke inside the tube making my investment worthless.  Disappointing as I&#x27;ve never encountered that when purchased in a store.  Hope to have better luck next time.</li>
            <li> Title says it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put on three coats of this and you will be fluttering your big fluffy lashes all day long at everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark. Thick. It does clump after two coats so if you are not fond of the thick clumped lashes look you will want to stick to one or two thin coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has permanently made its way to my list of Top 5 mascaras.</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I do have a system that might be helpful to you. I first comb my lashes and then apply a clear gel mascara base, and let it dry for 1 minute or so. Then I apply the Falsies mascara. The result is simply fabulous.</li>
            <li> i really like this mascara! but compared to the regular falsies mascara, it&#x27;s not as great. i prefer a wetter formula and longer brush the regular falsies mascara has but this mascara isn&#x27;t bad at all! and the price makes it even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;plus this arrived at my house after a few days of ordering. :D</li>
            <li> I am not sure why Mabelline thinks it needs to put scent in their mascara but it is VILE. I bought this type to get away from the smell of the last kind and it is just as bad as worse. Gross.</li>
            <li> I thought it had more of a curved brush, but it&#x27;s pretty straight. It&#x27;s a very dark black, and it makes my lashes look long and pretty.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the bomb!...after 3 coats it looks like falsies! Pun intended....but seriously, volume,length,no flakes...all that!</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome!!!  I curl my lashes and then use this, &amp; there are no clumps like with other mascaras.  SO impressed, my new favorite mascara :)</li>
            <li> This mascara was awful. It clumped so easily, and although the point of the \\&quot;spoon\\&quot; brush was to make applying it easier, it just didn&#x27;t do it for me. The formula was drier than what I was used to and thus felt rough on my eyelashes. I thought it was odd that the mascara smelled like burnt rubber, it goes away rather quickly but not the most pleasant thing to smell in the morning. I later went on to buy the Maybelline The Colossal Volum&#x27; Express and I liked it much better.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I have used in a long time. ( and i have bought name brand mascara at Sephora for $15+, only to be disappointed). Since I started using it I have gotten several compliments and other girls asking me what mascara I use. Buy this, you will not be disappointed for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Make sure you wiggle the mascara at the base of your lashes and it will give you more volume and will almost give a subtle &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34; effect. Never pump the mascara wand in the tube either, all it&#x27;s doing is getting air in there and causing it to dry out quicker. Hope this helps anyone reading this.</li>
            <li> These make my eyelashes look so long, and it especially makes them look really pretty after you use an eyelash curler on them.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t clump your lashes. The color is nice and dark. The only negative thing is that it dries more quickly than other mascara.</li>
            <li> thank you so much&lt;br /&gt; I love this mascara and another&lt;br /&gt;I bought from 1 year and I bought again and i am buying again</li>
            <li> Love it! Great lashes with out breaking the bank. . Volume with no clumps. This is one of my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the $30 mascara I was buying. I&#x27;m glad I found a great product to offset the cost of the other one</li>
            <li> Love it, that&#x27;s why I gave it in auto ship !</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it&#x27;s one of my favs.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a long time, it&#x27;s the best at keeping lashes curled. The flared brush really helps. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every kind of mascara--department-store expensive kinds and drugstore varieties. My lashes are thinning a bit and this mascara is the best I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s easy to put on and stays fresh all day. You just can&#x27;t beat the price or the value.</li>
