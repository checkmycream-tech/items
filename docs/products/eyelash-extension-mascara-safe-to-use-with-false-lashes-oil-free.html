            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This mascra works great and its comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Best to just add it on the natural lashes and go on with your day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have eyelash extensions but want some extra lift once in a while, this is the perfect mascara.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and must say I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this with my lash extensions.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff</li>
            <li>and I love that I can wear it with extensions.  </li>
            <li>so far its great</li>
            <li>Comes off easily with soap &amp; water.</li>
            <li>Since its oil-free it&#x27;s also easy to remove.</li>
            <li>After searching my whole life, this is by far the best mascara i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different Mascaras over the years, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this mascara to work great on both lash extensions, and my regular lashes.</li>
            <li>Needed oil free.  </li>
            <li>This was my 1st non-oil mascara and it works perfect, no clumps, makes my lashes pop, removes easily, no stress, no fuss.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>next day but loved the mascara</li>
            <li>I love it, it looks like something you would buy from a high end department store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to apply a product once throughout the day, with no clumping, and have beautiful long, thick lashes.</li>
            <li>be back to order more!</li>
            <li>but when I got my Eyes Lashes Extension did resarch and found out this one was a good one, compared to the other ones I used before, this mascara is half of the price and just a good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick, which many mascara a are not.</li>
            <li>Many mascaras tend to be clumpy, dry out too quickly, you have to reapply it throughout the day, and/or the brush isn&#x27;t exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>The Nova Mascara works very well and actually IS good for my extensions and doesn&#x27;t make them fall out, which means she has less work to do when I return for my fills.  </li>
            <li>I never have to try anything else because it works awesome on my fake and real lashes ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>For anyone with extensions knows one thing is certain</li>
            <li>Love it, it is creamy, thick and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>mascara is also very lumpy.</li>
            <li>The wand it comes with catches too much product</li>
            <li>This is high quality mascara!  </li>
            <li>I now have to grow back some of my own eyelashes to get the lushness back in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this mascara (by recommendation) to use on my first set of professionally applied eyelash extensions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: I have experienced it come off at times during the day, but leaves a residue that is incredibly difficult to remove with soap &amp; water.  </li>
            <li>I loved this mascara so much when I had fake eyelashes that I kept buying it after I started using Lumagen instead.</li>
            <li>so i usually have to apply it more than once per day.</li>
            <li>My only request is that they please make a waterproof version because my eyelids are very oily.</li>
            <li>It still lasts me the vast majority of the day, but I&#x27;d really like to go to the beach and not worry about it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know where you can buy it because I get mine directly from the gal that does my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is soft and not clumpy at all.  </li>
            <li>After wearing it, they were silky and soft.</li>
            <li>would never use this for natural lashes -</li>
            <li>it is not as thick as regular mascara but looks nice when applied.</li>
            <li>Im new to extensions, but wanted to do what I had too, to make them last.</li>
            <li>If you have fake lashes it really helps to make them pop :)</li>
            <li>I have used the mascara on my own lashes as it does seem to fill out my thin lashes (still having the same issues of smudging).</li>
            <li>it is not a great mascara, but it is an ok mascara for lash extensions.</li>
            <li>Made extensions even more dramatic and worked well.</li>
            <li>It is enough to get black mascara on a towel, but not enough to really see on the lashes.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different Mascaras over the years, and this one is by far the best. Many mascaras tend to be clumpy, dry out too quickly, you have to reapply it throughout the day, and/or the brush isn&#x27;t exactly what you&#x27;re looking for. I&#x27;ve found this mascara to work great on both lash extensions, and my regular lashes. It&#x27;s nice to be able to apply a product once throughout the day, with no clumping, and have beautiful long, thick lashes. Awesome!</li>
            <li> clumps a bit on the brush.</li>
            <li> this is so thick the mascara come out in clumps,  I would never order again with my extensions</li>
            <li> I loved this mascara so much when I had fake eyelashes that I kept buying it after I started using Lumagen instead. It&#x27;s nice and thick, which many mascara a are not. My only request is that they please make a waterproof version because my eyelids are very oily. It still lasts me the vast majority of the day, but I&#x27;d really like to go to the beach and not worry about it.</li>
            <li> worked perfect for my extentions</li>
            <li> Better off not putting it on; made my lashes look horrible. Best to just add it on the natural lashes and go on with your day.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy it again, why wear extension&#x27;s just to cover them and mess them up. Just my opinon.</li>
            <li> Mascara is almost waxy. Not at all water based or it would without a doubt come off with ease while I wash my fave to remove my make up or even shower. I&#x27;ve had lash extensions for years and this is the type of mascara you want to avoid! It&#x27;s almost waterproof in my opinion! For anyone with extensions knows one thing is certain, that&#x27;s a tragedy. No good. Not satisfied to say the very least.</li>
            <li> This was great for what I needed. Im new to extensions, but wanted to do what I had too, to make them last. You should&#x27;nt use oil basesd mascara, so I found this and it was great! Made extensions even more dramatic and worked well. Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Needed oil free.  Seems to work well on non-extended lashes.  Fairly waterproof.  Will smudge if you try.</li>
            <li> This was my 1st non-oil mascara and it works perfect, no clumps, makes my lashes pop, removes easily, no stress, no fuss.</li>
            <li> I used this mascara on my eye lash extensions and just about lost all of them within a weeks time.  I was rather pissed off.  I now have to grow back some of my own eyelashes to get the lushness back in my eyelashes.  The person that puts on my eye lash extensions swears by Nova Mascara, so I bought that from her.  The Nova Mascara works very well and actually IS good for my extensions and doesn&#x27;t make them fall out, which means she has less work to do when I return for my fills.  I will not use anything else  I don&#x27;t know where you can buy it because I get mine directly from the gal that does my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  mascara is also very lumpy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara (by recommendation) to use on my first set of professionally applied eyelash extensions.&lt;br /&gt;I am not used to wearing washable mascara.  It does remove with ease... which is both convenient and inconvenient (smudges easily and I felt as if I needed to reapply during the day).  Once I began using the mascara (less than 1 week from the application of my lashes) I noticed that my extensions started twisting, loosening and falling off.  Within 5 days, they were all gone - which was very disappointing!  I have used the mascara on my own lashes as it does seem to fill out my thin lashes (still having the same issues of smudging).</li>
            <li> Definitely wipe the brush off before using this mascara or you will have globs everywhere.</li>
            <li> Just one stroke of mascara &amp; my lashes look thicker &amp; fuller. I can wear this all day without any smears or smudges. Comes off easily with soap &amp; water.</li>
            <li> If you have eyelash extensions but want some extra lift once in a while, this is the perfect mascara.  It is soft and not clumpy at all.  You can build even fuller more beautiful lashes but then it comes off in the shower with a little baby shampoo.  Love it!</li>
            <li> little clumpy - not sure what makes it&lt;br /&gt;different from regular mascara</li>
            <li> clumply gives no extra volume will not buy ever again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago when I decided to get eyelash extensions and so far its great the mascara has a great brush and doesnt go on clumpy and when removing it I haven&#x27;t been losing any lashes. I would use this mascara even if I didnt have extensions because the application is so great. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this and must say I am pleased. It put just a little bit on and then use a spare wand to brush through my lash extensions. The wand it comes with catches too much product and I only like a little on mine. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my Novalash extensions- it is not as thick as regular mascara but looks nice when applied. The product doesn&#x27;t last long so i usually have to apply it more than once per day. Washes off with plain water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have false lashes but this product almost was like conditioner for my lashes. After wearing it, they were silky and soft. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Great mascara for eyelash extensions!</li>
            <li> works well. wish it went on a little thicker</li>
            <li> The good:  It is a mascara that is supposed to be removed with soap &amp; water.  There is nothing in the product that loosens the lash extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: I have experienced it come off at times during the day, but leaves a residue that is incredibly difficult to remove with soap &amp; water.  It is enough to get black mascara on a towel, but not enough to really see on the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never use this for natural lashes - it is not a great mascara, but it is an ok mascara for lash extensions.</li>
            <li> I love this with my lash extensions. It gives it that mascara look so people don&#x27;t know you have extensions.</li>
            <li> This is high quality mascara!  I love the stuff and I love that I can wear it with extensions.  Sometimes before a fill it helps them look fuller.  I love it, it looks like something you would buy from a high end department store.</li>
            <li> I have always used &amp;#34;Brand Names&amp;#34; expensive mascara but when I got my Eyes Lashes Extension did resarch and found out this one was a good one, compared to the other ones I used before, this mascara is half of the price and just a good. Love it, it is creamy, thick and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> This mascra works great and its comes off easily with soap and water. If you have fake lashes it really helps to make them pop :)</li>
            <li> Was great with my lash extensions, did have some flaking. But over all it made my lashes POP!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it, dumped me&lt;br /&gt;The next day but loved the mascara</li>
            <li> the perfect amount of thickness for my eyelash extensions. doesnt clump or flake. stays put.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this mascara it goes on beautifully, no clumping and adds a little extra where I need eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Will be back to order more!</li>
            <li> This mascara has a very light silky feel, which is great for real lashes and perfect for las extensions.  Since its oil-free it&#x27;s also easy to remove.</li>
            <li> After searching my whole life, this is by far the best mascara i&#x27;ve ever used. I never have to try anything else because it works awesome on my fake and real lashes ðŸ˜Š I love it so much!</li>
