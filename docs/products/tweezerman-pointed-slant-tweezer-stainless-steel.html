            <li>That service alone makes this product a wonderful purchase as you really get your money&#x27;s worth with these amazing tweezers.</li>
            <li>about a fine piece of workmanship !  </li>
            <li>Very precise and does not let the finer hairs slip through.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>product could be better</li>
            <li>I love this tweezers.</li>
            <li>i love these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I make sure I always have a pair of tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>Cut the mails of my two toddlers better than anything.</li>
            <li>Purchased 4 items, satisfied with every one.</li>
            <li>Hope with practice and more pressure closer to the hair and tweezer tips - I will be able to make use of them.</li>
            <li>Love the slant on these.</li>
            <li>Great quality and very grippy.</li>
            <li>I have owned many pairs of slanted Tweezerman tweezers and have trusted this brand, until now.</li>
            <li>Love the pointed slant.</li>
            <li>I only use the slanted one because it&#x27;s the best to get even the smallest, thinnest hairs.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I have always bought Tweezerman Tweezers, so I expected that this one would be equally wonderful.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use, felt super hygienic, and made plucking a breeze.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and perfect for getting out ingrown hairs or splinters.  </li>
            <li>Loved it - high quality, sharp, works excellently.</li>
            <li>The product got lost in shipment and the seller was very quick in responding and sending a replacement.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for good quality tweezers that were not real expensive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for a month and still going strong.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>They have a perfect slanted angle, and super sharp edges and point.</li>
            <li>I know they say they will sharpen them for free,</li>
            <li>These are fantastic.</li>
            <li>May as well go to target and buy a cheap pair-same thing.</li>
            <li>Cheap twezzers!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased and used lots of different tweezers over the years, and I have to tell you that these are absolutely great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works best if you lie the whole edge flat rather than the pointed end of the tweezer.</li>
            <li>Nice feel in the hand, not ridiculously priced, and well made.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get these tweezers</li>
            <li>I have not had my original purchase sharpened; however,, I thought it was about time to get them sharpened after 15+ years.  </li>
            <li>I purchased another pair of Tweezerman Tweezers to use while the original pair is being sharpened.  </li>
            <li>Should say more effective for the real tiny chin or eyebrow</li>
            <li>This is great for pulling single hairs or digging out pesky splinters.</li>
            <li>These get those dots right out of there and quickly!</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase because I knew the first one was great.  </li>
            <li>inside of the tip should be sharpened with a coarse/medium grind to help hold the hair during removal, but the grind needs to be perpendicular to the length of the hair, this is true for 1 tip</li>
            <li>I have used this particular tweezer for many years.  </li>
            <li>MAKE QUICK WORK OUT OF TASKS</li>
            <li>These are wonderful for those of us who are total perfectionists and want every last hair plucked from our eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for these because of the slant - thinking I could get under the hairs better and have a better view with my hand and tweezers off to the side more.</li>
            <li>have been wanting a good tweezers for a long time..  </li>
            <li>I finally dropped them on their tips so many times it wasn&#x27;t worth sending them to the company to re sharpen (which is free by the way).</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>We have other pairs to compare them to, and it became very obvious that these were the best tweezers we had ever owned.</li>
            <li>but oh so sharp and good metal.</li>
            <li>Very well made and definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>and I found the right ones.</li>
            <li>so when the arrived I tried them right away on my eye brows.  </li>
            <li>I thought that if I paid a little more for a pair of tweezers that I would get better quality</li>
            <li>At first, when I opened up these tweezers, I didn&#x27;t think I would like them.  </li>
            <li>and you know exactly which hair you are pulling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the tweezer is light not heavy</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my wife and she works in salons and has tried many different ones in her years, She absolutely loves these as they grab the thinnest and smallest of hairs!</li>
            <li>I just purchased two for my teenage granddaughters as gifts, they love them.  </li>
            <li>Tweezerman offers free sharpening for the life of the tweezers if you ship it to them.  </li>
            <li>The sharp point works quite well, and is great for tiny hairs and those targeted whiskery ones.</li>
            <li>plucking made easy (and hardly ever more than one attempt needed).</li>
            <li>High quality tweezers to add to my first aid kit.</li>
            <li>I highly recommand this one!</li>
            <li>Really let you get in there and pluck away.</li>
            <li>Yes I really do like it.</li>
            <li>More expensive than many others but definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>and we have been using these tweezers for the whole time.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your time.</li>
            <li>It says stainless steel, but they feel like they are made of cheap metal; nowhere near the spring of my old ones.</li>
            <li>I works better than the Revlon tweezer I have for certain areas of the face, but is too pointed for other areas.</li>
            <li>I still have several of my original tweezers.  </li>
            <li>It was even easy to get hairs that were normally kind of difficult to maneuver to pull out.</li>
            <li>As many have said, these are very good tweezers for removing stubborn hairs, thick or thin.</li>
            <li>these things are sharp, precise, and very well made !  </li>
            <li>sharp, precise, good grip and half price as in local drug stores.</li>
            <li>Now my 19 year old daughter wants a air</li>
            <li>They are my favorite of the tweezerman products (and I have quite a few).  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra $.</li>
            <li>One is slanted and the other is a fine tip.</li>
            <li>: works well solid construction large area close to the tip to apply large force while maintaining precision  CONs: 1.</li>
            <li>These tweezers live up to their claim.  </li>
            <li>So when we bought a new house that had additional bathrooms, we bought a pair for every bathroom.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and make it easy to pluck even the finest, thinnest hair.</li>
            <li>The last two I bought the ends were thicker and didn&#x27;t work as well as they had since I got the first set.  </li>
            <li>Ingrown hairs, extra coarse hairs, or really short hairs are all easily grabbed and removed using these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Always a firm grisp on fine or course hair...</li>
            <li>Clearly the precision has been sacrificed to the almighty dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>almost* completely beneath the skin (like wood splinters and metal shavings).  </li>
            <li>I can tweeze my eyebrows and pull the stubborn hairs that my old tweezers could not pull out.  </li>
            <li>The quality of these tweezers will far outweigh any sticker shock in the end.</li>
            <li>They do not work as well as my old ones did either.</li>
            <li>Much easier to maneuver then regular slant tip.</li>
            <li>It does a professional job...</li>
            <li>They are very pointed and I am used to tweezers with a flat end.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like for them to go back to the older way.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for any men who have similar issues.</li>
            <li>Thus far it&#x27;s infinitely better than my 2 year old tweezer I had been struggling with for the past few months, but that doesn&#x27;t say much.</li>
            <li>outside of the tips were sharpened with a coarse grind, instead of a polish grind, very unprofessional 2.</li>
            <li>They certainly aren&#x27;t the holy grail of tweezers, based upon what other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>am giving 3 stars only because they still work better than cheap tweezers, but I am bitterly disappointed with the reduced quality.</li>
            <li>Picks up splinters and other tiny objects very well and can grab items that are *</li>
            <li>it seems like a simple thing, but tweezers can really help u get ready quickly or slowly.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using them, since I paid so much for them, but it will take me a little while to adjust myself to them.</li>

            <li> High quality tweezers to add to my first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommand this one!</li>
            <li> Really let you get in there and pluck away.</li>
            <li> Yes I really do like it.</li>
            <li> More expensive than many others but definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> and we have been using these tweezers for the whole time.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your time.</li>
            <li> It says stainless steel, but they feel like they are made of cheap metal; nowhere near the spring of my old ones.</li>
            <li> I works better than the Revlon tweezer I have for certain areas of the face, but is too pointed for other areas.</li>
            <li> I still have several of my original tweezers.  </li>
            <li> It was even easy to get hairs that were normally kind of difficult to maneuver to pull out.</li>
            <li> As many have said, these are very good tweezers for removing stubborn hairs, thick or thin.</li>
            <li> these things are sharp, precise, and very well made !  </li>
            <li> sharp, precise, good grip and half price as in local drug stores.</li>
            <li> Now my 19 year old daughter wants a air</li>
            <li> They are my favorite of the tweezerman products (and I have quite a few).  </li>
            <li> Worth the extra $.</li>
            <li> One is slanted and the other is a fine tip.</li>
            <li> : works well solid construction large area close to the tip to apply large force while maintaining precision  CONs: 1.</li>
            <li> These tweezers live up to their claim.  </li>
            <li> So when we bought a new house that had additional bathrooms, we bought a pair for every bathroom.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and make it easy to pluck even the finest, thinnest hair.</li>
            <li> The last two I bought the ends were thicker and didn&#x27;t work as well as they had since I got the first set.  </li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs, extra coarse hairs, or really short hairs are all easily grabbed and removed using these tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Always a firm grisp on fine or course hair...</li>
            <li> Clearly the precision has been sacrificed to the almighty dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> almost* completely beneath the skin (like wood splinters and metal shavings).  </li>
            <li> I can tweeze my eyebrows and pull the stubborn hairs that my old tweezers could not pull out.  </li>
            <li> The quality of these tweezers will far outweigh any sticker shock in the end.</li>
            <li> They do not work as well as my old ones did either.</li>
            <li> Much easier to maneuver then regular slant tip.</li>
            <li> It does a professional job...</li>
            <li> They are very pointed and I am used to tweezers with a flat end.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like for them to go back to the older way.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for any men who have similar issues.</li>
            <li> Thus far it&#x27;s infinitely better than my 2 year old tweezer I had been struggling with for the past few months, but that doesn&#x27;t say much.</li>
            <li> outside of the tips were sharpened with a coarse grind, instead of a polish grind, very unprofessional 2.</li>
            <li> They certainly aren&#x27;t the holy grail of tweezers, based upon what other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> am giving 3 stars only because they still work better than cheap tweezers, but I am bitterly disappointed with the reduced quality.</li>
            <li> Picks up splinters and other tiny objects very well and can grab items that are *</li>
            <li> it seems like a simple thing, but tweezers can really help u get ready quickly or slowly.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using them, since I paid so much for them, but it will take me a little while to adjust myself to them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this new pair and find that the quality has gone way down.</li>
            <li> My only problem with them is that the flat part of the slanted end does not grip well</li>
            <li> , I have to put extra pressure on the tweezers to grab with the flat part.</li>
            <li> As another stated in their review, &amp;#34;does not grip well, I have to put extra pressure on the tweezers to grab with the flat part&amp;#34;,  </li>
            <li> One that&#x27;s flat and one that&#x27;s pointy.</li>
            <li> Plus I really have to squeeze hard to get them to come all the way together, sort of out of alignment or something like that.</li>
            <li> I have never paid this much for tweezers, but I am tired of not being able to get the tough thick hairs till they grow out enough (barely breaking the skin, not grabbable yet viewable) .</li>
            <li> So it was a complete waste of money, and I even used a gift certificate to buy it.</li>
            <li> These are ordinary tweezers, they get the job done, but I don&#x27;t notice any extra grip on hairs compared to generic tweezers.</li>
            <li> So when you need that pair of tweezers to get the microscopic ingrown painful hair, you will be glad you bought a pair of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this again in 6 months or so if the end dulls (or if it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> One needs to use it carefully.</li>
            <li> All of my other tweezers I threw out.</li>
            <li> I was very curious as to what a $20 pair of tweezers can do.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost at all</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have at least half a dozen different tweezers (I&#x27;ve traveled a lot and always seems to forget my tweezers at home).</li>
            <li> For some reason Tweezerman decided to change it slightly.  </li>
            <li> I do not like having those little black looking dots there</li>
            <li> can get the tiniest little hairs.</li>
            <li> Boy have I wasted a lot of money over the years bug</li>
            <li> I use to use only Tweezerman, but lately they have not been as thin in the blade as they use to be.  </li>
            <li> They just do not get the small hairs that you need to get.</li>
            <li> when i got these i could not believe what i have been missing out on !</li>
            <li> I have bought these tweezers in the past and continue to do so.  </li>
            <li> Along the entire slanted edge, there is a gap, making them useless for pulling hair.</li>
            <li> but not the other tip on my tweezer 3. expensive for such a poor quality</li>
            <li> If you want a pair of tweezers that gets the \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; and \\&quot;small stuff,\\&quot; this product is what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> In order to snag small hairs you must grip the tweezer at the tip rather than in the middle making it very difficult to see if you are tweezing the hair or just your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several types of Tweezerman tweezers and am always  disappointed at how soon they become dull.</li>
            <li> These are not as thin as I had hoped they would be.  </li>
            <li> Even thin hairs - can&#x27;t grab &#x27;em.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy about this and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any recourse.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are expensive, but they work great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The angle sometimes makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> These also eliminate pulling out the wrong hair (eyebrows) because they are pointed</li>
            <li> Sadly, for me, they&#x27;re useless</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it was not the case with these tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I dropped them onto tile</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a completely useless tweezer.</li>
            <li> Very expensive.</li>
            <li> Wrong wrong wrong!!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s to bad.  </li>
            <li> I just put them in the basket and was shocked that they cost twenty dollars.</li>
            <li> So disappointing!  </li>
            <li> Considering its popularity, I was disappointed with it because of the two points.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find out that they did not work.  </li>
            <li> Very thin do not like at all!!!</li>

            <li> These tweezers are expensive, but they work great.&lt;br /&gt;I use them for hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy them again if price isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good.  The angle sometimes makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular tweezer for many years.  For some reason Tweezerman decided to change it slightly.  The last two I bought the ends were thicker and didn&#x27;t work as well as they had since I got the first set.  I&#x27;d like for them to go back to the older way.  I think it may be time for me to try something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several types of Tweezerman tweezers and am always  disappointed at how soon they become dull. I know they say they will sharpen them for free, but it is such a bother to get them sent back that I don&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This type is more effective and I hope will last longer.  Should say more effective for the real tiny chin or eyebrow hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works best if you lie the whole edge flat rather than the pointed end of the tweezer.</li>
            <li> THE MOST PERFECT TWEEZERS I HAVE EVER USED. MAKE QUICK WORK OUT OF TASKS SUCH AS BROW OUTLINING AND PLUCKING. PLUCK THE FINEST TO THE COARSEST HAIRS.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is the best choice</li>
            <li> I have been using Tweezerman tweezers exclusively for 30+ years.  I still have several of my original tweezers.  They are outstanding!</li>
            <li> The product got lost in shipment and the seller was very quick in responding and sending a replacement. The tweezers have arrived today and I must say-I was very curious as to what a $20 pair of tweezers can do. Well, now I know. These are fantastic. They are very sharp and make it easy to pluck even the finest, thinnest hair. Very smooth product!</li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs, extra coarse hairs, or really short hairs are all easily grabbed and removed using these tweezers.  They are my favorite of the tweezerman products (and I have quite a few).  If you just want one pair of tweezers that will do everything, get these.</li>
            <li> product could be better</li>
            <li> These are NOT the pointed tweezers they were advertised to be. I don&#x27;t recommend. They are of no use. May as well go to target and buy a cheap pair-same thing. Still looking doe the good ones like the ones I&#x27;m trying to replace.</li>
            <li> PROs: works well solid construction large area close to the tip to apply large force while maintaining precision  CONs: 1. outside of the tips were sharpened with a coarse grind, instead of a polish grind, very unprofessional 2. inside of the tip should be sharpened with a coarse/medium grind to help hold the hair during removal, but the grind needs to be perpendicular to the length of the hair, this is true for 1 tip but not the other tip on my tweezer 3. expensive for such a poor quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a couple of this brand.  Nice feel in the hand, not ridiculously priced, and well made.  Picks up splinters and other tiny objects very well and can grab items that are *almost* completely beneath the skin (like wood splinters and metal shavings).  Yep, good times...</li>
            <li> I have at least half a dozen different tweezers (I&#x27;ve traveled a lot and always seems to forget my tweezers at home). These tweezers are my absolute favorite! Always a firm grisp on fine or course hair...plucking made easy (and hardly ever more than one attempt needed). Worth the extra $.</li>
            <li> These tweezers live up to their claim.  The grab and hold the hair to tweeze.  I would definetly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers. Pointed tip gets even the smallest and finest hairs when tweeting eyebrows. I had been looking for good quality tweezers that were not real expensive and I found the right ones. Now my 19 year old daughter wants a air also so guess I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a tweezers an product I didn&#x27;t like. This is great for pulling single hairs or digging out pesky splinters. A must in every mans medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Boy have I wasted a lot of money over the years bug Cheap twezzers!&lt;br /&gt;If you want a rolls-royce of twezzers look no further!!!&lt;br /&gt;Sharp and it wholes on big time when you want to pull anything !&lt;br /&gt;Wow, it work AWESOME...Just Buy It!</li>
            <li> At first, when I opened up these tweezers, I didn&#x27;t think I would like them.  They are very pointed and I am used to tweezers with a flat end.  However, I now find these tweezers are great. I can tweeze my eyebrows and pull the stubborn hairs that my old tweezers could not pull out.  These also eliminate pulling out the wrong hair (eyebrows) because they are pointed and you know exactly which hair you are pulling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend these tweezers for anyone!</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li> They just do not get the small hairs that you need to get. I just would not recommend this tweezer.</li>
            <li> I love this tweezers. I used to have to use two different kinds. One that&#x27;s flat and one that&#x27;s pointy. With this one you get both in one.I highly recommand this one!</li>
            <li> i love these tweezers.  it seems like a simple thing, but tweezers can really help u get ready quickly or slowly.  I make sure I always have a pair of tweezerman.  they are by far, the best tweezers ever made.</li>
            <li> have been wanting a good tweezers for a long time..  when i got these i could not believe what i have been missing out on !&lt;br /&gt;talk about a fine piece of workmanship !  these things are sharp, precise, and very well made !  no more trying to pull the same hair out 3 or 4 times in a row,  jajajaja  am getting ready to order another pair for the wifey !</li>
            <li> Nice tweezers.  I&#x27;ve used them for a month and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost at all</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t grasp anything.  Sadly, for me, they&#x27;re useless</li>
            <li> Tweezerman Tweezers are the best! I&#x27;ve purchased and used lots of different tweezers over the years, and I have to tell you that these are absolutely great. Use a magnifying mirror. If you can see it, these babies can remove it. Because they have such a good grip on the tiniest of hairs, you won&#x27;t find yourself going back over and over again, wasting time and getting frustrated. Word of warning: take good care of them. Drop them on the floor, and you could ruin the allignment that gives you that precision grip on those almost-invisible strands. You can pick up tweezers at the dollar store, but they won&#x27;t do a thing for you... Spend a little more, and you will be happy with the very best for years to come!</li>
            <li> sharp, precise, good grip and half price as in local drug stores. Win win.</li>
            <li> Very thin do not like at all!!!</li>
            <li> High quality tweezers to add to my first aid kit.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase because I knew the first one was great.  Really let you get in there and pluck away.</li>
            <li> I have received them.  I use to use only Tweezerman, but lately they have not been as thin in the blade as they use to be.  These are not as thin as I had hoped they would be.  That&#x27;s to bad.  Plus I really have to squeeze hard to get them to come all the way together, sort of out of alignment or something like that.</li>
            <li> this is what all tweezers shlould be mae in quality. the tweezer is light not heavy but oh so sharp and good metal.</li>
            <li> Yes I really do like it. Very precise and does not let the finer hairs slip through.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Best tweezer I ever had. All of my other tweezers I threw out.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I have bought these tweezers in the past and continue to do so.  They are the best I have ever found.  More expensive than many others but definitely worth the price.  They are sharp and perfect for getting out ingrown hairs or splinters.  People who&#x27;ve borrowed them are likewise impressed.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought a pair of Tweezerman tweezers at &amp;#34;Bed Bath and Beyond&amp;#34; in 2001. I just put them in the basket and was shocked that they cost twenty dollars. I was in a hurry so I didn&#x27;t refund the item, I just went with it and mumbled to myself &amp;#34;these better be some amazing tweezers&amp;#34;. Well, it&#x27;s 2014 and we have been using these tweezers for the whole time. We have other pairs to compare them to, and it became very obvious that these were the best tweezers we had ever owned. So when we bought a new house that had additional bathrooms, we bought a pair for every bathroom. The quality of these tweezers will far outweigh any sticker shock in the end. So when you need that pair of tweezers to get the microscopic ingrown painful hair, you will be glad you bought a pair of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks for your time.</li>
            <li> omgoodness, love these tweezers!</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday and used it this morning to pull some stray hairs. Thus far it&#x27;s infinitely better than my 2 year old tweezer I had been struggling with for the past few months, but that doesn&#x27;t say much. It was very easy to use, felt super hygienic, and made plucking a breeze. It was even easy to get hairs that were normally kind of difficult to maneuver to pull out. I&#x27;ll update this again in 6 months or so if the end dulls (or if it doesn&#x27;t and I can sing its praises).</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever used. They have a perfect slanted angle, and super sharp edges and point. Very well made and definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these tweezers so when the arrived I tried them right away on my eye brows.  I was very disappointed to find out that they did not work.  I thought that if I paid a little more for a pair of tweezers that I would get better quality but unfortunately it was not the case with these tweezers.  Maybe I got a defective pair or something, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> You pay for the best, you get the best!  Have been using Tweezerman products exclusively for 25+ years now.  Every so often I get seduced by another brand, and get burned.  There is nothing better out there!</li>
            <li> So disappointing!  In order to snag small hairs you must grip the tweezer at the tip rather than in the middle making it very difficult to see if you are tweezing the hair or just your skin.  Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and function.</li>
            <li> best tweezers.  can get the tiniest little hairs.</li>
            <li> Loved it - high quality, sharp, works excellently. Cut the mails of my two toddlers better than anything. Purchased 4 items, satisfied with every one.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as when they were made in Italy, but they will serve.</li>
            <li> the best  i have used</li>
            <li> As many have said, these are very good tweezers for removing stubborn hairs, thick or thin. My only problem with them is that the flat part of the slanted end does not grip well, I have to put extra pressure on the tweezers to grab with the flat part. The sharp point works quite well, and is great for tiny hairs and those targeted whiskery ones. I will keep using them, since I paid so much for them, but it will take me a little while to adjust myself to them.</li>
            <li> I have never paid this much for tweezers, but I am tired of not being able to get the tough thick hairs till they grow out enough (barely breaking the skin, not grabbable yet viewable) . I had such high hopes for these because of the slant - thinking I could get under the hairs better and have a better view with my hand and tweezers off to the side more. But I am finding I can&#x27;t grab squat with them. Even thin hairs - can&#x27;t grab &#x27;em.  As another stated in their review, &amp;#34;does not grip well, I have to put extra pressure on the tweezers to grab with the flat part&amp;#34;,  I will try to do the same.  Hope with practice and more pressure closer to the hair and tweezer tips - I will be able to make use of them. ... it looks like it &amp;#34;should&amp;#34; work.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Tweezers that actually work.  Love the slant on these.</li>
            <li> This is the best set of tweezers I have ever owned, by far. No matter the thickness or length of hair to be plucked, it just works.</li>
            <li> Great quality and very grippy. Tweezerman is the way to go.</li>
            <li> These are probably the best tweezers I have ever bought. The bonus is you get 2 tweezers ! One is slanted and the other is a fine tip. That way you have both types if using. You also receive a bag to carrying them in.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tweezerman tweezers for over 15 years.  They have a lifetime guarantee, so if you need them sharpened you can send back and they will sharpen for you.  I have not had my original purchase sharpened; however,, I thought it was about time to get them sharpened after 15+ years.  I purchased another pair of Tweezerman Tweezers to use while the original pair is being sharpened.  This pair is just as awesome as the first pair.  If you want a pair of tweezers that gets the \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; and \\&quot;small stuff,\\&quot; this product is what you are looking for.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife and she works in salons and has tried many different ones in her years, She absolutely loves these as they grab the thinnest and smallest of hairs! Would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> I got these to get pluck think facial hair follicles that can become ingrown.  They are excellent for it, and I am very pleased I bought them.  Highly recommended for any men who have similar issues.</li>
            <li> I works better than the Revlon tweezer I have for certain areas of the face, but is too pointed for other areas. One needs to use it carefully. Considering its popularity, I was disappointed with it because of the two points.</li>
            <li> I have a pair of these tweezers that I have had for 20 years or more, and they have been wonderful. Unfortunately I dropped them onto tile and they do not work anymore. I purchased this new pair and find that the quality has gone way down. It says stainless steel, but they feel like they are made of cheap metal; nowhere near the spring of my old ones. They do not work as well as my old ones did either. Clearly the precision has been sacrificed to the almighty dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving 3 stars only because they still work better than cheap tweezers, but I am bitterly disappointed with the reduced quality.</li>
            <li> I have owned many pairs of slanted Tweezerman tweezers and have trusted this brand, until now. There was only contact between the two POINTS of the tweezers. Along the entire slanted edge, there is a gap, making them useless for pulling hair. I am returning them wondering if the product quality control has dwindled.</li>
            <li> this tweezer will take out everything around the hair you are wanting to remove.  The slant is a detriment to a woman&#x27;s chin hair problem.  Takes out hair that doesnt need to be taken out</li>
            <li> Love the pointed slant. Pointed tip for tiny or short hairs and slant body for regular hairs. Much easier to maneuver then regular slant tip. Tweezerman makes the highest quality tweezers. My last pair lasted over 10 years.  I finally dropped them on their tips so many times it wasn&#x27;t worth sending them to the company to re sharpen (which is free by the way).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe all the hype. These are ordinary tweezers, they get the job done, but I don&#x27;t notice any extra grip on hairs compared to generic tweezers. They certainly aren&#x27;t the holy grail of tweezers, based upon what other reviewers have said. Maybe it&#x27;s just the item I received. Otherwise, craftsmanship is good and they look nice.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman always makes great products.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tweezers, best I have ever used.  I just purchased two for my teenage granddaughters as gifts, they love them.  My Tweezerman Tweezers are blunt tip which I have had over six years.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is my ONLY source for tweezers!  Since I bought this as a gift, I didn&#x27;t personally use it.  However, the person who received it loves it!</li>
            <li> Very expensive. Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> If I could give zero stars I would. I have always bought Tweezerman Tweezers, so I expected that this one would be equally wonderful. It wasn&#x27;t! It doesn&#x27;t even grip the hair... !! It&#x27;s a completely useless tweezer. I immediately wrote the vendor and asked to return it for a refund but they said they couldn&#x27;t accept returns. So it was a complete waste of money, and I even used a gift certificate to buy it. I am not happy about this and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any recourse. Wrong wrong wrong!!!</li>
            <li> They grab everything you can see in your magnification mirror. These are wonderful for those of us who are total perfectionists and want every last hair plucked from our eyebrows. I do not like having those little black looking dots there (that probably no one can see but I don&#x27;t care because I know they&#x27;re there). These get those dots right out of there and quickly!</li>
            <li> It does a professional job... what more can you say!</li>
            <li> I only use the slanted one because it&#x27;s the best to get even the smallest, thinnest hairs. I have one I use and one for back up in case the one I&#x27;m using needs servicing.  Tweezerman offers free sharpening for the life of the tweezers if you ship it to them.  They even pay for shipping back to you.  That service alone makes this product a wonderful purchase as you really get your money&#x27;s worth with these amazing tweezers.</li>
