            <li>Best of luck on your lash-quest!</li>
            <li>So happy I found something that works!</li>
            <li>This stuff is so awesome</li>
            <li>Very, very good buy.</li>
            <li>My sister gave it to me after she had incredible results.</li>
            <li>The gal that was doing my lash extensions told me about \\&quot;NuLash\\&quot; which she claimed worked great.</li>
            <li>It took over a month for me to see any growth in my eyelashes, but once there was, it was great.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>now neulash is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Quite overpriced considering the result wasn&#x27;t great or good.</li>
            <li>A year ago I got lash extensions and just loved them.</li>
            <li>It seems like woking good</li>
            <li>I think my lashes look good</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for about 2 months and my lashes look gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many products from Amazon and have always been happy, but I can&#x27;t believe how I was taken with this product.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I think this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Results are amazing.</li>
            <li>they grow really fast and look great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just kind of committed to neulash because I want to keep my lash</li>
            <li>I used the eyelash enhancer before and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I did not see a color change of any kind like some described, they were just visibly longer then before.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best product on the market.  </li>
            <li>But after hearing so many good things about this product, I decided to still go ahead and bought myself two tubes of neuLash available on Amazon which I received today.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think that the product greatly affected the volume very much.  </li>
            <li>This product is interesting.</li>
            <li>I would love to know if this has happened to anyone else</li>
            <li>Would love to hear some feedback.</li>
            <li>This application is better than the othersy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Currently, I am satisfied with the length of my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product makes my lashes look</li>
            <li>My lashes were okay before, but now they are so much more.</li>
            <li>I have been using Neulash for two months now and love what it has done for my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I will keep using a bit more to see how it lasts.</li>
            <li>Decided to try RapidLash and NeuLash to see which worked better.  </li>
            <li>so people could make a more educated choice.</li>
            <li>The price is outstanding, the in store price is 30%-40% more.  </li>
            <li>the product is okay.</li>
            <li>I love neuLash Enhancing Serum.  </li>
            <li>, I use this about 3-4 times a week (at the most,</li>
            <li>I normally use Rapid Lash which works great, but I read that this one makes your eyelashes darker.  </li>
            <li>I know it is more costly but trust me when I say it is worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and makes my lashes grow longer.</li>
            <li>application is fairly easy.</li>
            <li>No clumping, keeps eyelases healthy, full and strong.  </li>
            <li>Thus, it is best to put the product on and let it dry RIGHT before bed.</li>
            <li>I totally felt ripped off my money since I got this product based on great amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>This was the very BEST waste of my money.</li>
            <li>I love to read them, but rarely write them.</li>
            <li>They are barely better than when I first started to use it about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>The boxes looked like the original</li>
            <li>I have a quick evening routine and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several of the eyelash enhances, and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of anything that could have caused this but the NeuLash; maybe some of the product got on my cheeks from rubbing my eyes, tears from allergies, or sweat, and since it was effective at making my eyelashes grow, why wouldn&#x27;t it be effective at making other hair grow?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to use this product for several more weeks to be able to give an accurate review.</li>
            <li>Works really well, I love my lashes.</li>
            <li>Just as good as RX Latisse w/out possible side effects.</li>
            <li>Almost as good as Latisse without the red eyes and itching !  </li>
            <li>I have used other products for 2 weeks and obtained great results.</li>
            <li>Just a quick swipe and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other lash enhancing serums, but so far this is the best.  </li>
            <li>and I am very relieved to see such amazing results!</li>
            <li>Pretty bummed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more after this tube is gone!</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Gotta say, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have received several comments about how long and beautiful they are and I am very much satisfied with this product and how much I paid for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried other brands and Neulash is the best at making my lashes long and full.  </li>
            <li>Just can&#x27;t recommend it enough or say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>I can go every other day now with good results.  </li>
            <li>First I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much of this product, but it truly worked!!</li>
            <li>The Neulash had regrowth of fine tiny lashes that were light brown.  </li>
            <li>I have now been using it for 2 months (every night on the top and every other night on the bottom) and my lashes have easily doubled in length.</li>
            <li>The bottle lasted nearly 6 months also it is easy to put on.</li>
            <li>but I thought it was interesting and worth sharing as it changed my mind about further applying it.</li>
            <li>That said, two of my girlfriends started using it at the same time, and while its absolutely worked great for them, maybe not quite to the same extent as me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product 4 years ago when it first was marketed,  It still enhances my lashes but not line it used to ,</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I did see more lashes fill in, but the length after two months of regular use has not changed.  </li>
            <li>It seems to b working pretty well .  </li>
            <li>the first 3 days of using neulash</li>
            <li>I did have eye sensitivity and itching for about the first week but tried to ignore it.  </li>
            <li>Pretty soon I won&#x27;t even need eyeliner.</li>
            <li>They are also much longer than my pre-extension days!</li>
            <li>Thanks you very much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Smart Lash in the past, with pretty good results.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t want to take the risk that my lashes get shorter and not longer.</li>
            <li>but I have a friend who has had real lash growth.  </li>
            <li>The color hasn&#x27;t really darkened but they have grown.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know how much they&#x27;ve grown since it happens gradually.</li>
            <li>I rarely take the time to write reviews on products anymore, but Neulash surprised me.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes are much longer</li>
            <li>I used a much cheaper product and saw some results a lot sooner.</li>
            <li>I bought this not expecting much, but after four weeks, my eyelashes are already noticeably longer.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t irritate it too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using NeuLash for several months, and at first it was like a dream come true.</li>
            <li>Like any other product, I guess it works better for some than others.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other over the counter Eyelash enhancers, but none of them helped.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did, I have noticed a difference and have had other people comment on them as well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>If you stop using it, you will just eventually go back to your original lashes.</li>
            <li>It takes about 4-6 weeks to notice a change but all of a sudden they were significantly longer.</li>
            <li>My too-short lashes became long and beautiful after just a few weeks of using the product!</li>
            <li>two weeks later i had full eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My 48 year old mother is using as well and her eyelashes look extension eyelashes when it is real!</li>
            <li>I would have to dig the wand down into the bottom corner to even lightly saturate the brush!</li>
            <li>It really does help to keep your eyelashes strong and helps to prevent losing your eyelashes due to stress, etc.  </li>
            <li>so that was really my main concern when I bought this product.</li>
            <li>+ it wasn&#x27;t worth it to me, I&#x27;m going back to LiLash.</li>
            <li>I have used Revitalash in the past but can&#x27;t find it at a reasonable price on Amazon any more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to write reviews normally.</li>
            <li>After we come home, I go through the eyelash extension removal process and while my lashes are never &#x27;gone&#x27;, they just aren&#x27;t &#x27;normal&#x27; for awhile.</li>
            <li>will say that it is essential to put this stuff on right before bed.  </li>
            <li>- I have been using Neulash on the left eye and Rapidlash on the right to replace lashes pulled out over the course of using eyelash extensions....</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Worked quicker than i thought---lashes super long.</li>
            <li>is out of the question, I live in Asia).  </li>
            <li>if you are too lazy or don&#x27;t want to spend more buy this product.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the last few reviews that came in show results that are much closer to what I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;After I gave up on this crappy product I went with rapidlash and saw results within a week!</li>
            <li>The good part is that there is no irritation unlike some other lash enhancers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>After couple of weeks of using it, I clearly saw the difference.</li>
            <li>My 65 yr old mother loves this product as well.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and eyes, and thought it would bother me, but it hasn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Used it faithfully for nearly four weeks and have not noticed ny difference.  </li>
            <li>And for less than half the price of this product!&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews on Amazon, but if I save even one person from spending their money on a nicely packaged product that does not work, my mission is done.</li>
            <li>I use it probably every other night due to not remembering all the time, and I absolutely love the results.</li>
            <li>I finally realized that the new growth is darker than my natural color.  </li>
            <li>This product really works and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so amazed at how well it worked that I decided I really should look closer into this before using this long term.</li>
            <li>so the tube does last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>The rapidlash just came in thick and strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is really doing much.</li>
            <li>With daily use my lashes grew to the point they reach the lenses on my glasses which was unexpected.  </li>
            <li>(I wish I can upload my pic to prove).&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how authentic this product is after all; I will have to try it to believe it (really not much of a choice, since returning them</li>
            <li>Also, when the lashes that are longer fall out, the new ones will not be long unless you keep using the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using neuLash for years and my lashes were so long and lush</li>
            <li>I saw a news story about how they can harm your natural lashes long term</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the first 3 days of using neulash</li>
            <li> I did have eye sensitivity and itching for about the first week but tried to ignore it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty soon I won&#x27;t even need eyeliner.</li>
            <li> They are also much longer than my pre-extension days!</li>
            <li> Thanks you very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Smart Lash in the past, with pretty good results.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t want to take the risk that my lashes get shorter and not longer.</li>
            <li> but I have a friend who has had real lash growth.  </li>
            <li> The color hasn&#x27;t really darkened but they have grown.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know how much they&#x27;ve grown since it happens gradually.</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to write reviews on products anymore, but Neulash surprised me.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are much longer</li>
            <li> I used a much cheaper product and saw some results a lot sooner.</li>
            <li> I bought this not expecting much, but after four weeks, my eyelashes are already noticeably longer.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t irritate it too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using NeuLash for several months, and at first it was like a dream come true.</li>
            <li> Like any other product, I guess it works better for some than others.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other over the counter Eyelash enhancers, but none of them helped.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I did, I have noticed a difference and have had other people comment on them as well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> If you stop using it, you will just eventually go back to your original lashes.</li>
            <li> It takes about 4-6 weeks to notice a change but all of a sudden they were significantly longer.</li>
            <li> My too-short lashes became long and beautiful after just a few weeks of using the product!</li>
            <li> two weeks later i had full eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My 48 year old mother is using as well and her eyelashes look extension eyelashes when it is real!</li>
            <li> I would have to dig the wand down into the bottom corner to even lightly saturate the brush!</li>
            <li> It really does help to keep your eyelashes strong and helps to prevent losing your eyelashes due to stress, etc.  </li>
            <li> so that was really my main concern when I bought this product.</li>
            <li> + it wasn&#x27;t worth it to me, I&#x27;m going back to LiLash.</li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash in the past but can&#x27;t find it at a reasonable price on Amazon any more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews normally.</li>
            <li> After we come home, I go through the eyelash extension removal process and while my lashes are never &#x27;gone&#x27;, they just aren&#x27;t &#x27;normal&#x27; for awhile.</li>
            <li> will say that it is essential to put this stuff on right before bed.  </li>
            <li> - I have been using Neulash on the left eye and Rapidlash on the right to replace lashes pulled out over the course of using eyelash extensions....</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Worked quicker than i thought---lashes super long.</li>
            <li> is out of the question, I live in Asia).  </li>
            <li> if you are too lazy or don&#x27;t want to spend more buy this product.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the last few reviews that came in show results that are much closer to what I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;After I gave up on this crappy product I went with rapidlash and saw results within a week!</li>
            <li> The good part is that there is no irritation unlike some other lash enhancers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> After couple of weeks of using it, I clearly saw the difference.</li>
            <li> My 65 yr old mother loves this product as well.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and eyes, and thought it would bother me, but it hasn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Used it faithfully for nearly four weeks and have not noticed ny difference.  </li>
            <li> And for less than half the price of this product!&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews on Amazon, but if I save even one person from spending their money on a nicely packaged product that does not work, my mission is done.</li>
            <li> I use it probably every other night due to not remembering all the time, and I absolutely love the results.</li>
            <li> I finally realized that the new growth is darker than my natural color.  </li>
            <li> This product really works and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so amazed at how well it worked that I decided I really should look closer into this before using this long term.</li>
            <li> so the tube does last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> The rapidlash just came in thick and strong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is really doing much.</li>
            <li> With daily use my lashes grew to the point they reach the lenses on my glasses which was unexpected.  </li>
            <li> (I wish I can upload my pic to prove).&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how authentic this product is after all; I will have to try it to believe it (really not much of a choice, since returning them</li>
            <li> Also, when the lashes that are longer fall out, the new ones will not be long unless you keep using the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using neuLash for years and my lashes were so long and lush</li>
            <li> I saw a news story about how they can harm your natural lashes long term</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are super long and thick now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why or how, but my lashes are now very long and actually curl by themselves.  </li>
            <li> There was absolutely no problem with Amazon taking the product back.</li>
            <li> there are any adverse long term effects I&#x27;ll find out!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The lashes got so long that I don&#x27;t even use mascara every day.</li>
            <li> My sister asked me if I started curling them, and others commented on how long my lashes are.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but lasts a long time and works like nothing I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Lifetech who manufacture both RapidLash as well as NeuLash do not clearly label this.  </li>
            <li> My lashes got a little longer but not thicker, and not half as long as LiLash did.</li>
            <li> My lashes were never long or dark before neulash.  </li>
            <li> After a month, I had twice as long eyelashes as I used to have!</li>
            <li> One other drawback besides the cost is that if you quit using it, your lashes go back to the way they were before.  </li>
            <li> Kim Kardashian long!</li>
            <li> Price point is high, but at least there is no prescription required.</li>
            <li> and there is still a little left in the tube.  </li>
            <li> used only few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a crap shoot with these kind of things.</li>
            <li> My eyelids got a little red and irritated though, so now I&#x27;m using it every other day or 2-3 times a week, but it still works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had to cut down using it because my lashes are starting to look like those unnatural-looking extensions I&#x27;ve seen (at least for my taste).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d take short eyelashes over weird hair where there shouldn&#x27;t be hair any day, so I&#x27;m going to quit using the product, wax the new hair off, and hope that that&#x27;s the end of my problem.</li>
            <li> On the contrary, after only a few days my lashes were noticeable longer and slightly thicker looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they started to break off or if this is just part of a second growth cycle.</li>
            <li> so there was no change in any other products we were using to create this breakage.</li>
            <li> But in the past 1 1/2 years or so, I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes aren&#x27;t looking much different than before.</li>
            <li> Neulash is expensive, but it really works!  </li>
            <li> I have small asian eyes, so if they were to get any longer, they would reach my eye lids</li>
            <li> My issue with this purchase is the tube was 90% empty when it arrived!  </li>
            <li> No itching or other adverse side effects.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Then every other day.  </li>
            <li> I had extension and wanted to try this product due to the no side effects.  </li>
            <li> I will probably try one of the other products after I finish with this one.</li>
            <li> , its been 2 months now using every other day.</li>
            <li> I applied it almost everyday (did miss a few days here and there) for 30 days and definitely noticed my lashes were longer.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely use this product again,  but unfortunately I won&#x27;t be purchasing it from this seller.</li>
            <li> but it took me a while to thrown down the cash to purchase it.</li>
            <li> My other thought is that you get immune to it!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and wonder if it&#x27;s worth the $$$ if I can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li> Once I ran out, I decided to try Mary Kay&#x27;s version (I am an MK consultant and get my product half off).</li>
            <li> I noticed results in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Putting on mascara takes much less time now.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash was less than half the price....</li>
            <li> I just wanted to add a little oomph to my already dark lashes.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks I noticed no significant change</li>
            <li> but I am going to continue in hopes that the product just needs a little longer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch brands and take a break from LiLash and see what else worked for a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I got the 6ml bottle and used it faithfully everyday.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months now</li>
            <li> I used everyday for 4 weeks and no results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> However, this week I noticed some weird patches of hair on the tops of my cheekbones near my eyes that had not existed before.</li>
            <li> Less $ also !</li>
            <li> This product was also banned in Sweden because their active ingredient isopropyl cloprostenate and other \\&quot;prostaglandin analogs\\&quot; have potentially dangerous side effects and as such should be categorized as a drug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried a less expensive product than did not work, so I went back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other less expensive eyelash enhancers with little or no results.  </li>
            <li> Sadly my eyes began to turn red</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have not had the same results.</li>
            <li> I personally, won&#x27;t continue to use this product, it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT cheap!</li>
            <li> and as I&#x27;ve mentioned, my eyes are small and the product tends to come off on my lids.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I ordered the big size of Neulash</li>
            <li> I looked into other less expensive lash products</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past couple of month, and unfortunately, I have not noticed a single change in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Pretty expensive empty bottle :(</li>
            <li> and I always get eyelash extensions to save the hassle of eye makeup, with the raccoon eyes and late nights, and, well, it&#x27;s Vegas, so</li>
            <li> No it&#x27;s not as extreme as fake eyelashes, but it does affect lash</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see so dramatic change, but indeed my lash has been restored after heavy use of fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I should have stayed with the less expensive product since it was working!</li>
            <li> I started looking for a lash enhancement product because I hate wearing eye makeup in the sweaty summer months, when I&#x27;m constantly in and out of a pool or at the beach.  </li>
            <li> People ask all the time if I have extensions or am wearing false lashes.  </li>
            <li> After accidentally ripping out my eyelashes at Halloween (I wore false eyelashes), I decided to invest in the Neulash product.  </li>
            <li> There was supposed to be a dramatic change.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how well the product works because  there was hardly anything in it!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed my eyelashes had grown a bit sparser wanted sometime to correct that but not as drastic as a set of fake lashes.</li>
            <li> it was embarassing because i couldnt use mascara or fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Fake, Fake, Fake.</li>
            <li> cuz I never remember daily stuff) and my lashes look insane!</li>
            <li> However, they got very expensive and inconvenient to keep up</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past (purchased elsewhere) when applied nightly as recommended my lashes grew like mad!!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but somehow I convinced myself to lay out the cash</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid I will just be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t have any sort of bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> it works like crazy!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It was costly and do not see results, I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Just try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and would never buy this again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Sadly my eyes began to turn red and I found I was allergic to something in the product and had to return it. There was absolutely no problem with Amazon taking the product back.</li>
            <li> A year ago I got lash extensions and just loved them. However, they got very expensive and inconvenient to keep up (I had to drive an hour for the \\&quot;fill\\&quot;). The gal that was doing my lash extensions told me about \\&quot;NuLash\\&quot; which she claimed worked great. After reading the reviews carefully, I decided to try it as the lash extensions broke off all my natural lashes. I got the 6ml bottle and used it faithfully everyday.  I noticed results in about 30 days. That bottle lasted me over 8 months! Once I ran out, I decided to try Mary Kay&#x27;s version (I am an MK consultant and get my product half off). Unfortunately, I have not had the same results. I looked into other less expensive lash products but I&#x27;m afraid I will just be disappointed.  It&#x27;s been a few months now that I stopped using the NuLash and my lashes I want them back the way they were so I will be purchasing another bottle. I know it is more costly but trust me when I say it is worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is interesting. My sister gave it to me after she had incredible results. It took over a month for me to see any growth in my eyelashes, but once there was, it was great. However!...after 3 months, my eyelashes are now shorter than they were BEFORE I used this product. I&#x27;m not sure if they started to break off or if this is just part of a second growth cycle. I asked my sister and she said the same thing happened to her. We have both been using the same mascara and eye make-up remover--so there was no change in any other products we were using to create this breakage. I would love to know if this has happened to anyone else and if they continued to use Neulash--did their lashes grow longer again.  I personally, won&#x27;t continue to use this product, it&#x27;s so expensive and I really don&#x27;t want to take the risk that my lashes get shorter and not longer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how there are any low ratings for this product...it works like crazy! I&#x27;ve actually had to cut down using it because my lashes are starting to look like those unnatural-looking extensions I&#x27;ve seen (at least for my taste). That said, two of my girlfriends started using it at the same time, and while its absolutely worked great for them, maybe not quite to the same extent as me. Like any other product, I guess it works better for some than others.</li>
            <li> This product really works and lasts a long time. I use it probably every other night due to not remembering all the time, and I absolutely love the results. Not only are my lashes longer but they&#x27;re curlier even! Very, very good buy. People are constantly complimenting my lashes.</li>
            <li> It seems like woking good so far^^&lt;br /&gt;I used only few days. Well you should try too. Thanks you very much</li>
            <li> I have not seen a change in my eyelashes. There was supposed to be a dramatic change. Disappointed.  Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two months to recover from my lash extensions and saw no difference whatsoever. I stopped using it when I lost six lashes out of my left eyelid when I was washing my face one day. I wasn&#x27;t even rubbing my eyes. I totally felt ripped off my money since I got this product based on great amazon reviews. Fortunately the last few reviews that came in show results that are much closer to what I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;After I gave up on this crappy product I went with rapidlash and saw results within a week! And for less than half the price of this product!&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews on Amazon, but if I save even one person from spending their money on a nicely packaged product that does not work, my mission is done. Best of luck on your lash-quest!</li>
            <li> This doesnt work at all - instead of making my lashes grow it made me feel itchy at night after a month in.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement yet but I have a friend who has had real lash growth.  I&#x27;ll keep using for a while to see if it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using neuLash for years and my lashes were so long and lush, I would get compliments all the time!!! But in the past 1 1/2 years or so, I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes aren&#x27;t looking much different than before. They used to touch the lenses of my sunglasses and they don&#x27;t anymore. They are barely better than when I first started to use it about 5 years ago. I am convinced the manufacturer has taken out some of the lash growing formula because it just doesn&#x27;t work like it used to. I am very disappointed and wonder if it&#x27;s worth the $$$ if I can&#x27;t tell much difference. It&#x27;s NOT cheap! My other thought is that you get immune to it!  Would love to hear some feedback.</li>
            <li> Before I bought these I requested info from the supplier regarding the net weight but no reply.  But after hearing so many good things about this product, I decided to still go ahead and bought myself two tubes of neuLash available on Amazon which I received today.  Upon opening the packages, I noticed there are font/design differences (pic/original has no &amp;#34;lash strokes&amp;#34; mine has two) as well as, color (pic/original is shiny, mine is matt) differences on the tubes themselves.  The boxes looked like the original (I compared my product with that of my friend&#x27;s as she bought hers from the neuLash website itself).  They look nothing like in this picture (I wish I can upload my pic to prove).&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how authentic this product is after all; I will have to try it to believe it (really not much of a choice, since returning them is out of the question, I live in Asia).  Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> First I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much of this product, but it truly worked!! My eyelashes are super long and thick now. Thank you~!!!</li>
            <li> It works like a charm.  After 10 weeks, I could feel my lashes are a lot thicker and longer.  It does require continuos use.  Wish it were cheaper.</li>
            <li> This product is pricey I will give them that but it is worth every penny. they grow really fast and look great!  I did notice tho without using it they seem like they shrank. my fiancé says maybe we just got use to them? I don&#x27;t think so lol. I do know someone who their lashes got burned off and they used this product and they got them to grow back. AND THEY STAYED!</li>
            <li> The product does what it claims to do.  With daily use my lashes grew to the point they reach the lenses on my glasses which was unexpected.  My lashes were never long or dark before neulash.  The color hasn&#x27;t really darkened but they have grown.  I can go every other day now with good results.  I&#x27;m just kind of committed to neulash because I want to keep my lash length.&lt;br /&gt;If there are any adverse long term effects I&#x27;ll find out!&lt;br /&gt;For now neulash is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 4 years ago when it first was marketed,  It still enhances my lashes but not line it used to ,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it worked. However, this time I have seen no improvement whatsoever. I&#x27;m very disappointed and would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I used everyday for 4 weeks and no results. I have used other products for 2 weeks and obtained great results.</li>
            <li> After couple of weeks of using it, I clearly saw the difference. After a month, I had twice as long eyelashes as I used to have! My eyelids got a little red and irritated though, so now I&#x27;m using it every other day or 2-3 times a week, but it still works. Love it!</li>
            <li> Once I tried it I have never regretted!! The lashes got so long that I don&#x27;t even use mascara every day.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I noticed results in less than 2 weeks. I feel like my lashes have stopped growing but I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month so we&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> This does increase your eyelashes! Have used before and will continue to order. This application is better than the othersy</li>
            <li> I have purchased many products from Amazon and have always been happy, but I can&#x27;t believe how I was taken with this product. I can&#x27;t say how well the product works because  there was hardly anything in it!! I paid $80 for something that I used 3 times and I can&#x27;t even return it because I threw out the box and I am royally pissed off!!!</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks I noticed no significant change but I am going to continue in hopes that the product just needs a little longer.</li>
            <li> Quite overpriced considering the result wasn&#x27;t great or good. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone at the current price. If it were cheaper then maybe</li>
            <li> Neulash is expensive, but it really works!  I have tried many other over the counter Eyelash enhancers, but none of them helped.  Neulash takes time, but it made my lashes darker, longer, and thicker.  People ask all the time if I have extensions or am wearing false lashes.  I am allergic to mascara and this makes me look like I am wearing it.  One other drawback besides the cost is that if you quit using it, your lashes go back to the way they were before.  So happy I found something that works!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I decided to try this product.  I received it 2-14-14 and after about a month, there was a noticeable difference in the length of my lashes!  The reviews said it took about 2 months to fully kick in, it has been 2 months and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re any longer than they were at one month.  I have received several comments about how long and beautiful they are and I am very much satisfied with this product and how much I paid for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I am satisfied with the length of my lashes.  I have small asian eyes, so if they were to get any longer, they would reach my eye lids and I don&#x27;t want that, especially after the application of mascara.  The volume of my eyelashes were not especially sparse before I started using this product and I don&#x27;t think that the product greatly affected the volume very much.  I don&#x27;t know if that will change, but I think the current volume of my lashes is sufficient.  No complaints.  I also have yet to experience any adverse side effects.  I love that this product makes my lashes look natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is essential to put this stuff on right before bed.  I have used it maybe an hour or so before bed and as I&#x27;ve mentioned, my eyes are small and the product tends to come off on my lids.  Thus, it is best to put the product on and let it dry RIGHT before bed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past (purchased elsewhere) when applied nightly as recommended my lashes grew like mad!!! My issue with this purchase is the tube was 90% empty when it arrived!  I would have to dig the wand down into the bottom corner to even lightly saturate the brush! Pretty bummed! I will absolutely use this product again,  but unfortunately I won&#x27;t be purchasing it from this seller. Pretty expensive empty bottle :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is really doing much. I just wanted to add a little oomph to my already dark lashes. I think my lashes look good but I don&#x27;t know how much they&#x27;ve grown since it happens gradually. The good part is that there is no irritation unlike some other lash enhancers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands and Neulash is the best at making my lashes long and full.  If you try it you will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works really well, I love my lashes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch brands and take a break from LiLash and see what else worked for a little cheaper. This worked some, but didn&#x27;t take over from when I was using LiLash, so I had to wait a month before it even looked like my lashes were a bit longer. My lashes got a little longer but not thicker, and not half as long as LiLash did. For $85+ it wasn&#x27;t worth it to me, I&#x27;m going back to LiLash.</li>
            <li> Not everything works on everybody.  This did not do a thing.  Not a thing.  I don&#x27;t think it would have even poisoned me if I drank the stuff.  But who knows, may work on the next gal.  It&#x27;s a crap shoot with these kind of things.</li>
            <li> Kept hearing about neuLash and how well it worked but it took me a while to thrown down the cash to purchase it. I have noticed my eyelashes had grown a bit sparser wanted sometime to correct that but not as drastic as a set of fake lashes. I am so glad I did, I have noticed a difference and have had other people comment on them as well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. Simple to apply. I have a quick evening routine and this fit the bill. Just a quick swipe and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;2. Does lengthen lashes. I have been using for a couple of months and have noticed a difference, with and without mascara. No it&#x27;s not as extreme as fake eyelashes, but it does affect lash length.&lt;br /&gt;3. No itching or other adverse side effects.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Price point is high, but at least there is no prescription required. One bottle does seem to last a while however.</li>
            <li> This product did visible increase my lashes as well as my eyebrows. The bottle lasted nearly 6 months also it is easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get same results with Latisse. It&#x27;s still working but not as well as latisse. if you don&#x27;t mind to go to a doctor then go buy latisse. if you are too lazy or don&#x27;t want to spend more buy this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why or how, but my lashes are now very long and actually curl by themselves.  My lashes were okay before, but now they are so much more. I tried a less expensive product than did not work, so I went back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just know that it takes quite a while to see any difference, so don&#x27;t get discouraged.  Also, when the lashes that are longer fall out, the new ones will not be long unless you keep using the product.  If you stop using it, you will just eventually go back to your original lashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried other less expensive eyelash enhancers with little or no results.  After accidentally ripping out my eyelashes at Halloween (I wore false eyelashes), I decided to invest in the Neulash product.  I bought it and started using it in January.  My eyelashes are back!  And they are curly!  And they are thicker and darker!  I am blonde and you can&#x27;t see my eyelashes without mascara.  I kept thinking that I wasn&#x27;t getting all of my makeup off when I washed my face.  I finally realized that the new growth is darker than my natural color.  I will buy this again.  In a heartbeat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  People began commenting on my eyelashes.  My sister asked me if I started curling them, and others commented on how long my lashes are.  I started using this on January 5.  I used it daily until May.  Then every other day.  It is July 27 and there is still a little left in the tube.  I am ordering another tube now before I run out.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and decided to take the gamble.  I have used Revitalash in the past but can&#x27;t find it at a reasonable price on Amazon any more.  I&#x27;ll have to use this product for several more weeks to be able to give an accurate review.</li>
            <li> I would appreciate a refund as this product did not work well at all. It is nothing like the prostaglandin analogs which actually do work, such as Latisse.</li>
            <li> I had extension and wanted to try this product due to the no side effects.  I did see more lashes fill in, but the length after two months of regular use has not changed.  I will probably try one of the other products after I finish with this one.</li>
            <li> Just as good as RX Latisse w/out possible side effects. Less $ also !&lt;br /&gt;Worked quicker than i thought---lashes super long.</li>
            <li> It seems to b working pretty well .  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks.  My lashes are thicker and getting a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite a few years.  It really does help to keep your eyelashes strong and helps to prevent losing your eyelashes due to stress, etc.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing.  I rarely take the time to write reviews on products anymore, but Neulash surprised me.  I received it as a sample and in two weeks, I noticed a difference in the length and color of my eyelashes, so I purchased it.  I have been using Neulash for two months now and love what it has done for my eyelashes.  Putting on mascara takes much less time now.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about 2 months and my lashes look gorgeous.  They are longer and thicker.  I love them.</li>
            <li> I used the eyelash enhancer before and liked it.  I would order it again when and if I need it.</li>
            <li> I recently damaged my eyelashes from getting eyelash extensions and wanted to grow them back asap. they were short and i had gaps in between my lashes because there were no lashes there. it was embarassing because i couldnt use mascara or fake lashes. i used a number of products to make them grow back but none seem to work. the first 3 days of using neulash i noticed the lashes i did have were getting longer and the gaps were startingto grow lashes. two weeks later i had full eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I normally use Rapid Lash which works great, but I read that this one makes your eyelashes darker.  I believe that I have seen a difference since I have been using this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see so dramatic change, but indeed my lash has been restored after heavy use of fake lashes. I will keep using a bit more to see how it lasts.</li>
            <li> I was debating whether to use latisse or try out neulash after hearing about it from my brow gal.  I started using it about a month and can already tell I have longer lashes.  They also just seem softer and healthier.  The length so far is probably only something I can see but am curious how it will look in another month.  I did have eye sensitivity and itching for about the first week but tried to ignore it.  It eventually went away as my eyes got used to it.  Very easy to apply.  Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> Decided to try RapidLash and NeuLash to see which worked better.  I am sorry I ordered the big size of Neulash - I have been using Neulash on the left eye and Rapidlash on the right to replace lashes pulled out over the course of using eyelash extensions.... The Neulash had regrowth of fine tiny lashes that were light brown.  The rapidlash just came in thick and strong.  Rapidlash was less than half the price....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and makes my lashes grow longer. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and love it!</li>
            <li> I applied it almost everyday (did miss a few days here and there) for 30 days and definitely noticed my lashes were longer. I did not see a color change of any kind like some described, they were just visibly longer then before. If it were just for the results then I&#x27;d say I was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so amazed at how well it worked that I decided I really should look closer into this before using this long term. People may think this is just another simple cosmetic fix but they are infact applying a drug to their eye skin. Lifetech who manufacture both RapidLash as well as NeuLash do not clearly label this.  Here&#x27;s the warning letter from the FDA:&lt;br /&gt;[...] This product was also banned in Sweden because their active ingredient isopropyl cloprostenate and other \\&quot;prostaglandin analogs\\&quot; have potentially dangerous side effects and as such should be categorized as a drug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand people may not care about all this but I thought it was interesting and worth sharing as it changed my mind about further applying it. I gave it 3 stars because it does do what it sais it does but I had to deduct 2 stars because I felt it was irresponsible not to label things properly so people could make a more educated choice.</li>
            <li> This product works!  My eyelashes are much longer and I get lots of compliments on them.  Pretty soon I won&#x27;t even need eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using NeuLash for several months, and at first it was like a dream come true. My too-short lashes became long and beautiful after just a few weeks of using the product! However, this week I noticed some weird patches of hair on the tops of my cheekbones near my eyes that had not existed before. I can&#x27;t think of anything that could have caused this but the NeuLash; maybe some of the product got on my cheeks from rubbing my eyes, tears from allergies, or sweat, and since it was effective at making my eyelashes grow, why wouldn&#x27;t it be effective at making other hair grow? I&#x27;d take short eyelashes over weird hair where there shouldn&#x27;t be hair any day, so I&#x27;m going to quit using the product, wax the new hair off, and hope that that&#x27;s the end of my problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the eyelash enhances, and this is the best by far. It started working for me in about 3 weeks and my lashes grew to and have maintained about 1/2&amp;#34; of length. this product doesn&#x27;t sting or discolor your eyelids like some others do. My 65 yr old mother loves this product as well.  Yes, it is more expensive than some of the others, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product on the market.  If you see it out on Amazon, buy it.  Have tried others without the result I get from this.  No clumping, keeps eyelases healthy, full and strong.  The price is outstanding, the in store price is 30%-40% more.  100% recommend this.</li>
            <li> Fake, Fake, Fake. DO NOT!!! waist your money. Placebo to the cause. This was the very BEST waste of my money.</li>
            <li> After using it for 3 weeks, I still see no results.  It was costly and do not see results, I am disappointed.  Maybe in a couple of weeks, I will see results.  I used a much cheaper product and saw some results a lot sooner. I should have stayed with the less expensive product since it was working!</li>
            <li> I bought this not expecting much, but after four weeks, my eyelashes are already noticeably longer. I have sensitive skin and eyes, and thought it would bother me, but it hasn&#x27;t at all. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more after this tube is gone!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I could literally see the difference in just two weeks. Definitely will be buying this again and again!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past couple of month, and unfortunately, I have not noticed a single change in my lashes.  It was a complete waste of money. Revitalash did work for me...I should have stuck with that.</li>
            <li> Results are amazing. My 48 year old mother is using as well and her eyelashes look extension eyelashes when it is real!</li>
            <li> Almost as good as Latisse without the red eyes and itching !  Lashes staying longer also. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  And u will save $$$</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works. I was very skeptical but somehow I convinced myself to lay out the cash and I am very relieved to see such amazing results! I have sensitive eyes so that was really my main concern when I bought this product. However, I didn&#x27;t have any sort of bad reaction to it. On the contrary, after only a few days my lashes were noticeable longer and slightly thicker looking. You use it once a day at night so the tube does last a pretty long time. I have only been using it about 2 1/2 weeks but i&#x27;m thinking it will probably last 2-3 months. I would definitely recommend this product to people who are looking for fuller, longer lashes and don&#x27;t want to have to get a prescription for latisse. I started looking for a lash enhancement product because I hate wearing eye makeup in the sweaty summer months, when I&#x27;m constantly in and out of a pool or at the beach.  Just try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> the product is okay. doesn&#x27;t irritate it too much. application is fairly easy. i don&#x27;t know if i see results yet, its been 2 months now using every other day.</li>
            <li> I love neuLash Enhancing Serum.  I&#x27;ve tried other lash enhancing serums, but so far this is the best.  I saw results after about two weeks.  Lashes appear longer especially after applying mascara.</li>
            <li> I got eyelash extensions applied for 1 year. I saw a news story about how they can harm your natural lashes long term so I decided to stop. My lashes were damaged and short when I took the extensions off. I read reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. I have now been using it for 2 months (every night on the top and every other night on the bottom) and my lashes have easily doubled in length. It takes about 4-6 weeks to notice a change but all of a sudden they were significantly longer. They are also much longer than my pre-extension days! I haven&#x27;t had any side effects at all. I&#x27;ve told all of my girlfriends about this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Used it faithfully for nearly four weeks and have not noticed ny difference.  I will  continue until bottle is finished but will not refill unless I see visible results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Your lashes continue to grow with the use of this product. Kim Kardashian long! The only downfall is when you stop using it, your lashes go back to regular. Quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews normally. I love to read them, but rarely write them. This stuff is so awesome, I felt I had to give a shout out! Every year my girlfriends and I go to Vegas for Superbowl Weekend and I always get eyelash extensions to save the hassle of eye makeup, with the raccoon eyes and late nights, and, well, it&#x27;s Vegas, so Vegas lashes just make a girl feel fancy. After we come home, I go through the eyelash extension removal process and while my lashes are never &#x27;gone&#x27;, they just aren&#x27;t &#x27;normal&#x27; for awhile. I&#x27;ve used Smart Lash in the past, with pretty good results. This year I stumbled across this Neulash stuff and decided to give it a try based on the reviews. Gotta say, it&#x27;s worth it. A bit pricey, but lasts a long time and works like nothing I&#x27;ve seen. I have friends who use Latisse, and this is totally comparable (&amp; don&#x27;t have to go to the dr to get it, &amp; it&#x27;s a bit cheaper, bonus all the way around). It&#x27;s been 3 months since Vegas, I use this about 3-4 times a week (at the most, cuz I never remember daily stuff) and my lashes look insane! A couple of my girlfriends thought I got the extensions put back on! I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;ll bother with them this next year, this stuff is that rad! Just can&#x27;t recommend it enough or say enough good things about it! Hope this helps if you&#x27;re on the fence about the purchase.</li>
