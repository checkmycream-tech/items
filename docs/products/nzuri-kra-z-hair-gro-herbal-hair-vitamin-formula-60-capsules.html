            <li>Beautifulbrwnbabydoll for sharing on Youtube &amp; Nzuri for such a GREAT product!</li>
            <li>I also love that it is herbal based.</li>
            <li>I mostly bought it for my hair as my skin and nails are OK</li>
            <li>My hair looks a lot better and grows faster.</li>
            <li>I have another product that has more vitamins that will probably work better.</li>
            <li>and Nails are lovely &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Will continue using for sure.  </li>
            <li>My hair is growing, it&#x27;s thicker, smoother and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I think there is a better hair vitamin pill on the market that shows faster results.</li>
            <li>I probably should do another bottle to see better results as it may take more time for my body to adjust and respond to these vitamins</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>I would love to continue taking it</li>
            <li>To avoid nausea, I make sure I eat before I take them, even if it&#x27;s just toast</li>
            <li>To my surprise after about 3 weeks of taking a tablet a day, my hair is feeling healthier and looking so much better.  </li>
            <li>I will continue and I am expecting greater results.  </li>
            <li>I mostly bought it for my hair as my skin and nails are OK</li>
            <li>My hair looks a lot better and produces faster.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure once my depleted vitamin/mineral stores are replenished in a couple of months</li>
            <li>I will see the benefits even more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to grow my hair longer than just about my shoulder blades,&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li>Not to mention how healthy it looks and feels.</li>
            <li>With most of the ingredients you will not even succeed in getting your daily value of vitamin intake, whereas a good multivitamin will!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the nutrients this provides, and I find myself having more energy throughout the day.</li>
            <li>If your new to it, just make sure you put a good amount of water in your mouth and before trying to swallow the pill try to place it about at the end of your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first month major hair growth and nails and skin were wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and I want to cry because that&#x27;s all anyone wants is to have their OWN hair to grown healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li>, what&#x27;s the best way to ingest these pills and keep them down?</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I like Earthfare brand for all there supplements and the fact they are a credible manufacturer for vitamins.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, a close friend of mine recommended a line of products called &#x60;Nzuri&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is great.  </li>
            <li>My nails are getting stronger and much longer, and I am loving</li>
            <li>Maybe because I had taken the Nzuri Elixir and had amazing results, my expectations were to high for these pills.</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far</li>
            <li>and I am excited..</li>
            <li>I have noticed significant growth since I began taking the vitamins.</li>
            <li>Nzuri is by far the best health product out there especially for people of color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend either supplement if you are healthy or</li>
            <li>I also have experienced less shedding when doing my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks and God bless!!</li>
            <li>In other words, if your aim is to grow strong, healthy hair, then I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Everything was completely fine just wanted to see more growth which again is probably my fault for not continuing with a 2nd bottle...</li>
            <li>My hairs been really strong and vibrant</li>
            <li>It was worth a shot though but won&#x27;t repurchase again.</li>
            <li>Made some difference, but nothing worth celebrating.</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks of taking this product, I was amazed at how soft and full my hair is becoming - have seen some growth as well.</li>
            <li>My doctor says the lost hair will never come back, but I&#x27;m excited about being able to conceal it.</li>
            <li>and I drink lots of water right after and throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>If you want healthy long hair you need to once again watch what you eat, exercise, see a dermatology often, visit your primary care provider and take Nuzuri.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Its still too soon to tell, I have noticed an increase of thickness, but I have not yet completed my first bottle, I am considering purchasing another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But why pay the same amount for something when there is something out there better.</li>
            <li>It is doing exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>I gave them a three in fairness because maybe my body simply absorbs liquids better than pills.</li>
            <li>My hair normally grows pretty fast, but after just one month, I have to part my hair to see the bald spot!  </li>
            <li>to a certain extent.</li>
            <li>The product actually arrived before the date they quoted, which was fine with me.</li>
            <li>If you compare that info to a REAL multivitamin, the numbers are staggering.</li>
            <li>I used it straight for 30 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for give days and already my hair is so much thicker</li>
            <li>Really did help my typicality none growing hair too,&amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t believe I need to cut my hair already.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t show fast results</li>
            <li>Hair grew in a but not as much as I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>this vitamin really works for my hair.</li>
            <li>has supplemented the results from the liquid, my nails were already strengthening when I started taking this and are now growing very hard.&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li>I have bought  this product for 3 months now, actually I buy all Nuzuri products and they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>After all, I had read years ago that scientist had discovered a direct correlation between proper vitamin intake and healthy hair/nails/skin.</li>
            <li>okay try other products out there.</li>
            <li>This product really works well along with my other natural regimens, these last two months has been a successful journey I will continue to use</li>
            <li>First of all let me make it perfectly clear hair texture has nothing to do with rather vitamins works or not.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this may appear to be common knowledge, but make sure you only take these after you have eaten something.</li>
            <li>others claim to have had but am seeing steady growth and filling in of thinner areas.</li>
            <li>Unsure of this product.... has high promises.  </li>
            <li>It also made me break out because of the high amount of Biotin in it.  </li>
            <li>so next month I will start fresh with these again and go from there.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed that my hair just started shedding which is normal in the winter seasons</li>
            <li>I would check my head; no crawlies (thank God), just NEW GROWTH.</li>
            <li>20 days I noticed my hairline filling in with new baby hairs.</li>
            <li>Admittedly I was quite skeptical at first, owing to the fact that I had traveled down this road far too many times to foolishly get my hopes up; yet, to my pleasant surprise, this product actually works!</li>
            <li>have been doing many other things to help it grow in addition like having foods with omega 3,vitamin c, and gelatin, I only showering &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>Reviews were pretty solid</li>
            <li>Usually when I take hair vitamins I can tell they are working after about a week becuase my scalp will itch more</li>
            <li>For this reason, at least in my opinion, it seemed natural to pair a product healthy for the scalp with the required nutrients derivable from vitamin supplementation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m AA with natural 4a type hair.</li>
            <li>Nzuri Krazy Vitamins, I appreciate my natural hair</li>
            <li>but when I turn 30 and went to see the dermatology she made it clear my skin is changing because I am an adult</li>
            <li>but I did see a difference in my skin which means my skin really like this product, but there was difference in my hair growth; it was still growing but not massive when I take the vitamins.  </li>
            <li>My nails have never been this strong and long in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>At first I thought something was crawling in my head, but I would feel it in different areas of my head at the same time.</li>
            <li>and I want to give my skin time to heal and get back to normal which</li>
            <li>Drinking a lot of water helps a little, but I have a full bottle left that I PLAN TO USE!</li>
            <li>I bought 2  bottles so far, I just finished my 2nd bottle and my hair has grown 4 inches in 2 months.</li>
            <li>I can barely get my fingers thru it...</li>
            <li>I know that sounds weird, but it&#x27;s the God honest TRUTH; that&#x27;s what I feel.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I will not continue on with this product only if the price goes down than maybe it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely noticed my nails grew out really fast and very long.  </li>
            <li>Plus, in actuality... they are really just a super weak multivitamin when you look at the nutritional info on the back of the bottle!</li>
            <li>So if I am not happy with the Carribean ones I may go back the KRA-Z brand as the vitamins are easy to swallow</li>

            <li> I would check my head; no crawlies (thank God), just NEW GROWTH.</li>
            <li> 20 days I noticed my hairline filling in with new baby hairs.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I was quite skeptical at first, owing to the fact that I had traveled down this road far too many times to foolishly get my hopes up; yet, to my pleasant surprise, this product actually works!</li>
            <li> have been doing many other things to help it grow in addition like having foods with omega 3,vitamin c, and gelatin, I only showering &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Reviews were pretty solid</li>
            <li> Usually when I take hair vitamins I can tell they are working after about a week becuase my scalp will itch more</li>
            <li> For this reason, at least in my opinion, it seemed natural to pair a product healthy for the scalp with the required nutrients derivable from vitamin supplementation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AA with natural 4a type hair.</li>
            <li> Nzuri Krazy Vitamins, I appreciate my natural hair</li>
            <li> but when I turn 30 and went to see the dermatology she made it clear my skin is changing because I am an adult</li>
            <li> but I did see a difference in my skin which means my skin really like this product, but there was difference in my hair growth; it was still growing but not massive when I take the vitamins.  </li>
            <li> My nails have never been this strong and long in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> At first I thought something was crawling in my head, but I would feel it in different areas of my head at the same time.</li>
            <li> and I want to give my skin time to heal and get back to normal which</li>
            <li> Drinking a lot of water helps a little, but I have a full bottle left that I PLAN TO USE!</li>
            <li> I bought 2  bottles so far, I just finished my 2nd bottle and my hair has grown 4 inches in 2 months.</li>
            <li> I can barely get my fingers thru it...</li>
            <li> I know that sounds weird, but it&#x27;s the God honest TRUTH; that&#x27;s what I feel.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I will not continue on with this product only if the price goes down than maybe it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed my nails grew out really fast and very long.  </li>
            <li> Plus, in actuality... they are really just a super weak multivitamin when you look at the nutritional info on the back of the bottle!</li>
            <li> So if I am not happy with the Carribean ones I may go back the KRA-Z brand as the vitamins are easy to swallow</li>
            <li> every other&#x27;&#x27; day, I put gelatin in my shampoo/conditioner and massaging my scalp a few hours each day (I use a mechanical massage brush which has also helped with my growth success).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had a hard time fitting all the Daily Value in my multivitamin photos, as I was trying to ensure and include all the valuable info you absolutely need to see!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting because I want to clear my body of those other vitamins all together</li>
            <li> Earlier this week, I realized how much growth I had retained and how thick my braids are (I&#x27;m currently keeping my hair braids/plaits as a protective style underneath wigs).</li>
            <li> Long</li>
            <li> With the exception of only a few proprietary ingredients and differences, you will notice that for the same amount of money it costs for a bottle of kraz hair gro, you can find a multivitamin like this one which I bought from earthfare, and you take it three times a day.</li>
            <li> I have just taken my first two Kra-Z hair growth vitamins, are they supposed to make you nauseated?</li>
            <li> On the down side, it promotes ALL hair growth including facial hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally really forgetful with tablets</li>
            <li> i was tempted to try other brands but this is working well</li>
            <li> Just try other vitamins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I paid too much and want to see result</li>
            <li> and I am dealing with scarring alopecia which has left a few small bald spots on my crown along with severe breakage.</li>
            <li> both if you are run down.</li>
            <li> and I have less breakouts.</li>
            <li> if you use it for years it will give you some improvements and slight results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;Ordered and tried the other brand of vitamins and was not happy, not only did I not see any growth in nails or hair like these</li>
            <li> My mornings are often rushed, so if I take them without eating I get a little lightheaded.</li>
            <li> My hair is so long its ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to share my hair growth in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> so I purchased 1 bottle of these vitamins and took everyday until I finished the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have wasted lots of money with this.</li>
            <li> I noticed almost no shedding after I began to take it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> but it has made me throw up a few times.  </li>
            <li> However after I put a rinse on my natural hair it felt dry and was breaking off really bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they even put the ingredients listed in the product.</li>
            <li> I just got to lazy to order it</li>
            <li> May 7th with hardly any nails.  </li>
            <li> Two stars because the pills are hard to swallow for me and the dosage is two pills.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see anyone else with that complaint on these reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other hair vitamins with the promise of speeding up hair growth and needless to say it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Areas of thickened skin have smoothed out and my toenails which (annoyingly) are also growing like crazy are much thinner and less</li>
            <li> I started these pills in an effort to grow out the broken hair to help cover the bald spots.  </li>
            <li> I have an inch and a half!!!!</li>
            <li> And to think I was skeptical to purchase another so-called hair growth &amp; nail product.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t wash my hair when I looked.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have some of the crazy hair growth</li>
            <li> All of this can stop bad reviews.</li>
            <li> This is very sad :(</li>
            <li> I purchased the vitamins about 2 months ago but never took them because I hate pills.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought 2  bottles so far, I just finished my 2nd bottle and my hair has grown 4 inches in 2 months. I think i&#x27;m going to get another bottle. My hairs been really strong and vibrant</li>
            <li> get more of this  product&lt;br /&gt;nzuri kra -z hair gro herbal hair vitamin formula&lt;br /&gt;because the product is good it work</li>
            <li> Allergic to the Fo-Ti-Root</li>
            <li> I have just taken my first two Kra-Z hair growth vitamins, are they supposed to make you nauseated? I immediately had to vomit within 5 minutes of taking the pill. I&#x27;m sorry I paid too much and want to see result, what&#x27;s the best way to ingest these pills and keep them down? Drinking a lot of water helps a little, but I have a full bottle left that I PLAN TO USE!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and go out and buy a great multivitamin rather than kra z hair gro supplements! I was on kraz hair gro for 4 years with a well balanced diet and exercise, and they just didn&#x27;t do enough! lol. Plus, in actuality... they are really just a super weak multivitamin when you look at the nutritional info on the back of the bottle! If you compare that info to a REAL multivitamin, the numbers are staggering. With most of the ingredients you will not even succeed in getting your daily value of vitamin intake, whereas a good multivitamin will! Unfortunately, I had a hard time fitting all the Daily Value in my multivitamin photos, as I was trying to ensure and include all the valuable info you absolutely need to see! With the exception of only a few proprietary ingredients and differences, you will notice that for the same amount of money it costs for a bottle of kraz hair gro, you can find a multivitamin like this one which I bought from earthfare, and you take it three times a day. I like Earthfare brand for all there supplements and the fact they are a credible manufacturer for vitamins. I hope this helps somebody. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I started using Kra-z hair vitamins May 7th with hardly any nails.  Today, May 24th my nail growth has almost tripled in length.  My nails have never been this strong and long in such a short amount of time. I&#x27;m showing my nails off, which I was ashamed to do before. Since I&#x27;m wearing protective styles, I have not checked my hair length; however, I actually feel hair sprouting in my head.  I know that sounds weird, but it&#x27;s the God honest TRUTH; that&#x27;s what I feel.  At first I thought something was crawling in my head, but I would feel it in different areas of my head at the same time. I would check my head; no crawlies (thank God), just NEW GROWTH. I&#x27;ve only felt this since taking Kra-z hair vitamins.  And to think I was skeptical to purchase another so-called hair growth &amp; nail product.  I believe I found something that finally works.  Can&#x27;t wait to share my hair growth in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Beautifulbrwnbabydoll for sharing on Youtube &amp; Nzuri for such a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> My edges were almost non-existent but I am starting to see growth in that area. I did not see any improvements with my nails but my skin feels a lot softer and I have less breakouts. I just ordered my second bottle. i was tempted to try other brands but this is working well so I am going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> For years I had been aimlessly searching for something that would help make my hair grow. Fortunately, a close friend of mine recommended a line of products called &#x60;Nzuri&#x27;. Admittedly I was quite skeptical at first, owing to the fact that I had traveled down this road far too many times to foolishly get my hopes up; yet, to my pleasant surprise, this product actually works! I purchased the Nzuri hair food to work on the &#x60;outside&#x27; and the Nzuri herbal vitamins to work on the &#x60;inside&#x27;. After all, I had read years ago that scientist had discovered a direct correlation between proper vitamin intake and healthy hair/nails/skin. For this reason, at least in my opinion, it seemed natural to pair a product healthy for the scalp with the required nutrients derivable from vitamin supplementation. In other words, if your aim is to grow strong, healthy hair, then I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably stronger and thicker as a result of using this product. I used it straight for 30 days. Earlier this week, I realized how much growth I had retained and how thick my braids are (I&#x27;m currently keeping my hair braids/plaits as a protective style underneath wigs). I also have experienced less shedding when doing my hair. I also love that it is herbal based. This is a product that I will continue to use and I encourage everyone to add it to their haircare regimen!</li>
            <li> This is a very good complete solution for everyone that wants to look great. I mostly bought it for my hair as my skin and nails are OK and it gave me great results. My hair looks a lot better and grows faster. It also stopped falling off as before.</li>
            <li> Great for nail growth but didn&#x27;t see any growth in hair tho.</li>
            <li> Unsure of this product.... has high promises.  But I don&#x27;t see the results I was expecting.  I have another product that has more vitamins that will probably work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for give days and already my hair is so much thicker I can barely get my fingers thru it... Along with the shampoo and conditioner my happy feels amazing. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results at the end of my thirty days... Very pleased so far</li>
            <li> I enjoy the nutrients this provides, and I find myself having more energy throughout the day. I&#x27;m sure this may appear to be common knowledge, but make sure you only take these after you have eaten something. My mornings are often rushed, so if I take them without eating I get a little lightheaded. Aside from that, no noted side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the hair. Its still too soon to tell, I have noticed an increase of thickness, but I have not yet completed my first bottle, I am considering purchasing another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin and Nails are lovely &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update soon!</li>
            <li> Really did help my typicality none growing hair too,&amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t believe I need to cut my hair already.  And I have not even finished the bottle.  Will continue using for sure.  It has made a huge difference.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I ordered two months supply but didn&#x27;t notice any change in my hair whatsoever. Maybe I needed to take them longer than that  or maybe they just don&#x27;t work for everybody. It was worth a shot though but won&#x27;t repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I am ordering my second bottle. My hair is growing, it&#x27;s thicker, smoother and more manageable. It definitely worked for me</li>
            <li> Two stars because the pills are hard to swallow for me and the dosage is two pills. Although trice the price I&#x27;m going back to liquid.</li>
            <li> did not see any difference in hair growth. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like Kraz-hair however, it doesn&#x27;t show fast results if you use it for years it will give you some improvements and slight results. I think there is a better hair vitamin pill on the market that shows faster results. Therefore, I will not continue on with this product only if the price goes down than maybe it will be worth it. But why pay the same amount for something when there is something out there better.</li>
            <li> This product should not be taken if you have a heart condition. I did not know that before buying it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other hair vitamins with the promise of speeding up hair growth and needless to say it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I found this vitamin by accident and I am so thankful that I did.  When I say that I see the results I honestly see them and I want to cry because that&#x27;s all anyone wants is to have their OWN hair to grown healthy and strong.  I will recommend this vitamin to any and everyone.  It has not even been a month yet and I am excited.. Can&#x27;t wait to see what the 90 day mark shows for me.  I am a customer for life!!! Thanks and God bless!!</li>
            <li> For 2 weeks I have been taking one in the morning and one at night. My hair has grown 3 inches (I find that impressive for just 14 days). It is very easy for me to swallow but ever since I was 5 I&#x27;ve been subscribed swallowing pills. If your new to it, just make sure you put a good amount of water in your mouth and before trying to swallow the pill try to place it about at the end of your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;I have been doing many other things to help it grow in addition like having foods with omega 3,vitamin c, and gelatin, I only showering &#x27;&#x27;every other&#x27;&#x27; day, I put gelatin in my shampoo/conditioner and massaging my scalp a few hours each day (I use a mechanical massage brush which has also helped with my growth success).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AA with natural 4a type hair. Reviews were pretty solid so I purchased 1 bottle of these vitamins and took everyday until I finished the bottle.  Did they work?  Short answer yes.  Long answer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes to a certain extent. Definitely noticed my nails grew out really fast and very long.  Hair grew in a but not as much as I was hoping for.  I probably should do another bottle to see better results as it may take more time for my body to adjust and respond to these vitamins but I wanted to try a different brand of hair vitamins (Carribean grow vitamins). So if I am not happy with the Carribean ones I may go back the KRA-Z brand as the vitamins are easy to swallow and I experienced no side effects. Everything was completely fine just wanted to see more growth which again is probably my fault for not continuing with a 2nd bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;Ordered and tried the other brand of vitamins and was not happy, not only did I not see any growth in nails or hair like these I also broke out so I&#x27;m going back to these as soon as this month is over.  I&#x27;m waiting because I want to clear my body of those other vitamins all together and I want to give my skin time to heal and get back to normal which thankfully it is doing  so next month I will start fresh with these again and go from there.  Will provide another update in another month or two...</li>
            <li> I waited 30 days to write this review, I can&#x27;t see any difference in my hair none. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair As a matter of fact it seems to be shedding Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair. Well ladies I must admit I washed my hair and blowdried it I have an inch and a half!!!! Sorry I didn&#x27;t wash my hair when I looked. Anyway I must say it&#x27;s a keeper!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you order this product from the actual company you will NEVER use it again! I&#x27;m glad I did and I am through with the product all together! I&#x27;m not sure if they even put the ingredients listed in the product. Sounds like they have no clue what is going on with their own product! This is very sad :( I have wasted lots of money with this.</li>
            <li> The effects of this vitamin were excellent.  I noticed almost no shedding after I began to take it for a few weeks.  I would love to continue taking it but it has made me throw up a few times.  Not every time I take it but enough times to make me not want to take it anymore.  I didn&#x27;t see anyone else with that complaint on these reviews.  I guess my stomach just doesn&#x27;t agree with it.  It also made me break out because of the high amount of Biotin in it.  Best hair vitamin I have tried but my body couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for about a month. I&#x27;m African American with coarse hair and I am dealing with scarring alopecia which has left a few small bald spots on my crown along with severe breakage. I started these pills in an effort to grow out the broken hair to help cover the bald spots.  My hair normally grows pretty fast, but after just one month, I have to part my hair to see the bald spot!  My doctor says the lost hair will never come back, but I&#x27;m excited about being able to conceal it. I should add, I also take biotin (1000mcg) per day so maybe it&#x27;s the combination.  To avoid nausea, I make sure I eat before I take them, even if it&#x27;s just toast and I drink lots of water right after and throughout the day.  I&#x27;m looking forward to my next bottle!</li>
            <li> I purchased the vitamins about 2 months ago but never took them because I hate pills.  However after I put a rinse on my natural hair it felt dry and was breaking off really bad so I decided to try the vitamins.  To my surprise after about 3 weeks of taking a tablet a day, my hair is feeling healthier and looking so much better.  I also notice that my nails are not as brittle.  I will continue and I am expecting greater results.  Thanks Nzuri Krazy Vitamins, I appreciate my natural hair again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Jarmon&lt;br /&gt;Houston, Texas</li>
            <li> Made some difference, but nothing worth celebrating.</li>
            <li> This is a very good widespread answer for everyone that wants to look great. I mostly bought it for my hair as my skin and nails are OK and it gave me great consequences. My hair looks a lot better and produces faster. It also stopped falling off as before. When I use the oil, I do the 15 minute massage I can literally feel the stuff working! I leave it in for an entire day before washing it out.</li>
            <li> NProduct seems to be working nails and hair are healthier. Noticed growth and strength in nails and growth in hair fullness</li>
            <li> I must say this product has been working for me. I chose to only take one pill daily in the beginning then I gradually shifted to two pills daily. I have noticed significant growth since I began taking the vitamins. It&#x27;s not a miracle growth pill like some reviews state, but it does promote hair growth like the bottle reads. On the down side, it promotes ALL hair growth including facial hair! But it comes with the territory, I guess the trade off for longer hair on my head is having to wax my upper lip.... That&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> This product really works well along with my other natural regimens, these last two months has been a successful journey I will continue to use</li>
            <li> I took these pills as described for a month and didnt notice any changes.  Usually when I take hair vitamins I can tell they are working after about a week becuase my scalp will itch more, I felt nothing with this.  I wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> this vitamin really works for my hair. its getting longer than before i have used one bottle and i purchased the second.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the product. It is doing exactly what it said it would do. I would recommend this product to others. The product actually arrived before the date they quoted, which was fine with me.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I had taken the Nzuri Elixir and had amazing results, my expectations were to high for these pills. I gave them a three in fairness because maybe my body simply absorbs liquids better than pills. Someone else may get amazing results.</li>
            <li> I added this with the Nzuri liquid after 10 days as I was so rundown I felt I would benefit from the additional nutrients as I was so depleted. I&#x27;ve  been taking this for 35 days now and have seen great progress. I&#x27;m normally really forgetful with tablets but these make me feel so nauseous that I have to lie/sit still for 30mins or so after taking them so I&#x27;ve managed to stick with doing this before I get up in the morning. I&#x27;d recommend taking with food even though it doesn&#x27;t advice this in the directions.&lt;br /&gt;This has supplemented the results from the liquid, my nails were already strengthening when I started taking this and are now growing very hard.&lt;br /&gt;By 10 days I noticed my eyebrows filling out and body hair growing quicker.&lt;br /&gt;At 20 days I noticed my hairline filling in with new baby hairs. Areas of thickened skin have smoothed out and my toenails which (annoyingly) are also growing like crazy are much thinner and less ridged.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have some of the crazy hair growth others claim to have had but am seeing steady growth and filling in of thinner areas. I have been rundown for a while so I&#x27;m sure once my depleted vitamin/mineral stores are replenished in a couple of months I will see the benefits even more. Highly recommend either supplement if you are healthy or both if you are run down.</li>
            <li> First of all let me make it perfectly clear hair texture has nothing to do with rather vitamins works or not.  If for any reason a product doesn&#x27;t work do not blame it on hair texture. Just try other vitamins. Also consider age, when I was in my 20s I didn&#x27;t see a need for hair, nails and skin vitamins products but when I turn 30 and went to see the dermatology she made it clear my skin is changing because I am an adult now.&lt;br /&gt; I have bought  this product for 3 months now, actually I buy all Nuzuri products and they are fantastic.  The first month major hair growth and nails and skin were wonderful.  I decided to stop just to see if there was a difference.  Well my hair conti to grow because I do take really good care of my hair, nails were still strong and great but I did see a difference in my skin which means my skin really like this product, but there was difference in my hair growth; it was still growing but not massive when I take the vitamins.  Overall this product is great.  I tell people all the time focus on the health of your hair, length will come.  Check your diet and how and what you eat  and lastly visit  a dermatologist. All of this can stop bad reviews. Nzuri is by far the best health product out there especially for people of color. UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE: I am still a fan of Nzuri products.  It still is working for me.  My hair is so long its ridiculous.  I did stop taking it for a month I just got to lazy to order it and I noticed that my hair just started shedding which is normal in the winter seasons and I said it was time to get my vitamins back and my hair stop shedding.  If you want healthy long hair you need to once again watch what you eat, exercise, see a dermatology often, visit your primary care provider and take Nuzuri.  Nuzuri is not just a hair vitamin product its also a mult-vitamins with hair vitamins in them.  If Nuzuri does not work for you its okay try other products out there.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My hair feels and looks great! It also is longer than it&#x27;s ever&lt;br /&gt;been! I&#x27;ve never been able to grow my hair longer than just about my shoulder blades,&lt;br /&gt;now it&#x27;s almost to my lower back. Not to mention how healthy it looks and feels. My nails&lt;br /&gt;and skin look better as well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The bottom line is don&#x27;t waist your time or money.  This product didn&#x27;t grow my hair at all. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of taking this product, I was amazed at how soft and full my hair is becoming - have seen some growth as well. My nails are getting stronger and much longer, and I am loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
