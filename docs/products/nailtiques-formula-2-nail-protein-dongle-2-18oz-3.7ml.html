            <li>Nailtiques is amazing!  </li>
            <li>but it lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li>This stuff works so good.</li>
            <li>and it is great as a under and top coat</li>
            <li>I was preparing for an art show and wanted my hands to look nice.</li>
            <li>I have had great success.</li>
            <li>and it has been so for most of my life.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure until week 2.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>While I could probably get away with leaving the Protein Formula 2 on all by itself; I do apply OPI matte top coat and no one is the wiser.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t chip and break nearly as easily.</li>
            <li>I feel like it chips off easily because it will do this while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li>As a man who has nails that bend and tear really easy I had to find a solution.  </li>
            <li>And my nails are STRONG.</li>
            <li>I have strong nails that look</li>
            <li>The nails on my left hand are beautiful though, no flakes, no chips, no cracks.</li>
            <li>I work with and wash my hands constantly and thus, do not have great nails.</li>
            <li>I have tried countless products to strengthen and grow my nails, nothing has worked as great as Nailtiques Formula 2.</li>
            <li>My nails always  have peeled or gotten very brittle when getting longer, this made my nails strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about it, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>I thought this was a full size bottle.  </li>
            <li>After the first month of using Nailtiques, my nails had started to grow strong.  </li>
            <li>My nails grew super fast and it also helped strengthen them after I took my acrylics off.</li>
            <li>After trying it I have to say that I am amazed at how smooth and natural it looks.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that keeps my nails strong.</li>
            <li>Now I apply it nightly and my nails are gorgeous and rock hard.  </li>
            <li>Really strengthens my nails.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my nails.</li>
            <li>Great product for when your nails are thin after using solar nails for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 59 years old and this is the first time in my life that I&#x27;ve been able to have long nails...</li>
            <li>Within weeks I had nails as long and strong as the acrylics I used to wear.</li>
            <li>though, I didn&#x27;t buy this product with the intention of it growing my nails, I needed it to preserve the nail growth I&#x27;ve achieved taking high potency</li>
            <li>Definitely a product worth recommending.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I do have issues with the length of the nails on my right index, thumb and middle fingers, this is possibly because I am right handed.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t live without this product since being introduced to it in 1986.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s true, while I don&#x27;t religiously follow the instructions to apply a coat every other day, I do apply two fresh coats each week and that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for anyone with soft, bendy, flaky nails.</li>
            <li>This definitely helped my nails become MUCH stronger!</li>
            <li>Now I get frequent compliments!</li>
            <li>this fixed the problems alright!</li>
            <li>I use this everyday to make my nails strong</li>
            <li>My nails were significantly stronger in less than a week of use.</li>
            <li>This has really helped by dry and breaking nails.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, my nails actually grow so long that I have to trim them.  </li>
            <li>At first I was surprised at the size of the bottle as it seemed to be about half the size of the standard nail lacquer</li>

            <li> In fact, about a week after the show, I actually had to clip my nails back, as they were too long to pick up pins!!!!</li>
            <li> My nails were very thin and they peeled easily ..</li>
            <li> Had given up on my nails long ago when my nail tech suggested using this.</li>
            <li> are long and stronger than they have ever been before.  </li>
            <li> I am passionate about products that work.</li>

            <li> I have tried OPI Nail Envy in the past, and it has nothing on this.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Seems to have helped my nails. they are no longer peeling after using for a month. Will order another bottle.</li>
            <li> This definitely helped my nails become MUCH stronger! They grow faster and look healthier.</li>
            <li> Been using for years.  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Best nail protein I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t live without this product since being introduced to it in 1986.  Really strengthens my nails.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to make my nails strong</li>
            <li> Had given up on my nails long ago when my nail tech suggested using this. Within weeks I had nails as long and strong as the acrylics I used to wear. I am concerned that the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; ingredient might be formaldehyde, but don&#x27;t want to know because I would have difficulty giving this up.</li>
            <li> Have only used it twice so far but already noticing a big difference in my nails which have always been paper thin and flimsy my entire life</li>
            <li> Love this product, but bought the wrong size. You can get A bottle twice the size for the same price.</li>
            <li> My nails always  have peeled or gotten very brittle when getting longer, this made my nails strong and healthy. I very very happy with this.</li>
            <li> My nails were very thin and they peeled easily .. I&#x27;ve been using Nailtiques Protein Formula2 for about 3 months and has been the only product that has work for me... I&#x27;m 59 years old and this is the first time in my life that I&#x27;ve been able to have long nails...</li>
            <li> works well if you keep it up</li>
            <li> and it has been so for most of my life. I decided to give this product a try because it professed to contain protein. At first I was surprised at the size of the bottle as it seemed to be about half the size of the standard nail lacquer bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after about a month of consistent use, my husband of five years has commented that he never thought he&#x27;d see the day when I&#x27;d be wearing long nails that look as if they are fake! But it&#x27;s true, while I don&#x27;t religiously follow the instructions to apply a coat every other day, I do apply two fresh coats each week and that has worked for me. Full disclosure though, I didn&#x27;t buy this product with the intention of it growing my nails, I needed it to preserve the nail growth I&#x27;ve achieved taking high potency Biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do have issues with the length of the nails on my right index, thumb and middle fingers, this is possibly because I am right handed. The nails on my left hand are beautiful though, no flakes, no chips, no cracks. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> If you have problem nails, this is the solution. I actually have to cut my nails about every 3 weeks so I don&#x27;t stab myself! Only issue is that you must continue to use it or nails peel. It adds a layer of protein that adheres to your nail, which is what peels and can damage if you don&#x27;t continue using it a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My nails used to chip, crack and peel until I found this product.  Now I apply it nightly and my nails are gorgeous and rock hard.  I have been using this for about 3 years every night.</li>
            <li> thought this was a larger bottle...........my fault for not reading description closer.</li>
            <li> Only used it for a week and my nails are already longer and stronger than before would buy again  and it is great as a under and top coat</li>
            <li> teeny tiny bottle but it lasts for a good while. this stuff really works well. I have had great success.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It has really helped my nails. It has helped so they don&#x27;t crack down the nail.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a nail specialist.  It has helped with my peeling nails--both protects, stops the peeling and seems to be helping the strenghtening/healing.</li>
            <li> small bottle but it works!</li>
            <li> this nail polish works great and gives strength to the nail- but the product became so tacky in the bottle within 2 weeks that I had to toss it.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell the difference in my nails. They don&#x27;t chip and break nearly as easily. I just wish the formula could stand tougher handling. I feel like it chips off easily because it will do this while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li> Finally a nail treatment that delivers on its promise. I suffered from paper thin nails before trying this. Now I get frequent compliments! I&#x27;m telling everyone alt this miracle!</li>
            <li> I wish I had heard about this product about 50 yrs ago. I work with and wash my hands constantly and thus, do not have great nails. I was preparing for an art show and wanted my hands to look nice. this fixed the problems alright! In fact, about a week after the show, I actually had to clip my nails back, as they were too long to pick up pins!!!! it is a must now for all time use. 6 stars!!!</li>
            <li> Nailtiques is amazing!  I have been using it for months now and my once splitting, constantly peeling nails are long and stronger than they have ever been before.  I have used a multitude of other products that promise to strengthen my nails to no avail.  After the first month of using Nailtiques, my nails had started to grow strong.  I use this product about every other day now and the vitamin oil about twice a week.  For the first time in my life, my nails actually grow so long that I have to trim them.  Best nail formula aver!  I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Definitely a product worth recommending. I am passionate about products that work. Wasn&#x27;t sure until week 2.  Follow directions and you will be amazed. And I was not always punctual on my application.  Finally my nails adapted and were growing way beyond my usual &amp;#34;cutting point&amp;#34;. I cut them, but next time will allow them to grow and see if they survive. I am thinking they will. ... On an organic note: does any one have any feed back? Hate to think: works great at a price. Dang!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!!!  I have tried OPI Nail Envy in the past, and it has nothing on this.  My nails were significantly stronger in less than a week of use.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference with with product.... i somewhat wish i hadnt purchased it. BUt differnt things work for different people</li>
            <li> Great product for when your nails are thin after using solar nails for years.  Helps to strenghten your nails....</li>
            <li> I thought this was a full size bottle.  What I received is a sample.  Never again!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that keeps my nails strong.</li>
            <li> This has really helped by dry and breaking nails. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products to strengthen and grow my nails, nothing has worked as great as Nailtiques Formula 2. I cannot say enough good things about it, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> As a man who has nails that bend and tear really easy I had to find a solution.  I work outside and it&#x27;s just plain HARD on my hands.  After trying clear nail polish and a variety of other products that just didn&#x27;t suit my needs I started looking up info on nails and saw a YouTube video where the woman swore by this product.  After trying it I have to say that I am amazed at how smooth and natural it looks. And my nails are STRONG. Kudos to you, Nailtiques!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  While I could probably get away with leaving the Protein Formula 2 on all by itself; I do apply OPI matte top coat and no one is the wiser.  I have strong nails that look nude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anyone with soft, bendy, flaky nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so good. My nails grew super fast and it also helped strengthen them after I took my acrylics off.</li>
            <li> Been using for almost two years.  Sometimes I think its working then all my nails break.  So I think its time to try another product!</li>
