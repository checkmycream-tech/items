            <li>They&#x27;ve changed the formulation a number of times through the years, each time becoming not as good as before.</li>
            <li>, this product is worth trying and the price and service is great</li>
            <li>It is not the original Aramis, but the shave is close and the skin feels good, you do not even need after-shave</li>

            <li>review has my wife&#x27;s name at top..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Have been purchasing this great product for a year or more now.....  makes a very noticeable difference as to the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>For the money I think it could be much better.</li>
            <li>texture of the stuff is interesting, it feels substantial on your fingers as you take a dab out of the jar.</li>
            <li>The shave is very comfortable and the cream leaves my face feeling smooth and without irritation.</li>
            <li>You deserve a nice clean paid free shave.  </li>
            <li>It is the closest most comfortable shave with lidocaine.</li>
            <li>This is by far the absolute best shave cream.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just a smooth shave (Pain Free)</li>
            <li>Fantastic comforting shave cream lives up to it&#x27;s name</li>
            <li>I was hopeful this would be a good replacement because there was nothing like the Lab brand for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be much better based on the reviews, but it really isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>and quick to use.</li>
            <li>Usually uses Thumper which is very good</li>
            <li>;, however, having bought and used both, this and the &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34; of Aramis, this is far superior to the new Aramis replacing the again, gone &amp;#34;lab series&amp;#34; with numbing in it.</li>
            <li>I used for first time this morning and used a blade that had a weeks worth of use, and I received the most pain free shave since the old Aramis.</li>
            <li>Same numbing action for sensitive skin, and a great shave too!  </li>
            <li>This is the closest I have been able to get in replacing the old Aramis Shave Cream with Benzocaine.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t misunderstand your face is not numb or anything like that</li>
            <li>I get such an easy and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a \\&quot;New Advanced Formula\\&quot; for its Maximum Comfort Shave Cream.</li>
            <li>Also, if you have facial hair to shave around, this stuff makes it super easy to see</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll really appreciate the difference.</li>
            <li>Much needed successor to the discontinued Lab series range with pain-killing ingredient</li>
            <li>I would recommend it it to anyone whether they be cartridge, DE or straight razor users.</li>
            <li>product is much better, costs less and has the lidocaine ingredient.  </li>
            <li>Because it is substantial, it takes more than one rinse to totally remove from your face after the shave but that doesn&#x27;t bother me personally.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>high end shave creams.</li>
            <li>Works great as far as the numbing agent goes, but difficult to wash off your razor unless you&#x27;re using am old fashion straight razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and shaving was very challenging with this product.</li>
            <li>if you have used the old Aramis shave cream</li>
            <li>This shave cream claims to be a replacement for the old Lab Series shave cream.</li>
            <li>For many years I was accustomed to the little-lather shave balms or lotions instead of the big heavy creams.</li>
            <li>FACE Skin Care, overcomes this problem by introducing lidocaine in its formulation, thus returning a skin care product for shaving that produces a real \\&quot;maximum comfort\\&quot; zone for shaving by eliminating the pain of minor razor burn or nicks.</li>
            <li>The creams just really seemed to dry out and irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>nothing compares to ultimate comfort shave cream for sensitive skin.....</li>
            <li>This has a similar texture but is no way near as creamy.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it only takes a little bit to smear on thick and provide enough protection for a good shave.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does an excellent job removing facial hair. And the results last a for the rest of the day. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Was a dedicated user of Lab Series for over 15 years because of the benzocaine in the product.  Frantically searched for a replacement product when the benzocaine was removed.  Was so happy when I found Face Skin Care with Lidocaine.  Same numbing action for sensitive skin, and a great shave too!  Seemed a little expensive at first, but the 8 oz. tub lasts a long time! So, it pays!!!!  Oh, and to speak with them on the phone.... They are the nicest people to deal with... What a change from dealing with big corporations!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and with the creators&#x27; commitment to perfection, I can only see it getting better and better. I would recommend this to anybody looking for the discomfort that comes with their shaving, to disappear.</li>
            <li> Husband loves!!  Usually uses Thumper which is very good but this is definitely wonderful for a good shave.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> you will love to shave.....I&#x27;m not kidding...shaving is something I look forward to each day....no sensation of irritation whatsoever.......guys...theres nothing like this product out there.....I&#x27;ve tried literally every shave cream out there...nothing compares to ultimate comfort shave cream for sensitive skin.....</li>
            <li> extinct &amp;#34;Aramis lab series&amp;#34;, however, having bought and used both, this and the &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34; of Aramis, this is far superior to the new Aramis replacing the again, gone &amp;#34;lab series&amp;#34; with numbing in it.</li>
            <li> I searched for a product that had a numbing agent due to sensitive skin and shaving.  I had used Lab Series before when it stopped working as expected. I later discovered that they changed the formula without any notification.  Lab Series took out the ADVERTISED ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is much better, costs less and has the lidocaine ingredient.  I&#x27;ll never buy that other company&#x27;s products again.</li>
            <li> Oh Happy Days..This is the closest I have been able to get in replacing the old Aramis Shave Cream with Benzocaine. I have spent hundreds of dollars looking for a replacement to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;This product is not totally the same but it&#x27;s the very best I have tried. I used for first time this morning and used a blade that had a weeks worth of use, and I received the most pain free shave since the old Aramis. Please don&#x27;t misunderstand your face is not numb or anything like that, it&#x27;s just a smooth shave (Pain Free) if you have used the old Aramis shave cream you will be Blown Away..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review has my wife&#x27;s name at top..I&#x27;m the one that used product..also I used Aramis/Lab Series 25 years..</li>
            <li> You deserve a nice clean paid free shave.  This is the only product out there with Lidocaine.  Apply, give it two minutes and shave.  Use a shave oil pre-cream and you&#x27;ll really appreciate the difference.</li>
            <li> I love it. The smell is great and the texture is awesome. It works perfectly on my husband&#x27;s face. However, I didn&#x27;t know that I was allergic to something in this product so it makes my legs break out. Oh well. Still an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Have been purchasing this great product for a year or more now.....  makes a very noticeable difference as to the closeness of the shave. Unlike other shave creams, this product has a topical additive that really reduces the uncomfortable irritation that accompanies other shave creams when used daily.</li>
            <li> Works great as far as the numbing agent goes, but difficult to wash off your razor unless you&#x27;re using am old fashion straight razor.</li>
            <li> Awesome replacement for Aramis Max Comfort!</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is the best!</li>
            <li> Fantastic comforting shave cream lives up to it&#x27;s name, this product is worth trying and the price and service is great</li>
            <li> It is not the original Aramis, but the shave is close and the skin feels good, you do not even need after-shave</li>
            <li> Lab Series, Skin Care For Men, recently introduced a \\&quot;New Advanced Formula\\&quot; for its Maximum Comfort Shave Cream. This product now does NOT CONTAIN the one ingredient that produced maximum comfort, benzocaine, a local anesthetic on the skin.  FACE Skin Care, overcomes this problem by introducing lidocaine in its formulation, thus returning a skin care product for shaving that produces a real \\&quot;maximum comfort\\&quot; zone for shaving by eliminating the pain of minor razor burn or nicks. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Was a long-time user of Lab Series for over 10 years because of the benzocaine in the product. I searched extensively for a replacement product and found this product and tried it once and was convinced.  Best shaving cream on the market!</li>
            <li> Tried it this morning, great shaving cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lab series ultimate comfort shave cream since the 1980&#x27;s when it was called aramis 900.  They&#x27;ve changed the formulation a number of times through the years, each time becoming not as good as before. This last change was the last straw and I went looking for a replacement. I&#x27;ve tried a half dozen high end shave creams. The face skin care ultimate comfort shave cream is the answer. This is by far the absolute best shave cream.  My shaves are incredibly close and incredibly comfortable.</li>
            <li> This shave cream claims to be a replacement for the old Lab Series shave cream. This has a similar texture but is no way near as creamy. This type also doesn&#x27;t numb the face like the Lab brand did. I was expecting it to be much better based on the reviews, but it really isn&#x27;t anything special. For the money I think it could be much better. I was hopeful this would be a good replacement because there was nothing like the Lab brand for sensitive skin. This just missed the mark.</li>
            <li> Much needed successor to the discontinued Lab series range with pain-killing ingredient</li>
            <li> For many years I was accustomed to the little-lather shave balms or lotions instead of the big heavy creams. The creams just really seemed to dry out and irritate my skin. So when I switched to shaving with a double edge safety razor I was sort of apprehensive about switching to a big lathery soap to shave with. Enter this product, it works great for me. I get such an easy and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the stuff is interesting, it feels substantial on your fingers as you take a dab out of the jar. The consistency is somewhere between whipped cream and white glue. Anyway, it only takes a little bit to smear on thick and provide enough protection for a good shave. Because it is substantial, it takes more than one rinse to totally remove from your face after the shave but that doesn&#x27;t bother me personally. Also, if you have facial hair to shave around, this stuff makes it super easy to see so you don&#x27;t ruin your beard or something.</li>
            <li> As an ardent brush lathering soap/cream user this shave cream is somewhat of a revelation.&lt;br /&gt;Easy and quick to use. The shave is very comfortable and the cream leaves my face feeling smooth and without irritation. I would recommend it it to anyone whether they be cartridge, DE or straight razor users.</li>
            <li> Product worked well!  Just started to use it so I will hopefully achieve the same results as I did with Lab Series.</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement for the Lab Series (who changed their formula to exclude benzocaine). It is the closest most comfortable shave with lidocaine. Its thick and a little goes a long way. Pricey yes, but you will end up saving as this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product had the same numbing quality ingredient as their earlier shave cream but it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s very thick and shaving was very challenging with this product.</li>
