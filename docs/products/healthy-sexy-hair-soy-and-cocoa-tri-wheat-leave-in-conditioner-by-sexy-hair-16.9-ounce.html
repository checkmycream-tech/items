            <li>Tri-Wheat Leave-In Conditioner by Sexy Hair, 16.9 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.  </li>
            <li>I. Love.</li>
            <li>received a sample size of this in my Ipsy bag and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the great reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>I love this leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>no tangles just healthy hair</li>
            <li>I have heard from many people</li>
            <li>I love the stuff and plan to get it again.</li>
            <li>I used to love the John Freida leave-in-conditioner, but this is much better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite hair care products.  </li>
            <li>Love the size.</li>
            <li>Better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>If there was a better product without the extra adjective, I&#x27;d choose that, but this is the best we&#x27;ve found for combing out her hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>My hair is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this right after my hairstylist sprayed on me at the salon and it smelled really good and condition well.</li>
            <li>but when I use Kerastase ultime with it, it really looks good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to comb through after spraying this on.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, wavy and frizzy.</li>
            <li>we love healthy sexy hair, it works great to moisturize and makes my thick hair easy to brush through.  </li>
            <li>The size of this product is huge.</li>
            <li>I have dyed hair and moisture is important for my hair.</li>
            <li>Works great on my long hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on dry ends.  </li>
            <li>Smells kinda different, but still pleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell is different but my hair is looking good.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found to control frizz, maintain softness and protect from the straight iron without weighing my hair down or making it look dirty/greasy.</li>
            <li>I can say that the conditioner works great, but it&#x27;s heavy for fine, oily types.</li>
            <li>much more cost effective to buy this here on Amazon - Ulta charges the same or more for the smaller 10oz bottle.</li>
            <li>Worth spending your money on</li>
            <li>I have used the hair product, Healthy Sexy Hair, for a few years.  </li>
            <li>The is a great product it makes your hair so soft and bouncy really helps with combing through wet hair</li>
            <li>Great for long and short hair.</li>
            <li>Sure enough they carry it</li>
            <li>Love the big bottle, lasts for a while!</li>
            <li>went to a hair salon to get my usual trim and the lady used Healthy Sexy Hair on my tresses to detangle it before a haircut.</li>
            <li>Love this spray: detangles and provides a light conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always been full of tangles ever since I was young.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large but if I would have problems holding it.</li>
            <li>and it really works well for my hair.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need too much of it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care the smell and didn&#x27;t see much conditioning.</li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner really defines my curles and, if used over time, seems to make my hair look stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really dig that she&#x27;s asking me what it means.  </li>
            <li>It makes combing her hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li>We no longer have the fights to get the tangles out thanks to this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really greasy</li>
            <li>The smell kinda neutralizes the odor of my hair conditioner and shampoo but don&#x27;t really mind about that.</li>
            <li>, it smells nice and it has also helped keep the dry frizzies to a minimum (major plus).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>and you have less static when you use this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>If you have unruly hair, I highly recommend this Leave</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really see a wow moment either.</li>
            <li>Wanted the bigger size, but couldn&#x27;t find it wherever I looked and the price was right.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft with this</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair  very soft, fights the frizz and makes it shine a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>keep my curls very natural - not crunchy.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li>Some people claim it makes their hair greasy, I only noticed that when I didnt shower that day, it did get much greaiser than normal.</li>
            <li>It detangles and leaves your hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it does not leave hair gummy - instead - soft.</li>
            <li>My waves turn into soft curls and my hair isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>This leaves your hair so soft without making it oily.</li>
            <li>I frequently get color put on my hair</li>
            <li>I dont use much but my hair is definitely healthier and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, which I have chemically straightened.</li>
            <li>very helpful and seems to help with the dry hair, can&#x27;t say  </li>
            <li>I have long, straight Asian hair</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see it work instantly.</li>
            <li>I have very long (top of hip) moderately thick hair that basically turns into dreadlocks without daily conditioning</li>
            <li>It does not weigh my hair down if I don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin, so on other types it may be slightly different, but i honestly dont see the greasiness being an issue.</li>

            <li> I have very long (top of hip) moderately thick hair that basically turns into dreadlocks without daily conditioning</li>

            <li> My hair is thin, so on other types it may be slightly different, but i honestly dont see the greasiness being an issue.</li>
            <li> This is the only product (besides super expensive treatments that dont even last long) that defrizzes my hair and keeps it shiny.</li>
            <li> Made it earlier than expected and was just as listed.</li>
            <li> Her hair gets tangled because it is so long</li>
            <li> This may not be advertised as a detangling spray, but it works wonders on my daughter&#x27;s long hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a must with my dry hair in Arizona.  </li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry and frizzy after washing, but this helps a lot.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry and brittle - lots of frizz - color processed.  </li>
            <li> and she puts it up and down into ponytails constantly.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to build up with daily use, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use conditioner just this spray on damp hair then blow dry!</li>
            <li> For years, my shower drain was full of hair I pulled out of my head while running my comb through my wet hair with these useless products.</li>
            <li> Bottle was little to big to use.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Is good! very helpful and seems to help with the dry hair, can&#x27;t say  cuz i just have used it one day</li>
            <li> Great bargain! The size of this product is huge. Worth spending your money on and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have used Healthy Sexy Hair Soy &amp; Cocoa Tri-Wheat leave in conditioner for some time, I love it. My hair is very thick and very dry as a rule, but after using this leave in conditioner my hair stays soft. The plus was getting this at a great price as well.[[ASIN:B003UE0HG0 Healthy Sexy Hair Soy and Cocoa Tri-Wheat Leave-In Conditioner by Sexy Hair, 16.9 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this.  It detangles and leaves your hair so soft.  Even my stylist asked what I was using!</li>
            <li> My hair feels very soft with this</li>
            <li> The is a great product it makes your hair so soft and bouncy really helps with combing through wet hair this complements any hair style</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!!! No more fighting over hair combing!</li>
            <li> I have used the hair product, Healthy Sexy Hair, for a few years.  It works as a great leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this spray: detangles and provides a light conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I. Love. This. Product!&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample size of this in my Ipsy bag and fell in love with it. I can use this on my hair after showering without conditioning my hair and I can get a brush through my hair like butter. It&#x27;s ridiculous. I have very long (top of hip) moderately thick hair that basically turns into dreadlocks without daily conditioning but since I&#x27;ve tried this, I can actually skip that step if I need to save on time or am just feeling lazy. :-P (Just to test it, I went without using traditional conditioner in the shower for over a week - it still works wonders.)&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy or heavy, it smells nice and it has also helped keep the dry frizzies to a minimum (major plus).&lt;br /&gt;Also much more cost effective to buy this here on Amazon - Ulta charges the same or more for the smaller 10oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the great reviews on this product. For starters, it is a liquid and not a creamy product and it&#x27;s almost like there is nothing in your hair. I think it helped somehow but I didn&#x27;t really see a wow moment either. I would have rather stayed with my Biosilk leave-in.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it on my wet hair! It&#x27;s easy to comb through after spraying this on. Smells great. Leaves my hair looking and feeling healthy!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gets knots out immediately from my daughters&#x27; curly hair and helpful to moisturize my husband&#x27;s gray hair.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner it makes my hair look great all the time no frizzy no tangles just healthy hair</li>
            <li> Made it earlier than expected and was just as listed.</li>
            <li> Love this and smells real good...</li>
            <li> This product smells good and it is great for detangling.  I&#x27;m natural and I spray it in my hair and rub in and finger detangle before combing through with a wide tooth comb.  My only complaint is that it dries a little crunchy, you must use with a moisturizing lotion  or oil if you intend to leave it on.  I decided to use it as a detangler with added conditioning benefits before washing my hair rather than as a leave in.</li>
            <li> Before buying anything I always check out the reviews. I was a little concern due to some of the review&#x27;s. I have heard from many people how great this leave in was going to help my hair. So I decided to get it. I had no problems with shipping. My two bottles were not leaking or that the squeeze was broken. The bottle is large but if I would have problems holding it. I would go and get a spray bottle smaller to use and just pour the product in it. I heard one say she even sprayed her face and almost her eyes. That makes me think the person didn&#x27;t know their is two control sprayers in the trigger. I love the stuff and plan to get it again. I have very thick hair and it really works well for my hair. Get it you will like it</li>
            <li> I like the idea of leave in conditioner, sadly...it&#x27;s not for my hair, which is on the oily side. I can say that the conditioner works great, but it&#x27;s heavy for fine, oily types.</li>
            <li> This is a must with my dry hair in Arizona.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I like the way it does not leave hair gummy - instead - soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great for long and short hair. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> This is a leave on conditioner and it does what you want a conditioner to do. You can comb/brush through tangles and you have less static when you use this. It does not weigh my hair down if I don&#x27;t use too much. A little goes a long way. I bought a smaller bottle at the salon and then saw my stylist using this &amp;#34;lifetime supply&amp;#34; bottle and told her I would get some when I checked out. We both forgot and I decided to look on Amazon. Sure enough they carry it and I am happy. One of my daughters has very long and very thick hair and she likes it too. Her hair gets tangled because it is so long and she puts it up and down into ponytails constantly. She discovered my bottle and started using it and that is why I needed to get a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price!</li>
            <li> I discovered this stuff because my hair stylist used it after my last haircut. My hair is fine, wavy and frizzy. No leave in conditioner or styling product would ever get rid of the frizz. This stuff is great! My waves turn into soft curls and my hair isn&#x27;t sticky. It can be heavy so you don&#x27;t need too much of it. Hope they never stop making this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have really thick hair. This is the best detangler I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair feeling so silky and moisturized.  My hair tends to be dry and frizzy after washing, but this helps a lot.  I used to love the John Freida leave-in-conditioner, but this is much better. I would recommend this to anyone who tends to have frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> good price great product</li>
            <li> This leaves your hair so soft without making it oily. I love the smell. I get out of the shower use a towel to get the excess water and spray this, it helps detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> Wanted the bigger size, but couldn&#x27;t find it wherever I looked and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Bottle was little to big to use. When I sprayed it went all over my face too. I used before curl my hair and created nice curl but I don&#x27;t care the smell and didn&#x27;t see much conditioning.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on the health of my hair and I use this almost every day!  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hair care products.  My hair is extremely dry and brittle - lots of frizz - color processed.  This product was recommended by my beautician and after trying it at the salon, she gave it to me to take home.  It&#x27;s great on dry ends.  I do follow it up with Kerastase ultime.  With use of both products, my hair is in good condition; looks good; doesn&#x27;t tangle; feels good and styling stays..  This product doesn&#x27;t seem to build up with daily use, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  It&#x27;s a favorite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have one con - it&#x27;s that I think it does dull the hair, a bit - but when I use Kerastase ultime with it, it really looks good.  I have found that this  duo works great for me.</li>
            <li> Love the size. The smell is different but my hair is looking good. I have dyed hair and moisture is important for my hair. This fits the bill. I have long thick hair and I went from bleach blonde to red brown.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner really defines my curles and, if used over time, seems to make my hair look stronger and healthier. I frequently get color put on my hair and I feel like it helps it heal.</li>
            <li> I love this! After going through many detanglers, this is THE one! Smells kinda different, but still pleasant. I dont use much but my hair is definitely healthier and manageable. Love the big bottle, lasts for a while!</li>
            <li> I bought this right after my hairstylist sprayed on me at the salon and it smelled really good and condition well. But when I got this smell was not the same.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, which I have chemically straightened. This is the best product I have found to control frizz, maintain softness and protect from the straight iron without weighing my hair down or making it look dirty/greasy. Will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This may not be advertised as a detangling spray, but it works wonders on my daughter&#x27;s long hair.  Better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.  I kind of wish it wasn&#x27;t called healthy &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; hair.  I mean, my daughter&#x27;s only 6 and I don&#x27;t really dig that she&#x27;s asking me what it means.  If there was a better product without the extra adjective, I&#x27;d choose that, but this is the best we&#x27;ve found for combing out her hair.  Ever.</li>
            <li> This is the only product (besides super expensive treatments that dont even last long) that defrizzes my hair and keeps it shiny. It also helps with breakage in the hair. Some people claim it makes their hair greasy, I only noticed that when I didnt shower that day, it did get much greaiser than normal. My hair is thin, so on other types it may be slightly different, but i honestly dont see the greasiness being an issue.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it takes away all my frizzies.  Just spray and comb through.  Done!  Highly recommended.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my long hair! I wish it would smell better!</li>
            <li> we love healthy sexy hair, it works great to moisturize and makes my thick hair easy to brush through.  My girls have curly hair and it works great on them too !!</li>
            <li> I by this for my daughters hair and we love it! It makes combing her hair so much easier.  We no longer have the fights to get the tangles out thanks to this conditioner.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My hair is really greasy and I have to wash it 4 times a week, so this product is really nice because its very light. The smell kinda neutralizes the odor of my hair conditioner and shampoo but don&#x27;t really mind about that. Leaves my hair  very soft, fights the frizz and makes it shine a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret buying this size because for $22 its twice the size of the medium bottle.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Recomended by my stylist for my daughters hair. she has curly corse hair it keeps the tagles away. Great price!</li>
            <li> Wife loves the stuff.</li>
            <li> great leave in conditioner. keep my curls very natural - not crunchy. It does not create buil up and smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My hair is nice and smooth. I don&#x27;t even use conditioner just this spray on damp hair then blow dry!</li>
            <li> I have long, straight Asian hair and it&#x27;s always been full of tangles ever since I was young. I would drive to work with my car windows down and my hair would automatically become tangled and my co-worker would comment, &amp;#34;Did you even brush your hair this morning?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried over the counter conditioners such as Herbal Essence, Pantene and even more expensive &amp;#34;Salon grade&amp;#34; ones by Nexxus and Paul Mitchell. For years, my shower drain was full of hair I pulled out of my head while running my comb through my wet hair with these useless products. One day I was visiting my friend in San Diego and staying at her house and she said, &amp;#34;are you losing your hair?&amp;#34; when she saw the clumps of hair I cleaned from her tub. It&#x27;s a wonder that I&#x27;m not balding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a hair salon to get my usual trim and the lady used Healthy Sexy Hair on my tresses to detangle it before a haircut. I was surprised to see it work instantly. I immediately bought it for my own use and I can&#x27;t see how I lived all my life without this wonderful product! My salon no longer sells it to their customers, so I have to buy it on Amazon. If you have unruly hair, I highly recommend this Leave In Conditioner by Sexy Hair!</li>
