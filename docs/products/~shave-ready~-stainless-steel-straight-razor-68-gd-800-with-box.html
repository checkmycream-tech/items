            <li>Happy with the razor.  </li>
            <li>They are a great buy when you compare cost to the value.</li>
            <li>For an inexpensive razor, it has a very nice handling feel.</li>
            <li>A good razor for the price</li>
            <li>Nice weight.</li>
            <li>I took it to a friend of mine to have it honed and the results after the process were much better.</li>
            <li>What I like most about this razor is its weight, the blade is balanced nicely and fits comfortably in my hands.</li>
            <li>but I would definitely recommend getting it honed once more for best results.</li>
            <li>It did not cut a hanging hair - but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I know their are better quality razors that give even smoother shaves, but this razor is effective and a good choice for someone wanting to try a straight razor on a budget.</li>
            <li>However, you WILL pay much more for the blade.</li>
            <li>Works, but quality could be better.</li>
            <li>If I wanted to spend $120 to $220 on a razor, I could have gotten a better looking razor.</li>
            <li>Great product I love my new razor.</li>
            <li>Ultra sharp and great service for the price!</li>
            <li>and it ought to be fine for a travel razor.</li>
            <li>A bit cheap on the materials, but for the price this razor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent straight razor for beginners or for those who are a little more frugal</li>
            <li>Works great and easy to keep sharp.</li>
            <li>So far this has been a great straight razor.</li>
            <li>However, the blade holds an excellent edge, and if you buy it from Wet Shaving Products - comes shave ready.</li>
            <li>looked nice and was good craftsmanship for what you pay, it also felt good in your hands, however the blade was not shave ready it was very dull.</li>
            <li>I noticed it struggling to get through my hair effectively compared to other razors I own.  </li>
            <li>Apparently these have much better craftsmanship and are better quality</li>
            <li>Two were of Carbon Steel and this one which is Stainless Steel,  and my favorite of the three.  </li>
            <li>While this razor comes sharp, I would argue that an additional honing is needed to make it a more effective razor.</li>
            <li>Ready to shave, I am happy with the quality so far and would recommend it to someone looking to get into shaving with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this straight razor, and yes it does come shave ready as promised!</li>
            <li>Nice middle shelf product</li>
            <li>I realized this after buying a professionally honed razor that shaved my face super smooth with no cuts or irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>As I said previously, if you can learn to hone, this is a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li>more then likely given 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Next time I would spend more.</li>
            <li>I have very coarse/thick hair and the first shave I gave myself with this razor</li>
            <li>This is my first straight razor so please understand that I have nothing else to compare with in the line of straight razors.</li>
            <li>The DoVo  I purchased from you is the far superior blade hands down</li>
            <li>A dull putty knife provided a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It was suppose to be shave ready but not so now I am working on learning on how to sharpen a razor.</li>
            <li>I do like the look,  feel and weight but still not quite ready to shave with just yet looking forward to when it is.</li>
            <li>Had it been truly shave ready</li>
            <li>Shave ready when received</li>
            <li>If you are a beginner with straight razor shaving, I would try this based on price.</li>
            <li>If you are going to stick to using a straight razor no matter the steep learning curve, then save you money and go with a DOVO.</li>
            <li>receiving the whetstones, I re beveled the blade and honed it according to the straight razor guru, Lynn Abrams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to straight razor shaving and am using quality budget priced items.  </li>
            <li>I use them for shaping double reeds (mostly oboe and English horn).  </li>
            <li>This razor is pure junk do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Too hard is a big problem for this kind of use, since the blade tends to chip..</li>
            <li>I have a very coarse beard and so far unless my hair gets about 4 days long (1/8&amp;#34;), I have no issues day to day.</li>
            <li>Comes sharp enough to cut a standing hair, truly shave ready.</li>
            <li>I can very sharp and ready to use out of the box.</li>

            <li> Great product I love my new razor. I can very sharp and ready to use out of the box. Very happy.</li>
            <li> A bit cheap on the materials, but for the price this razor is fantastic.  Comes sharp enough to cut a standing hair, truly shave ready.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to keep sharp. Beats buying regular blades.</li>
            <li> Returned for refund.  &amp;#34;Shave Ready&amp;#34; did not apply to the unit I received.  A dull putty knife provided a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> While this razor comes sharp, I would argue that an additional honing is needed to make it a more effective razor. I have very coarse/thick hair and the first shave I gave myself with this razor I noticed it struggling to get through my hair effectively compared to other razors I own.  I took it to a friend of mine to have it honed and the results after the process were much better. What I like most about this razor is its weight, the blade is balanced nicely and fits comfortably in my hands.

A good razor for the price but I would definitely recommend getting it honed once more for best results.</li>
            <li> Happy with the razor.  It is sharp and shaves well.  It did not cut a hanging hair - but that&#x27;s ok.  When I get my sharpening stones I&#x27;ll change that.</li>
            <li> This razor came just as described. Ready to shave, I am happy with the quality so far and would recommend it to someone looking to get into shaving with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> It was suppose to be shave ready but not so now I am working on learning on how to sharpen a razor. I do like the look,  feel and weight but still not quite ready to shave with just yet looking forward to when it is. Had it been truly shave ready would have more then likely given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Shave ready when received</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to straight razor shaving and am using quality budget priced items.  This razor arrived sharp and shaved my face close without cuts or irritation.  I know their are better quality razors that give even smoother shaves, but this razor is effective and a good choice for someone wanting to try a straight razor on a budget.</li>

            <li> This razor is pure junk do not waste your money. there&#x27;s no doubt its poor craftsmanship and it is not shave ready</li>
            <li> This is my first straight razor so please understand that I have nothing else to compare with in the line of straight razors. So far this has been a great straight razor. I have not had to strop it since I have been using it for a month now. I have a very coarse beard and so far unless my hair gets about 4 days long (1/8&amp;#34;), I have no issues day to day. If you are a beginner with straight razor shaving, I would try this based on price. If you are going to stick to using a straight razor no matter the steep learning curve, then save you money and go with a DOVO. Apparently these have much better craftsmanship and are better quality However, you WILL pay much more for the blade.</li>
            <li> They are as sharp as advertised, but I don&#x27;t using them for shaving.  I use them for shaping double reeds (mostly oboe and English horn).  The steel is neither too soft nor too hard.  Too hard is a big problem for this kind of use, since the blade tends to chip..</li>
            <li> Works, but quality could be better. You get what you pay for. Next time I would spend more.</li>
            <li> Nice middle shelf product</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> This was a starter razor for me. I didn&#x27;t realize that the reason I sliced and scraped up my face for a month wasn&#x27;t due to a lack of skill, but to a blade that wasn&#x27;t sharp enough (though it was advertized as &amp;#34;shave ready&amp;#34;). I realized this after buying a professionally honed razor that shaved my face super smooth with no cuts or irritation whatsoever. I&#x27;ll have it honed and it ought to be fine for a travel razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straight razor, and yes it does come shave ready as promised!</li>
            <li> Ultra sharp and great service for the price!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Shave Ready\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply to everyone. For me, it wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to give me the shave I anticipated. I do, however, believe I can get it there with some additional honing, If you&#x27;re prepared to,and have the ability to do some touch up with a 4k/8k stone, then it,s a terrific buy.For an inexpensive razor, it has a very nice handling feel. Nice weight. After about a month, I had to Repin the back section of the scales. A disappointment, it turned out well, since I did a better job of it than the refurbisher&#x27;s did.&lt;br /&gt;  Later date:&lt;br /&gt;After receiving the whetstones, I re beveled the blade and honed it according to the straight razor guru, Lynn Abrams. It is now a very awesome razor. As I said previously, if you can learn to hone, this is a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> This razor was supposed to be &amp;#34;shave ready&amp;#34; but was not even close. Am sending it back.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 Gold Dollar Razors from this company.  Two were of Carbon Steel and this one which is Stainless Steel,  and my favorite of the three.  They are a great buy when you compare cost to the value.</li>
            <li> looked nice and was good craftsmanship for what you pay, it also felt good in your hands, however the blade was not shave ready it was very dull.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. If I wanted to spend $120 to $220 on a razor, I could have gotten a better looking razor. However, the blade holds an excellent edge, and if you buy it from Wet Shaving Products - comes shave ready. This is an excellent straight razor for beginners or for those who are a little more frugal</li>
