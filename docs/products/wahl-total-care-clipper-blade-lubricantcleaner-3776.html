            <li> Product content itself is okay, but the warehouse shipped the product with a broken cap, rendering the cap useless.  </li>
            <li> You can hear the clippers &amp;#34;loaded&amp;#34; down a little because of the thicker lubricant.</li>
            <li> It works well to force clippings out but the weight of the lubricant is a little heavy(thick) in my opinion.</li>
            <li> does the job but application can be a bit messy</li>

            <li> This product is PERFECT for me.  I have very sensitive skin and hot clippers burn my face up.  Not any more!!!</li>
            <li> Works great to keep trimmer running at optimal level.</li>
            <li> When you need to clean or lubricate your clippers, use this! It&#x27;s good to maintain the condition of your clippers before they start to rust or build up hair and get stuck. So, I use this about 1-2 times per month, and with the amount you get in this product, it will definitely last for a while. When my clippers got stuck, I applied this to the blade and instantly it cleared everything up. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Product content itself is okay, but the warehouse shipped the product with a broken cap, rendering the cap useless.  Since the contents carry a &amp;#34;Danger&amp;#34; warning, the cap is an essential safety item for when I have to store the spray canister on a shelf somewhere!</li>
            <li> Great at cleaning cutters</li>
            <li> Great price for Wahl hair trimmers oil lubricant.</li>
            <li> The clipper lubricant is a nice alternative to the Shaver Saver. You get twice as much lube for have the price of Shaver Saver. The Wahl clipper lubricant is a much thicker oil, therefore you do not need to use as much of it on your razor.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a beautician, I bought this for her. She recommends it.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well. I will reorder when when this supply runs out.</li>
