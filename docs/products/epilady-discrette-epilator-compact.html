    <ol>
            <li>For $25 this is a GREAT buy!</li>
            <li>this is just a great solution for unwanted body hair!</li>
            <li>it does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>Works best on just-showered and exfoliated legs (loofa or scrubby gloves).  </li>
            <li>good!  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because of its great reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>For the money, this is a great value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for underarms and works well in the bikini area.</li>
            <li>Its great.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok!!</li>
            <li>It was good...</li>
            <li>the good is that is actally works</li>
            <li>but as good when it comes to thinner hairs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size for travel.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, it&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Way better than shaving, for legs, pits and bikini!</li>
            <li>Make sure you used lotion afterward!     </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use!).</li>
            <li>This seemed to be the most effective, cheapest version - I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like epilating.     </li>
            <li>This new model is good too!</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes my legs feel.  </li>
            <li>Even though the product is inexpensive, it should perform better.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this product again - better to pay a bit more but have your hair removed quicker and easier.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing is this is WAY quieter than my braun, but it isn&#x27;t as thorough at plucking out the hairs.</li>
            <li>I love the Epilday Discrette.</li>
            <li>I imagine the Legend is much better - thought</li>
            <li>I like the dual-speed choice even though I mostly use the faster one.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If you want something cheap and better than waxing</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d say that the best results were when I used it on my armpits (perhaps because my hair there is thicker than in other areas)</li>
            <li>- the bright light makes the hair much easier to see.   </li>
            <li>Fairly easy to clean</li>
            <li>It works well but still isn&#x27;t as good as my old one which is another brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is the first time I&#x27;ve used an epilator, I can&#x27;t compare it&#x27;s performance to others, but I can say it&#x27;s so much better than shaving</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good at getting fine hairs as it is getting big ones, but patience gets results.    </li>
            <li>It was very good pay less for this epilator and see that it works well.</li>
            <li>Nothing special...  </li>
            <li>probabbly perfect for girl with thick hair</li>
            <li>If you have waxed before you can certainly \\&quot;bear the pain\\&quot; from this, and if you haven&#x27;t then just try the tweezers on the area you want to work on and imagine many tweezers working at once, but the results are definetely worth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great price compared to other epilators.  </li>
            <li>My last epilator was about the same price, but it performed excellent.</li>
            <li>I expected a good product.</li>
            <li>This is not as powerful as the Emjoi epilator</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s effective, and as long as you keep up with it</li>
            <li>your money, add a little more and buy one with more quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely used to the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; - so much that I don&#x27;t even feel it any more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I use an epilator</li>
            <li>Very noisy!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the first process at all and after that</li>
            <li>color of my epilator is not the same at the one shown, it&#x27;s much more pleasing to the eye..</li>
            <li>With this process, it takes a week or two before I see much of anything worth removing.  </li>
            <li>Ok now to the actual product review.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much after the first time.  </li>
            <li>My problem is that this epilator does not remove much hair when you roll it over an area just once.</li>
            <li>I actually really like doing it now</li>
            <li>On the whole, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>very comfortable.and</li>
            <li>I have an earlier model (blue and white) and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>But you gotta be patient, because we have to pass lots of time in the same spot to clean everything.  </li>
            <li>It seems to get jammed, and it&#x27;s not cuz I don&#x27;t clean it!</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy this particular one again.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this since it was the lowest priced epilator hear on Amazon.</li>
            <li>No change of batteries were able to revive it.&lt;br /&gt;Had to buy a new one that was slightly more expensive but has been working for a year plus now...</li>
            <li>As someone commented before, it may not pick up some thinner hair that lies on the skin, however on a clean dry skin</li>
            <li>It does not hurt nearly as much as the old model did.  </li>
            <li>I almost send this product back, but decided that by the time I pay for shipping again, it won&#x27;t be worth it.</li>
            <li>It takes too long to remove the hair, it is not as effective as couple of other brands I had used.  </li>
            <li>long, the artifact itsemf is easy to clean and a little brush is included for this purpose.</li>
            <li>I have thich dark hair and epilating leaves my legs smooth and without stubble.</li>
            <li>inefficient.&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to philips, so much</li>
            <li>I tried different angles, adjusted the speed, but it did not help too much.</li>
            <li>I fixed and its working again....   </li>
            <li>It takes longer than my old one (another brand)</li>
            <li>Considerably faster than tweezing.    </li>
            <li>This product did not work as well as the old one I was replacing.  </li>
            <li>Grabs the short hairs just fine, usually on the first or second pass.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an older style epilator for 18 years and it finally wore out.</li>
            <li>It hursts like heck especially the first time and it takes numerous frequent passes over the same area to get all the hair.  </li>
            <li>The reason why I gave this product three stars is because the hair it does remove grows back quite slowly, I just wished it did a better job removing the hair.</li>
            <li>It does a better job when used for the arm pits, but it performs poorly on the legs.</li>
            <li>I love this because it&#x27;s so much better than waxing, faster and less painful.</li>
            <li>Still totally sold on the general principle of epilators.</li>
            <li>Any contact with my skin kind of makes it drag and slow down.    </li>

            <li> I would not recomend.&lt;br /&gt;Takes too long to remove hair, it requires passing SEVERAL times over the same area.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Well long story short</li>
            <li> However, it seems to last a very long time before you need to go through the pain again.  </li>
            <li> It took much longer than it should have to remove hair and some hair was left behind even after several attempts.</li>
            <li> While the curved head makes it easier to do legs sort of, it makes it harder for me to do my bikini line close enough.</li>
            <li> I have hirsutism and have struggled with having hair on my face for a long time.</li>
            <li> Still, it never broke down, it is simple to use and quite painless.</li>
            <li> This machine works just as well as the larger machines, but for half the price.</li>
            <li> For me it was very painful, much more so than waxing (which at least gets things over with quickly.)    </li>
            <li> If necessary the cap around the rotating tweezers can be removed for use (I did it to reach certain curves that otherwise were difficult but not really necessary nor advised by the manual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, (and again, as someone said) if you have the time (and can handle a little pain)</li>
            <li> It´s work, but it have some trouble whit slim and short hair, but it´s beter than a shape</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very powerful either.</li>
            <li> I would just rather plug my ears up with some cotton and use the braun than have to spend twice as long with the little discrette.</li>
            <li> Gets most of the hairs and is much less painful then the one i had in 01.</li>
            <li> Epilating is going to be painful, and the first time you use this product it definitely is.  </li>
            <li> Not terribly effective; it has a hard time grabbing smaller, finer hairs that tend to lay flat on your skin.    </li>
            <li> It never broke down.  </li>
            <li> At first epilating is painful, but after a few uses, it&#x27;s not because fewer hairs grow back.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s much less to remove as regrowth</li>
            <li> I will be keeping it though because it seems to hurt less than the braun for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;ll sit in my closet for those days when pain is less tolerable for me.</li>
            <li> so it takes less time</li>
            <li> use and a half on very thin leg hair was too much for the little engine that couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;After one use and 1/2 the compact died.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the mess.     </li>
            <li> I absolutely agree with the other review of this product - excelent for armpits but horrible for legs-you have to go over the same spot several times to remove hair.</li>
            <li> so the hair is a little reduced.</li>
            <li> However, when I tried the product, I was not very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Alas, this one perished in only about 4 months.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly slow progress</li>
            <li> and it was less painful than expected.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it broke down and they discontinued the model.</li>
            <li> My hair is very very thin...</li>
            <li> Hurts a little bit, but not too bad!  </li>
            <li> It was so painful and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t wanted to because I bought one about 8 yrs ago and hated it.</li>
            <li> Pulling one hair out at a time is insane!</li>

            <li> I have been using this epilator for 3-4 years now. It never broke down.  My problem is that this epilator does not remove much hair when you roll it over an area just once. It takes too long to remove the hair, it is not as effective as couple of other brands I had used.  Still, it never broke down, it is simple to use and quite painless.</li>
            <li> I purchased this device for my daughter but just had to try it.  It hursts like heck especially the first time and it takes numerous frequent passes over the same area to get all the hair.  However, it seems to last a very long time before you need to go through the pain again.  I actually really like doing it now and I love how it makes my legs feel.  You MUST use some type of skin lotion afterwards to lesson the rash of irritation from all that pulling out of hair though.</li>
            <li> For $25 this is a GREAT buy! It&#x27;s the first time I use an epilator and it was less painful than expected. If you have waxed before you can certainly \\&quot;bear the pain\\&quot; from this, and if you haven&#x27;t then just try the tweezers on the area you want to work on and imagine many tweezers working at once, but the results are definetely worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual says to use only for legs and arms but I&#x27;d say that the best results were when I used it on my armpits (perhaps because my hair there is thicker than in other areas), it even picked up 1mm stubs!. As someone commented before, it may not pick up some thinner hair that lies on the skin, however on a clean dry skin it is very likely to pick up everything if used properly (read the manual for instructions, it&#x27;s easy to use!). I would agree with the manual on not using it for the pubic area, although it works for the bikini line if you can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is 6ft (2m) long, the artifact itsemf is easy to clean and a little brush is included for this purpose. If necessary the cap around the rotating tweezers can be removed for use (I did it to reach certain curves that otherwise were difficult but not really necessary nor advised by the manual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, (and again, as someone said) if you have the time (and can handle a little pain) this is just a great solution for unwanted body hair!</li>
            <li> I love this because it&#x27;s so much better than waxing, faster and less painful. But you gotta be patient, because we have to pass lots of time in the same spot to clean everything.  If you want something cheap and better than waxing and you have time to spend, buy it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of its great reviews. I expected a good product. However, when I tried the product, I was not very satisfied. I have to go over one area several times in order to remove hair. It took much longer than it should have to remove hair and some hair was left behind even after several attempts. It does a better job when used for the arm pits, but it performs poorly on the legs. I tried different angles, adjusted the speed, but it did not help too much. Even though the product is inexpensive, it should perform better. My last epilator was about the same price, but it performed excellent. Unfortunately, it broke down and they discontinued the model. The reason why I gave this product three stars is because the hair it does remove grows back quite slowly, I just wished it did a better job removing the hair. I almost send this product back, but decided that by the time I pay for shipping again, it won&#x27;t be worth it. I will use it for the arm pits.</li>
            <li> Epilating is going to be painful, and the first time you use this product it definitely is.  But it&#x27;s effective, and as long as you keep up with it it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much after the first time.  It&#x27;s also a great price compared to other epilators.  It&#x27;s not as good at getting fine hairs as it is getting big ones, but patience gets results.    I couldn&#x27;t use it on my underarms, but the product warned against that anyway so I can&#x27;t count it against the epilator.</li>
            <li> Nothing special...  It was good... My hair is very very thin... It helped but it didn&#x27;t tok everything out!  Very noisy!  Hurts a little bit, but not too bad!  It stopped working after a couple of times... I fixed and its working again....   very fragile!  good!  probabbly perfect for girl with thick hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care who you are these things hurt! Pulling one hair out at a time is insane! I finally just threw the darn thing away.</li>
            <li> I absolutely agree with the other review of this product - excelent for armpits but horrible for legs-you have to go over the same spot several times to remove hair. I would not buy this product again - better to pay a bit more but have your hair removed quicker and easier.</li>
            <li> I did allot of research before deciding on this epilator.  Since I haven&#x27;t used one before, I didn&#x27;t want to invest in one of the more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to worry.  I didn&#x27;t mind the first process at all and after that, there&#x27;s much less to remove as regrowth isn&#x27;t even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of my epilator is not the same at the one shown, it&#x27;s much more pleasing to the eye..lavender and silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is the first time I&#x27;ve used an epilator, I can&#x27;t compare it&#x27;s performance to others, but I can say it&#x27;s so much better than shaving every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I shave, by the end of the day I already have visible stubble.  With this process, it takes a week or two before I see much of anything worth removing.  What a difference!!</li>
            <li> the good is that is actally works but as good when it comes to thinner hairs</li>
            <li> It was very good pay less for this epilator and see that it works well. It takes longer than my old one (another brand) but it&#x27;s ok!!</li>
            <li> Pros:    Considerably faster than tweezing.    Inexpensive.    Fairly easy to clean/maintain.    Cons:    For me it was very painful, much more so than waxing (which at least gets things over with quickly.)    Not terribly effective; it has a hard time grabbing smaller, finer hairs that tend to lay flat on your skin.    Surprisingly slow progress; I had to keep going over areas again and again.      On the whole, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is not as powerful as the Emjoi epilator I had before (which died after about 4-5 years.) Alas, this one perished in only about 4 months. It seems to get jammed, and it&#x27;s not cuz I don&#x27;t clean it! Time to try something different. Still totally sold on the general principle of epilators. Way better than shaving, for legs, pits and bikini!</li>
            <li> While the curved head makes it easier to do legs sort of, it makes it harder for me to do my bikini line close enough. My favorite thing is this is WAY quieter than my braun, but it isn&#x27;t as thorough at plucking out the hairs. I would just rather plug my ears up with some cotton and use the braun than have to spend twice as long with the little discrette. It&#x27;s not very powerful either. Any contact with my skin kind of makes it drag and slow down.    I will be keeping it though because it seems to hurt less than the braun for whatever reason. So it&#x27;ll sit in my closet for those days when pain is less tolerable for me.</li>
            <li> I love the Epilday Discrette.It&#x27;s a good size. very comfortable.and it does an excellent job.  It does not hurt nearly as much as the old model did.  I would recommend it to anyone who hates shaving.</li>
            <li> I searched the Epilady brand a bit before deciding on this model. This seemed to be the most effective, cheapest version - I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like epilating.     Well, I do. It&#x27;s great. If you have no problem plucking or waxing, you should have no problem epilating. Make sure you used lotion afterward!     I imagine the Legend is much better - thought I&#x27;ve never used it. Now that I know that I don&#x27;t mind epilating, I&#x27;ll wait for this thing to die or I have $100 to spend and order the Legend.</li>
            <li> I have an earlier model (blue and white) and it works great.  Works best on just-showered and exfoliated legs (loofa or scrubby gloves).  I&#x27;m completely used to the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; - so much that I don&#x27;t even feel it any more (and I&#x27;m a wimp).  I use it about once a week so it takes less time than it does when I wait a month or so.  Grabs the short hairs just fine, usually on the first or second pass.   We&#x27;ve got a tub next to a window, so I use it sitting on a tub-seat in the morning - the bright light makes the hair much easier to see.   I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
            <li> This product did not work as well as the old one I was replacing.  I didn&#x27;t return it, but will use it as a last resort.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this particular one again.  It works well but still isn&#x27;t as good as my old one which is another brand.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is a great value. This machine works just as well as the larger machines, but for half the price. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> This epilator compact lasted about a week.&lt;br /&gt;A use and a half on very thin leg hair was too much for the little engine that couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;After one use and 1/2 the compact died. No change of batteries were able to revive it.&lt;br /&gt;Had to buy a new one that was slightly more expensive but has been working for a year plus now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, add a little more and buy one with more quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older style epilator for 18 years and it finally wore out. This new model is good too! At first epilating is painful, but after a few uses, it&#x27;s not because fewer hairs grow back. I have thich dark hair and epilating leaves my legs smooth and without stubble.</li>
            <li> I like it better than I expected. I like the dual-speed choice even though I mostly use the faster one. It&#x27;s a good size for travel. It&#x27;s great for underarms and works well in the bikini area. It does miss some of the finer hairs on my legs, however. All-in-all, it&#x27;s a good product for the price. [[ASIN:B000Y8FXTQ Epilady Discrette - Corded Epilator]]</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this since it was the lowest priced epilator hear on Amazon. When I got it I didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as it does. I have hirsutism and have struggled with having hair on my face for a long time. I hate it. So I decided I would stop shaving and start waxing. That only gave my bumps and never removed all the hair. Not to mention the mess.     I&#x27;d been batting around the idea of getting one of these things for a while. I havn&#x27;t wanted to because I bought one about 8 yrs ago and hated it. It was so painful and ineffective. Well since then I&#x27;ve had a bit of laser and hrt so the hair is a little reduced. Well long story short I read about another woman with hirsutism and she convinced me to get this finally.     Ok now to the actual product review. Its great. I love it. It works really well. Gets most of the hairs and is much less painful then the one i had in 01.</li>
