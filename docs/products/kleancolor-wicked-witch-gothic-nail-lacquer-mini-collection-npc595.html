            <li>I love this set!</li>

            <li>Love the smoky feel these colors have.</li>
            <li>I really love this mini set.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a bit overwhelming and the polish does chip.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter was pleased with the colors.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the colors</li>
            <li>good colors, totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>I would have love</li>
            <li>Fast and happy with product</li>
            <li>ok i used then</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish it does chip</li>
            <li>, they love nail polish and this package gave them many colors to choose from.  </li>
            <li>, now I know they enjoyed their Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li>I love nail polish</li>
            <li>I especially loved the red (called, &amp;#34;bite</li>
            <li>shipped fast!!!!</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty good, drys fast, which is good because they definitely need 2 or more coats to look the best.</li>
            <li>Again, I am loving these colors, although I duplicated a couple between the mini and the full size bottles.  </li>
            <li>Lots of fun!!</li>
            <li>Nice colors arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It was \\&quot;Bite Me\\&quot; which is that beautiful glittery red that has a richer color and more glitter to it than most of the reds I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>A metallic orange that is very pretty, kind of like a rock n roll pumpkin.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant and good quality polish.</li>
            <li>However the gift set is great for the young.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own right.  </li>
            <li>other than that, colors are awesome.</li>
            <li>It does come off easily when required.  </li>
            <li>I loved the colors and they look great with a few coats but even with that</li>
            <li>The strong, off smell keeps me from using them, however.  </li>
            <li>These are awesome, they come in a cute small size but they&#x27;re easy to hold and apply.</li>
            <li>It works just fine</li>
            <li>came as described, its a fine product.</li>
            <li>The colors are lovely and bold, just like I want them to be.</li>
            <li>I was thinking of giving this as a prize at a Halloween party because it is sooo awesomely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and I only need to apply one coat of polish, which made me happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the package was great from the seller, it came fast, it was brand new</li>
            <li>I was very happy when I seen every one with different color nails at new years</li>
            <li>Yes, it looks like wet cement, and it is beautiful in</li>
            <li>I bought this item for my granddaughter and she loves all the vdifferent nail polishes as long as shes happy</li>
            <li>The colors are rich, the polish itself is creamy and faster at drying than others.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and drys quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saving my Wicked Witch by Kleancolor for October since these have the right colors for the month of Halloween!</li>
            <li>My daughter loves these and wants to get more.</li>
            <li>Painted my nails and looked good, then they chipped the next morning.</li>
            <li>Love,Love,Love,this and can&#x27;t wait to get more!!!A loyal customer,</li>
            <li>Cute colours, cute tiny bottles, smelly</li>
            <li>Quick drying.</li>
            <li>She loves painting her nails wild colors and these certainly filled her love of color.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Colors were very pretty</li>
            <li>and I have found a new favorite brand of polish.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>then I thought they were going to be, but for the price I really wasn&#x27;t surprised, but it&#x27;s nice polish.</li>
            <li>these would be fun to add to a bag of goodies for your guests or keep them as additions to your polish collection if you&#x27;re a collector like myself</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say how good the actual polish is</li>
            <li>This nailpolish looks awesome, lasts about the same as any other store brand, and if you think about it is cheaper than even the dollar store.</li>
            <li>I could peel it right off.</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; since black is my favorite color, it mkes it all da mre betta.</li>
            <li>The concrete gray (I forget the real name)is a modern twist on the gothy, moody colors for people like me who just love gothy, moody colors.  </li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and are true to how they appear online.</li>
            <li>Nice little set of nail polish to have on hand for anytime or special occasions to match what your wearing.</li>
            <li>I do like the little bottles and the brush seems good to control.  </li>
            <li>Chipped off within the first day of wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, a pretty manly one if I do say so myself.  </li>
            <li>, her nails looked pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>job, thanks!</li>
            <li>and two top coats still started chipping off by next day.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>love the colors I got 2 different sets,and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li>I was able to only able to paint my nails twice because these BOTTLES are VERY VERY VERY tiny!!!</li>
            <li>:) i painted my nails multiple times and used every color</li>
            <li>so I guess I have to use a thinner for it first</li>
            <li>Chips of as soon as twenty four hours pass you seriously have to applied this every day or else every day the nail polish will chipp off greatly didint even need nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>last night, i tested all of the colors and they were awesome, they dry fast and are sturdy enough to use tape on them for nail art</li>
            <li>Perfect size to last you quite a few paintings without drying out or getting old before you use them up.</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive about the mini size, but I am getting more use out of these mini&#x27;s, then I do the full size in other brands, as it doesn&#x27;t take more than one coat.</li>
            <li>Okay, admittedly I thought putting \\&quot;Military</li>
            <li>these are these go on really well</li>
            <li>I didint really like this at all.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I liked the nail polish and the colors except as soon as it dried, it chipped off.</li>
            <li>Initially I love the colors these come in, but found out quickly they do not last very long at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell does go away with time, but it was too strong for me to put up with very long.  </li>
            <li>Great choices in color, fast dry time, long lasting wear.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering full sized bottles of these colors in the future!!</li>
            <li>I love the colors, they&#x27;re good even for kids, just expected the bottles to be a bit bigger, they&#x27;re really small.</li>
            <li>these are super tiny, but</li>
            <li>Instead of being even 1/2 the size of normal polishes, they&#x27;re .17oz.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to buy a long last top coat</li>
            <li>and they are normal size mini bottles i haven&#x27;t used them yet</li>
            <li>liked the colors and how thick the polish is, but it did seem a bit old&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the nail polish is kind of thick</li>
            <li>It is very dark and remains matte, no glitter on this one, but very cool.  </li>
            <li>, I was shocked,but excited at the same time,ththrottles were bigger than I thought they would be, so 7 days from order to door</li>
            <li>once again, I loved the colors in this set, but am once again giving a three star rating, due to receiving dried out nail polish.</li>
            <li>These are smaller than expected but I still love the colors I bought 3 different sets</li>
            <li>recommend buying it from a retailer store, so if it is old you could just return it.</li>
            <li>The colours were cute and not regular sized bottles to waste away on my shelf if I didn&#x27;t like them.  </li>
            <li>They are really small and thet chip easy.</li>
            <li>, cant even tell the green is green, but the glittery red is beautiful, the orange is sort of transparent, the white n</li>
            <li>This is a sweet little gift set.</li>
            <li>but its exactly what i expected</li>
            <li>Green\\&quot; in the box was not very Halloweenish, but the color does remind me of the wicked witch of the west and in all honestly I had been looking for a camouflage sort of green polish for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The grey looks amazing with a pale pink accent of either gemstones or as a french manicure.</li>
            <li>Polish is thick, very strong odor, and take a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li>The black and white are also cute for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>and i still have PLENTY of nail polish left, and the colors are thick enough that one coat is fine</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s it not long time wear.</li>
            <li>I typically buy my nail polish at the dollar store, which obviously chips, and the paint in the bottle dries fast.</li>
            <li>Then very basically, you have black and white.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This nailpolish looks awesome, lasts about the same as any other store brand, and if you think about it is cheaper than even the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I could peel it right off.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; since black is my favorite color, it mkes it all da mre betta.</li>
            <li> The concrete gray (I forget the real name)is a modern twist on the gothy, moody colors for people like me who just love gothy, moody colors.  </li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and are true to how they appear online.</li>
            <li> Nice little set of nail polish to have on hand for anytime or special occasions to match what your wearing.</li>
            <li> I do like the little bottles and the brush seems good to control.  </li>
            <li> Chipped off within the first day of wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, a pretty manly one if I do say so myself.  </li>
            <li> , her nails looked pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> job, thanks!</li>
            <li> and two top coats still started chipping off by next day.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> love the colors I got 2 different sets,and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> I was able to only able to paint my nails twice because these BOTTLES are VERY VERY VERY tiny!!!</li>
            <li> :) i painted my nails multiple times and used every color</li>
            <li> so I guess I have to use a thinner for it first</li>
            <li> Chips of as soon as twenty four hours pass you seriously have to applied this every day or else every day the nail polish will chipp off greatly didint even need nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> last night, i tested all of the colors and they were awesome, they dry fast and are sturdy enough to use tape on them for nail art</li>
            <li> Perfect size to last you quite a few paintings without drying out or getting old before you use them up.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about the mini size, but I am getting more use out of these mini&#x27;s, then I do the full size in other brands, as it doesn&#x27;t take more than one coat.</li>
            <li> Okay, admittedly I thought putting \\&quot;Military</li>
            <li> these are these go on really well</li>
            <li> I didint really like this at all.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I liked the nail polish and the colors except as soon as it dried, it chipped off.</li>
            <li> Initially I love the colors these come in, but found out quickly they do not last very long at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell does go away with time, but it was too strong for me to put up with very long.  </li>
            <li> Great choices in color, fast dry time, long lasting wear.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering full sized bottles of these colors in the future!!</li>
            <li> I love the colors, they&#x27;re good even for kids, just expected the bottles to be a bit bigger, they&#x27;re really small.</li>
            <li> these are super tiny, but</li>
            <li> Instead of being even 1/2 the size of normal polishes, they&#x27;re .17oz.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to buy a long last top coat</li>
            <li> and they are normal size mini bottles i haven&#x27;t used them yet</li>
            <li> liked the colors and how thick the polish is, but it did seem a bit old&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the nail polish is kind of thick</li>
            <li> It is very dark and remains matte, no glitter on this one, but very cool.  </li>
            <li> , I was shocked,but excited at the same time,ththrottles were bigger than I thought they would be, so 7 days from order to door</li>
            <li> once again, I loved the colors in this set, but am once again giving a three star rating, due to receiving dried out nail polish.</li>
            <li> These are smaller than expected but I still love the colors I bought 3 different sets</li>
            <li> recommend buying it from a retailer store, so if it is old you could just return it.</li>
            <li> The colours were cute and not regular sized bottles to waste away on my shelf if I didn&#x27;t like them.  </li>
            <li> They are really small and thet chip easy.</li>
            <li> , cant even tell the green is green, but the glittery red is beautiful, the orange is sort of transparent, the white n</li>
            <li> This is a sweet little gift set.</li>
            <li> but its exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> Green\\&quot; in the box was not very Halloweenish, but the color does remind me of the wicked witch of the west and in all honestly I had been looking for a camouflage sort of green polish for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The grey looks amazing with a pale pink accent of either gemstones or as a french manicure.</li>
            <li> Polish is thick, very strong odor, and take a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> The black and white are also cute for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> and i still have PLENTY of nail polish left, and the colors are thick enough that one coat is fine</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s it not long time wear.</li>
            <li> I typically buy my nail polish at the dollar store, which obviously chips, and the paint in the bottle dries fast.</li>
            <li> Then very basically, you have black and white.  </li>
            <li> black r just normal</li>
            <li> The colors are unusual and not easy to find.</li>
            <li> Bottles are a little too small, will only be able to to use a few times before running out.  </li>
            <li> The bottles are the small ones but they seemed to have lasted a decent amound of time.</li>
            <li> even given I have fairly long fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I took it off before my nails were even dry and moved on to something else.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe is the box smelled like nail polish, not sure why, nothing was popped open.</li>
            <li> She loves the colors and it seems to last a little longer on her nails then some of the other products she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just go buy a bottle of white and cement grey and use those, at least they should smell like nail polish and not some remover that&#x27;s been under the sink too</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely small botles i was expecting small but its way smaller just the size of a extra midget nail</li>
            <li> This polish smells a little different, not sure what&#x27;s in it.  </li>
            <li> Loves these dark Halloween colors.</li>
            <li> Colors are a bit dark for me, but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Very tiny, but I like the colors too much to give a bad review.</li>
            <li> they called it \\&quot;black and white\\</li>
            <li> &quot; - like I was expecting \\&quot;Black Cat\\&quot; and \\&quot;Ghost\\&quot; or something, but who cares.  </li>
            <li> Even for the price, it was a waste of money in my book.</li>
            <li> However, these will not be wasted.  </li>
            <li> These colors unlike the metallics do last a couple of days with base and clear coats.</li>
            <li> Nail polish was a little thick.</li>
            <li> Usually get comments on this set.</li>
            <li> Having to apply one then one coat usually make my nails take forever to dye and chips easier.</li>
            <li> but when I got them I was so surprise how freaking small their were..</li>
            <li> and they are small</li>
            <li> polish is a little thick, but a little nail polish remover poured into polish helps thin it out some.</li>
            <li> up before it gets hard or sticky.</li>
            <li> products obtained without shoddy nail polish is peeled</li>
            <li> Goes on thick and even.</li>
            <li> The colors are thick and look like the colors in the bottle.</li>
            <li> the green and gray actually come out very ugly</li>
            <li> Little disappointed.</li>
            <li> When my nail polish is bad I get mad and take it all off.</li>
            <li> but the formula was bad.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I received my order</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> these are super tiny, but great colors and the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to realize that Kleancolor is a pretty awesome brand of polish. The colors in this mini set have to be my favorite. I wish they were sold in .5 oz bottles, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any. Instead of being even 1/2 the size of normal polishes, they&#x27;re .17oz. Very tiny, but I like the colors too much to give a bad review.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; since black is my favorite color, it mkes it all da mre betta. Da orange is sooo kute, especially if u puttin on yo toes, it mkes yo toes look younga.</li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant and good quality polish. Goes on thick and even. Not only for halloween but for every day wear. The grey looks amazing with a pale pink accent of either gemstones or as a french manicure. The black and white are also cute for everyday wear. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very nice colors and beautiful wear. My daughter loves these and wants to get more. It is great for all occasions.</li>
            <li> Great choices in color, fast dry time, long lasting wear. I do suggest these</li>
            <li> I typically buy my nail polish at the dollar store, which obviously chips, and the paint in the bottle dries fast. So, I started buying from big name stores, and at 2-6 dollars a bottle I expect it to last. Well folks, it doesn&#x27;t. This nailpolish looks awesome, lasts about the same as any other store brand, and if you think about it is cheaper than even the dollar store. I was a little apprehensive about the mini size, but I am getting more use out of these mini&#x27;s, then I do the full size in other brands, as it doesn&#x27;t take more than one coat. A must have for Nail artists &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I LOVE these colors. Very pretty. Great for Halloween nail painting. Perfect size to last you quite a few paintings without drying out or getting old before you use them up. Great price for this set. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love the smoky feel these colors have. Usually get comments on this set. Don&#x27;t forget to buy a long last top coat</li>
            <li> Initially I love the colors these come in, but found out quickly they do not last very long at all. Chipped off within the first day of wear. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Anyone who makes nail polish in a set called \\&quot;Wicked Witch\\&quot; is good in my book.  I really love this mini set.  I had bought a bunch of nail polish deciding what to use at my next pedicure and the winner actually came out of this set.  It was \\&quot;Bite Me\\&quot; which is that beautiful glittery red that has a richer color and more glitter to it than most of the reds I&#x27;ve tried.  \\&quot;Boogie Nights\\&quot; is also awesome.  A metallic orange that is very pretty, kind of like a rock n roll pumpkin.  Okay, admittedly I thought putting \\&quot;Military Green\\&quot; in the box was not very Halloweenish, but the color does remind me of the wicked witch of the west and in all honestly I had been looking for a camouflage sort of green polish for a long time.  It is very dark and remains matte, no glitter on this one, but very cool.  The concrete gray (I forget the real name)is a modern twist on the gothy, moody colors for people like me who just love gothy, moody colors.  Yes, it looks like wet cement, and it is beautiful in it&#x27;s own right.  Then very basically, you have black and white.  I was kinda dissapointed they called it \\&quot;black and white\\&quot; - like I was expecting \\&quot;Black Cat\\&quot; and \\&quot;Ghost\\&quot; or something, but who cares.  They belong in this pack.  I&#x27;ve never had white nail polish before.  It is Casper white.  I was thinking of giving this as a prize at a Halloween party because it is sooo awesomely fantastic.  I do like the little bottles and the brush seems good to control.  This polish smells a little different, not sure what&#x27;s in it.  It does come off easily when required.  My only gripe is the box smelled like nail polish, not sure why, nothing was popped open.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, a pretty manly one if I do say so myself.  But I got these for one of my friends and I have to admit, her nails looked pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job, thanks!</li>
            <li> Cute color in mini bottles great for a lover of nail polish...Great gift and very nice bright colors. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Bottles are a little too small, will only be able to to use a few times before running out.  Would like these colors in regular size bottles.</li>
            <li> Colors were very pretty and I only need to apply one coat of polish, which made me happy. Having to apply one then one coat usually make my nails take forever to dye and chips easier. The only issue was the bottles were smaller then I thought they were going to be, but for the price I really wasn&#x27;t surprised, but it&#x27;s nice polish.</li>
            <li> This is a sweet little gift set. The colors are vibrant and are true to how they appear online. The smell is a bit overwhelming and the polish does chip. However the gift set is great for the young.</li>
            <li> These polishes are wonderful, they are mini size and they make great stocking stuffers or party favors if you&#x27;re having a manicure party or makeover party these would be fun to add to a bag of goodies for your guests or keep them as additions to your polish collection if you&#x27;re a collector like myself you&#x27;ll love these and the polish is of amazing quality. Overall I would recommend these and the seller .</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I liked the nail polish and the colors except as soon as it dried, it chipped off. When my nail polish is bad I get mad and take it all off.</li>
            <li> I loved the colors and they look great with a few coats but even with that and two top coats still started chipping off by next day. Little disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are really small and thet chip easy. I would by it again. I was disappointed when I received my order</li>
            <li> Sent these as a gift and she loved them!</li>
            <li> Painted my nails and looked good, then they chipped the next morning. I could peel it right off. Good for a night out that&#x27;s it not long time wear.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter was pleased with the colors. She got good wear from the nail polish, so can&#x27;t complain there either.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Nice little set of nail polish to have on hand for anytime or special occasions to match what your wearing.I haven&#x27;t used any of the colors yet so I can&#x27;t really say how good the actual polish is but if you like changing colors often like I do then you&#x27;ll love these! I&#x27;m saving my Wicked Witch by Kleancolor for October since these have the right colors for the month of Halloween!</li>
            <li> the green and gray actually come out very ugly, cant even tell the green is green, but the glittery red is beautiful, the orange is sort of transparent, the white n black r just normal</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the colors</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on July 1 2014, and it came in the mail today, I was shocked,but excited at the same time,ththrottles were bigger than I thought they would be, so 7 days from order to door .I love the colors I got 2 different sets,and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it I will definitely be ordering all the set&#x27;s. Love,Love,Love,this and can&#x27;t wait to get more!!!A loyal customer,</li>
            <li> over all its a good product. polish is a little thick, but a little nail polish remover poured into polish helps thin it out some. good colors, totally worth the price. shipped fast!!!!</li>
            <li> These are smaller than expected but I still love the colors I bought 3 different sets</li>
            <li> products obtained without shoddy nail polish is peeled</li>
            <li> I was able to only able to paint my nails twice because these BOTTLES are VERY VERY VERY tiny!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!I waited and waited for these bottles to come in so I could do some nail art but when I got them I was so surprise how freaking small their were..</li>
            <li> I wanted to try out this polish my DIY (do-it-yourself) nail polish designs&lt;br /&gt;I liked the colors and how thick the polish is, but it did seem a bit old&lt;br /&gt;the package was great from the seller, it came fast, it was brand new&lt;br /&gt;but I think it&#x27;s nearing the time of expire? I had place some replenisher&lt;br /&gt;So I like it, I feel if it was a newer lot of nail polish from this brand I would have love it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying it from a retailer store, so if it is old you could just return it.</li>
            <li> This collection was an instant hit with my granddaughter. The colors are unusual and not easy to find. The size of the bottle is perfect -Used up before it gets hard or sticky. Great gift idea!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these colors amazing thank you</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and drys quickly. The colors are thick and look like the colors in the bottle. Great for a cheap Christmas or Birthday gift for the &amp;#34;not-so-girly&amp;#34; girly girl.</li>
            <li> Fast and happy with product everything was how the description said do recommend colors were adlo what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Cute colours, cute tiny bottles, smelly product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase a lot of nail polish and when I saw this set, I had to have it.  The colours were cute and not regular sized bottles to waste away on my shelf if I didn&#x27;t like them.  The strong, off smell keeps me from using them, however.  I&#x27;ll just go buy a bottle of white and cement grey and use those, at least they should smell like nail polish and not some remover that&#x27;s been under the sink too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell does go away with time, but it was too strong for me to put up with very long.  I took it off before my nails were even dry and moved on to something else.  Even for the price, it was a waste of money in my book.</li>
            <li> Quick drying. Nice colors arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> [EDITED] i don&#x27;t know why everyone is complaining about the size of the bottles it says mini on there and they are normal size mini bottles i haven&#x27;t used them yet but its exactly what i expected and i&#x27;m very happy with it &lt;3....ok i used then last night, i tested all of the colors and they were awesome, they dry fast and are sturdy enough to use tape on them for nail art :) i painted my nails multiple times and used every color and i still have PLENTY of nail polish left, and the colors are thick enough that one coat is fine so yea i&#x27;m still happy :D</li>
            <li> Loves these dark Halloween colors. They lasted me for about 6 months. The nail polish stayed on for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish it does chip but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to paint over the chipped parts 💀👀 i only gaved it four stars based on the chipping of the nail polish .</li>
            <li> I bought this set so I can do some water marbling. It works just fine but the nail polish is kind of thick so I guess I have to use a thinner for it first</li>
            <li> Even though the bottles are small, the colors really pop! One thing I don&#x27;t like is for the darker colors, the polish can be somewhat of a challenge to remove. But again the colors are great.</li>
            <li> These were a gift to my daughter. She loves the colors and it seems to last a little longer on her nails then some of the other products she&#x27;s tried. I haven&#x27;t seen these colors in stores and I will be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty good, drys fast, which is good because they definitely need 2 or more coats to look the best.</li>
            <li> Very nice gift for girls of all ages, they love nail polish and this package gave them many colors to choose from.  I was very happy when I seen every one with different color nails at new years, now I know they enjoyed their Christmas presents.  The price was great!!</li>
            <li> Great price. Great product. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, they&#x27;re good even for kids, just expected the bottles to be a bit bigger, they&#x27;re really small.</li>
            <li> the only thing i didn&#x27;t realize was the size of polish bottle. other than that, colors are awesome. definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love this set! The colors are great, they are the perfect size if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting yourself into, and they don&#x27;t break the bank. I do nail art, and these are just what I needed. Cannot wait to start painting!</li>
            <li> nice colors my daughter is crazy about the nail polish. i bought a lot with different colors. Lots of fun!!</li>
            <li> Polish is thick, very strong odor, and take a long time to dry.  Nice colors though.</li>
            <li> I love nail polish these are these go on really well and they are small you can put them in your purse&lt;br /&gt;and the colors are fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> Nail polish was a little thick.</li>
            <li> came as described, its a fine product.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend really liked it, she said it was good quality. The bottles are the small ones but they seemed to have lasted a decent amound of time.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, they come in a cute small size but they&#x27;re easy to hold and apply. These colors unlike the metallics do last a couple of days with base and clear coats. I especially loved the red (called, &amp;#34;bite me&amp;#34;) it&#x27;s sparkly but not too overly shiny, just the perfect touch of sparkle. Great buy. :)</li>
            <li> I didint really like this at all.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Six great colors to chose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Bad formula.Chips of as soon as twenty four hours pass you seriously have to applied this every day or else every day the nail polish will chipp off greatly didint even need nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely small botles i was expecting small but its way smaller just the size of a extra midget nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some the bottles get stuck so that all you get is the cover of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Really liked the colors but the formula was bad. wouldint recomend this to anyone unless they are just starting to learn how to paint their nails.I regret buying this.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my granddaughter and she loves all the vdifferent nail polishes as long as shes happy i am</li>
            <li> once again, I loved the colors in this set, but am once again giving a three star rating, due to receiving dried out nail polish.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter-in-law as a Christmas present.  She loves painting her nails wild colors and these certainly filled her love of color.</li>
            <li> Again, I am loving these colors, although I duplicated a couple between the mini and the full size bottles.  However, these will not be wasted.  The colors are lovely and bold, just like I want them to be. Although I&#x27;ve got some mini sizes, I find I still get several uses from each bottle even given I have fairly long fingernails.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with Kleancolor and I have found a new favorite brand of polish. The colors are rich, the polish itself is creamy and faster at drying than others. An even bigger plus is its one coat coverage. I will be ordering full sized bottles of these colors in the future!!</li>
            <li> These are really pretty colors , but they last the same as the ones that you buy at the drug store, and this are really small, so I&#x27;ll stick to the drug store ones.</li>
            <li> Colors are a bit dark for me, but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
