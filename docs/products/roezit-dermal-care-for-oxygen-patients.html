            <li> ReEzit will stop that the first night you use it, at least it did for me.</li>
            <li> Now used for dry climate states and countries on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> did nothing for my dry nose</li>
            <li> my nose when it is dry, which is a lot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are going to use something for dry nostrils use  an &amp;#34;Ayr&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> It is indespensible for keeping a dry nose moisturized.  </li>
            <li> only thing keeping it from being higher stars is jut how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> I know it seems expensive, but it goes a long way, and with no sores on or in my nose from irritations like a CPAP or oxygen tubes, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am on supplemental oxygen and at times the inside of my nose gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses it for drying of nostrils due to oxygen use.</li>
            <li> I suppose other skin preperations could have worked just as well, but this product is specifically for Oxygen patients of which I am one.</li>
            <li> only negative is the smell but after about a week you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It has a fragrance in the cream that really makes it difficult to breathe with if you have COPD which I do .</li>
            <li> A little thick for me, but constant attention to foot care and</li>
            <li> The bottle it comes in is very small, like smaller than the palm of your hand, small.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this product used often for a few days clears it up.  </li>
            <li> Even the cheapest vendor sells this for a crazy high amount.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but it takes a very small amount each night.</li>
            <li> just know it&#x27;s a very small amount and plan to purchase accordingly.</li>
            <li> Lansinoh has a very faint lanolin smell but to me it is much less objectionable than the rancid smell of RoEzIt.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I might have gotten a bad tube</li>
            <li> The smell is really bad if placed inside your nostrils.</li>

            <li> This product has really helped me a lot.  I was turned on to this product by a friend who also uses this product.  When I run low, I will order from you guys again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Just what my wife needed for use with her oxygen</li>
            <li> My husband uses it for drying of nostrils due to oxygen use. It works great. He is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.being on oxygen really keeps it moist.this is the best one  I have found.very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product bought it for my mother who used oxygen and it help her alot</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 8 years.  My sleep machine people used to supply free.  That&#x27;s when I found that you had the product.  I am pleased with the product as well as your good service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Y. Smith</li>
            <li> Great heale.  Great for nose iritations from oxygen use. Also I use it for my pierced ears when I insert the posts.</li>
            <li> I use this for my feet. A little thick for me, but constant attention to foot care and this is a good adjunct.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a local doctor and it works wonders if you are like my wife and need oxygen 24/7</li>
            <li> Originally introduced to me for Cpap and effective.  Now used for dry climate states and countries on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It smelled good and worked well.</li>
            <li> Soft and silky feeling, doesn&#x27;t take much at all to work. Definitely worked to help with the chafing over my ears from the nasal cannula. I have used it on my nose as well, around the edges, and it does help prevent cracking and drying. I&#x27;ve even used it on my hands, where my nails get dry and brittle, and around the nail, and it works great there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing keeping it from being higher stars is jut how expensive it is. Even the cheapest vendor sells this for a crazy high amount. The bottle it comes in is very small, like smaller than the palm of your hand, small. It doesn&#x27;t take very much though, so it will last a while, but just know it&#x27;s a very small amount and plan to purchase accordingly.</li>
            <li> did nothing for my dry nose</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. It does have a smell but it isn&#x27;t too aggressive. Most importantly, it works great! I have a nasal CPAP machine and it caused red, inflamed skin. Using this for about a week completely got rid of the red skin. The bottle is small but it takes a very small amount each night. It is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I received the product promptly. I use a c-pap machine and my doctor suggested I purchase some of this product for severe nasal dryness. I purchased 2 tubes thinking they would not be that big but I was wrong.  The product is great! I am able to us it all around and up inside (okay by Dr) my nose when it is dry, which is a lot.&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is the smell but after about a week you get used to it. The sample pack I received from my doctor was different than what a purchased.  But I it has made a great improvement in my health.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> My mother uses this and we have nothing else that works as well.</li>
            <li> like it very well. no smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great very creamy type of soothing product.  It was recommended to me for use in and around my nostrils since I wear a nasal pillows type of apnea mask.  It is GREAT for that.</li>
            <li> Works well. Makes your nose softer and moister. Water based and very good. Will keep using while on oxygen. Buy it. It works.</li>
            <li> Works miracles!  dudn djd sss sss sss ssss ddd  dddd d  ddd ddd ddd dddd  dddd dddd ddd  dd d</li>
            <li> It helps with my nose when I am using my cpap.</li>
            <li> I  have a BI-PAP/CPAP machine for apnea,  with the &#x27;canula&#x27; type mask.  This works quite well in the nostril/lip area to help prevent chafing/soothe any irritatation that does occur.  I have recommended it to several friends and they now also use it regularly.  It  has a very &#x27;light&#x27; non-greasy consistency, and a very slight fragrance to which I do not object at all.</li>
            <li> Every CPAP user should have this product on hand. Your nose will thank you. Love love love this product!!!!  Order this now.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good product.</li>
            <li> I might have gotten a bad tube but it had a rancid smell, although it still had a year before the marked expiration date.  If you are very sensitive to rancid smells (as I am) stay away.  I am trying now [[ASIN:B005MI648C Lansinoh HPA Lanolin for Breastfeeding Mothers, 40 Grams]], which is pure lanolin.  Although meant for sore nipples, it supposedly helps with CPAP nose irritation as well.  (Can&#x27;t tell yet.)  Lansinoh has a very faint lanolin smell but to me it is much less objectionable than the rancid smell of RoEzIt.</li>
            <li> Family member is on oxygen 24/7 and this really helps to keep the nasal passage moist and the cannula soft. Safe for multiple time use during day contains NO petroleum-  Good product arrives quickly~</li>
            <li> the daily and continual use of oxygen results in crusty formations in the nostrils.  RoEzit dissolves these and makes it much easier to breathe.</li>
            <li> Never needed this product before, but it is as advertised.  I suppose other skin preperations could have worked just as well, but this product is specifically for Oxygen patients of which I am one.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for anyone who suffers from dryness ~ especially associated with oxygen use.  If you&#x27;re on oxygen 24/7, you know how important it is to keep the crusties from blocking your nose.  This product is great inside and outside the nose.  My oxygen supply company gave me one to try and I&#x27;m hooked.  I will always have a tube by my side.  It makes breathing so much easier.  It is also great on other dry patches, but let&#x27;s face it, at this price I save it for my nose.  It&#x27;s worth every penny and then some.</li>
            <li> I am on oxygen 24/7 and I have been using and recommending this cream for several years.  It is better than anything else out there because it isn&#x27;t sticky when you have it in your nose.  It doesn&#x27;t last but it is soothing. Definitely going to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The smell is really bad if placed inside your nostrils. It has a fragrance in the cream that really makes it difficult to breathe with if you have COPD which I do . If you are going to use something for dry nostrils use  an &amp;#34;Ayr&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! I have been using this for years!! Shipment came as planned an in good shape Thanks</li>
            <li> Price was excellent. I have been using Roezit for more than 12 years, superb product.</li>
            <li> This product always arrives on time and in good condition.  It is indespensible for keeping a dry nose moisturized.  Have a happy nose, keep your mouth closed and sleep well with this product to ease your necessary oxygen use.</li>
            <li> No need. ReEzit will stop that the first night you use it, at least it did for me. Just take a drop, put it on the tip of you finger, and apply to the outside of your nostrils, and you will be amazed. I know it seems expensive, but it goes a long way, and with no sores on or in my nose from irritations like a CPAP or oxygen tubes, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am on supplemental oxygen and at times the inside of my nose gets very dry.  A little bit of this product used often for a few days clears it up.  Hydrates nasal passages better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I guess this worked but I really can&#x27;t stand the smell -- please,make it in unscented especially something used so close to or in the nostrils.  It has a nice soft feeling.</li>
            <li> It is great it works well and helps alot. I have recomended this to my friends who also have to be on oxygen.</li>
