    <ol>
            <li>These strips worked perfect.</li>
            <li>They work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Do it immediately for best results.</li>
            <li>Great product and value!!  </li>
            <li>Great buy.  </li>
            <li>These work great, and save me a lot of money by my waxing my brows myself.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows look great</li>
            <li>They make me so happy.</li>
            <li>shape of these also works just great for me.  </li>
            <li>This product I ok at best.</li>
            <li>With a light tweeting afterward you have perfectly shaped eye brows.</li>
            <li>and they did get some good reviews.</li>
            <li>I love these things!</li>
            <li>glad i found them again!  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li>Great for a quick wax on the run!</li>
            <li>i just use them to keep them tidy.  </li>
            <li>These do a much better job.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use them and had to give them away.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love them.</li>
            <li>these are okay</li>
            <li>For people who state it doesn&#x27;t work--make sure you remove all oil.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that they are already shaped to wax the top of your brow and the bottom.</li>
            <li>For the most part I&#x27;m satisfied and I&#x27;ll continue to use this one box until it&#x27;s gone</li>
            <li>I love these strips.  </li>
            <li>and im sure glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It was nice though that it did a great job pulling out the tiny, fine, almost-invisible hairs that I can never seem to get with tweezers.</li>
            <li>So quick and easy to use!  </li>
            <li>But these are shaped well, easy to use and why use anything else?  </li>
            <li>She says these strips are so easy anyone can use them.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and don&#x27;t pluck you bald.  </li>
            <li>They are like really strong tape, but I&#x27;ve never had TAPE that would pull my hair follicles (spelling?)</li>
            <li>But they are fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d give these a try since they were so cheap</li>
            <li>and when I used the first strip on that side it did much better.</li>
            <li>Sent Right away!</li>
            <li>Cool water and a moisturizer soothes the area after you wax.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick &amp; the product was as I remembered.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>At this point tweezing or paying for a professional waxing is more productive.</li>
            <li>I chose these instead of my regular kind because of the price</li>
            <li>I always use them right after I get done washing my face with soap.  </li>
            <li>I have very light eyebrows &amp; the hairs are not too coarse, so may be the reason why they work well for me and not so well for some of the 1-star reviewers.</li>
            <li>This is an easy no mess alternative to hot wax and plucking.</li>
            <li>The trick to getting all the hair off on the first rip is to wash your eyebrow area with soap (like bar-soap or body wash) and water.</li>
            <li>you can let your lashes grow out enough, im sure that this will work a lot</li>
            <li>I bought these on eBay thinking they would be cheaper without checking Amazon first.</li>
            <li>The second worked much better.</li>
            <li>Especially if a wax strip was touching that area.</li>
            <li>As you get older, eyebrows get thinner on their own, and you could end up looking really strange.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing my brows myself for years and while hot wax works really well</li>
            <li>, I guess they may work better for some people than they have for me, and I have only used them twice, but that is because, I normally tweeze or use the eyebrow shavers to shape my brows.</li>
            <li>but next time I think I will pay a little more for a brand that does the job a bit better</li>
            <li>Get all the oils off and they work very well.</li>
            <li>and you really cant beat a 3 pack 63 count for 12 bucks.</li>
            <li>(I used to always always have them waxed, however it seemed that they didn&#x27;t have to grow out as much to have them professionally waxed as it does for this product to work, even though this works the same as a waxing, without the wax, but I guess that is because, since wax isn&#x27;t being used, there needs to be a bit more length to the hair for it to get a grip on to).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So fast,</li>
            <li>You need to put them on without touching the sticky part (or not much of it) with your hands.  </li>
            <li>These cold wax strips are the best non-hot wax option I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I used other brands and it works better.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and hot wax always tears my skin.</li>
            <li>No messy residue, gentle to the skin.  </li>
            <li>They are nicely pre-shaped (but easily re-cut if you want/need), remove hair remarkably well the first time around and are actually much less painful than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>These strips are a new brand for me.  </li>
            <li>so I tried one on my wrist first and it worked and did not leave red marks.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think someone should be touching my brow area while super small amount of blood is present and my skin is open.</li>
            <li>Maybe the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; got too warm and then weak?</li>
            <li>Today I was early to something and pulled them out</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Overall, they are fairly decent.</li>
            <li>I cleaned and scrubbed my eyebrows thoroughly and let them dry for some time and like others, the first wax strip I used barely took anything.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot hair and my hair is very light and thin.</li>
            <li>The trick to these is to leave them on for a few seconds, pull skin taught, and then pull them quickly in the opposite direction of the hair growth.</li>
            <li>no mess and my brows are actually even!  </li>
            <li>These wax strips probably won&#x27;t work the first time, because the first strip is always wasted on dead skin sells, oils, or whatever else is on your face</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My 17 yr old has never quite learned the art of the tweezers, and like her older sisters, spent her hard earned money on brow waxing while their mother has been using tweezers my entire life.</li>
            <li> I saw these and since I sometimes have trouble getting them even, I thought this would be great to try, however, I hate letting my brows grow out that much, enough for this product to work, however, I am working on doing so now</li>
            <li> A few tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> I can get about 2 or 3 waxes out of each box which is what I expected and what I was use to with my other brand.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like the shape these make my eyebrows into, because all the strips are the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands when I ran out and didn&#x27;t have time to wait for Amazon to deliver.  </li>
            <li> No more paying ten bucks to have my eyebrows waxed and ending up with break outs!</li>
            <li> Ive used others in the past and local stores stopped carrying them</li>
            <li> A little time consuming</li>
            <li> Just a few touch ups with tweezers when you&#x27;re done &amp; voila....perfectly shaped eyebrows.</li>
            <li> word of warning though...Don&#x27;t make your brows too thin, because after a while the hair stops growing back.</li>
            <li> No more trips to the salon for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> Not sure how anyone can complain about these.</li>
            <li> Will pick up maybe a couple of the lightest and loosest hairs - definitely not suitable for eyebrow shaping.  </li>
            <li> I hate super thin brows -</li>
            <li> The strips DO work, at least they do on me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, it will take at least 2 before they pull the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say this product is a failure.</li>
            <li> Compares very poorly to almost any other wax strip product I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t dislike this product, I am just having some problems, making myself have the self control to let me lashes grow out enough to use it, but I want to because I so badly want to reshape my lashes, and I know (as do you ladies) that it is hard to do, but I still recommend it.</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment is that, even though it did rip a few hairs out, I still had to go through and pluck a few afterwards.</li>
            <li> I then used them on my eyebrows (which by the way, I haven&#x27;t dealt with in two months and were bad) and these strips totally work!</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say this product was a waste of money and does not work.</li>
            <li> My wife was very unimpressed with this product and hated it.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s messy and can be difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Anyone who can&#x27;t use these or don&#x27;t like them must be doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> When I bought these, I was skeptical they would work</li>
            <li> In my opinion any person that gets these and can use them without cutting them must not be doing an arch at all.</li>
            <li> But they were really horrible...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use tweezers anymore. These do a much better job. With the tweezers, I run a bigger risk over over tweezing. These strips take off all the hair I need. It doesn&#x27;t hurt either. At first, I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like the shape these make my eyebrows into, because all the strips are the same. Thankfully, that was not the case.</li>
            <li> Anyone who can&#x27;t use these or don&#x27;t like them must be doing it wrong. These strips worked perfect. With a light tweeting afterward you have perfectly shaped eye brows. No more trips to the salon for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands when I ran out and didn&#x27;t have time to wait for Amazon to deliver.  But these are shaped well, easy to use and why use anything else?  I always use them right after I get done washing my face with soap.  Get all the oils off and they work very well.</li>
            <li> In my opinion any person that gets these and can use them without cutting them must not be doing an arch at all. I like to cut them and even them and use them as guide lines for my wax. A little time consuming but If you&#x27;d rather not pay salon cost you work with what you have and you really cant beat a 3 pack 63 count for 12 bucks.</li>
            <li> This product I ok at best. It didn&#x27;t remove all the hair and it seems to show a lot of fingertip smudge. It reminds me of a stronger version of adhesive tape. I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say this product was a waste of money and does not work. At this point tweezing or paying for a professional waxing is more productive. The two reviews had me believing, just bogus.</li>
            <li> My wife was very unimpressed with this product and hated it.  It didn&#x27;t pull any hair out and she could&#x27;ve used Scotch Tape for the same effect.  Won&#x27;t buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife recommends [[ASIN:B001426RO6 Wax Strips Mini Eyebrow 32 ct]] instead.</li>
            <li> My local CVS quit carrying these wax strips.  I have been using them for years.  So quick and easy to use!  Just a few touch ups with tweezers when you&#x27;re done &amp; voila....perfectly shaped eyebrows.</li>
            <li> These wax strips were too big for my eyebrows. I wasn&#x27;t able to use them and had to give them away. I wish they included smaller strips for smaller eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday and it does not plucked anything off. I used other brands and it works better. This one does not even pull one hair and I have not plucked my eyebrow in a while. It does not work like wax. It does not have wax. I think the title is misleading. When I open the box, the shapers are like eyelids helpers. When I peel the sharpers, it sticks like my scotch tape. I don&#x27;t have a lot hair and my hair is very light and thin. I will say this product is a failure. I bought this thinking it has shapers template, but it is basically a scotch tape divided into 2 with a curve.</li>
            <li> Great buy.  Sent Right away!</li>
            <li> These strips are a new brand for me.  They work perfectly.  No messy residue, gentle to the skin.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and hot wax always tears my skin. These work great, and save me a lot of money by my waxing my brows myself.  The trick to these is to leave them on for a few seconds, pull skin taught, and then pull them quickly in the opposite direction of the hair growth.</li>

            <li> When I bought these, I was skeptical they would work so I just left them in my car. Today I was early to something and pulled them out and I will never tweeze again! I have sensitive skin so I tried one on my wrist first and it worked and did not leave red marks. I then used them on my eyebrows (which by the way, I haven&#x27;t dealt with in two months and were bad) and these strips totally work! No more paying ten bucks to have my eyebrows waxed and ending up with break outs! &#x3D;) This is an easy no mess alternative to hot wax and plucking.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Will pick up maybe a couple of the lightest and loosest hairs - definitely not suitable for eyebrow shaping.  Not even as cleanup in between tweezings.  Compares very poorly to almost any other wax strip product I&#x27;ve ever tried (well this is the only one that&#x27;s specifically shaped for eyebrows.. but since it doesn&#x27;t work at all, that makes no difference).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love them. The trick to getting all the hair off on the first rip is to wash your eyebrow area with soap (like bar-soap or body wash) and water. Not facial cleanser, because that adds a layer of moisturizer that coats the hair and makes them slippery.&lt;br /&gt;You can also go over the eyebrow with alcohol before ripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to trim my strips to get the shape I want, but it&#x27;s no big deal. My eyebrows look great afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning though...Don&#x27;t make your brows too thin, because after a while the hair stops growing back. As you get older, eyebrows get thinner on their own, and you could end up looking really strange.</li>
            <li> I cannot find these wax strips in drugstores anymore, so I found them here.  The shipping was quick &amp; the product was as I remembered.  I have very light eyebrows &amp; the hairs are not too coarse, so may be the reason why they work well for me and not so well for some of the 1-star reviewers.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere, so I searched on line and found it!  Great for a quick wax on the run!</li>
            <li> these are okay, I guess they may work better for some people than they have for me, and I have only used them twice, but that is because, I normally tweeze or use the eyebrow shavers to shape my brows. I saw these and since I sometimes have trouble getting them even, I thought this would be great to try, however, I hate letting my brows grow out that much, enough for this product to work, however, I am working on doing so now (I used to always always have them waxed, however it seemed that they didn&#x27;t have to grow out as much to have them professionally waxed as it does for this product to work, even though this works the same as a waxing, without the wax, but I guess that is because, since wax isn&#x27;t being used, there needs to be a bit more length to the hair for it to get a grip on to).&lt;br /&gt;I will try this again, and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;if you can let your lashes grow out enough, im sure that this will work a lot better!&lt;br /&gt;there is a lot of different shapes and sizes included, so this could work for anybody, and you can change up the shape of your brows if wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t dislike this product, I am just having some problems, making myself have the self control to let me lashes grow out enough to use it, but I want to because I so badly want to reshape my lashes, and I know (as do you ladies) that it is hard to do, but I still recommend it.</li>
            <li> The strips didn&#x27;t work for my eyebrows! Please don&#x27;t purchase this product!</li>
            <li> They felt like tape.  I got a big scab and it didn&#x27;t touch the hairs.  I threw the remaining packages (I got three) away.  I will stick with the Parissa eyebrow wax strips.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give these a try since they were so cheap and they did get some good reviews. But they were really horrible...they don&#x27;t do anything. It&#x27;s like sticky honey over a piece of tape. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> I love these things! The don&#x27;t carry them at Rite Aid anymore so I&#x27;m here to get another supply.  So fast, no mess and my brows are actually even!  I can never get them the same without these. I will cry if they ever stop making them. Not sure how anyone can complain about these. They make me so happy.</li>
            <li> I use product because I&#x27;m officially concerned about sanitary conditions at salons; plus, I bleed when go to salon and I don&#x27;t think someone should be touching my brow area while super small amount of blood is present and my skin is open. Anyway, it works!! For people who state it doesn&#x27;t work--make sure you remove all oil. I remove oil by applying rubbing alcohol to area because if your skin is oily, it&#x27;s NOT going to work. I LOVE IT and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought these on eBay thinking they would be cheaper without checking Amazon first. Definitely do price comparisons as Amazon was cheaper by almost $2 a box. Overall, they are fairly decent. My favorite part is that they are already shaped to wax the top of your brow and the bottom. The shape worked for me and I didn&#x27;t have to cut or reshape them like others did. I cleaned and scrubbed my eyebrows thoroughly and let them dry for some time and like others, the first wax strip I used barely took anything. A few tiny hairs. The second worked much better. I cleaned the unwaxed side a second time and when I used the first strip on that side it did much better. I also discovered that keeping it on your brow for longer than directions say cause them to not pull any hairs at all. Do it immediately for best results. Maybe the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; got too warm and then weak? My biggest disappointment is that, even though it did rip a few hairs out, I still had to go through and pluck a few afterwards. My entire goal was to avoid plucking. Especially if a wax strip was touching that area. It was nice though that it did a great job pulling out the tiny, fine, almost-invisible hairs that I can never seem to get with tweezers. For the most part I&#x27;m satisfied and I&#x27;ll continue to use this one box until it&#x27;s gone but next time I think I will pay a little more for a brand that does the job a bit better</li>
            <li> I have bought these here on Amazon for about a year now, and I can&#x27;t imagine my life without them.  The strips DO work, at least they do on me.  They are like really strong tape, but I&#x27;ve never had TAPE that would pull my hair follicles (spelling?) out of my head, so they are stronger than \\&quot;tape\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of these also works just great for me.  I don&#x27;t have to cut them, as I read on another review, but maybe I do have big eyebrows???  I don&#x27;t know. But they are fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some things you should know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. These wax strips probably won&#x27;t work the first time, because the first strip is always wasted on dead skin sells, oils, or whatever else is on your face that you didn&#x27;t see.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, it will take at least 2 before they pull the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  You must follow the directions.  You need to put them on without touching the sticky part (or not much of it) with your hands.  It will leave finger prints on your strips, and they will be garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to put them on, flatten them in the direction your hair lays, tugg on the sides of your eyelids, and RIP them off.  They will then take the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Cool water and a moisturizer soothes the area after you wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing my brows myself for years and while hot wax works really well, it&#x27;s messy and can be difficult to use. These cold wax strips are the best non-hot wax option I&#x27;ve found. They are nicely pre-shaped (but easily re-cut if you want/need), remove hair remarkably well the first time around and are actually much less painful than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great product and value!!  I used to get these locally now cant find them- glad i found them again!  Easy to use and don&#x27;t pluck you bald.  I hate super thin brows - i just use them to keep them tidy.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love these strips.  Ive used others in the past and local stores stopped carrying them so I decided to order online.  I chose these instead of my regular kind because of the price and im sure glad I did.  I can get about 2 or 3 waxes out of each box which is what I expected and what I was use to with my other brand.  I wax around every 2 weeks. These 3 boxes should last around 4 months. Will be buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li> These are basically equivalent to taking a piece of tape and putting them on your eyebrows. These strips don&#x27;t work.</li>
