            <li>The original Brazilian Blowout Shampoo and the best!  </li>
            <li>this is an excellent price and was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>of the Brazilian Blowout products are very good at helping to smooth your hair while maintaining body and softness.  </li>
            <li>The smell  isn&#x27;t very appealing though.</li>
            <li>love love this !!  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing even when the blowout comes out.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say it does not extend the life of a Brazilian blowout nor does it make my hair any smoother.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice smell and is not fruity.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>and they work just great as I am coming to the end of my original bottles.</li>

            <li>Great price fast shipping.</li>

            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and have used it for years</li>
            <li>I love that I had a Brazilian blowout done to my hair.</li>
            <li>Pay more and buy from someone else.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I love this shampoo for the way that it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Love it for my Blowout.</li>
            <li>It almost seems to leave my hair more frizzy.</li>
            <li>great product and more reasonable on amazon.  </li>
            <li>simply the best brazilian blow out shampoo.</li>
            <li>much better than the volume shampoo, this leaves your hair cleaner longer.</li>
            <li>but you will love the condition of your hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have a tremendous amount of hair and can go through a great deal of hair products quickly.  </li>
            <li>Getting it through Amazon was a great value, timely delivery, and exactly the product that is available at about twice the price in hair salons.</li>
            <li>BUT this is not the ORIGINAL blow out shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Great product, not harsh on my hair!</li>
            <li>My hair looks great with this product, but I have the Brazilian blowout done on my hair professionally also helps</li>
            <li>I think there are better sulfate free shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo to preserve your BB, smells nice and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It is the original authentic product as I have purchased from the salons twice before but now from Amazon at a lower price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t misunderstand, I love the shampoo and it is great with my brazilian blowout but only when it is the correct product.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a grit to it and took out most of my Brazilian treatment before I realized it wasn&#x27;t the true product.</li>
            <li>It still is fine after washing my hair with it and lathers well.</li>
            <li>and they were fine</li>
            <li>My hair is always smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>My daughters hooked me on this antifrizz shampoo/serum this summer and despite the Chicago humidity, my hair is shiny smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth without any frizz.  </li>
            <li>With this hair treatment I need to use salt free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This is a luxurious shampoo for keeping your Brazilian Blowout smooth and for keeping frizzy hair nourished.</li>
            <li>This is NOT THE REAL thing!!!</li>
            <li>I have used the original for years, which has a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Smells nothing like the original and doesn&#x27;t smooth the hair like it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Believe this is a knock off of the original BB shampoo.</li>
            <li>I usually haveto get it in Florida and was VERY happy to see that you carry it.  </li>
            <li>Best shampoo I have found to control frizz without a heavy residue!  </li>
            <li>I knew something wasn&#x27;t right!</li>
            <li>Great product and got it before expected</li>
            <li>Really love this product, I have very frizz hair</li>
            <li>This is NOT the true Brazilian Blowout shampoo.</li>
            <li>No bad smell.</li>
            <li>the brazilian blowout was the best, and since then my hair has &amp;#34;acclimated&amp;#34; to the treatment and to products so the blowouts don&#x27;t seem to last as long and my hair is not as smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>use the correct amount (which isn&#x27;t much ) works great and last to make the cost stretch</li>
            <li>The shampoo that keeps frizz free even when the weather is humid and hot.</li>
            <li>Brazilian Blowout never fails me !</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, leaves my hair soft and well conditioned.</li>
            <li>Lathers up quickly is the first clue.  </li>
            <li>I also wash and rinse my hair first, and then tie it up.</li>
            <li>So I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner for the first 30-60 days to help maintain it.</li>
            <li>After having a Brazilian Blowout it is important that you use a shampoo that is not harsh with sulfates.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and deep conditioner from Brazilian Blowout.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had brazilian blowouts for several years now and have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the first time I got</li>
            <li>This is the first time this has ever happened to me on Amazon.</li>
            <li>You would most definitely like this shampoo if you&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair!</li>
            <li>but it certainly makes for easier straightening on the rare occasions I put a straight iron to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and only a very small amount is needed to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>And i would feel very itchy all over.  </li>
            <li>This is not the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Thank you for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>who don&#x27;t have stick straight hair.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>Ivery bought from others and it was the real deal.</li>
            <li>The real Brazilian Blowout shampoo does not lather.</li>
            <li>This does not smell like the real product.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does not need too much sudsing.  </li>
            <li>a Brazilian blowout treatment thank you for the fast shipment</li>
            <li>Which is unusual for me</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>this shampoo is amazing and you get so much lather out of a small dollop of gel.</li>
            <li>Easy to blow dry.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>It is mixed with some other kind of soap.</li>
            <li>I first bought this at my salon after a Brazilian blowout and paid major bucks for it.</li>
            <li>So I use other sulfate free products when I can.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this shampoo, works really well on my long wavy super frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair smooth and makes it easier to dry or flat iron.</li>
            <li>and this shampoo makes it really soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>having no issues so far</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally frizzy and I had to use panteene and my hair frizzed up.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and almost feel as though I could get away without conditioning after using only this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and free-free with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out.</li>
            <li>I use this product (okay not daily, but every few days).  </li>
            <li>Honestly no different then any other shampoo from the super market shelf.  </li>
            <li>This product really makes my Brazilian blowout last longer which is the only thing that has truly removed my frizz in this humidity.  </li>
            <li>I receive the same exact make and amount of shampoo and conditioner to take and use; however, since you only get it done every 4 months, there isn&#x27;t enough product, so I purchased these</li>
            <li>After getting the blowout a second time, I ordered this exact same one for a much lesser price.  </li>
            <li>It has been 10 month since my last blowout as I write this - too busy.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo and less expensive than at the salon.</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with coarse, dry, and/or curly hair.</li>
            <li>They are expensive, but it&#x27;s either that or getting cheaper products forcing you to get $$$ brazilian blowouts more frequently.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using it along with some of their other products.</li>
            <li>If I have had the Brazilian Blowout smoothing technique on my hair at the salon within the last 8 weeks, I will use considerally less product because the hair is so much smoother to begin.  </li>

            <li> use the correct amount (which isn&#x27;t much ) works great and last to make the cost stretch</li>
            <li> The shampoo that keeps frizz free even when the weather is humid and hot.</li>
            <li> Brazilian Blowout never fails me !</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, leaves my hair soft and well conditioned.</li>
            <li> Lathers up quickly is the first clue.  </li>
            <li> I also wash and rinse my hair first, and then tie it up.</li>
            <li> So I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner for the first 30-60 days to help maintain it.</li>
            <li> After having a Brazilian Blowout it is important that you use a shampoo that is not harsh with sulfates.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and deep conditioner from Brazilian Blowout.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had brazilian blowouts for several years now and have tried many products.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the first time I got</li>
            <li> This is the first time this has ever happened to me on Amazon.</li>
            <li> You would most definitely like this shampoo if you&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair!</li>
            <li> but it certainly makes for easier straightening on the rare occasions I put a straight iron to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and only a very small amount is needed to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> And i would feel very itchy all over.  </li>
            <li> This is not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Thank you for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> who don&#x27;t have stick straight hair.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> Ivery bought from others and it was the real deal.</li>
            <li> The real Brazilian Blowout shampoo does not lather.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like the real product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not need too much sudsing.  </li>
            <li> a Brazilian blowout treatment thank you for the fast shipment</li>
            <li> Which is unusual for me</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is amazing and you get so much lather out of a small dollop of gel.</li>
            <li> Easy to blow dry.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> It is mixed with some other kind of soap.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at my salon after a Brazilian blowout and paid major bucks for it.</li>
            <li> So I use other sulfate free products when I can.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this shampoo, works really well on my long wavy super frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair smooth and makes it easier to dry or flat iron.</li>
            <li> and this shampoo makes it really soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> having no issues so far</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally frizzy and I had to use panteene and my hair frizzed up.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and almost feel as though I could get away without conditioning after using only this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and free-free with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out.</li>
            <li> I use this product (okay not daily, but every few days).  </li>
            <li> Honestly no different then any other shampoo from the super market shelf.  </li>
            <li> This product really makes my Brazilian blowout last longer which is the only thing that has truly removed my frizz in this humidity.  </li>
            <li> I receive the same exact make and amount of shampoo and conditioner to take and use; however, since you only get it done every 4 months, there isn&#x27;t enough product, so I purchased these</li>
            <li> After getting the blowout a second time, I ordered this exact same one for a much lesser price.  </li>
            <li> It has been 10 month since my last blowout as I write this - too busy.  </li>
            <li> Great shampoo and less expensive than at the salon.</li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with coarse, dry, and/or curly hair.</li>
            <li> They are expensive, but it&#x27;s either that or getting cheaper products forcing you to get $$$ brazilian blowouts more frequently.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend using it along with some of their other products.</li>
            <li> If I have had the Brazilian Blowout smoothing technique on my hair at the salon within the last 8 weeks, I will use considerally less product because the hair is so much smoother to begin.  </li>
            <li> Last long enough.</li>
            <li> I do this every six months, and to make it last that long, I only use Brazilian Blowout hair products.</li>
            <li> This product has a strange texture to it.</li>
            <li> The product came earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> I do not wash my body until i am completely done with my hair, because in the past this shampoo/conditioner caused my body to develop rashes.  </li>
            <li> Just not sure why the initial texture is different.</li>
            <li> by comparison, the brazilian blowout conditioner is not very nourishing, and you have to use a LOT.</li>
            <li> I received the product as expected.</li>
            <li> I got it sooner than I expected and</li>
            <li> I received the product as expected in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I choose this product due to having the Brazillian done to my hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to other customers.</li>
            <li> I tried other shampoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have ordered them before from other sources on amazon</li>
            <li> but it is  something odd I never noticed in the other shampoos.</li>
            <li> But I continue to buy it because I am afraid that any other shampoo would just strip the Brazilian blowout right out Of my hair.</li>
            <li> My only negative comment is the price.  </li>
            <li> so be careful!!  </li>
            <li> Not like what I had previously purchased from my salon.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased this shampoo at my hair salon for $50.  </li>
            <li> The hair is oily in less than 2 days.</li>
            <li> I try to wash my hair every other day because it a small bottle and a little pricy.</li>
            <li> and It lasted a little over 6 months.</li>
            <li> A waste of 20$</li>
            <li> I have to question the authenticity of this shampoo because it has a gritty sandy texture to it that I had not experienced with any shampoos bought through an authorized Brazilian Blowout Product Salon.</li>
            <li> It always keeps my thick, wavy hair tamed and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> so I used it once and will not sure it again.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this will damage my hair or continue to maintain my blowout</li>
            <li> it was too late to return.</li>
            <li> A little too expensive, but it works.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles because they were &amp;#34;warehouse deals&amp;#34; to save and then to late to return when I discovered they were fakes!  </li>
            <li> This does the job but is not great.</li>
            <li> this will destroy your blowout if it is fake!</li>
            <li> I do not use the Brazilian products then getting a flat iron through my hair will probably be worthless.</li>
            <li> You would think as expensive as the product is they could make it smell nicer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I buy my shampoo in bulk amounts and by the time I opened this bottle</li>
            <li> weird</li>
            <li> I am afraid it&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s supposed to be and will damage my hair</li>
            <li> but this one is a FAKE!!  </li>
            <li> This was horrible!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product once and my hair feels so healthy already!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped in great time. Best price on Internet!</li>
            <li> The original Brazilian Blowout Shampoo and the best!  Really love this product, I have very frizz hair and this shampoo makes it really soft and shiny.  Love it</li>
            <li> My hair looks great with this product, but I have the Brazilian blowout done on my hair professionally also helps</li>
            <li> I get brazilian blowouts and I have been using this stuff forever with the s hampoo.  It&#x27;s amazing even when the blowout comes out.  GET IT!</li>
            <li> I first bought this at my salon after a Brazilian blowout and paid major bucks for it. I only use this.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo to preserve your BB, smells nice and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product - lives up to what it claims!</li>
            <li> Great price for the product compared to what you pay in the damn salon!</li>
            <li> i bought this shampoo because i had a brazilian blowout done.  I try to wash my hair every other day because it a small bottle and a little pricy. i make sure to rinse well because it can make my scalp itchy.  I also wash and rinse my hair first, and then tie it up. I then proceed to wash my body.  I do not wash my body until i am completely done with my hair, because in the past this shampoo/conditioner caused my body to develop rashes.  And i would feel very itchy all over.  so i make sure to soap and rinse my body well after using this product.  i use a separate towel for hair and body just in case too.</li>
            <li> love love this !!  the best shampoo ever  if you have a Brazilian Blow out or a Keratin treatment this is the best shampoo to use</li>
            <li> Brazilian Blowout never fails me !</li>
            <li> This was horrible!!  It WAS NOT the Brazilian blowout product in the bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance, fabulous results.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the true Brazilian Blowout shampoo. I have used the original for years, which has a smooth texture. This shampoo has a grit to it and took out most of my Brazilian treatment before I realized it wasn&#x27;t the true product.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product!</li>
            <li> this shampoo is amazing and you get so much lather out of a small dollop of gel. by comparison, the brazilian blowout conditioner is not very nourishing, and you have to use a LOT. i ran out of conditioner weeks before i ran out of shampoo.</li>
            <li> gift for daughter. she&#x27;s thrilled with it !</li>
            <li> I received this product and when I went to use it the shampoo was separated and had a gritty sand texture to it. I threw it away and purchased shampoo at the salon. Will not buy this product again online. I have used this brand of shampoo for years so I know what it feels and looks like. Would not buy again</li>
            <li> This product has a strange texture to it. Not like what I had previously purchased from my salon. It&#x27;s a bit slimy and clumpy. It still is fine after washing my hair with it and lathers well. Just not sure why the initial texture is different.</li>
            <li> I received the product as expected.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the Brazilian blowout shampoo.  All their products rock!!!  My hair is always smooth and silky.  I had a friend ask me about what products I use and I directed her to Brazilian Blowout.  She is now a fan!</li>
            <li> use the correct amount (which isn&#x27;t much ) works great and last to make the cost stretch</li>
            <li> I get my Brazilian Blowout done about every 5 months. So I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner for the first 30-60 days to help maintain it. The smell  isn&#x27;t very appealing though. So I use other sulfate free products when I can. You would think as expensive as the product is they could make it smell nicer.</li>
            <li> After getting a Brazilian Blowout This product along with the conditioner was recommended to me to use. I do not want to strip my hair of the Brazilian Blowout so I am using this shampoo. It is the original authentic product as I have purchased from the salons twice before but now from Amazon at a lower price. It smells wonderful and only a very small amount is needed to wash your hair. I love it and would recommend this .</li>
            <li> This does the job but is not great. I think there are better sulfate free shampoos out there. I have ordered a kerastase one but have yet to receive it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a while now. I can honestly say it does not extend the life of a Brazilian blowout nor does it make my hair any smoother. But I continue to buy it because I am afraid that any other shampoo would just strip the Brazilian blowout right out Of my hair.</li>
            <li> I choose this product due to having the Brazillian done to my hair. My hairdresser said that he used it just as his regular shampoo. So I use it even when I have not had the Brazillian done! Keeps my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Nice product!!  Nice transaction!</li>
            <li> My daughters hooked me on this antifrizz shampoo/serum this summer and despite the Chicago humidity, my hair is shiny smooth. Perfectly brilliant. Braziliant!</li>
            <li> After having a Brazilian Blowout it is important that you use a shampoo that is not harsh with sulfates. This products helps extend the life of the Blowout.</li>
            <li> This is not the real stuff. There is some sort of grit in the one I received and I&#x27;ve never had that before. I&#x27;ve been getting Brazilian blowout treatments for 2 years now. I am LIVID because this can strip the treatment I just paid for. I used the shampoo twice and after the second time I knew something wasn&#x27;t right!</li>
            <li> I have never found anything that compares.  This product really makes my Brazilian blowout last longer which is the only thing that has truly removed my frizz in this humidity.  Thank you for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have used only this product for several years along with their conditioner. I would highly recommend using it along with some of their other products.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this shampoo, works really well on my long wavy super frizzy hair. I got the Brazilian blowout and then maintained it with this shampoo and the mask. I used it about once a week and It lasted a little over 6 months.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, leaves my hair soft and well conditioned.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for people that straighten their hair.  Leaves hair smooth without any frizz.  I would recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I got it sooner than I expected and a great price!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy from Modern Style!</li>
            <li> Great product, along with conditioner noticeably extends Brazilian keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!  Works as described. No bad smell. Last long enough. I will by it again. Nice product.</li>
            <li> very good to use this shampoo after brazillian blowout, I find it has lasted well. I would recommend it to other customers.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about two years.  This bottle has some sort of gritty texture in it.  I am afraid it&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s supposed to be and will damage my hair so I used it once and will not sure it again.  I will mostly like order the product again online...but maybe not from this seller.</li>
            <li> Believe this is a knock off of the original BB shampoo. Smells nothing like the original and doesn&#x27;t smooth the hair like it is supposed to.  A waste of 20$</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and deep conditioner from Brazilian Blowout.  They are great products!</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair especially in the summer humidity.  My hair dresser suggested a Brazillian Blow Out.  With this hair treatment I need to use salt free shampoo.  The Acai Anti-Frizz Shampoo is great.  I tried other shampoo&#x27;s but I didn&#x27;t like the smell of them.  This shampoo has a nice smell and is not fruity.</li>
            <li> The product came earlier than expected.  I have used the product before adn I really liked it.  It always keeps my thick, wavy hair tamed and less frizzy.  I would recommend it for people who don&#x27;t have stick straight hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product (okay not daily, but every few days).  I love it.  I have had my hair with a Brazillian Blowout for 6 months now.  When I get it done I receive the same exact make and amount of shampoo and conditioner to take and use; however, since you only get it done every 4 months, there isn&#x27;t enough product, so I purchased these and they work just great as I am coming to the end of my original bottles.</li>
            <li> Title says it all.  I&#x27;ve had brazilian blowouts for several years now and have tried many products.  I feel like the first time I got the brazilian blowout was the best, and since then my hair has &amp;#34;acclimated&amp;#34; to the treatment and to products so the blowouts don&#x27;t seem to last as long and my hair is not as smooth and shiny.  But I truly believe the brazilian blowout brand products are the best at prolonging and maintaining brazilian blowouts.  They are expensive, but it&#x27;s either that or getting cheaper products forcing you to get $$$ brazilian blowouts more frequently.</li>
            <li> this product worked for me to keep a brazilian chocolate style that i did to my hair. having no issues so far</li>
            <li> The best product for frizz prone hair and a great value. Keeps a Brazilian blow out effects far longer than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I usually haveto get it in Florida and was VERY happy to see that you carry it.  It is best used after a brazilian blowout treatment and helps it to stay in longer.</li>
            <li> This product is Couterfit are all BB brand products featured on Amazon</li>
            <li> Its the best shampoo ever.&lt;br /&gt;gets rid of the frizz and makes it shinier and after and doesnt leave a residue feel. I love it</li>
            <li> This is NOT THE REAL thing!!! I love this shampoo and have used it for years BUT this is not the ORIGINAL blow out shampoo!  Lathers up quickly is the first clue.  Upon inspecting shampoo it is clearly mixed with something.  Maybe ivory dish soap. I ordered 2 bottles because they were &amp;#34;warehouse deals&amp;#34; to save and then to late to return when I discovered they were fakes!  I have ordered them before from other sources on amazon and they were fine so be careful!!  Don&#x27;t misunderstand, I love the shampoo and it is great with my brazilian blowout but only when it is the correct product.  Trust me this will destroy your blowout if it is fake!</li>
            <li> Great product and got it before expected</li>
            <li> I love that I had a Brazilian blowout done to my hair. I do this every six months, and to make it last that long, I only use Brazilian Blowout hair products. Getting it through Amazon was a great value, timely delivery, and exactly the product that is available at about twice the price in hair salons.</li>
            <li> The shampoo that keeps frizz free even when the weather is humid and hot. Easy to blow dry. Hair feels silkier and softer.</li>
            <li> A little too expensive, but it works.</li>
            <li> I have to question the authenticity of this shampoo because it has a gritty sandy texture to it that I had not experienced with any shampoos bought through an authorized Brazilian Blowout Product Salon. I am not sure if this will damage my hair or continue to maintain my blowout but it is  something odd I never noticed in the other shampoos. I do not think I will purchase again from this seller so for now I&#x27;ll just cut my losses.</li>
            <li> Great product, not harsh on my hair!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and less expensive than at the salon.</li>
            <li> It really works.  My hair is naturally frizzy and I had to use panteene and my hair frizzed up.  So I know it works</li>
            <li> Ivery bought from others and it was the real deal. This one is NOT!!  I have used this product now for 5 years but this one is a FAKE!!  It is mixed with some other kind of soap. A soap that lathers a lot. The real Brazilian Blowout shampoo does not lather. This does not smell like the real product. Unfortunately I buy my shampoo in bulk amounts and by the time I opened this bottle it was too late to return. I&#x27;m out of shampoo, out of money and my blowout is ruined now. Please don&#x27;t buy from this buyer. Pay more and buy from someone else. This is the first time this has ever happened to me on Amazon. It deserves zero stars but it won&#x27;t let me put zero. I won&#x27;t even use this on my dog...who knows what they mixed it with.</li>
            <li> Great product. This is what i expect for. It make my hair softer without conditioning. I will re purchase again</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  I use its companion conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the Brazilian Blowout products are very good at helping to smooth your hair while maintaining body and softness.  They smell great too!  My only negative comment is the price.  $$  I have a tremendous amount of hair and can go through a great deal of hair products quickly.  If I have had the Brazilian Blowout smoothing technique on my hair at the salon within the last 8 weeks, I will use considerally less product because the hair is so much smoother to begin.  It has been 10 month since my last blowout as I write this - too busy.  The shampoo does not need too much sudsing.  Just add more water to your hair and continue massing into your scalp instead of wasting your expensive product.  My hairdresser advised this and it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I do not use the Brazilian products then getting a flat iron through my hair will probably be worthless.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love this shampoo for the way that it makes my hair feel. I have very curly hair and almost feel as though I could get away without conditioning after using only this shampoo. I had the Brazilian Blowout almost 2 years ago but continue to use the shampoo (and conditioner) because of the way it seems to replenish the moisture to my hair. Not only that, but it certainly makes for easier straightening on the rare occasions I put a straight iron to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with coarse, dry, and/or curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you need this product for your hair this is an excellent price and was delivered quickly.  Packaging was also very good.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price üëç</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased this shampoo at my hair salon for $50.  After getting the blowout a second time, I ordered this exact same one for a much lesser price.  It‚Äôs the same brand, size, and quality as the hair salon one</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have found to control frizz without a heavy residue!  The conditioner is great too!.  Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> You would most definitely like this shampoo if you&#x27;ve had a Brazilian blowout treatment thank you for the fast shipment</li>
            <li> I have a had a Brazilian Blowout at using this shampoo extends the life of my treatment. Makes my hear feel great!</li>
            <li> great  at keeping the hair in line</li>
            <li> I started using it after I had brazillian blow out done to my hair. I don&#x27;t feel that it cleans good. The hair is oily in less than 2 days. Which is unusual for me</li>
            <li> Great price , fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Ordered twice. Love it for my Blowout.</li>
            <li> Honestly no different then any other shampoo from the super market shelf.  It almost seems to leave my hair more frizzy. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! My hair is so soft and free-free with this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy!</li>

            <li> Nice transaction works great.</li>
            <li> I received the product as expected in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This is a luxurious shampoo for keeping your Brazilian Blowout smooth and for keeping frizzy hair nourished.</li>
            <li> Keeps my frizz at bay...</li>
            <li> simply the best brazilian blow out shampoo. much better than the volume shampoo, this leaves your hair cleaner longer. smell is not that great but you will love the condition of your hair. great product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had a Brazilian blowout, get this!  It keeps your hair smooth and makes it easier to dry or flat iron.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it. Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair! I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out.</li>
