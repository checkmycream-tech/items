            <li>AND FOR THE BEST PART: IT IS MAKING MY SPOT GO AWAY!!!</li>
            <li>Best concealer ever!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t initially impressed with the foundation and concealer</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t give the best review on this.</li>
            <li>Wasnt impressed by this product.</li>
            <li>My mom loved it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I did, I LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li>This does a great job of covering my spots and sun damage.  </li>
            <li>What a great find.  </li>
            <li>and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, light weight and the color matches perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am 53 caucasion with good olive skin.</li>
            <li>Good concealer.</li>
            <li>Love it product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I also like that it has its own sponge tip applicator.</li>
            <li>This blots over that and covers it nicely so I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li>Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
            <li>LOVE THE PRODUCT AND PACKAGING&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li>This product gives great coverage and covers my freckles really well.  </li>
            <li>I am able to put this on with ease</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, it fits well on my eyes</li>
            <li>Like I said, so far so good!</li>
            <li>I use a light mineral powder on top to even the rest of my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>The coverage was extremely light, and most of the product ended up soaked into the sponge tip instead of my face.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t show, even if I don&#x27;t use foundation.  </li>
            <li>this is so easy to use</li>
            <li>I Do Use clinique Foundation and Revlon Photo Ready powder (Which I LOVE!).</li>
            <li>(I lightly &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; and stipple with my foundation brush, blends awesomely and vanishes every dark spot!).</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly and blends and covers well.</li>
            <li>I paint it on and smooth edges with my finger.  </li>
            <li>so I can have one with me in my purse, one for my vanity at home and another to keep in my office stash (I love it that much)!</li>
            <li>I do not wear a lot of make-up, so it certainly is good enough for me</li>
            <li>I purchased this to cover a sun spot that is right in front of my ear therefore really shows up nicely along my pretty earrings.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last all day, but works better then most others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Works great for my under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li>this blots on easily and camouflages it very well.</li>
            <li>I knew she would love this concealer and look young.</li>
            <li>On top of that I developed a sun spot 1/2 the size of a dime on cheek under eye...</li>
            <li>right out in front.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, nothing is going to really &amp;#34;fade&amp;#34; those brown spots, but if it happens by the time I use this up, I will write a 5-star review, regardless of the packaging!</li>
            <li>I use it on top of my liquid make-up as a double cover.  </li>
            <li>You can also touch it up over makeup and it blends pretty well.</li>
            <li>Firstly I couldn&#x27;t find my exact skin shade, so settled with one that is closest.</li>
            <li>let alone a foundation because my skin looks almost perfect, but I know it would benefit me to use a base that contained some sort of sunscreen and more coverage, but in this case, I can get away with lightly dusting with the matching Perfecter Powder of the same line.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too soon to really know if it&#x27;s erasing as well as concealing.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have really struggled to cover this.</li>
            <li>No concealer really worked like this one has.</li>
            <li>This works better than the 12+ other products (in all price ranges)I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Better than any other!</li>
            <li>I like a natural look, so finding good coverage and a natural-dewy finish is hard to come by...</li>
            <li>This product worked well at slightly covering an age spot so that it blended better to my skin tone</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s winter and my skin is starting to feel dry from my BareMinerals mineral powder foundation I love to use in the summer.</li>
            <li>In general though, I heard the other age rewind concealer by Maybelline is better.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job lightening the age spots, but does not cover them completely.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>so poking around with the gimmicky BB and CC creams didn&#x27;t work so well because of the coverage and the fact that the cream started to break me out and would start to settle into the fine lines.</li>
            <li>but it is the closest I&#x27;ve found so far to anything else.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying at least two more just</li>
            <li>This almost completely covers it by itself and then when I put my makeup over it you can barely see it.</li>
            <li>Funnily enough the reason I returned this &#x27;Age Rewinder&#x27; is because the product was &#x27;old&#x27;, so old in fact that I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the sponge tipped applicator.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty clear, just having trouble finding products my skin feels comfortable in due to other factors including seasons and hormones.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly dark sunspot on my face and this covers it pretty well.</li>
            <li>This product is the first one I&#x27;ve found to sufficiently cover my dark circles!</li>
            <li>I am 65 and have major age spots that I could never really completely hide.  </li>

            <li> It may have well been the size of a half dollar on my pale olive skin!</li>

            <li> it was broken when i got it.</li>
            <li> I did order the wrong color</li>
            <li> Too bad Maybelline isn&#x27;t selling it in stores anymore.</li>

            <li> This does a great job of covering my spots and sun damage.

            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT AND PACKAGING&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the worst packaged produce I have ever seen.  There are YouTubes that will show you how to open it, if you finally get through the outer packaging.  Mine did not ever &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; so was broken from the outset.  I finally discovered I can pull up (vigorously) on the sponge portion and eventually some product will appear on the sponge.  I agree with other reviewers who think the sponge is a bad idea because of bacteria, so I recommend using a clean finger or a washable makeup applicator to apply the product, rather than applying directly to the face.  I will not purchase again.  I would rather have a plain tube such as those by Clinique and others.  In my opinion, nothing is going to really &amp;#34;fade&amp;#34; those brown spots, but if it happens by the time I use this up, I will write a 5-star review, regardless of the packaging!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Received the item still in its packaging. This product gives great coverage and covers my freckles really well.  I also like that it has its own sponge tip applicator.</li>
            <li> Funnily enough the reason I returned this &#x27;Age Rewinder&#x27; is because the product was &#x27;old&#x27;, so old in fact that I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the sponge tipped applicator.</li>
            <li> 2nd one I bought that I couldn&#x27;t get to turn so I can&#x27;t review product that I CAN&#x27;T get to work!</li>
            <li> Great coverage, light weight and the color matches perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works great for my under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly and blends and covers well. Not sure about the age rewind bit though, too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> I brought this in Paris on vacation because I forgot my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; concealer.  Wow!  What a great find.  You can find this in the US.  I am 65 and have major age spots that I could never really completely hide.  This works better than the 12+ other products (in all price ranges)I have tried.  You need to keep twisting the tube until the liquid comes through to the fuzzy applicator end.  I paint it on and smooth edges with my finger.  Stays on all day.  Blends well with my skin.  I use a light mineral powder on top to even the rest of my skin tone.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> This product worked well at slightly covering an age spot so that it blended better to my skin tone but it did not conceal it, as suggested by the name of the product. I will use it again but will continue looking for something that actually does conceal and erase</li>
            <li> My mom loved it! She didn&#x27;t expect me of this. I knew she would love this concealer and look young. I think I will also get another one myself.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job lightening the age spots, but does not cover them completely.  I use it on top of my liquid make-up as a double cover.  Like it well enough that I bought it for the 2nd time.  I do not wear a lot of make-up, so it certainly is good enough for me</li>
            <li> I am 53 caucasion with good olive skin. It has always been hard to find concealers and foundation to go with my skin tone. On top of that I developed a sun spot 1/2 the size of a dime on cheek under eye...yeah...right out in front. It may have well been the size of a half dollar on my pale olive skin! I have really struggled to cover this. I Do Use clinique Foundation and Revlon Photo Ready powder (Which I LOVE!). No concealer really worked like this one has. PLUS I have a sweaty job unloading UPS trucks and this concealer keeps on covering! There are times I go without foundation and just use this. AND FOR THE BEST PART: IT IS MAKING MY SPOT GO AWAY!!! THANK YOU MAYBELLINE! XOX!</li>
            <li> Would not come out!!  Dried up?  I threw it away!</li>
            <li> Best concealer ever! Too bad Maybelline isn&#x27;t selling it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to cover a sun spot that is right in front of my ear therefore really shows up nicely along my pretty earrings. My regular makeup wouldn&#x27;t cover the spot but this blots on easily and camouflages it very well. I wouldn&#x27;t say it 100% covers it but it is the closest I&#x27;ve found so far to anything else. After applying my makeup and powder, I only notice the spot because I&#x27;m looking for it. I also have a dark freckle under my lower lashes which always looks like my makeup is smudged. This blots over that and covers it nicely so I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Conceals the dark circles around my eyes!!!</li>
            <li> Good concealer. Doesn&#x27;t clump or dry out my skin. Not sure I really see any change in skin tone though</li>
            <li> All I can say is, &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34; I tried the foundation and under eye concealer from this line a couple of years ago, but somehow missed this little goldmine of a concealer. I&#x27;m a lighter-complected Filipina-American, (almost) mid-thirties and have normal-to-combination skin. I&#x27;m not prone to acne but if I get a blemish, I get hyperpigmentation when it heals, but eventually fades away. My skin is pretty clear, just having trouble finding products my skin feels comfortable in due to other factors including seasons and hormones. It&#x27;s winter and my skin is starting to feel dry from my BareMinerals mineral powder foundation I love to use in the summer. I like a natural look, so finding good coverage and a natural-dewy finish is hard to come by...so poking around with the gimmicky BB and CC creams didn&#x27;t work so well because of the coverage and the fact that the cream started to break me out and would start to settle into the fine lines. I wasn&#x27;t initially impressed with the foundation and concealer I tried a couple years back, but decided to give it another try. I&#x27;m very glad I did, I LOVE this product!!! I am able to put this on with ease (I lightly &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; and stipple with my foundation brush, blends awesomely and vanishes every dark spot!). I feel like I don&#x27;t need a lot (a little really goes a long way) let alone a foundation because my skin looks almost perfect, but I know it would benefit me to use a base that contained some sort of sunscreen and more coverage, but in this case, I can get away with lightly dusting with the matching Perfecter Powder of the same line. I feel like Maybelline had this thirty-something in mind when they made this product. I plan on buying at least two more just so I can have one with me in my purse, one for my vanity at home and another to keep in my office stash (I love it that much)!</li>
            <li> this is so easy to use and it does a great job. saves me a lot of time in the morning.</li>
            <li> Concealers look cakey on me a lot. This was not an exception.  I did order the wrong color so I can&#x27;t give the best review on this. In general though, I heard the other age rewind concealer by Maybelline is better.</li>
            <li> This product is the first one I&#x27;ve found to sufficiently cover my dark circles! Time will tell if I repurchase it!</li>
            <li> Nope, does not work. Maybe its just me, but go ahead and buy it and try it, maybe it will work for some people.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it fits well on my eyes I had dark circles and it made it lighter.</li>
            <li> Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
            <li> I have a fairly dark sunspot on my face and this covers it pretty well. I have had a hard time finding a concealer that covers it completely and stays throughout the day. This almost completely covers it by itself and then when I put my makeup over it you can barely see it. It doesn&#x27;t last all day, but works better then most others I&#x27;ve tried. You can also touch it up over makeup and it blends pretty well. I also like the fact that it is suppose to fade spots over time, as for that only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried TONS of concealers.  This one doesn&#x27;t clump, blends well and can be reapplied over makeup.  Will continue to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> Firstly I couldn&#x27;t find my exact skin shade, so settled with one that is closest. It leaves a white smudge that shows even after blending and covering with foundation.</li>
            <li> it was broken when i got it.</li>
            <li> Wasnt impressed by this product. The coverage was extremely light, and most of the product ended up soaked into the sponge tip instead of my face. Wouldnt buy again.</li>
