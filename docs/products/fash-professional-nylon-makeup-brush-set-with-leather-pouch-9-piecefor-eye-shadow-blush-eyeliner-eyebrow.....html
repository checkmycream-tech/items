            <li>Its more of a vinyl/ pleather pouch..</li>
            <li>The case is cheap, but cute.</li>
            <li>(this is literally my first set), but I&#x27;m enjoying using them!</li>
            <li>Excellent condition for the most part - the mascara brush tip was a little bent in my set</li>
            <li>The quality is fine.</li>

            <li>They also look very nice, I&#x27;ll definitely keep them in mind as a gift.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how soft they were, the packaging was nice and it even came with the netted brush protectors!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the largest brush, the eyebrow comber, and the lash brush so far, but all brushes are excellent -- they are soft and work well.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with my brushes when they arrived, they are soft unlike some brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>But it is not too strong, and I can definitely live with it, it&#x27;ll probably fade away soon.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and easy to apply make up.</li>
            <li>Happy with the brush set, hands down however a little dissapointed with the pouch that is advertised as a nice leater pouch.</li>
            <li>This brush set is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a present for my grand daughter, she loves them .</li>
            <li>The service was fast.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t vouch very well for the quality of the brushes because of my skill level</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>The brushes are medium soft, they are quite small, I do not like are equally good for beginners in the makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, has esencial brushes and a nice pouch.</li>
            <li>: fast shipping, the brushes are really soft to touch, the whole set looks stylish.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The brushes are of natural pile and well made, but the pouch is not of leather as it was said.</li>
            <li>I was worried the hairs would fall out or wouldn&#x27;t be soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of previous purchases from different companies, I was hesitant to buy these brushes especially because they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>not too bad, but not too great either.</li>
            <li>My main concern was brush size, I have a smaller make up bag and didn&#x27;t want them to be too long</li>

            <li> This set of brushes work good to great for mineral based makeup. You can spend a lot more on brushes that a trained eye may see the difference in how they perform. At the price of this set I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong.</li>
            <li> The brushes are medium soft, they are quite small, I do not like are equally good for beginners in the makeup. The service was fast.</li>
            <li> The brushes were as described and reviewed.  Good looking and soft.  The pouch is faux leather instead of leather.  The name of this product should better be revised accordingly.</li>
            <li> This brush set is soft and smooth. Its quality is over my expectation due to such a low price. I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve has these brushes since the summer and they are still in great condition for the price. The case and brushes have a nice look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just learning, so this price can&#x27;t be beat! I can&#x27;t vouch very well for the quality of the brushes because of my skill level (this is literally my first set), but I&#x27;m enjoying using them!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with my brushes when they arrived, they are soft unlike some brushes I&#x27;ve used. Shipping was fast and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a make up guru so I don&#x27;t know how helpful my review will be.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: fast shipping, the brushes are really soft to touch, the whole set looks stylish.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the case is not real leather, some of the brushes weren&#x27;t covered properly so the hairs go in different directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So not too bad, but not too great either.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with these brushes. They are very soft and easy to use. Not sure what another reviewer meant when she said they don&#x27;t hold powder or eye shadow, I don&#x27;t have any problems with that. They also look very nice, I&#x27;ll definitely keep them in mind as a gift. There is a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s not the brushes, it&#x27;s the case, since it&#x27;s not real leather. But it is not too strong, and I can definitely live with it, it&#x27;ll probably fade away soon.</li>
            <li> I spent several months looking for a natural hair brush set and just could not spend the money. I came across this set and decided to buy it. (well I bought 2, one for a friend and one for myself) I honestly didn&#x27;t think I was going to like this set since it is nylon and you never really know what you are getting when you order online. The quality is fine. The brushes are soft and easy to apply make up. I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the liner brush, but I have never used one before (I usually use the small angled brush for my gel liner.)&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the QUALITY of the brushes are great. They are very strong brushes and don&#x27;t look or feel cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my friend her set and she was so thrilled. I belive for the price, it is a great deal and would recommend this set to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;The only disappointment was that the set I ordered looked Pink, instead I received a brownish color set. The blue set I ordered was just as it appeared on the site.</li>
            <li> I really love this cosmetic brush set with the leather pouch! The brushes are of great quality and work perfect with my makeup and the leather pouch is of high quality and help to keep my brushes in order. I am very pleased with my purchase and with the seller!!! I will do business with this person again!!! :)</li>
            <li> I just received my Brush Set and i love it,,,the brushes are so girlie like and its compact enough to fit into my clutches when i carry them,,GREAT PRICE &amp; LOOK !!!!!!</li>
            <li> The product was as described and met my expectations. The case is cheap, but cute. The brushes are of good quality. Definitely a bargain I would say.</li>
            <li> Brush set arrived quickly, quality and packaging was good. I was disappointed with the fact that the Pouch is vinyl and not Leather as stated/described.</li>
            <li> Happy with the brush set, hands down however a little dissapointed with the pouch that is advertised as a nice leater pouch. Its more of a vinyl/ pleather pouch.. my only critisim..</li>
            <li> The brushes are of natural pile and well made, but the pouch is not of leather as it was said.</li>
            <li> My main concern was brush size, I have a smaller make up bag and didn&#x27;t want them to be too long but I couldn&#x27;t find any sizes so I just measured and the longest brush in the bag is 6 inches including the brush hairs. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of previous purchases from different companies, I was hesitant to buy these brushes especially because they were so cheap. I was worried the hairs would fall out or wouldn&#x27;t be soft. I was pleasantly surprised how soft they were, the packaging was nice and it even came with the netted brush protectors! I got them two days after I ordered them and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, has esencial brushes and a nice pouch. Great for gifts.</li>
            <li> I hate them. they don&#x27;t hold the blush or the eye shadows at all.. And the lipstick brush hair are coming off! Wasted 10$~</li>
            <li> i just opened the package ......they seem great ....i wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be this good but they actually are soo get &#x27;em</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the largest brush, the eyebrow comber, and the lash brush so far, but all brushes are excellent -- they are soft and work well. The case is simple to transport and opens and closes well.... CAN&#x27;T beat this set for the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent condition for the most part - the mascara brush tip was a little bent in my set but I&#x27;m not too concerned as long as it doesn&#x27;t keep bending back and forth to the point of breaking off. The bag itself (plaid) looks very nice and holds all the brushes securely.</li>
            <li> Brushes are good and kit is so easy to carry anywhere</li>
            <li> This was a present for my grand daughter, she loves them . They came on time, and they where what was described.</li>
