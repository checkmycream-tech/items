            <li>this works great.</li>
            <li>Great value for the money</li>
            <li>Great handle, and great bristles...</li>
            <li>Great brush, good foaming.  </li>
            <li>On one hand the brush has been awesome in that I enjoyed the experience of shaving with a brush and creme.</li>
            <li>My husband says it feels good in his hand</li>
            <li>Why pay 50 bucks for a brush when this one is just as good.</li>
            <li>Semogue or Omega are 2 good brands, and you can get an Omega for under $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>LOVED IT, used it for a year, wanted a non animal one.</li>
            <li>This brush lathered up well and soaped me up good for a close shave, but like I said before, I needed a softer bristle.</li>
            <li>The brush make and quality is good and for</li>
            <li>Been using it for 6 months now and it gives me a fairly good lather.</li>
            <li>love this brush, great for my husband sent it to him over seas so he has it to use when shaving or whatever else</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the quality and performance of this brush!</li>
            <li>Works as good or better than nautral hair brush.  </li>
            <li>I liked the brush, but I needed a softer bristle, so I baught a softer model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice synthetic brush.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice lather&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent brush, being made of a high quality synthetic material.</li>
            <li>a great synthetic, Muhle&#x27;s silvertip fiber version 2.0 feels velvety soft, lathers well, and feels great.  </li>
            <li>Soft, gives a nice lather, just great all around!</li>
            <li>Mine ended up ungluing because I never invested in a shaving brush holder which is very important to own</li>
            <li>If you must have a cheap synthetic, then you can make this work, but rather good synthetics can be had for $25.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to see that a company can make an excellent product like this without having to use the fur of a dead badger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a really good affordable brush, I&#x27;d highly recommend a good boar bristle brush and greak it in - soft tips, good backbone for soaps, and both lathers well and feels great.  </li>
            <li>(too course, did not produce a good lather, etc), compared to true badger or horse hair brushes.</li>
            <li>Quick fix with some superglue made it good as new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that my shaves are now closer than before.</li>
            <li>Well, considering the price, it works, but the top brush fell away from the wood part.  </li>
            <li>Synthetic is much better than stinky animal hair.</li>
            <li>veg and don&#x27;t want to use hair brushes, and sure</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d be just as happy with it even if it cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>using a shaving brush almost makes shaving an enjoyable experience.  </li>
            <li>This make shaving more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>Rinses easily</li>
            <li>Bristles attached in this manner are fine in cosmetic brushes.  </li>
            <li>It lathers fine in a cup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of synthetic bristle shave brushes.</li>
            <li>As a vegetarian I was attracted by the fact that this shaving brush is produced cruelty free without boar or badger bristles.</li>
            <li>Plus: it&#x27;s comparably cheap.</li>
            <li>like that this is a cheap brush with synthetic bristles, but the weakness of the glue annoys me.</li>
            <li>It was surprisingly comfortable to use on my face for a synthetic brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and 3.</li>
            <li>brush is adequately soft on the face, and it helps produce a good lather.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it&#x27;s cheap, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I use water-based shaving gels and it even whips those up into rich, emollient foam that gets between the whiskers and the skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first synthetic fiber brush I have used and love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fun to use and along with my super cheap blades from dorcousa.com</li>
            <li>if you like stiff bristles - and I do - then this thing does a good job when it comes to whipping up some nice lather.</li>
            <li>The fair-trade wood is fine, the bristle material may be all right.</li>
            <li>and it makes a good lather (especially with Van Der Hagen soap).  </li>
            <li>The saying &amp;#34;You get what you paid for&amp;#34; rings true with this shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The next one up&#x27;ll cost you about 30 dollars, so this is a good temporary/travel/or introductory brush.</li>
            <li>have an ethical objection to how the Badger hair is harvested for most brushes that are on the market, so I chose to opt for a synthetic hair brush</li>
            <li>I think this is a good brush if you are just starting out.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as a an inexpensive badger brush (i.e., same price range).  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>The brush is fine, exactly what my husband likes.  </li>
            <li>After a short break in period (maybe a week or two), this brush really started to hold water and lather great.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work decent, but I know there are way better brushes out there.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I realize that a true badger hair brush might perform better then the synthetic counter parts, or that true shaving &amp;#34;aficionados&amp;#34; will scoff at anything that isn&#x27;t real badger, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed mush difference.</li>
            <li>One of the other reviewers of the brush made an excellent recommendation about care, which I believe is important not only for this brush, but for any brush you might purchase.</li>
            <li>While higher-end brushes do better, this $11 brush is a good investment for those that don&#x27;t want to spend a small fortune on shaving products.</li>
            <li>For a synthetic brush it&#x27;s fabulous, can&#x27;t really go wrong!&lt;br</li>
            <li>a nice lather with regular Dial bath soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bristles are very soft and load up lather well - very satisfied (now that I&#x27;ve fixed it).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and priced right.</li>
            <li>This brush is very cost effective, gives me a great lather on the face with little soap and is quick to dry as well.</li>
            <li>This will make certain the brush is with you for years to come!</li>
            <li>You will waste more money getting this cheaper brush first and then realizing you should just get yourself a badger brush, which doesn&#x27;t cost too much more.</li>
            <li>Shaving brushes need to be designed for men who shave briskly and use hot water.</li>
            <li>My first brush.  </li>
            <li>Hot Glued the brush to the handle</li>
            <li>Buying  better brush that will hopefully last longer</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I just wanted something to serve as a shaving brush that will not burst the bank and this brush does exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, there are better alternatives for the same money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Synthetic and vegan friendly, soft and used with shaving bar soap from chagrin valley soaps.</li>
            <li>As expected, this is a cheap brush that works like a cheap brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend if your looking for a fairly priced and very solid synthetic shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This guy is still going with pretty much no bristle hair lost after a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many months now and despite its price I recommend this as a good  half way point between the stiffness of a boar bristle brush and a badger brush for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>I now use this one exclusively instead of the pure badger</li>
            <li>The fibers of this brush are fine,  but the knot is definitely not well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a waste for The Body Shop&#x27;s name to be associated with this product when with just a little more effort the company could produce a good one that could still be reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had a few more bristles on it to make it a bit more fan shaped, but its not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been shaving with straight razors for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not used animal hair brushes for ethical reasons.</li>
            <li>I would have expected it to hold up better than it did.  </li>
            <li>I really ,really want to like this brush.</li>
            <li>That being said, this brush isn&#x27;t nearly as nice as a badger one, it&#x27;s awkwardly stiff.</li>
            <li>The natural fibers from beavers or muskrats smell from animal oil when first used and need special treatment to knock back the musk smell.</li>
            <li>Not a thick one, but not a thin one either.</li>
            <li>While not as soft as a boar shaving bush, this brush pretty well mimics the feel of a badger brush.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll find less irritation and better shaving.</li>
            <li>Probably could super glue it back together</li>
            <li>This is 100x better than my old boar brush; its softer, makes a better lather, and best of all doesn&#x27;t have that awful wet dog/boar smell when you run it under the water!  </li>
            <li>It feels soft against my face and it maintains its shape very well.  </li>
            <li>When applying the lather the brush does not pancake out like any normal brush would do.  </li>
            <li>be afraid to really press, especially at first; synthetic brushes are really durable, and after a few weeks of vigorous use this thing feels very nice on the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are much softer than your cheaper boar hair brushes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it does a better job.  </li>
            <li>review is for the exact same brush bought at a body shop location</li>
            <li>Spend the time cleaning and drying it properly after every shave and make sure you store it/dry it with the bristles pointing down.</li>
            <li>I enjoy wet shaving, but the brush doesn&#x27;t, fell apart one week after starting to use it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush directly from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li>Soft any sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Most negative reviews on synthetic brushes that I read were regarding the feel or performance of the brush</li>
            <li>Really helps to apply shave cream consistently, love using this to shave for less of a mess and a smoother lather.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t realize just how much I was missing out on with the first one until I got this one.</li>
            <li>it looks great but its extremely hard to use not very good to lather with.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush as I am just getting into the wet shaving scene.</li>
            <li>If you use too much soap, you get a dry lather on your face.  </li>
            <li>Also dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t require soaking for a few minutes</li>
            <li>If you dry this properly between uses it will hold up very well!</li>
            <li>This little brush worked right out of the package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still usable because the glue binding the bristles to each other is fine, but it&#x27;s a little ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No abuse, so no excuse.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks of ownership, and a trip under hot water everyday made the adhesive give way and separate the metal bristle grommet from the handle.</li>

            <li> This guy is still going with pretty much no bristle hair lost after a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many months now and despite its price I recommend this as a good  half way point between the stiffness of a boar bristle brush and a badger brush for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I now use this one exclusively instead of the pure badger</li>
            <li> The fibers of this brush are fine,  but the knot is definitely not well made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste for The Body Shop&#x27;s name to be associated with this product when with just a little more effort the company could produce a good one that could still be reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a few more bristles on it to make it a bit more fan shaped, but its not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been shaving with straight razors for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not used animal hair brushes for ethical reasons.</li>
            <li> I would have expected it to hold up better than it did.  </li>
            <li> I really ,really want to like this brush.</li>
            <li> That being said, this brush isn&#x27;t nearly as nice as a badger one, it&#x27;s awkwardly stiff.</li>
            <li> The natural fibers from beavers or muskrats smell from animal oil when first used and need special treatment to knock back the musk smell.</li>
            <li> Not a thick one, but not a thin one either.</li>
            <li> While not as soft as a boar shaving bush, this brush pretty well mimics the feel of a badger brush.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll find less irritation and better shaving.</li>
            <li> Probably could super glue it back together</li>
            <li> This is 100x better than my old boar brush; its softer, makes a better lather, and best of all doesn&#x27;t have that awful wet dog/boar smell when you run it under the water!  </li>
            <li> It feels soft against my face and it maintains its shape very well.  </li>
            <li> When applying the lather the brush does not pancake out like any normal brush would do.  </li>
            <li> be afraid to really press, especially at first; synthetic brushes are really durable, and after a few weeks of vigorous use this thing feels very nice on the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are much softer than your cheaper boar hair brushes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it does a better job.  </li>
            <li> review is for the exact same brush bought at a body shop location</li>
            <li> Spend the time cleaning and drying it properly after every shave and make sure you store it/dry it with the bristles pointing down.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wet shaving, but the brush doesn&#x27;t, fell apart one week after starting to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush directly from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> Soft any sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Most negative reviews on synthetic brushes that I read were regarding the feel or performance of the brush</li>
            <li> Really helps to apply shave cream consistently, love using this to shave for less of a mess and a smoother lather.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t realize just how much I was missing out on with the first one until I got this one.</li>
            <li> it looks great but its extremely hard to use not very good to lather with.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush as I am just getting into the wet shaving scene.</li>
            <li> If you use too much soap, you get a dry lather on your face.  </li>
            <li> Also dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t require soaking for a few minutes</li>
            <li> If you dry this properly between uses it will hold up very well!</li>
            <li> This little brush worked right out of the package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still usable because the glue binding the bristles to each other is fine, but it&#x27;s a little ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No abuse, so no excuse.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of ownership, and a trip under hot water everyday made the adhesive give way and separate the metal bristle grommet from the handle.</li>
            <li> contacted the seller, they offered to cover half the cost for a new brush, however shipping was my cost.</li>
            <li> The bristles did move in more of a clump (as other reviewers have warned) than my previous brush, but it wasn&#x27;t particularly hard to use this product.</li>
            <li> The Body Shop brush is adequate but has little &amp;#34;splay&amp;#34;, it is stiff.</li>
            <li> the handle was broken right out of the package, and you can see where it was glued back together.</li>
            <li> I fixed mine with some water-resistant wood glue, but other reports suggest that this is not unusual.</li>
            <li> Either the bristles are too sparse or the knot is weirdly shaped; the brush doesn&#x27;t fan out in a that way puts soap on your face comfortably or efficiently.  </li>
            <li> The brush is being marketed as an entry-level shaving brush, but that seems like an excuse.  </li>
            <li> That being said, a small price to pay for not pointlessly killing animals.</li>
            <li> After having tried several other brushes, this is at the bottom of the heap.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not noticed a single lost bristle yet.</li>
            <li> The brush performs like any other, but it turned out to be a lot smaller than I had expected.</li>
            <li> One then has to constantly scrape the lather back down into a bowl and gather it on the tips in order to appky it, and this makes a mess with lather running onto one&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> I had to use epoxy glue to glue the knot back into the handle less than a month after buying it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not top notch, but it&#x27;s basically your only vegan option on the low end of the budget scale.</li>
            <li> only regret is that the coverage of the hair is a bit too narrow for my taste, but no biggie</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s synthetic so stiffness should be expected.</li>
            <li> For those looking for a brush that&#x27;s not real fur or something not costly</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving brush because of the plain wooden handle and the eco-friendly synthetic bristles.  </li>
            <li> The bristles I must say is a bit stiff and you can definitely feel it, but at this price I am not complaining.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t bend easy and broke away from its base after only two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Lasts longer than other brushes.</li>
            <li> It also cleans out, dries, and holds up extremely well.</li>
            <li> the other hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not doing anything extreme with it - just mixing the shaving cream in a mug or bowl.  </li>
            <li> My problem is a common one apparently.</li>
            <li> other plus point is also that since it&#x27;s synthetic brush no badger had to die to make this.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the glue holding the brush to the handle came loose after about two weeks.</li>
            <li> It sent me down the path of wet</li>
            <li> Disappointing that it could fall apart so quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought another cheap brush on this site which lasted for several months until the bristles (that was a boar brush) detached from the base.</li>
            <li> For a $10 brush, not worth it.</li>
            <li> It works just okay with the maca root shave cream from The Body Shop, but it&#x27;s almost worthless on soaps.  </li>
            <li> The knot is too tight and instead of fanning out while in use it stays tight almost to the point of being sharp.</li>
            <li> Bristles don&#x27;t feel natural, handle staretd splintering whenresting on its base, and really didn&#x27;t perform.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes there is Plisson and Muhle black fiber bur</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to break in.</li>
            <li> But little else.</li>
            <li> But I definitely don&#x27;t like the poor quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have been using the Plisson knot that L&#x27;Occitaine offers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush about a month ago and have used it everyday since.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now and it is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also stiff and you have to paint your face with it.</li>
            <li> The brush threads remain at a pointy 90 degrees to the face and in a small 3/4 inch circle.  </li>
            <li> Perhas, though I&#x27;m not sure what watertight glue I&#x27;d use and face it - I shouldn&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> A few months in with only a handful of uses, the entire wood base has been bleached by water damage and is beginning to crack.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re small, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> But, something&#x27;s wrong with the way it&#x27;s made.  </li>
            <li> One has to press quite hard on the brush to produce lather, and the lather then ends up saturating the base of the brush rather than tips.  </li>
            <li> but you can not do a face lather, it will be rather unpleasant.</li>
            <li> So instead of them chucking a bad handle</li>
            <li> Crap.  </li>
            <li> Either the glue didn&#x27;t stick or it wasn&#x27;t well fitted to the base.  </li>
            <li> So I hold the brush at the base, still does the job.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> I used this brush 3x a week for 3 months, and now the head has detached from the base!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Crap.  Get a Fuller brush.  This one came apart within 3 days.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the quality and performance of this brush! This is my second vegan shaving brush and I didn&#x27;t realize just how much I was missing out on with the first one until I got this one.</li>
            <li> My husband says it feels good in his hand and it makes a good lather (especially with Van Der Hagen soap).  He&#x27;s very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> As a vegetarian I was attracted by the fact that this shaving brush is produced cruelty free without boar or badger bristles. Plus: it&#x27;s comparably cheap. if you like stiff bristles - and I do - then this thing does a good job when it comes to whipping up some nice lather. But I definitely don&#x27;t like the poor quality of this brush. It lost bristles from the beginning and after only three weeks of daily usage the brush separated from the handle. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving brush because of the plain wooden handle and the eco-friendly synthetic bristles.  The brush is fine, exactly what my husband likes.  However, in a matter of weeks the bristles all came out as a solid unit.  I had to glue them back in myself. Bristles attached in this manner are fine in cosmetic brushes.  Shaving brushes need to be designed for men who shave briskly and use hot water.</li>
            <li> Great brush, good foaming.  Works as good or better than nautral hair brush.  Lasts longer than other brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of synthetic bristle shave brushes. I purchased this brush directly from The Body Shop. Unfortunately, I have been using the Plisson knot that L&#x27;Occitaine offers. The Plisson has spoiled me. The Body Shop brush is adequate but has little &amp;#34;splay&amp;#34;, it is stiff. If that&#x27;s your preference, buy this brush. It&#x27;s well made and priced right. I&#x27;m putting mine in the dopp kit.</li>
            <li> The fibers of this brush are fine,  but the knot is definitely not well made. If you want an inexpensive synthetic brush I would recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used boar and badger shaving brushes before and had believed that a synthetic brush would not perform as well. I was wrong. While not as soft as a boar shaving bush, this brush pretty well mimics the feel of a badger brush. I use water-based shaving gels and it even whips those up into rich, emollient foam that gets between the whiskers and the skin. I&#x27;m sure that my shaves are now closer than before. While higher-end brushes do better, this $11 brush is a good investment for those that don&#x27;t want to spend a small fortune on shaving products.</li>
            <li> The quality just isn&#x27;t there.  I had to use epoxy glue to glue the knot back into the handle less than a month after buying it.  The coating started to crack within a couple months.      The bristles are much softer than your cheaper boar hair brushes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it does a better job.  It works just okay with the maca root shave cream from The Body Shop, but it&#x27;s almost worthless on soaps.  If you use too much soap, you get a dry lather on your face.  If you put enough water, the brush starts to fling water and soap.  The bristles just don&#x27;t hold onto the water or the lather.    You will waste more money getting this cheaper brush first and then realizing you should just get yourself a badger brush, which doesn&#x27;t cost too much more.</li>
            <li> As a big fan of the The Body Shop&#x27;s shaving cream, I&#x27;d urge them to redesign this brush.  The fair-trade wood is fine, the bristle material may be all right. But, something&#x27;s wrong with the way it&#x27;s made.  Either the bristles are too sparse or the knot is weirdly shaped; the brush doesn&#x27;t fan out in a that way puts soap on your face comfortably or efficiently.  It&#x27;s like using a broom. The brush is being marketed as an entry-level shaving brush, but that seems like an excuse.  It&#x27;s a waste for The Body Shop&#x27;s name to be associated with this product when with just a little more effort the company could produce a good one that could still be reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to break in. Doesn&#x27;t absorb water like a boar bristle. Soft any sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is 100x better than my old boar brush; its softer, makes a better lather, and best of all doesn&#x27;t have that awful wet dog/boar smell when you run it under the water!  I do wish it had a few more bristles on it to make it a bit more fan shaped, but its not a big deal.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible shaving brush.  One has to press quite hard on the brush to produce lather, and the lather then ends up saturating the base of the brush rather than tips.  One then has to constantly scrape the lather back down into a bowl and gather it on the tips in order to appky it, and this makes a mess with lather running onto one&#x27;s hands. When applying the lather the brush does not pancake out like any normal brush would do.  The brush threads remain at a pointy 90 degrees to the face and in a small 3/4 inch circle.  If you must have a cheap synthetic, then you can make this work, but rather good synthetics can be had for $25.</li>
            <li> The saying &amp;#34;You get what you paid for&amp;#34; rings true with this shaving brush. The bristles broke off of the handle after maybe 3 days, but i still use the now handleless bristles.</li>
            <li> It took just one month of moderate use for the clump of bristles to come out of the wooden handle. COuld I glue it back in? Perhas, though I&#x27;m not sure what watertight glue I&#x27;d use and face it - I shouldn&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> As expected, this is a cheap brush that works like a cheap brush. A few months in with only a handful of uses, the entire wood base has been bleached by water damage and is beginning to crack. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not top notch, but it&#x27;s basically your only vegan option on the low end of the budget scale. The next one up&#x27;ll cost you about 30 dollars, so this is a good temporary/travel/or introductory brush. It does the job. But little else.</li>
            <li> Used it about 5 times and no synthetic hairs falling out. Doesn&#x27;t have the dog smell my boars hair did. Why pay 50 bucks for a brush when this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for me and another for someone else. I think it works well, however the person I gave it to said the bristle part detached from the wooden handle. Disappointing that it could fall apart so quickly.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t bend easy and broke away from its base after only two weeks of use.  Not a good product.</li>
            <li> I no longer buy badger because of concerns over animal welfare. That being said, this brush isn&#x27;t nearly as nice as a badger one, it&#x27;s awkwardly stiff. It softens a bit over time however. That being said, a small price to pay for not pointlessly killing animals.</li>
            <li> My first brush.  After having tried several other brushes, this is at the bottom of the heap.  Bristles don&#x27;t feel natural, handle staretd splintering whenresting on its base, and really didn&#x27;t perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a really good affordable brush, I&#x27;d highly recommend a good boar bristle brush and greak it in - soft tips, good backbone for soaps, and both lathers well and feels great.  Semogue or Omega are 2 good brands, and you can get an Omega for under $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a great synthetic, Muhle&#x27;s silvertip fiber version 2.0 feels velvety soft, lathers well, and feels great.  Also dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t require soaking for a few minutes (I soak my boar before I get into the shower).  Ordering from a European vendor such as Connaught Shaving bypasses Muhle&#x27;s North American distributor markup so it&#x27;s cheaper even with shipping from England.</li>
            <li> I bought another cheap brush on this site which lasted for several months until the bristles (that was a boar brush) detached from the base. After *four days* of use this brush&#x27;s synthetic bristles did the same. It&#x27;s still usable because the glue binding the bristles to each other is fine, but it&#x27;s a little ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t abuse the brush or anything. The bristles did move in more of a clump (as other reviewers have warned) than my previous brush, but it wasn&#x27;t particularly hard to use this product. However, it&#x27;s possible that leaving the brush standing upright and not sitting in my bowl was a mistake. I haven&#x27;t been shaving with straight razors for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this is a cheap brush with synthetic bristles, but the weakness of the glue annoys me.</li>
            <li> Not used animal hair brushes for ethical reasons. This brush is very cost effective, gives me a great lather on the face with little soap and is quick to dry as well. Plus I&#x27;m not too worried about the bristles and spoiling the brush as such.</li>
            <li> After a short break in period (maybe a week or two), this brush really started to hold water and lather great.  It feels soft against my face and it maintains its shape very well.  I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple months now and I&#x27;ve not noticed a single lost bristle yet.</li>
            <li> I realize that a true badger hair brush might perform better then the synthetic counter parts, or that true shaving &amp;#34;aficionados&amp;#34; will scoff at anything that isn&#x27;t real badger, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed mush difference. Most negative reviews on synthetic brushes that I read were regarding the feel or performance of the brush (too course, did not produce a good lather, etc), compared to true badger or horse hair brushes. However, i think this performs just as well as any comparably priced animal hair equivalent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an ethical objection to how the Badger hair is harvested for most brushes that are on the market, so I chose to opt for a synthetic hair brush instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is adequately soft on the face, and it helps produce a good lather. It also cleans out, dries, and holds up extremely well. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding or bristles fall out, and its been in constant use for well over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend if your looking for a fairly priced and very solid synthetic shaving brush.</li>
            <li> LOVED IT, used it for a year, wanted a non animal one. very soft.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. Hasn&#x27;t lost bristles yet.</li>
            <li> On one hand the brush has been awesome in that I enjoyed the experience of shaving with a brush and creme. It sent me down the path of wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand the handle was broken right out of the package, and you can see where it was glued back together. So instead of them chucking a bad handle they decided to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; it. Maybe the damaged ones are sold in the Gift Sets???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also stiff and you have to paint your face with it. It lathers fine in a cup but you can not do a face lather, it will be rather unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I used this brush 3x a week for 3 months, and now the head has detached from the base!  Either the glue didn&#x27;t stick or it wasn&#x27;t well fitted to the base.  I&#x27;m not doing anything extreme with it - just mixing the shaving cream in a mug or bowl.  I would have expected it to hold up better than it did.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well, considering the price, it works, but the top brush fell away from the wood part.  I guess I need to glue it.</li>
            <li> The brush performs like any other, but it turned out to be a lot smaller than I had expected. If you&#x27;re small, this is for you. If not, keep on looking.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s cheap, and I was not disappointed. I&#x27;m not a shaving snob, so if you are, you might disagree with my opinion.</li>
            <li> was given this brush with a body shop gift set....I enjoy wet shaving, but the brush doesn&#x27;t, fell apart one week after starting to use it. Hot Glued the brush to the handle, one week later, fell apart. Buying  better brush that will hopefully last longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many months now and despite its price I recommend this as a good  half way point between the stiffness of a boar bristle brush and a badger brush for a lot less money. If you dry this properly between uses it will hold up very well!</li>
            <li> I think this is a good brush if you are just starting out.  Especially if you are looking for a synthetic brush.  Seems to work decent, but I know there are way better brushes out there.  Just depends on what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Synthetic is much better than stinky animal hair. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Brush came out of handle after one week. I fixed mine with some water-resistant wood glue, but other reports suggest that this is not unusual. Otherwise it&#x27;s unexceptional.</li>
            <li> I now use this one exclusively instead of the pure badger I had.&lt;br /&gt;The feels on the skin is great and it dries fast.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that the coverage of the hair is a bit too narrow for my taste, but no biggie</li>
            <li> Really helps to apply shave cream consistently, love using this to shave for less of a mess and a smoother lather.</li>
            <li> For a synthetic brush it&#x27;s fabulous, can&#x27;t really go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m veg and don&#x27;t want to use hair brushes, and sure; there are nicer synthetic brushes out there, but they cost 6-8x as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid to really press, especially at first; synthetic brushes are really durable, and after a few weeks of vigorous use this thing feels very nice on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be just as happy with it even if it cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> This brush works well in conjunction with the shave soap that i purchased.  Soft, gives a nice lather, just great all around!</li>
            <li> I liked the brush, but I needed a softer bristle, so I baught a softer model.  This brush lathered up well and soaped me up good for a close shave, but like I said before, I needed a softer bristle.</li>
            <li> This is the first synthetic fiber brush I have used and love it. The natural fibers from beavers or muskrats smell from animal oil when first used and need special treatment to knock back the musk smell. This little brush worked right out of the package.</li>
            <li> love this brush, great for my husband sent it to him over seas so he has it to use when shaving or whatever else but he loves it.</li>
            <li> I had this brush for maybe 3 years and I was very happy with it. It was surprisingly comfortable to use on my face for a synthetic brush. Mine ended up ungluing because I never invested in a shaving brush holder which is very important to own so you can extend the life of your brush.</li>
            <li> I do not find the brush to be too abrasive. But it&#x27;s synthetic so stiffness should be expected. My problem is a common one apparently. The unit separated entirely. No abuse, so no excuse. Unreliable product! I should not have to be fixing a brush 3 weeks after purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush as I am just getting into the wet shaving scene. The brush make and quality is good and for it&#x27;s price it does what it needs to do. The bristles I must say is a bit stiff and you can definitely feel it, but at this price I am not complaining. I just wanted something to serve as a shaving brush that will not burst the bank and this brush does exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other plus point is also that since it&#x27;s synthetic brush no badger had to die to make this.</li>
            <li> For those looking for a brush that&#x27;s not real fur or something not costly this works great. Been using it for 6 months now and it gives me a fairly good lather. Not a thick one, but not a thin one either.</li>
            <li> using a shaving brush almost makes shaving an enjoyable experience.  this is the only way to shave.  I got &amp;#34;The Body Shop For Men Maca Root Shave Cream Regular, 6.3-Fluid Ounce&amp;#34; as well and they pair together well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice synthetic brush. My only complaint is that the glue holding the brush to the handle came loose after about two weeks. So I hold the brush at the base, still does the job. Probably could super glue it back together myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller, they offered to cover half the cost for a new brush, however shipping was my cost. For a $10 brush, not worth it. Wouldn&#x27;t buy from this seller again, or buy this brush again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush about a month ago and have used it everyday since. It&#x27;s an excellent brush, being made of a high quality synthetic material. It&#x27;s great to see that a company can make an excellent product like this without having to use the fur of a dead badger. One of the other reviewers of the brush made an excellent recommendation about care, which I believe is important not only for this brush, but for any brush you might purchase. Spend the time cleaning and drying it properly after every shave and make sure you store it/dry it with the bristles pointing down. This will make certain the brush is with you for years to come!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now and it is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Brush has no smell&lt;br /&gt;- Brush doesn&#x27;t lose bristles&lt;br /&gt;- Makes a nice lather&lt;br /&gt;- Rinses easily&lt;br /&gt;- Quality construction&lt;br /&gt;- No animals were harmed in the making of this product&lt;br /&gt;- Great value for the money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None, it does the job perfectly</li>
            <li> Not as good as a an inexpensive badger brush (i.e., same price range).  With effort, you can make an acceptable lather, so it&#x27;s usable. There are three advantages -- 1.  No animals are hurt to make this product; 2. It&#x27;s cheap and 3. It dries quickly.  As such, I recommend this product for travel or for those who have moral objections to animal products.  Otherwise, there are better alternatives for the same money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use mine when I travel -- but not otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter Brush and probably the best bang for your buck synthetic brush. Yes there is Plisson and Muhle black fiber bur this synthetic brush is your best bang for your buck synthetic. You want a synthetic brush that wont break your bank account...this and the Omega S Brush are the two you should get.</li>
            <li> This make shaving more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;Make a nice lather with regular Dial bath soap.&lt;br /&gt;Fun to use and along with my super cheap blades from dorcousa.com it costs almost nothing to shave.</li>
            <li> Does its job well and no problems with sturdiness.</li>
            <li> I really ,really want to like this brush. but I don&#x27;t! it looks great but its extremely hard to use not very good to lather with. The knot is too tight and instead of fanning out while in use it stays tight almost to the point of being sharp. id avoid this one&lt;br /&gt;this review is for the exact same brush bought at a body shop location</li>
            <li> Great handle, and great bristles... but the adhesive in the middle needs some work. After about two weeks of ownership, and a trip under hot water everyday made the adhesive give way and separate the metal bristle grommet from the handle. Quick fix with some superglue made it good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are very soft and load up lather well - very satisfied (now that I&#x27;ve fixed it).</li>
            <li> This guy is still going with pretty much no bristle hair lost after a year. Synthetic and vegan friendly, soft and used with shaving bar soap from chagrin valley soaps. Stop shaving with foam, switch to soap and a brush and you&#x27;ll find less irritation and better shaving.</li>
            <li> Never saw it. It was a gift to a friend.</li>
