            <li>Makes my skin super soft and smells awesome!</li>

            <li>&#x60;I&#x27; however loved it and would totally recommend it to anyone who tans and are looking for a good after tanning moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I absolutley love this lotion it leaves your body soft and smells great</li>
            <li>It works really well with keeping my skin hydrated and smooth not to mention the fragrance is very nice and not overbearing</li>

            <li>Smells great and makes my skin sooo soft.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell ok at first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I like it for the smell more than the way it helps my skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>smells great and leaves skin soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Seller was great; super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This lotion is just perfect for that, sensitive skin but still being a useful product for it&#x27;s original intentions.</li>
            <li>This is most luxurious feeling body moisturizer I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve probably tried everything on the market, including making my own body cream with pure Shea butter and coconut butter (not something you should try at home).</li>
            <li>It will be worth the money! :)</li>
            <li>The scent is like a sweet cinnamon smell!</li>
            <li>This is a rich, creamy moisturizer that I&#x27;m absolutely in love with now.  </li>
            <li>Extends the life of your tan and is more than worth the price!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy if you don&#x27;t like strong, sweet smells!</li>
            <li>Goes on your body easily and smells like you just put on perfume.</li>
            <li>This cream is so nice -- not only smells so grand but is so smooth on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Really glad that I did get this kind.  </li>
            <li>how strong it is.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong so I wouldn&#x27;t wear it out, I just put it on at night.</li>
            <li>At first I loved the smell, it was sweet and had a tint of candy to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong mix of flowers and fruit.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Lotion is very rich and softens skin well leaving a lovely fresh scent.</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing, it seem to do exactly what it says, leave you tan longer, and it smells wonderful&lt;3.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, very pleased.</li>
            <li>honestly I didn&#x27;t think at first that I would like it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping it will help me get my beautiful, youthful skin back to what it should be.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to find it here for a very resonable price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hemp lotion before and liked it but hot diggity</li>
            <li>love the feel of the lotion, but the scent is really strong at first then gets better as it fades.  </li>
            <li>and I put this new lotion on, I loved it.</li>
            <li>Would have been cool to have some free samples, that would have taken it to another level:)</li>
            <li>Also, it is a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>and that is important to me.  </li>
            <li>If you buy this.. you&#x27;ll look great, smell great and your tan will last (point blank)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great size for the price and will last me a while.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth and hydrated after tanning without an oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the feel of this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not obnoxious.</li>
            <li>I feel a chalky smooth feel.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and keeps skin hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not obnoxious.</li>
            <li>It is silky smooth and leave no oily residue.  </li>
            <li>It is lightly scented, goes on skin smoothly and evenly, leaving a long-lasting dewy look and feel to your skin.</li>
            <li>but the scent is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t win me over.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that reminds me of strawberries.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this lotion to my mother, because of how great for the skin it is and the low price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Product is great and a fraction of the cost at the local tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy about the price but understand supply and demand please bring this product back</li>
            <li>Goes on the skin smooth and enhances your tan.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t an issue to me; you kind of get used to it.</li>
            <li>Makes you silky smooth</li>
            <li>The real thing, works amazing.</li>
            <li>No 9.  Has a light blackberry scent.  </li>
            <li>lotion has a great scent but that is also a personal preference.</li>
            <li>The current place where I tan didn&#x27;t have it available, and was happy to see it available online.</li>
            <li>It has also extended the life of my tan which is important to me.</li>
            <li>and smooth I would buy his again.</li>
            <li>this one has a peculiar, cheap strawberry smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have shiny, silky smooth skin and</li>
            <li>It smells so good and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I loved how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>My friends all love the smell and can&#x27;t believe I got such a good deal.</li>
            <li>Smelled great and really helped keep my skin sane after going tanning so much for a wedding.</li>
            <li>this product smells so good, and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Its smells good and makes my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>Was very excited to try this lotion since it&#x27;s had such good reviews.</li>
            <li>I love using this lotion right after I tan.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not bad, but I also prefer Ever After tan extender, which has an awesome vanilla scent, I noticed kisses makes me look more red, which me being Italian is better than tan Olive.</li>
            <li>The size is very worth the price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really place the exact scent, but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>what I don&#x27;t like is when I originally ordered it it was 13 dollars and some cents but never received the order</li>
            <li>but my tan continues to get darker and this keeps my skin hydrated and fresh!</li>
            <li>In fact, the scent sort of grew on me, and I actually think it&#x27;s quite nice!  </li>
            <li>I first used this product when I was tanning and fell in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li>I just got this yesterday, but thought I needed to leave a review because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Its a great size and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this so much!</li>
            <li>I purchased this originally from my tanning salon a couple years ago, and I ran out of it.</li>
            <li>To me this lotion is very strong smelling, its a pleasant smell but can be a little overpowering.</li>
            <li>I received the item much quicker than I expected and I loved it!!!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel super smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lotion you can buy especially if you are a Tanner, It will keep you soft and extend your tan.</li>
            <li>Many of the ingredients are great, but there are some that I have trouble pronouncing--</li>
            <li>It makes me feel very soft, you do feel warm for a minute after you put it on</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of lotions to keep my skin moisturized after using a tanning bed and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I love to smell good, but even for me this is a bit extreme.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see how large the bottle was when I received it.</li>
            <li>The price is right!</li>
            <li>helped cover up the &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; smell quite well, too, but I am definitely putting it on more than just after tanning!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely good stuff if you like a fresh and fruity smell with purely silkaliscious skin!</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, smell is a very subjective thing and some are more sensitive to it than others.  </li>
            <li>and she loves it not only does it moisturize without leaving a greasy feeling it really help retain her beautiful Suntan.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and my husband says my skin is always so soft.</li>
            <li>I first started using it for after tanning, but it is great for daily use.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and really does make your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my body chemistry, but the scent is sickeningly sweet on me.  </li>
            <li>It is a really good moisturizing lotion to use daily.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but my boyfriend absolutely hates the smell.</li>
            <li>It smells like cotton candy or something else really, really sweet.</li>
            <li>smells like roses and sweet fruit.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact I am getting ready to order another bottle now :)</li>
            <li>Love the hemp, it really does the trick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for All skin, especially those that go to the tanning salon, post-tan.</li>
            <li>smells like roses and sweet fruit.</li>
            <li>The scent is TOO sweet, and smells like stinky candy to me, for some reason.</li>
            <li>thick and creamy and smells great!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and its very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love this sooooo much.</li>
            <li>smell is pleasant, however, the only thing that would make this product even better would be a more tropical fragrance, such as coconut added.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about you , but doesn&#x27;t sound right to me..................</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong at first but fades with time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s got a pretty strong scent but one that I like.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think that this lotion smells like &#x27;fresh rain&#x27;, more like a sweet candy smell.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that the whole family can use, save your money and try some others from Target, but if you are buying this for a speacial treat... treat yourself, I think you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>I dont think it is super moisturizing</li>
            <li>absolutely love my lotion makes you feel so soft and has such a pleasant smell</li>
            <li>But luckily, after rubbing the lotion on, the smell began to dissipate.</li>
            <li>This is one sweet and delicious, for when I really want to be soft and smell extra girly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sweet smell so some people may think it&#x27;s a bit much.</li>
            <li>moisturizing is important and this works very well!</li>
            <li>There is a smell to this, but it is NOT unpleasant to me.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong smell, (kind of like candy) but it doesn&#x27;t stay strong after a few minutes of wearing it.</li>
            <li>and it also has a strong scent, but doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong at first, but the intensity goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I take it in the tanning salon with me and apply it immediatly after I get out of the bed, I also use the Eternal Youth tanning lotion and that really helped get my great color too, This after tan lotion keeps your tan for sooo long!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m amazed at how it instantly makes my skin silky smooth!!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, soaks in really well, but leaves my skin SO SILKY</li>
            <li>I do feel the the moisturizing action lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product I&#x27;ve bought 5 bottles so far.</li>
            <li>but if you buy them online its almost always worth a shot I feel.  </li>
            <li>The smell is reminiscent of laughy taffy or some kind of girly cocktail.  </li>
            <li>It is a thicker lotion and a nice big bottle.  </li>
            <li>and it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite after tanning lotion that I have ever</li>
            <li>It does have a distinct smell.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a nice sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t linger for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells fresh and fruity.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>scent of the lotion is personal opinion, everyone has their own likes and dislikes.</li>
            <li>I left lotion at room temperature for 3-4 hours to warm up the bottle.</li>
            <li>I like the quality of the product, as far as moisture, but the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>My husband makes fun of me and says I smell like a \\&quot;Strawberry</li>
            <li>so it was def worth the money.</li>
            <li>but I still use this lotion as my Daily moisturizer because nothing has ever worked as effectively as this lotion.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s only because people love to get free things.  </li>
            <li>It is really worth buying.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would keep my skin soft and smooth and this does the job!</li>
            <li>It has such a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>I use it right out the tanning bed</li>
            <li>, it has a more silky feeling, out of the three I definitely choose designer skin angel, smells like fresh ripe pears, I would give kisses five stars, but it&#x27;s not priced so good lately and there is better out there than kisses...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was possible but this is hands down the best lotion I have EVER used.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this bottle WAY bigger than I was expecting, but it smells fabulous and leaves you so soft immediately its incredible.</li>
            <li>I guess I don&#x27;t really know what I expected, maybe a miracle lotion that left my tan looking wonderful for weeks...or something like that.</li>
            <li>So overall, even if you dont go tanning id still reccomend this as a daily lotion because its nice :)</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel great if you can get past the smell.</li>
            <li>and I used this after tanning and it kept my skin nice and supple all winter long.</li>
            <li>I am using Kisses right now and like it very much.</li>
            <li>The scent was slightly overwhelming, but only at first because it mellows out quickly once applied to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very thick and takes a while for my skin to absorb it, but it works very well and smells great!</li>
            <li>This stiff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It certainly does make my man want to give me body kisses too!</li>
            <li>Would not suggest if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li>I am african american and truly it makes my skin appear lighter lol.</li>
            <li>Overall though, I’m really happy with it, and will definitely use it after tanning.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how great I smell when I wear this stuff and have convinced several of friends to buy it.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, the smell in the bottle was a little strange to me, but on it smells great, and the smell lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and very affordable compared to other lotions, and overall, I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fruity smell that&#x27;s not unpleasant, but I wouldn&#x27;t normally choose to smell like a strawberry shortcake for an hour after my shower!</li>
            <li>This makes your skin feel nourished, sexy, tight and super soft :-)  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Australian Gold lotions, all thier products leave you</li>
            <li>It seems to do exactly what it says to do</li>
            <li>fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It makes me feel like I have been at the beach - would definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li>arrived earlier than promised and love the product</li>
            <li>It did a great job moisturizing, but I threw it out after I realized it was overpowering and receiving negative attention...</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, is pretty thick</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the first thing I put on.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this moisturizer I bought 2 bottles sense</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and use it several times a day.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels better instantly and feels moisturized hours after applying.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thick, creamy, great fragrance</li>
            <li>The shipping was excellent, i got it two days earlier than when it said it was supposed to arrive, and for the price i couldn&#x27;t not get it it such a big bottle</li>
            <li>Absolutely my favorite lotion, especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my skin so soft that people actually comment on how soft my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I saw a change in my skin.</li>
            <li>smell is great, effects last a long time, my skin stays hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s not greasy like a lot of lotions.</li>
            <li>It sounds like an allergy to one or more of the ingredients, and not everyone will have the same results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time tanner</li>
            <li>exactly what it says will always use this if just even for lotion.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to several of my tanning friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li>Only better, &amp; I&#x27;ll tell you why..</li>
            <li>I first used this product years ago when I first started tanning.</li>
            <li>This product worked really well!</li>
            <li>This lotion runs a very close race!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this again.  </li>
            <li>and seems to last on me most of the day.</li>
            <li>contains most of the same ingredients that the other 2 lotions I liked had, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>The lotion does seem to keep my tan longer than normal, but I honestly wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you for sure since I typically tan every other day.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and it smells so good!</li>
            <li>Someone thought it was Natural Light beer smell and all sorts of other less than delicious smell.</li>
            <li>The original scent is nearly identical.</li>
            <li>It keeps me smelling amazing right after tanning and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or burned after I put it on.</li>
            <li>has an amazing texture and has actually managed to keep my hands moisturized and soft  </li>
            <li>This stuff has an amazing texture and has actually managed to keep my hands moisturized and soft in the wintertime in Michigan.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t seem much better than a regular lotion you could buy for 3 or 4 dollars instead of the $20.00 (don&#x27;t forget the shipping cost)for these tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>I love fake baking but have fair skin</li>
            <li>I got a response from Rays bribing me to leave positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this, I heard nothing but positive feedback.</li>
            <li>At first, the scent was a bit offensive to me, but somehow I acquired it and now use this instead of perfume (so I really like the scent).</li>
            <li>I usually buy ones that have received an award in Allure or Good Housekeeping.</li>
            <li>At first it made my skin amazing soft, but as the lotion wore off my skin got so ashy and dry.</li>
            <li>My daughter thinks it smells like bubble gum; I smell fermented strawberries mixed with a strong chemical smell; however, my husband loves it, so I guess that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>put it on after tanning yesterday, and woke up still feeling like pure silk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am currently using the hemp nation vanilla pineapple which is my new favorite (:</li>
            <li>The smell of the lotion is pretty strong, and lingers a long time.</li>
            <li>I gave my daughter my second bottle because these bottles are huge.  </li>
            <li>After several uses of it now, I can tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle is HUGE and will probably last me all winter.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I am a natual tanner all the way, with the real sun and everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say three to four times, not getting much of a tan yet.</li>
            <li>and it really firms your skin as well.</li>
            <li>Plus reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I feel it really helps keep my tan.</li>
            <li>I spray tan and do the regular tanning bed and feel it helps with both along with keeping my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care much for the smell but seems to moisturize well.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing for the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I used coco butter as recommended by everyone, and it worked ok, minimal stretch marks, but this time I had decided since I had just bought 3 bottles of body kisses, that I would try that instead of the butter.</li>
            <li>Very summer like.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really deepens and extends my tan, as well.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li>and together they really work very well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy at all, makes you feel really refreshed</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>Came is fast a</li>
            <li>This price on amazon was absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very creamy and moisturizes your skin before and after you tan.</li>
            <li>I use hemp lotion and this is very close to it....</li>
            <li>Smells like cheap, generic cherry candy.</li>
            <li>Nice everyday moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really thick but Absorbs fast and smells good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works better than the 2 other</li>
            <li>Ok I got this lotion based on other reviews.</li>
            <li>I definitly noticed a huge diffrence in my tan lasting way longer and my skin is back to being so smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion it firms and makes my skin so soft always after a shower dont dry off just put it on and let your skin drinkit up</li>
            <li>BUT there is a lotion that is pretty much the exact same in smell and also has hemp extract in it: it&#x27;s called Hemp lotion.</li>
            <li>This bottle lasted so long, left me feeling so soft and I absolutely love the smell!</li>
            <li>I am really quite new at tanning</li>
            <li>This arrived very quickly and was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>Kisses has an easy to use pump applicator, and I would suggest you pump carefully -</li>
            <li>The order was shipped quickly and came shortly after I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>I looked at their main ingredients and then started comparing to lower priced lotions.</li>
            <li>I think it works better than the more expensive lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wears off quick enough, though.</li>
            <li>would not buy this particular product again.</li>
            <li>For example, I can only use Ivory bar soap in the shower and Eucerin or Gold bond have been the only lotions I have been able to use.</li>
            <li>it absorbs fast and isn&#x27;t grease but leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>And my legs have never felt so soft after my shower!!</li>
            <li>SO upset that it got discontinued :( smells great, leaves skin silky smooth, non greasy/oily.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need a lot, absorbs wonderfully (no oily film residue) and does a great job with extending my tan life.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to extend there tan and keep their skin soft.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell makes my skin really soft but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy anymore</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the low price and effortlessness of an online purchase.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion and the smell I use it all year round even when I&#x27;m not tanning</li>
            <li>This product definitely does not smell like \\&quot;Fresh Rain.\\</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad but it is strange.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day though like some have said, but I do have dry skin most of the time.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I’ll mix it with regular un-scented lotion for daily use, but the fragrance is strong and fruity.</li>
            <li>I dont know if it really has the ability to pro-long a tan more than other regular lotion, but I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I live this lotion and the smell is heavenly.  </li>
            <li>I live this company.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for new moisturizers to try.</li>
            <li>I live about 10 minutes from my tanning salon, so as soon as I get home</li>
            <li>After using about half the bottle my skin feels tighter (in a good way), extremely moisturized and glowy.</li>
            <li>This lotion works ok, smells ok up close, but to others it stinks.</li>
            <li>Now let the price down to $4.00 and I will buy it all day long because it is a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>The smell takes awhile to get use to, but it leaves your skin very soft...</li>
            <li>After just one application, it made my skin feel very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin, this lotion didnt irritate it at all.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, it came in samples when I bought Australian Gold&#x27;s \\&quot;Wicked\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Contains many of the same ingredients in more expensive anti-aging, firming body lotions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>Finally, something that does exactly what it</li>
            <li>and it was the exact same!!!  </li>
            <li>My only thing is I don&#x27;t care for strawberry scents and this one is pretty noticeable</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive or allergic to wheat, avoid this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of person who turned in assignments in school with blood on them because my knuckles would crack open due to allergy to many lotions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strong at first, but definitely yummy</li>
            <li>Used to be a hardcore tanner and this was my go to after moisturizer, then last October I found out I was pregnant with my second child and giving up tanning for another nine months(my second pregnancy in 2 years) now with my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong but it diminishes after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>also really like that a little goes a long way, and it comes in a nice big (22 oz.)</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis, a severe case and can only use certain things on my skin.</li>
            <li>While the smell is less than desirable, the lotion itself makes it all worth it!</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin soft, and holds on to your tan longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>oh so soft</li>
            <li>As far as if it made me darker, I can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>It also smells like something a 13 year old girl would wear.  </li>
            <li>As far as skin firming, I literally just started using this product 2 days ago, so it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
            <li>IT JUST MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SOOOOO SOFT.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after having just used it.</li>
            <li>So far has also been keeping my tan going well.</li>
            <li>I really like all Australian gold products</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt this soft even when I wasn&#x27;t tanning.</li>
            <li>Skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I also know this because I got a bottle for my 20yr old daughter</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t a 13 year old girl I would not recommend.</li>
            <li>And to me it smells like a soft bubble gum.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I bought this awhile back and really like it...</li>
            <li>bottle vs. the same price I&#x27;ve paid for much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I like the product as far as it&#x27;s ability to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li>leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>The package also says to go to color.australiangold.com, which does not exist and leads me to believe that this product might be rather old.</li>
            <li>It came in the mail fast only 5 days from when I placed my order.</li>
            <li>But as far as a moisturizer</li>
            <li>After tanning and showering, KISSES makes your skin feel so soft and hydrated again.  </li>
            <li>The consistancy is perfect, its thick enough to give skin the moisture it needs while tanning but not too thick and greesy.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re tired of smelling like coconut when going tanning, this is a nice change of pace.</li>
            <li>It was a mess to clean up and try to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice thick consistency, but still goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it as a daily lotion.</li>
            <li>i use it everyday and the price is great ill be buying this from you again very soon ...</li>
            <li>For as thick as this stuff is I expected it to be more moisturizing!</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really get such a large lotion with a pump with other after tanning moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It took a very long time to get what I ordered, but the people were very prompt when I e-mailed them about it.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my hands when they are dry in the winter and from all of the time that I spend in the water and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It lasts a pretty long while, the only issue I had was that sometimes it would &#x27;stick&#x27; and you couldn&#x27;t unlock it.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling extra soft!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thick and super moisturizing!</li>
            <li>But, with this moisturizer, my skin is so soft and it even has kinda a different look of my skin as well.</li>
            <li>I have only used this lotion a couple of days, but so far I like it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell though, it doesn&#x27;t mesh well with my natural scent.</li>
            <li>I definitely can tell a difference in the firmness of my skin from the anti-aging ingredient, although I am still young.</li>
            <li>The bottles lasted only slighter longer than my normal bottles of lotion, so I&#x27;m not sure the price is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend likes the smell a lot he said it reminds him of some kind of silly putty kids play with.  </li>
            <li>Again the smell is crazy good.  </li>
            <li>and I plan on purchasing the same item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li>It does have an odd smell at first</li>
            <li>but I had higher expectations based on the previous reviews.</li>
            <li>very hydrating after a tan or any other time.</li>
            <li>Not a single stretch mark, not an ounce of cellulite , not on my belly,not on my legs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived earlier than expected, packaged very well, and no problems at all.</li>
            <li>Only issue I had was when it was sent to me, the top plastic pump was completely broken off and leaking lotion all over.</li>
            <li>I get weird bumps on my chest from time to time and they&#x27;ve completely disappeared for the most part with this and my legs are smoother than they have ever been.  </li>
            <li>The lotion smells good and seems thick, but after I apply it my skin was still dry and cracked after it dried.</li>
            <li>I was beginning to get very dry skin from tanning and my normal lotion wasn&#x27;t helping,</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s way too sticky, so you can&#x27;t really put it on before you go out because you&#x27;ll get negative attention, and you can&#x27;t really put it on before bed because your husband or SO will complain about the stench, and you will feel sticky and gross trying to go to sleep.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and work in one as well so</li>
            <li>It is very silky feeling and the longer it is used the less that is needed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic change in my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It claims to have green bergamot, melon fruit, and lavender scents, but once you put it on your skin, its a very subtle and soft scent, kind of smells like cucumber melon to me.  </li>
            <li>worked okay, but was a little on the thick side,</li>
            <li>One I have had this on for awhile no bad post sweet smell or anything bad at all.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> &quot; It is more of a girly, bubblegum scent.</li>

            <li> Makes my skin super soft and smells awesome!</li>

            <li> &#x60;I&#x27; however loved it and would totally recommend it to anyone who tans and are looking for a good after tanning moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I absolutley love this lotion it leaves your body soft and smells great</li>
            <li> It works really well with keeping my skin hydrated and smooth not to mention the fragrance is very nice and not overbearing</li>

            <li> The price is amazing and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my skin sooo soft.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell ok at first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I like it for the smell more than the way it helps my skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> smells great and leaves skin soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Seller was great; super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just perfect for that, sensitive skin but still being a useful product for it&#x27;s original intentions.</li>
            <li> This is most luxurious feeling body moisturizer I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve probably tried everything on the market, including making my own body cream with pure Shea butter and coconut butter (not something you should try at home).</li>
            <li> It will be worth the money! :)</li>
            <li> The scent is like a sweet cinnamon smell!</li>
            <li> This is a rich, creamy moisturizer that I&#x27;m absolutely in love with now.  </li>
            <li> Extends the life of your tan and is more than worth the price!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you don&#x27;t like strong, sweet smells!</li>
            <li> Goes on your body easily and smells like you just put on perfume.</li>
            <li> This cream is so nice -- not only smells so grand but is so smooth on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Really glad that I did get this kind.  </li>
            <li> how strong it is.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong so I wouldn&#x27;t wear it out, I just put it on at night.</li>
            <li> At first I loved the smell, it was sweet and had a tint of candy to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong mix of flowers and fruit.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Lotion is very rich and softens skin well leaving a lovely fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing, it seem to do exactly what it says, leave you tan longer, and it smells wonderful&lt;3.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, very pleased.</li>
            <li> honestly I didn&#x27;t think at first that I would like it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping it will help me get my beautiful, youthful skin back to what it should be.</li>
            <li> so I was thrilled to find it here for a very resonable price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hemp lotion before and liked it but hot diggity</li>
            <li> love the feel of the lotion, but the scent is really strong at first then gets better as it fades.  </li>
            <li> and I put this new lotion on, I loved it.</li>
            <li> Would have been cool to have some free samples, that would have taken it to another level:)</li>
            <li> Also, it is a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin so smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> and that is important to me.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this.. you&#x27;ll look great, smell great and your tan will last (point blank)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great size for the price and will last me a while.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin smooth and hydrated after tanning without an oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the feel of this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not obnoxious.</li>
            <li> I feel a chalky smooth feel.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and keeps skin hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not obnoxious.</li>
            <li> It is silky smooth and leave no oily residue.  </li>
            <li> It is lightly scented, goes on skin smoothly and evenly, leaving a long-lasting dewy look and feel to your skin.</li>
            <li> but the scent is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t win me over.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent that reminds me of strawberries.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended this lotion to my mother, because of how great for the skin it is and the low price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Product is great and a fraction of the cost at the local tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy about the price but understand supply and demand please bring this product back</li>
            <li> Goes on the skin smooth and enhances your tan.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t an issue to me; you kind of get used to it.</li>
            <li> Makes you silky smooth</li>
            <li> The real thing, works amazing.</li>
            <li> No 9.  Has a light blackberry scent.  </li>
            <li> lotion has a great scent but that is also a personal preference.</li>
            <li> The current place where I tan didn&#x27;t have it available, and was happy to see it available online.</li>
            <li> It has also extended the life of my tan which is important to me.</li>
            <li> and smooth I would buy his again.</li>
            <li> this one has a peculiar, cheap strawberry smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have shiny, silky smooth skin and</li>
            <li> It smells so good and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I loved how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> My friends all love the smell and can&#x27;t believe I got such a good deal.</li>
            <li> Smelled great and really helped keep my skin sane after going tanning so much for a wedding.</li>
            <li> this product smells so good, and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Its smells good and makes my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> Was very excited to try this lotion since it&#x27;s had such good reviews.</li>
            <li> I love using this lotion right after I tan.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not bad, but I also prefer Ever After tan extender, which has an awesome vanilla scent, I noticed kisses makes me look more red, which me being Italian is better than tan Olive.</li>
            <li> The size is very worth the price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really place the exact scent, but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> what I don&#x27;t like is when I originally ordered it it was 13 dollars and some cents but never received the order</li>
            <li> but my tan continues to get darker and this keeps my skin hydrated and fresh!</li>
            <li> In fact, the scent sort of grew on me, and I actually think it&#x27;s quite nice!  </li>
            <li> I first used this product when I was tanning and fell in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday, but thought I needed to leave a review because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Its a great size and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this so much!</li>
            <li> I purchased this originally from my tanning salon a couple years ago, and I ran out of it.</li>
            <li> To me this lotion is very strong smelling, its a pleasant smell but can be a little overpowering.</li>
            <li> I received the item much quicker than I expected and I loved it!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel super smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is the best lotion you can buy especially if you are a Tanner, It will keep you soft and extend your tan.</li>
            <li> Many of the ingredients are great, but there are some that I have trouble pronouncing--</li>
            <li> It makes me feel very soft, you do feel warm for a minute after you put it on</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of lotions to keep my skin moisturized after using a tanning bed and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I love to smell good, but even for me this is a bit extreme.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see how large the bottle was when I received it.</li>
            <li> The price is right!</li>
            <li> helped cover up the &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; smell quite well, too, but I am definitely putting it on more than just after tanning!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely good stuff if you like a fresh and fruity smell with purely silkaliscious skin!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, smell is a very subjective thing and some are more sensitive to it than others.  </li>
            <li> and she loves it not only does it moisturize without leaving a greasy feeling it really help retain her beautiful Suntan.  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and my husband says my skin is always so soft.</li>
            <li> I first started using it for after tanning, but it is great for daily use.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and really does make your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my body chemistry, but the scent is sickeningly sweet on me.  </li>
            <li> It is a really good moisturizing lotion to use daily.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but my boyfriend absolutely hates the smell.</li>
            <li> It smells like cotton candy or something else really, really sweet.</li>
            <li> smells like roses and sweet fruit.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact I am getting ready to order another bottle now :)</li>
            <li> Love the hemp, it really does the trick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for All skin, especially those that go to the tanning salon, post-tan.</li>
            <li> smells like roses and sweet fruit.</li>
            <li> The scent is TOO sweet, and smells like stinky candy to me, for some reason.</li>
            <li> thick and creamy and smells great!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and its very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love this sooooo much.</li>
            <li> smell is pleasant, however, the only thing that would make this product even better would be a more tropical fragrance, such as coconut added.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you , but doesn&#x27;t sound right to me..................</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong at first but fades with time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s got a pretty strong scent but one that I like.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think that this lotion smells like &#x27;fresh rain&#x27;, more like a sweet candy smell.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that the whole family can use, save your money and try some others from Target, but if you are buying this for a speacial treat... treat yourself, I think you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> I dont think it is super moisturizing</li>
            <li> absolutely love my lotion makes you feel so soft and has such a pleasant smell</li>
            <li> But luckily, after rubbing the lotion on, the smell began to dissipate.</li>
            <li> This is one sweet and delicious, for when I really want to be soft and smell extra girly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sweet smell so some people may think it&#x27;s a bit much.</li>
            <li> moisturizing is important and this works very well!</li>
            <li> There is a smell to this, but it is NOT unpleasant to me.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong smell, (kind of like candy) but it doesn&#x27;t stay strong after a few minutes of wearing it.</li>
            <li> and it also has a strong scent, but doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong at first, but the intensity goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I take it in the tanning salon with me and apply it immediatly after I get out of the bed, I also use the Eternal Youth tanning lotion and that really helped get my great color too, This after tan lotion keeps your tan for sooo long!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m amazed at how it instantly makes my skin silky smooth!!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, soaks in really well, but leaves my skin SO SILKY</li>
            <li> I do feel the the moisturizing action lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li> I love this product I&#x27;ve bought 5 bottles so far.</li>
            <li> but if you buy them online its almost always worth a shot I feel.  </li>
            <li> The smell is reminiscent of laughy taffy or some kind of girly cocktail.  </li>
            <li> It is a thicker lotion and a nice big bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite after tanning lotion that I have ever</li>
            <li> It does have a distinct smell.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t linger for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells fresh and fruity.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> scent of the lotion is personal opinion, everyone has their own likes and dislikes.</li>
            <li> I left lotion at room temperature for 3-4 hours to warm up the bottle.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the product, as far as moisture, but the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> My husband makes fun of me and says I smell like a \\&quot;Strawberry</li>
            <li> so it was def worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I still use this lotion as my Daily moisturizer because nothing has ever worked as effectively as this lotion.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s only because people love to get free things.  </li>
            <li> It is really worth buying.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would keep my skin soft and smooth and this does the job!</li>
            <li> It has such a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> I use it right out the tanning bed</li>
            <li> , it has a more silky feeling, out of the three I definitely choose designer skin angel, smells like fresh ripe pears, I would give kisses five stars, but it&#x27;s not priced so good lately and there is better out there than kisses...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible but this is hands down the best lotion I have EVER used.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this bottle WAY bigger than I was expecting, but it smells fabulous and leaves you so soft immediately its incredible.</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t really know what I expected, maybe a miracle lotion that left my tan looking wonderful for weeks...or something like that.</li>
            <li> So overall, even if you dont go tanning id still reccomend this as a daily lotion because its nice :)</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel great if you can get past the smell.</li>
            <li> and I used this after tanning and it kept my skin nice and supple all winter long.</li>
            <li> I am using Kisses right now and like it very much.</li>
            <li> The scent was slightly overwhelming, but only at first because it mellows out quickly once applied to the skin.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick and takes a while for my skin to absorb it, but it works very well and smells great!</li>
            <li> This stiff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It certainly does make my man want to give me body kisses too!</li>
            <li> Would not suggest if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li> I am african american and truly it makes my skin appear lighter lol.</li>
            <li> Overall though, I’m really happy with it, and will definitely use it after tanning.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how great I smell when I wear this stuff and have convinced several of friends to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, the smell in the bottle was a little strange to me, but on it smells great, and the smell lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and very affordable compared to other lotions, and overall, I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fruity smell that&#x27;s not unpleasant, but I wouldn&#x27;t normally choose to smell like a strawberry shortcake for an hour after my shower!</li>
            <li> This makes your skin feel nourished, sexy, tight and super soft :-)  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love Australian Gold lotions, all thier products leave you</li>
            <li> It seems to do exactly what it says to do</li>
            <li> fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I have been at the beach - would definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li> arrived earlier than promised and love the product</li>
            <li> It did a great job moisturizing, but I threw it out after I realized it was overpowering and receiving negative attention...</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, is pretty thick</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the first thing I put on.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this moisturizer I bought 2 bottles sense</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and use it several times a day.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels better instantly and feels moisturized hours after applying.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy, great fragrance</li>
            <li> The shipping was excellent, i got it two days earlier than when it said it was supposed to arrive, and for the price i couldn&#x27;t not get it it such a big bottle</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite lotion, especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my skin so soft that people actually comment on how soft my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I saw a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> smell is great, effects last a long time, my skin stays hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s not greasy like a lot of lotions.</li>
            <li> It sounds like an allergy to one or more of the ingredients, and not everyone will have the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time tanner</li>
            <li> exactly what it says will always use this if just even for lotion.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to several of my tanning friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li> Only better, &amp; I&#x27;ll tell you why..</li>
            <li> I first used this product years ago when I first started tanning.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well!</li>
            <li> This lotion runs a very close race!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of this again.  </li>
            <li> and seems to last on me most of the day.</li>
            <li> contains most of the same ingredients that the other 2 lotions I liked had, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> The lotion does seem to keep my tan longer than normal, but I honestly wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you for sure since I typically tan every other day.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Someone thought it was Natural Light beer smell and all sorts of other less than delicious smell.</li>
            <li> The original scent is nearly identical.</li>
            <li> It keeps me smelling amazing right after tanning and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or burned after I put it on.</li>
            <li> has an amazing texture and has actually managed to keep my hands moisturized and soft  </li>
            <li> This stuff has an amazing texture and has actually managed to keep my hands moisturized and soft in the wintertime in Michigan.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t seem much better than a regular lotion you could buy for 3 or 4 dollars instead of the $20.00 (don&#x27;t forget the shipping cost)for these tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I love fake baking but have fair skin</li>
            <li> I got a response from Rays bribing me to leave positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this, I heard nothing but positive feedback.</li>
            <li> At first, the scent was a bit offensive to me, but somehow I acquired it and now use this instead of perfume (so I really like the scent).</li>
            <li> I usually buy ones that have received an award in Allure or Good Housekeeping.</li>
            <li> At first it made my skin amazing soft, but as the lotion wore off my skin got so ashy and dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter thinks it smells like bubble gum; I smell fermented strawberries mixed with a strong chemical smell; however, my husband loves it, so I guess that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> put it on after tanning yesterday, and woke up still feeling like pure silk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am currently using the hemp nation vanilla pineapple which is my new favorite (:</li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion is pretty strong, and lingers a long time.</li>
            <li> I gave my daughter my second bottle because these bottles are huge.  </li>
            <li> After several uses of it now, I can tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle is HUGE and will probably last me all winter.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I am a natual tanner all the way, with the real sun and everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say three to four times, not getting much of a tan yet.</li>
            <li> and it really firms your skin as well.</li>
            <li> Plus reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I feel it really helps keep my tan.</li>
            <li> I spray tan and do the regular tanning bed and feel it helps with both along with keeping my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care much for the smell but seems to moisturize well.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing for the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used coco butter as recommended by everyone, and it worked ok, minimal stretch marks, but this time I had decided since I had just bought 3 bottles of body kisses, that I would try that instead of the butter.</li>
            <li> Very summer like.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really deepens and extends my tan, as well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> and together they really work very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy at all, makes you feel really refreshed</li>
            <li> i really like it.</li>
            <li> Came is fast a</li>
            <li> This price on amazon was absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very creamy and moisturizes your skin before and after you tan.</li>
            <li> I use hemp lotion and this is very close to it....</li>
            <li> Smells like cheap, generic cherry candy.</li>
            <li> Nice everyday moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really thick but Absorbs fast and smells good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works better than the 2 other</li>
            <li> Ok I got this lotion based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I definitly noticed a huge diffrence in my tan lasting way longer and my skin is back to being so smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion it firms and makes my skin so soft always after a shower dont dry off just put it on and let your skin drinkit up</li>
            <li> BUT there is a lotion that is pretty much the exact same in smell and also has hemp extract in it: it&#x27;s called Hemp lotion.</li>
            <li> This bottle lasted so long, left me feeling so soft and I absolutely love the smell!</li>
            <li> I am really quite new at tanning</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly and was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Kisses has an easy to use pump applicator, and I would suggest you pump carefully -</li>
            <li> The order was shipped quickly and came shortly after I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I looked at their main ingredients and then started comparing to lower priced lotions.</li>
            <li> I think it works better than the more expensive lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wears off quick enough, though.</li>
            <li> would not buy this particular product again.</li>
            <li> For example, I can only use Ivory bar soap in the shower and Eucerin or Gold bond have been the only lotions I have been able to use.</li>
            <li> it absorbs fast and isn&#x27;t grease but leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> And my legs have never felt so soft after my shower!!</li>
            <li> SO upset that it got discontinued :( smells great, leaves skin silky smooth, non greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need a lot, absorbs wonderfully (no oily film residue) and does a great job with extending my tan life.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to extend there tan and keep their skin soft.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell makes my skin really soft but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy anymore</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the low price and effortlessness of an online purchase.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion and the smell I use it all year round even when I&#x27;m not tanning</li>
            <li> This product definitely does not smell like \\&quot;Fresh Rain.\\</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad but it is strange.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day though like some have said, but I do have dry skin most of the time.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I’ll mix it with regular un-scented lotion for daily use, but the fragrance is strong and fruity.</li>
            <li> I dont know if it really has the ability to pro-long a tan more than other regular lotion, but I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I live this lotion and the smell is heavenly.  </li>
            <li> I live this company.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for new moisturizers to try.</li>
            <li> I live about 10 minutes from my tanning salon, so as soon as I get home</li>
            <li> After using about half the bottle my skin feels tighter (in a good way), extremely moisturized and glowy.</li>
            <li> This lotion works ok, smells ok up close, but to others it stinks.</li>
            <li> Now let the price down to $4.00 and I will buy it all day long because it is a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> The smell takes awhile to get use to, but it leaves your skin very soft...</li>
            <li> After just one application, it made my skin feel very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin, this lotion didnt irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, it came in samples when I bought Australian Gold&#x27;s \\&quot;Wicked\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Contains many of the same ingredients in more expensive anti-aging, firming body lotions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li> Finally, something that does exactly what it</li>
            <li> and it was the exact same!!!  </li>
            <li> My only thing is I don&#x27;t care for strawberry scents and this one is pretty noticeable</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive or allergic to wheat, avoid this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who turned in assignments in school with blood on them because my knuckles would crack open due to allergy to many lotions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strong at first, but definitely yummy</li>
            <li> Used to be a hardcore tanner and this was my go to after moisturizer, then last October I found out I was pregnant with my second child and giving up tanning for another nine months(my second pregnancy in 2 years) now with my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong but it diminishes after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> also really like that a little goes a long way, and it comes in a nice big (22 oz.)</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis, a severe case and can only use certain things on my skin.</li>
            <li> While the smell is less than desirable, the lotion itself makes it all worth it!</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin soft, and holds on to your tan longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> oh so soft</li>
            <li> As far as if it made me darker, I can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> It also smells like something a 13 year old girl would wear.  </li>
            <li> As far as skin firming, I literally just started using this product 2 days ago, so it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> IT JUST MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SOOOOO SOFT.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after having just used it.</li>
            <li> So far has also been keeping my tan going well.</li>
            <li> I really like all Australian gold products</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt this soft even when I wasn&#x27;t tanning.</li>
            <li> Skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I also know this because I got a bottle for my 20yr old daughter</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t a 13 year old girl I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> And to me it smells like a soft bubble gum.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile back and really like it...</li>
            <li> bottle vs. the same price I&#x27;ve paid for much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I like the product as far as it&#x27;s ability to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li> leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> The package also says to go to color.australiangold.com, which does not exist and leads me to believe that this product might be rather old.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail fast only 5 days from when I placed my order.</li>
            <li> But as far as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> After tanning and showering, KISSES makes your skin feel so soft and hydrated again.  </li>
            <li> The consistancy is perfect, its thick enough to give skin the moisture it needs while tanning but not too thick and greesy.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re tired of smelling like coconut when going tanning, this is a nice change of pace.</li>
            <li> It was a mess to clean up and try to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice thick consistency, but still goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it as a daily lotion.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday and the price is great ill be buying this from you again very soon ...</li>
            <li> For as thick as this stuff is I expected it to be more moisturizing!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really get such a large lotion with a pump with other after tanning moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to get what I ordered, but the people were very prompt when I e-mailed them about it.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my hands when they are dry in the winter and from all of the time that I spend in the water and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It lasts a pretty long while, the only issue I had was that sometimes it would &#x27;stick&#x27; and you couldn&#x27;t unlock it.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling extra soft!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Thick and super moisturizing!</li>
            <li> But, with this moisturizer, my skin is so soft and it even has kinda a different look of my skin as well.</li>
            <li> I have only used this lotion a couple of days, but so far I like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell though, it doesn&#x27;t mesh well with my natural scent.</li>
            <li> I definitely can tell a difference in the firmness of my skin from the anti-aging ingredient, although I am still young.</li>
            <li> The bottles lasted only slighter longer than my normal bottles of lotion, so I&#x27;m not sure the price is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend likes the smell a lot he said it reminds him of some kind of silly putty kids play with.  </li>
            <li> Again the smell is crazy good.  </li>
            <li> and I plan on purchasing the same item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li> It does have an odd smell at first</li>
            <li> but I had higher expectations based on the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> very hydrating after a tan or any other time.</li>
            <li> Not a single stretch mark, not an ounce of cellulite , not on my belly,not on my legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived earlier than expected, packaged very well, and no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Only issue I had was when it was sent to me, the top plastic pump was completely broken off and leaking lotion all over.</li>
            <li> I get weird bumps on my chest from time to time and they&#x27;ve completely disappeared for the most part with this and my legs are smoother than they have ever been.  </li>
            <li> The lotion smells good and seems thick, but after I apply it my skin was still dry and cracked after it dried.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to get very dry skin from tanning and my normal lotion wasn&#x27;t helping,</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s way too sticky, so you can&#x27;t really put it on before you go out because you&#x27;ll get negative attention, and you can&#x27;t really put it on before bed because your husband or SO will complain about the stench, and you will feel sticky and gross trying to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and work in one as well so</li>
            <li> It is very silky feeling and the longer it is used the less that is needed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic change in my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It claims to have green bergamot, melon fruit, and lavender scents, but once you put it on your skin, its a very subtle and soft scent, kind of smells like cucumber melon to me.  </li>
            <li> worked okay, but was a little on the thick side,</li>
            <li> One I have had this on for awhile no bad post sweet smell or anything bad at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited getting this for $15 less!!!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my old, DARK.</li>
            <li> Not just for keeping your tan, it really does help firm your skin (noticeably!)</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past, but never read into it that much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice if it helps keep my tan going</li>
            <li> so it lasts a really long time, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> how long this will last (;</li>
            <li> cuz I&#x27;m gonna have to smell like this for such a long time.</li>
            <li> pretty thick</li>
            <li> The consistency of the lotion is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> and it seems to last all day long!</li>
            <li> The bottle is so big, you buy one and it lasts all year long!</li>
            <li> I have recently gained some weight due to medical problems</li>
            <li> After cleaning up the mess, I just used one of my old plastic tops from an empty bottle which worked out well enough.</li>
            <li> It really is a Kiss to some 50 year old skin that works out hard everyday.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that will keep your skin firm and soft (and hold your tan)</li>
            <li> will help you keep your Tan for a really long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> lasts a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> this bottle was way bigger than i expected.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time on my skin and continue to smell it all day too.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy, really hydrates the skin after tanning.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I ran out of my other hemp based lotion by Australian Gold.</li>
            <li> It lasts you a long time too!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, however the pump was broken!!</li>
            <li> I got a sunburn in the tanning bed last week and still haven&#x27;t peeled due to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Other Australian Gold products have always been a hit with me...</li>
            <li> and I am the darkest I have been in a very long time.</li>
            <li> I use it in the winter even when I am not tanning for really dry akin.</li>
            <li> like I do if i&#x27;m dry after tanning.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one for my daughter who has dry skin</li>
            <li> No longer is my skin so dry and used to</li>
            <li> at times my skin would get so dry that it would tend to flake some.</li>
            <li> seriously, who beyond the age of 12 wants to smell like chemical strawberries?</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I use after a shower and let it dry.</li>
            <li> After a week I am softer but still dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or thick feeling after, and that&#x27;s the main reason I will continue to by this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious if the odd smell was due to product being old?</li>
            <li> Bonus: Big bottle of lotion for less $ compared to other brands in a tiny jar that just do not do what they claim.  </li>
            <li> my skin usually doesnt get passed a certain point, but with this stuff i got SOOOO dark!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty thin</li>
            <li> You never feel dry and itchy after tanning when you use this lotion!</li>
            <li> After All Day Moisturizer after I tan with Millenium Tanning Solid Black Bronzer.</li>
            <li> It is sold at various tanning salon&#x27;s, but at Amazon it is about half price from salon prices.  </li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> The lotion is a thick lotion and replenishes the dryness that the tanning bed can cause, however the results do not last long and you have to constantly reapply.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and it is so much less expensive then anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on my face because its non greasy and makes my skin incredibly soft compared to other brands I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> This seems to have a little extra oil in it</li>
            <li> when I wake up in the morning there is little if any sunburn left.  </li>
            <li> so im not too sure why others have given bad feedback on the scent.</li>
            <li> It is heavy enough to keep skin moisturized but is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Item was promptly shipped and as expected.</li>
            <li> The fragrance wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but the product does what it needs to.</li>
            <li> I usually only use a few pumps per use.</li>
            <li> Ingredients in this lotion contain Vitamins A,C, &amp; E. Shea Butter, Hemp Seed Oil, &amp; a few different Root, Sprout, &amp; Seed Extracts.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not my cup</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> Other than that it does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> It has a candy odor and not as moisturizing as other Austrailian products.</li>
            <li> Not really sure it firms a lot, but my tan does seem to last longer...</li>
            <li> I mean I may as well go get the playboy seat covers for my car and fuzzy pink steering wheel cover and long neon pink acrylic nails while I&#x27;m at it.</li>
            <li> BUT at least it came 2 days earlier then it said.</li>
            <li> This does do the job but the smell is not your average.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good scent to cover up that nasty after tan smell.</li>
            <li> The pump was taped down and lotion had squirted all over the pump.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be let down.</li>
            <li> The man who sits on the other side said it smells like the carpet smelled in his college frat house!</li>
            <li> I was going every other day and this lasted a while!  </li>
            <li> also I was slightly burnt and it made my skin tingle</li>
            <li> it Black</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a couple months and am not even half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> My current salon would order for me but they are charging a ridiculous price plus shipping and tax.  </li>
            <li> When I first smelled this in the botttle, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without leaving greasy mess.</li>
            <li> my daughter says this stuff rocks, it smells a little like beer</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little pricy</li>
            <li> It was crazy how fast I got so dark, I would recomend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Took a few days to get</li>
            <li> I use this everyday after a shower.</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using firming, anti-aging formula body lotions for a few years.</li>
            <li> Only thing is when I received it the pump on the bottle was broken</li>
            <li> I am using it everyday after shower.</li>
            <li> Some people hate the smell, i personally enjoy it.</li>
            <li> use  this product everyday .  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday after i shower.</li>
            <li> have excema and am postpartum, it helps firm my skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tone or firm.</li>
            <li> I was badly burned at a tanning salon, so I bought this lotion right away and started using it two-three times a day and after two weeks I still have not peeled from the sunburn.</li>
            <li> It arrived early but was packaged very poorly.</li>
            <li> all day long, people complained about a gross stale beer smell.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, not too thin, but still goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The lotion is not too bad as far as moisturizing, however the scent is not very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> Certain laundry detergents make me break out, they aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> this product is a little thick, it will leave patches if you do not watch out.</li>
            <li> I love what this does for my skin, but I hate the smell!!!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> and I could smell the gross stale beer stench when she was putting it on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Sadly they stopped making this lotion in 2014, and sometime recently this seller ran out.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I like the fragarance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that one is by Autralian Gold or not.</li>
            <li> Don’t get me wrong, I like the way it smells, but it definitely has that “tanning lotion” smell.</li>
            <li> (another PLUS).You don&#x27;t want to waste it!</li>
            <li> in the past, but never saw this Moisturizer until I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I was never able to get a tan let alone keep one.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my skin was getting rreally dry due to tanning and crazy Mid-Atlantic weather.</li>
            <li> It seems a little thick, and sometimes it can be tough to rub it in.</li>
            <li> far as someone having a bad skin reaction to it, this does not happen to everyone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find anything negative to say about product.</li>
            <li> you remove the negative feedback we will also refund the shipping</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, not too thick or thin.</li>
            <li> it kinda smells like cucumbers but not really, all tanning lotions will have kinda a weird smell</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion before but had difficulties finding it lately in tanning salons.  </li>
            <li> Tangelic was almost too thick and greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It also is thick not runny like some lotions</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t absorb well (too thick which some may prefer) and smelled off.</li>
            <li> Please, please make an unscented moisturizer because aside from the heavy scent your product rocks!!</li>
            <li> waste of money !!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Good customer service would accept there failure and refund the shipping</li>
            <li> This has a horrible sickly sweet fruity smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion might smell a little weird (husband swears it&#x27;s strawberries, I&#x27;m not convinced), but it works.</li>
            <li> While the smell of Body Kisses isn&#x27;t Horrible, it definitely has a strange smell to it.</li>
            <li> smell?!\\&quot; in a NEGATIVE way!</li>
            <li> Anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried this moisturizer should definitely give it a chance, they won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick lotion, is probably why it&#x27;s clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this lotion, it&#x27;s very thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, a quality that I like</li>
            <li> However, it is very thick and tends to make me feel clammy and sticky</li>
            <li> Made my burnt hurt 10x worse.</li>
            <li> It is a sweet-almost like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotion-kind of smell.</li>
            <li> this just makes my opinion of them worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on every night after my shower because when the weather begins to get cold</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 that I could visibly see improvement while using, but they&#x27;re expensive.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> would put it under the sink, but the bottle shape and texture make it oddly difficult to pick up with one hand</li>
            <li> and it was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> She said she didn&#x27;t think it was fake of altered in any way.  </li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad they have discontinued it</li>
            <li> Headshop\\&quot; or a \\&quot;Drunk Strawberry\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> my neighbor had a cold sore</li>
            <li> Too bad the price keeps going up.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> The woman who sits 10 feet away from me moaned and groaned all day, saying the smell was making her sick.</li>
            <li> the smell I hate, the feel of the lotion is bad.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Which I hated.</li>
            <li> However it has a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> But the smell is horrible</li>
            <li> I had to return it, which proved to also be a terrible process.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the way it moisturizes but I am not big on the smell. I wish that they would make an unscented version.</li>
            <li> This definitely does the job, makes your tan last longer, if applied after tanning and after any showers or baths. It makes me feel very soft, you do feel warm for a minute after you put it on and  before you get darker, but I am a guy, kisses kinda smells like banana taffy, balanced out with bronzer, cologne and deodorant, it&#x27;s not bad, but I also prefer Ever After tan extender, which has an awesome vanilla scent, I noticed kisses makes me look more red, which me being Italian is better than tan Olive. Ever after lotion makes me a more brown/tan color, also found that I love the designer skin angel brand tan extender the most, it has a more silky feeling, out of the three I definitely choose designer skin angel, smells like fresh ripe pears, I would give kisses five stars, but it&#x27;s not priced so good lately and there is better out there than kisses...Ever After or Angel</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is thick and creamy, really hydrates the skin after tanning. I use it just out of the shower. It keeps your skin soft, and holds on to your tan longer.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant, however, the only thing that would make this product even better would be a more tropical fragrance, such as coconut added.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I ran out of my other hemp based lotion by Australian Gold. I love the smell but it will not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this makes my skin feel. The smell is also great. It&#x27;s a very sweet smell so some people may think it&#x27;s a bit much.</li>
            <li> my daughter says this stuff rocks, it smells a little like beer so if you dont like that scent then steer away but it does its job for sure</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two weeks and I am the darkest I have been in a very long time. It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Oh my god this stuff smells so GOOD!! It leaves your skin so smooth and moisturized. The price is amazing and it was worth it. It lasts you a long time too! I&#x27;ll use this when i get out of the shower and it does help your prolong your tan.</li>
            <li> Smooth and wonderful smelling.  I absolutely love this lotion.  Prefer it to any over the counter lotion anytime. Goes on your body easily and smells like you just put on perfume. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I live this lotion and the smell is heavenly.  It is heavy enough to keep skin moisturized but is not greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, it feels very nice, but the smell lingers a l o n g time....I love to smell good, but even for me this is a bit extreme.</li>
            <li> The lotion is a thick lotion and replenishes the dryness that the tanning bed can cause, however the results do not last long and you have to constantly reapply. The smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant; my boyfriend wont come close to me if im wearing it if that gives you any idea how strong it is. I probably won&#x27;t buy anymore of this.</li>
            <li> While the smell isn&#x27;t something I would use as a perfume, it also isn&#x27;t something that should stop you from buying this.  There is a smell to this, but it is NOT unpleasant to me.  Let&#x27;s be honest, smell is a very subjective thing and some are more sensitive to it than others.  I do feel the the moisturizing action lasts most of the day.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t necessarily feel that it&#x27;s that much different than a moisturizing lotion, but I bought into the hype of it being specifically for after tanning and prolonging a tan and that is important to me.  Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that the whole family can use, save your money and try some others from Target, but if you are buying this for a speacial treat... treat yourself, I think you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> I read all the rave review on here and thought this was the lotion I have been looking for. I am really quite new at tanning and I don&#x27;t do any of that indoor tanning bed stuff. I am a natual tanner all the way, with the real sun and everything. After buying the product and recieving it of coarse, I&#x27;ve laid out (tanning) I&#x27;d say three to four times, not getting much of a tan yet. I have used the lotion after each tanning (after a shower.) It has a strong smell, (kind of like candy) but it doesn&#x27;t stay strong after a few minutes of wearing it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day though like some have said, but I do have dry skin most of the time. It really doesn&#x27;t seem much better than a regular lotion you could buy for 3 or 4 dollars instead of the $20.00 (don&#x27;t forget the shipping cost)for these tanning lotions. I guess I don&#x27;t really know what I expected, maybe a miracle lotion that left my tan looking wonderful for weeks...or something like that. This is not that lotion. I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again because of the price. Now let the price down to $4.00 and I will buy it all day long because it is a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great, I use it every day when I get out of the shower. It seems a little thick, and sometimes it can be tough to rub it in. A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Australian Gold lotions, all thier products leave you oh so soft and they always nail a super great scent. This is one sweet and delicious, for when I really want to be soft and smell extra girly. It certainly does make my man want to give me body kisses too! Perfect product name!</li>
            <li> At first I loved this lotion but then I realized it was making the eczema on my hands flare up and it was also making my chest/shoulders/&amp; back break out in pimples/blackheads. It&#x27;s a very thick lotion, is probably why it&#x27;s clogging my pores. If you have very dry skin then it would probably work for you. Also it smells like fermented fruit...</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I was beginning to get very dry skin from tanning and my normal lotion wasn&#x27;t helping, so I figured I&#x27;d try this. When I first smelled this in the botttle, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the fragrance. It claims to have green bergamot, melon fruit, and lavender scents, but once you put it on your skin, its a very subtle and soft scent, kind of smells like cucumber melon to me.  I definitly noticed a huge diffrence in my tan lasting way longer and my skin is back to being so smooth and soft!  (Once a day application didn&#x27;t seem to do the trick, but putting it on twice a day makes the diffrence!)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, the smell in the bottle was a little strange to me, but on it smells great, and the smell lasts all day.  I had co workers wonder what I had on because they liked the smell too.  I would tell people to buy this and buy it again myself.</li>
            <li> I have never used an after tan lotion before, until this stuff, and now I dont know how i went without it! my skin usually doesnt get passed a certain point, but with this stuff i got SOOOO dark! It was crazy how fast I got so dark, I would recomend this to everyone! It smells great too. I take it in the tanning salon with me and apply it immediatly after I get out of the bed, I also use the Eternal Youth tanning lotion and that really helped get my great color too, This after tan lotion keeps your tan for sooo long! buy it! It will be worth the money! :)</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this lotion with something I purchased from my tanning salon. It smelled so good when I put it on and it made my skin feel good too. So of course, I ordered a bottle. As far as if it made me darker, I can&#x27;t tell. I&#x27;m getting darker, but I do use the Designer Skin 14KT Gold tanning lotion, so I don&#x27;t know if it has anything to do with this lotion or if it&#x27;s because of the 14KT Gold or just the combination. So, my suggestion is to get them both and see how you like them. I hope this helps with your decision.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells absolutely amazing. I use it in the winter even when I am not tanning for really dry akin.</li>
            <li> It came immediatly. I live this company.  I love this product I&#x27;ve bought 5 bottles so far. I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Love this product for after tanning!!! The best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used for after tanning, nice light scent too!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It smells so good and really does make your skin feel soft and smooth.  It seems to do exactly what it says to do and it is an amazing price!  The bottle is huge and it is so much less expensive then anywhere else.  The order was shipped quickly and came shortly after I ordered it.  It rubs in nicely and leaves my skin smelling great!</li>
            <li> Great deal.  Smells Amazing.  My skin feels so soft.  Soothes after tan.  I can&#x27;t find anything negative to say about product.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing and the price is great!! I put this on after I tan and it definitely moisturizes me!</li>
            <li> I love what this does for my skin, but I hate the smell!!! Maybe it&#x27;s my body chemistry, but the scent is sickeningly sweet on me.  It also smells like something a 13 year old girl would wear.  I&#x27;ve  used the vanilla version and it also has a strong scent, but doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.  Please, please make an unscented moisturizer because aside from the heavy scent your product rocks!!</li>
            <li> Just bought this recently from my tanning salon. I dont know if it really has the ability to pro-long a tan more than other regular lotion, but I do like it a lot. The lotion itself smells awesome so im not too sure why others have given bad feedback on the scent. The consistancy is perfect, its thick enough to give skin the moisture it needs while tanning but not too thick and greesy. I also love the idea that it comes in a pump bottle! So overall, even if you dont go tanning id still reccomend this as a daily lotion because its nice :)</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion ever, it smells amazing and a bottle lasts a good while.  Definitely a great price too, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great after tanning lotion that smells great, makes your skin feel amazing and comes in a cute bottle then give this a try. You won&#x27;t regret. I love it and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion is pretty strong, and lingers a long time.</li>
            <li> Very good product. The size is very worth the price. The scent is strong so I wouldn&#x27;t wear it out, I just put it on at night.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion ok, but probably would not order it again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion ever! SO upset that it got discontinued :( smells great, leaves skin silky smooth, non greasy/oily. I have dry-ish skin and I used this after tanning and it kept my skin nice and supple all winter long.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday. ..it&#x27;s really thick but Absorbs fast and smells good</li>
            <li> Smells great! I absolutely love this lotion! I use it after every shower, and the forever after is used after tanning. I love both of them!</li>
            <li> I guess this works. However it has a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great but when it arrived the bottle had leaked within the plastic wrap. It was a mess to clean up and try to use.</li>
            <li> i purchased this from one of indiana&#x27;s local tanning salons &amp;i love it the smell is awesome&amp;whatever it has in it.if you also have a cut or something like that it heals it up as well so this product can be used for after tanning of course or even to heal cuts&amp;even my neighbor had a cold sore i put a lil in his hand he put it on that&amp;it was gone in 1day so perfect for lots of stuff.main thing i love the smell&amp;how shining it leaves my skin&#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I like the product for sure..........what I don&#x27;t like is when I originally ordered it it was 13 dollars and some cents but never received the order so I had to reorder and all of a sudden it was 19 dollars plus........what the hell?  I don&#x27;t know about you , but doesn&#x27;t sound right to me..................</li>
            <li> I just bought this from my salon, and I absolutely love the smell! It feels great as well, and smooths on easily. I&#x27;ve been using Tangelic after tanning lotion by designer skin, and am really glad I switched. Tangelic was almost too thick and greasy feeling. I don&#x27;t really think that this lotion smells like &#x27;fresh rain&#x27;, more like a sweet candy smell. As far as skin firming, I literally just started using this product 2 days ago, so it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> Totally love this stuff! Smells great &amp; great price. fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to get what I ordered, but the people were very prompt when I e-mailed them about it.</li>
            <li> Love this! Too bad the price keeps going up.</li>
            <li> Today I just received my bottle of Australian Gold Body Kisses Daily Moisturizer 22 oz.  Took a few days to get BUT at least it came 2 days earlier then it said. When I first tried it, it came in samples when I bought Australian Gold&#x27;s \\&quot;Wicked\\&quot;. As soon as I tried the samples I knew I had to buy it. Oh man, this stuff smells AMAZING! And it makes your skin nice and smooth. Everyone feels/sees/tastes/smells and so on things differently.  Some people say they didn&#x27;t like the smell of this. &#x60;I&#x27; however loved it and would totally recommend it to anyone who tans and are looking for a good after tanning moisturizer.  It&#x27;s got a good fruity smell to it, but it&#x27;s not over powering.  You&#x27;re not gonna walk somewhere and have people walk by you covering their shirts over their face. Trust me, this stuff is awesome! But I&#x27;m always looking to try different stuff. Maybe next I&#x27;ll try Australian Gold&#x27;s \\&quot;Forever after\\&quot;? Or Designer skins \\&quot;Angel\\&quot;?  All I know is this stuff rocks! d(^_^)b</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful. Not just for after tanning . Great scent silky feel  not waxy feeling  I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> arrived within 3-4 days of ordering. this is my favorite lotion ever! not even exaggerating! i use to work at a tanning salon and they sold it for awhile, but then it seemed like i couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere?! it smells great! its not greasy or anything, great moisturizer, after extended use it really does make your legs look firmer. &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 not to mention great price! cheaper than buying it local.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the low price and effortlessness of an online purchase.  Everyone knows salons sell all these types of lotions for over 100% profit.  Therefor people cannot even afford to try these out.. but if you buy them online its almost always worth a shot I feel.  Anyhow the lotion hydrates my skin wonderfully.  The smell is reminiscent of laughy taffy or some kind of girly cocktail.  One I have had this on for awhile no bad post sweet smell or anything bad at all.  My boyfriend likes the smell a lot he said it reminds him of some kind of silly putty kids play with.  anyway lol....  I think this stuff helped my skin look more healthy and brown rather than turn red like I do if i&#x27;m dry after tanning.  I would say definitely try it.</li>
            <li> This smells sooo good and def. enhances your tan. I use it right out the tanning bed and it really firms your skin as well. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months and my skin looks amazing! The price is great and delivery is very fast. I saved over over 50% on this considering what my salon is charging.. 25$!! If you buy this.. you&#x27;ll look great, smell great and your tan will last (point blank)</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my daughter who has dry skin and she loves it not only does it moisturize without leaving a greasy feeling it really help retain her beautiful Suntan.  It also smells very nice, she loves it.  I use the Forever After and it is equally good and smells nice also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynette in Wisconsin</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It is cheaper to buy at amazon then in a tanning salon. It smells great &amp; works better to keep your color nice, you smelling good, and kiss able soft skin.</li>
            <li> This stiff is AMAZING! Makes my skin super soft and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Lotion is very nice and smoothing..husband and I apply this after each tanning sesssion and keeps our skin from becoming dry...would defintely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years and I love it. The smell is amazing and my husband says my skin is always so soft.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with this moisturizer. Smells great and makes my skin sooo soft. Plus reasonably priced. I use this everyday after a shower.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency and the smell ! It makes me feel like I have been at the beach - would definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li> arrived earlier than promised and love the product</li>
            <li> At first I loved the smell, it was sweet and had a tint of candy to it. But then everywhere I went people were like \\&quot;What is that smell?!\\&quot; in a NEGATIVE way! Someone thought it was Natural Light beer smell and all sorts of other less than delicious smell. It did a great job moisturizing, but I threw it out after I realized it was overpowering and receiving negative attention...</li>
            <li> this is good lotion but is really sweet smelling. It is a really good moisturizing lotion to use daily. good</li>
            <li> The smoothness of this lotion is wonderful.  I love the way it feels on my skin.  The smell is a bit strong but it diminishes after a few minutes. The packaging was great.  I gave my daughter my second bottle because these bottles are huge.  The price was great for so much lotion.</li>
            <li> IT JUST MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SOOOOO SOFT. A++++ A++++ A++++ WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND ITTO ANYONE.LIKE THE HEADING SAID AWESOME.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, is pretty thick so you don&#x27;t need a lot, absorbs wonderfully (no oily film residue) and does a great job with extending my tan life.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion very moisturizing awesome smell. Leaves your skin feeling silky and smooth! You never feel dry and itchy after tanning when you use this lotion! I would definitely buy it again!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion i use it every time i tan and take a shower. it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Bought this when I was out in the sun. worked okay, but was a little on the thick side, have some left</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad but it is strange.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to go to work with. it smells like some sort of dessert.  Other then that i would give a five star rating. it absorbs fast and isn&#x27;t grease but leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing product I have found for anyone who tans. Im 37, my daughter is 12. Im very fair she looks Italian. It&#x27;s GREAT for both of us. The smell is FAB!!! It moisturizes without leaving greasy mess. I use this daily even when Im not tanning.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new moisturizers to try. I came across Australian Gold Body Kisses Daily Moisturizer with Hemp and honestly I didn&#x27;t think at first that I would like it. But, as soon as I got out of the tanning bed and I put this new lotion on, I loved it. My skin felt instantly softer. After several uses of it now, I can tell a huge difference in my skin. No longer is my skin so dry and used to at times my skin would get so dry that it would tend to flake some. Which I hated. But, with this moisturizer, my skin is so soft and it even has kinda a different look of my skin as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. It works great and I plan on purchasing the same item again in the very near future. As, I love everything about it, even the smell of the lotion is great. Not only do I use this lotion after I tan, but I use it several times a day, especially after I take a shower, it&#x27;s the first thing I put on. Anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried this moisturizer should definitely give it a chance, they won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very large of very good smelling lotion..nice to put on after being in the sun..Great price..i love it and would buy it again!</li>
            <li> seriously, who beyond the age of 12 wants to smell like chemical strawberries? the cream itself is good, but oh the stench... had to leave it in my work bathroom for people to use as handlotion. yuk.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this lotion. It has been my favorite for years. Only issue I had was when it was sent to me, the top plastic pump was completely broken off and leaking lotion all over. After cleaning up the mess, I just used one of my old plastic tops from an empty bottle which worked out well enough.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it works great for my sensitive screen... I do not break out with use, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer everyday. I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel. When I first bought this moisturizer I bought 2 bottles sense then I have ordered 4 more. My salon sells this for $24.00. So for this price I get two.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It smells so good and makes my skin feel so soft. I usually put it on every night after my shower because when the weather begins to get cold I have dry skin so I&#x27;m hoping that this lotion will help to prevent it. It&#x27;s also a great size for the price and will last me a while.</li>
            <li> This was bought for my daughter while she lived outside the house.  I will no longer be buying it for her but it was a great product</li>
            <li> I just received this today, and have only used it once. The smell is...different. I personally love it, but can understand why some people might not. My skin feels soft after having just used it. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, because I don&#x27;t yet know how the firming aspect is as I&#x27;ve only used it once. Even if it isn&#x27;t as firming as it claims, I still think I&#x27;ll buy this moisturizer again. Great price, too!</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion that smells so great and leaves your skin feeling so soft!! The scent is like a sweet cinnamon smell! A must if you tan! I don&#x27;t tan anymore but I use this now as a daily lotion! For the size of the bottle and the price you just cant beat it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using firming, anti-aging formula body lotions for a few years. I usually buy ones that have received an award in Allure or Good Housekeeping. I&#x27;ve tried 2 that I could visibly see improvement while using, but they&#x27;re expensive. I looked at their main ingredients and then started comparing to lower priced lotions. The Australian Gold Body Kisses Daily Moisturizer with Hemp Seed Extract contains most of the same ingredients that the other 2 lotions I liked had, so I gave it a try. I think it works better than the more expensive lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Contains many of the same ingredients in more expensive anti-aging, firming body lotions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works better than the 2 other more expensive anti-aging, firming body lotions that I tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (These are picky):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle draws attention from anyone who uses my bathroom, \\&quot;What&#x27;s that lotion you have in there with the lips all over it?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would put it under the sink, but the bottle shape and texture make it oddly difficult to pick up with one hand - I&#x27;ve never had a problem with that before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fruity smell that&#x27;s not unpleasant, but I wouldn&#x27;t normally choose to smell like a strawberry shortcake for an hour after my shower! My husband thinks it smells like a fruity beer. It wears off quick enough, though.</li>
            <li> The bottle is HUGE! This lotion smells good. The scent lasts awhile, but isn&#x27;t overpowering. It&#x27;s a good value - you can&#x27;t really get such a large lotion with a pump with other after tanning moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion and is great for lathering up after a good tanning session.. I RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> Bottle wrapping cosistanatly arrives opened. I wonder if I&#x27;m getting the actual product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible but this is hands down the best lotion I have EVER used.  I get weird bumps on my chest from time to time and they&#x27;ve completely disappeared for the most part with this and my legs are smoother than they have ever been.  LOVE IT!  Will definitely repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> Overwhelming smell! It doesn&#x27;t even feel good on my skin and it smells like rotten beer :/ also I was slightly burnt and it made my skin tingle and it was uncomfortable. Made my burnt hurt 10x worse. I would rather use my Hemp lotion.</li>
            <li> the smell I hate, the feel of the lotion is bad. waste of money !! used twice put it in the trash!!</li>
            <li> Was a great value as this bottle is huge! Great smell and moisturizes really well.  So far has also been keeping my tan going well.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, however the pump was broken!! Have used it before, smells great! I really like all Australian gold products</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Simple as that. If you want lotion that doesn&#x27;t feel way greasy but gets the job done then stick with this. Trust me.</li>
            <li> I bought this cause I wanted to try something different.  It is a thicker lotion and a nice big bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy and has a pleasant smell.  I have only used this lotion a couple of days, but so far I like it and it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of lotions to keep my skin moisturized after using a tanning bed and this is by far my favorite! My skin has never felt this soft even when I wasn&#x27;t tanning. If you are looking for something that will keep your skin firm and soft (and hold your tan) then this is a great product for the price. I&#x27;m glad my friend recommended it to me :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion! Only thing is when I received it the pump on the bottle was broken</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product. It leaves my old, DARK. Skin feeling soft. It lasts all day. I have another bottle on the way as I comment.</li>
            <li> The lotion is not too bad as far as moisturizing, however the scent is not very good.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this particular product again. Delivery and service were great!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and I like the melon smell and the thicker texture which gives me longer lasting on my skin. I am using it everyday after shower. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of this. But I gave it to my sister and she liked it alot.</li>
            <li> Not only is this bottle WAY bigger than I was expecting, but it smells fabulous and leaves you so soft immediately its incredible. I know I wont go without this again! Thanks.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.  It is like 3 time more expensive locally.  She said she didn&#x27;t think it was fake of altered in any way.  This is what the local place said would happen to it if you didn&#x27;t buy it from an authorized retailer.  Glad I ignored them.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for 8 years and paid $37 for each bottle and a friend told me about it on amazon so now I order from here for way cheaper than the tanning salons charge. I absolutely love this lotion and the smell I use it all year round even when I&#x27;m not tanning</li>
            <li> I enjoy this scent and I am impressed by the moisture that this lotion provides.  I also use it on my hands when they are dry in the winter and from all of the time that I spend in the water and it works very well.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite after tanning lotion that I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after every time I tan (inside and outside) and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful and keeps my skin super hydrated!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. As a lotion addict this is by far the best I have ever used. I loved how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I feel it really helps keep my tan. I spray tan and do the regular tanning bed and feel it helps with both along with keeping my skin smooth. It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and use it several times a day.  I live in a very dry climate and work in one as well so moisturizing is important and this works very well!</li>
            <li> This product works great and does just as it states perfect for after the sun and day to day usage as well. Thanks</li>
            <li> I liked the smell ok at first. I started using it on a weekend. My boyfriend said it smelled gross but I didn&#x27;t listen to him. I used it on Monday morning before going to the office and everywhere I went, all day long, people complained about a gross stale beer smell. I WAS SO EMBARRASSED!! The woman who sits 10 feet away from me moaned and groaned all day, saying the smell was making her sick. The man who sits on the other side said it smells like the carpet smelled in his college frat house! I wanted to crawl under a rock! This lotion works ok, smells ok up close, but to others it stinks. I also know this because I got a bottle for my 20yr old daughter and I could smell the gross stale beer stench when she was putting it on. I would give it zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It is not greasy and goes on smoothly. I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> It does an amazing job making my tan look darker and my legs look smoother. It moisturizes ALL DAY! The scent is wonderful! It is a sweet-almost like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotion-kind of smell. It is very thick and takes a while for my skin to absorb it, but it works very well and smells great!</li>
            <li> Very thick. Don&#x27;t care much for the smell but seems to moisturize well. Used after sun exposure and after shower.</li>
            <li> I live about 10 minutes from my tanning salon, so as soon as I get home I put this on. It smells AMAZING and leaves my skin super soft. I can&#x27;t say much about whether it helps my tan last longer because I go tan everyday but my tan continues to get darker and this keeps my skin hydrated and fresh!</li>
            <li> This has a great smell and works great I tan all year and this helps so much your skin fills great... I order it all the time.</li>
            <li> Smells, ok.  Very moisturizing for the skin.  The bottle is HUGE and will probably last me all winter.  I may bring it to work.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my skin was getting rreally dry due to tanning and crazy Mid-Atlantic weather. This is the richest body lotion I&#x27;ve ever owned. My skin feels better instantly and feels moisturized hours after applying. I don&#x27;t even wear perfume because the scent is very nice.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this lotion, it&#x27;s very thick and creamy.  It keeps my skin smooth and hydrated after tanning without an oily feeling.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell though, it doesn&#x27;t mesh well with my natural scent.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I tan a lot there for I have to keep my body moisturized so I can keep my tan and this lotion is amazing. Kisses also smells great. It also is thick not runny like some lotions</li>
            <li> After a month of waiting for my lotion I filed a claim for a refund. I got a response from Rays bribing me to leave positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;if you remove the negative feedback we will also refund the shipping charges.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good customer service would accept there failure and refund the shipping this just makes my opinion of them worse. I understand they had issues with there building but thats not my fault so why keep my shipping?</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the feel of this.  Last time I had ANGEL with Hemp seed by the same company.  This seems to have a little extra oil in it and I love it.  It really is a Kiss to some 50 year old skin that works out hard everyday.  I would recommend this product to anyone any day of the week...  Great company selling it too...</li>
            <li> Excellent quality!  By far, one of the best moisturizers around!  The scent was slightly overwhelming, but only at first because it mellows out quickly once applied to the skin.  In fact, the scent sort of grew on me, and I actually think it&#x27;s quite nice!  I highly recommend this product, and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but my boyfriend absolutely hates the smell. It smells like cotton candy or something else really, really sweet. But it feels great going on and moisturizes all day. Would not suggest if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. Some people hate the smell, i personally enjoy it. It doesnt seem overpowering when you actually put it on. And my legs have never felt so soft after my shower!! It arrived early but was packaged very poorly. The pump was taped down and lotion had squirted all over the pump.</li>
            <li> It works really well with keeping my skin hydrated and smooth not to mention the fragrance is very nice and not overbearing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 10 years now. I first started using it for after tanning, but it is great for daily use. It smells like strawberry candy in the bottle but has a weirdly different smell on the skin. My fiance won&#x27;t let me wear anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Sadly they stopped making this lotion in 2014, and sometime recently this seller ran out. BUT there is a lotion that is pretty much the exact same in smell and also has hemp extract in it: it&#x27;s called Hemp lotion. The original scent is nearly identical. They have a lot of variations of it which I haven&#x27;t tried. Some sound like they would smell great, but I wanted to replace the sweet kisses with something identical.</li>
            <li> The product was a nice moisturizer but I didn&#x27;t care for the scent.  I never finished using it, gave it to a friend.  Change the scent and I&#x27;d buy it again, otherwise, I prefer to look for another product.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leave skin smooth and hydrate all day !  I will purchase again and again this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion, smells great, works great</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion! Smells, great and is very moisturizing but not greasy. :)</li>
            <li> Love how it moisturizes your skin. Not sure how I like the fragarance. I have used another kind of hemp moisturizer. I think it was a tropical scent. Loved that too.  I&#x27;m not sure if that one is by Autralian Gold or not.</li>
            <li> smells good and feels good.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> Item was promptly shipped and as expected. However I had difficulty with the pump dispenser, but it&#x27;s not something that would deter me from ordering again.</li>
            <li> This has the same scent as Hempz lotion if you&#x27;ve ever used that. It&#x27;s light and not obnoxious. It does a great job of moisturizing and I feel like my skin is already tighter having only used it for about 2 weeks. I was badly burned at a tanning salon, so I bought this lotion right away and started using it two-three times a day and after two weeks I still have not peeled from the sunburn. Which to me is a miracle. I&#x27;m very happy with this lotion and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I love it! I use this and  Forever  After All Day Moisturizer after I tan with Millenium Tanning Solid Black Bronzer. The 3 work perfect together!</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; smells wonderful</li>
            <li> love it  use  this product everyday .  has a great smell . will be getting more soon and the price is good ....</li>
            <li> I just got it in today but I&#x27;m amazed at how it instantly makes my skin silky smooth!! I have recently gained some weight due to medical problems so I&#x27;m hoping it will help me get my beautiful, youthful skin back to what it should be. This is definitely a MUST HAVE!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It smells great and moisturizes great. Also this lotion smells the same no matter who puts it on and no matter when you put it on</li>
            <li> Used to be a hardcore tanner and this was my go to after moisturizer, then last October I found out I was pregnant with my second child and giving up tanning for another nine months(my second pregnancy in 2 years) now with my first pregnancy I used coco butter as recommended by everyone, and it worked ok, minimal stretch marks, but this time I had decided since I had just bought 3 bottles of body kisses, that I would try that instead of the butter. Let me just tell you, I am now 8 months along and could not be happier with the results! Not a single stretch mark, not an ounce of cellulite , not on my belly,not on my legs. Tanning or no tanning, this is the BEST lotion! Would recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> Smells like what I imagine an angel smells like</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I like it for the smell more than the way it helps my skin feel smooth.  To me it&#x27;s awesome.  Again the smell is crazy good.  You&#x27;ll be sold on this one for sure.  Glad I found it here for this price.  I paid over $20 for it at the tanning store which is where I discovered it. .</li>
            <li> this product is a little thick, it will leave patches if you do not watch out. Other than that it does what it is intended to do. Repair and prepare your skin for the sun.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and makes your skin feel awesome.</li>
            <li> I like the scent.  I don&#x27;t feel that it extends my tan.  It&#x27;s creamy buy once it absorbs into my skin I feel a chalky smooth feel.  I do not feel it hydrates which will not aid in anti-aging.  I&#x27;m going to finish my bottle &amp; not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Been using Kisses for ten years and it is the best moisturizer! It is very thick and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Use daily and after tanning!</li>
            <li> My friends all love the smell and can&#x27;t believe I got such a good deal. This bottle lasted so long, left me feeling so soft and I absolutely love the smell!</li>
            <li> Great products always, I use noting else it&#x27;s always the best value for your money &amp; buying thru Amazon you save money</li>
            <li> It is very silky feeling and the longer it is used the less that is needed.  Legs and back of the arms just soak it up and they look great!!</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy, great fragrance and it seems to last all day long! I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice if it helps keep my tan going but we&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> I first used this product when I was tanning and fell in love with the scent.  It&#x27;s the perfect body lotion!  I often mix it with my self tanner ( for medium skin) because I have fair skin and it moisturizes so well that it helps the color last longer.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing, it seem to do exactly what it says, leave you tan longer, and it smells wonderful&lt;3. The shipping was excellent, i got it two days earlier than when it said it was supposed to arrive, and for the price i couldn&#x27;t not get it it such a big bottle, i had to have it, i was so pleased i love it:)</li>
            <li> Lotion smells amazing! Goes on smoothly, not too thick or thin. Not greasy at all. Leaves skin feeling extra soft! I will purchase again! I cannot stress enough how this product smells...like a fruity flowery garden smell. Very summer like. Have gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Very good quality and it smells delicious. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite lotion, especially in the summer.  I have used this lotion for 4 years now.  It smells great and makes my skin so soft that people actually comment on how soft my skin looks and feels.  I feel like it really deepens and extends my tan, as well. It makes my tan &amp;#34;pretty.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  Goes on smooth and keeps skin hydrated all day.  Pleasant smell without being overpowering.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best after sun moisturizer I have ever used.  It is sold at various tanning salon&#x27;s, but at Amazon it is about half price from salon prices.  It makes your skin feel so soft...smooth and smells teriffic.  I would recommend buying this from Amazon, even with shipping it is the cheapest way to get this lotion.</li>
            <li> This has a horrible sickly sweet fruity smell. If you aren&#x27;t a 13 year old girl I would not recommend. Yuck.</li>
            <li> This lotion works amazing! The firming I do not see but the moisture works. It smells so gross though...I use after a shower and let it dry. I am african american and truly it makes my skin appear lighter lol. I bought it at my salon. She was holding it for someone else but knew I had come in often to buy it. It was 22 dollars...</li>
            <li> It has a candy odor and not as moisturizing as other Austrailian products.</li>
            <li> This product soaks into your skin and does a great job of moisturizing. Nice fragrance and very reasonably priced. Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> The fragrance wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but the product does what it needs to. It hydrates a good tan and keeps the color.</li>
            <li> I started using it in 2007 after tanning. Now since they don&#x27;t sell it anywhere anymore I have to order it online. This makes your skin feel nourished, sexy, tight and super soft :-)  I will keep ordering it..I&#x27;m addicted. And to me it smells like a soft bubble gum. I love the smell:-)</li>
            <li> This has the same scent as Hempz lotion if you&#x27;ve ever used that. It&#x27;s light and not obnoxious. It does a great job of moisturizing and I feel like my skin is already tighter has an amazing texture and has actually managed to keep my hands moisturized and soft  smells like roses and sweet fruit. wonderful smell. good feel smooth moisture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this lotion, and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this lotion it leaves your body soft and smells great i use it everyday and the price is great ill be buying this from you again very soon ...</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE!! I received the item much quicker than I expected and I loved it!!!</li>
            <li> This is probably the greatest lotion I have ever used and it smells great. It spreads well too so it lasts a really long time, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I have been tanning for 3 years now and this is all I use when I am done tanning. It smells like &amp;#34;Cotton Candy&amp;#34;. Who wouldn&#x27;t love that smell.  :D</li>
            <li> smells great makes your skin smooth and hydrates your skin very inexpensive good stuff would recommend this after tanning or showering</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this lotion smells! I dont think it is super moisturizing but it does help to tighten the skin on my legs. I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate it at all. It did help to extend my tan and even my spray tan. I use it everyday after i shower.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have used in years.  It is silky smooth and leave no oily residue.  It does have a distinct smell.  Not of hemp, but of yeast.  It smells a lot like a brewery.  If you want silky smooth sun-kissed skin, with a hint of Miller Lite, this is the best lotion on the market.</li>
            <li> This cream is so nice -- not only smells so grand but is so smooth on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Really glad that I did get this kind.  Use it after I am in the sun all day &amp; is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> Great moisture ... But the smell is horrible I cnt even describe it ... Very strong and overpowering .. I definitely will not be buying it again... Seller was great !!</li>
            <li> I love using this lotion right after I tan. It makes my skin feel so fresh and moisturized. Sometimes I’ll mix it with regular un-scented lotion for daily use, but the fragrance is strong and fruity. Don’t get me wrong, I like the way it smells, but it definitely has that “tanning lotion” smell. I’ve had several friends ask if I just tanned after I put it on bc they can smell it. Overall though, I’m really happy with it, and will definitely use it after tanning.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly and was exactly as expected. very happy with the service and the product. i would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I love it and the scent lasts!  It&#x27;s an acquired scent sensation, I think.  Some people don&#x27;t like it.  I do.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been tanning for about a month in tanning beds and didn&#x27;t start peeling till I got this stuff. Not only does it smell like rubber, it doesn&#x27;t work. Lame.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I started using it when I was working at the local gym.  Even though I don&#x27;t tan it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used to keep my skin from drying out and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I just love this. It is a great moisturizer, and the smell is sweet. It does not go on greasy.</li>
            <li> This is most luxurious feeling body moisturizer I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve probably tried everything on the market, including making my own body cream with pure Shea butter and coconut butter (not something you should try at home). Kisses has an easy to use pump applicator, and I would suggest you pump carefully - a little goes a long way (another PLUS).You don&#x27;t want to waste it! It is lightly scented, goes on skin smoothly and evenly, leaving a long-lasting dewy look and feel to your skin. I have used Australian Gold sun protection  and indoor tannning products  in the past, but never saw this Moisturizer until I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good scent to cover up that nasty after tan smell. This does do the job but the smell is not your average. It almost smells like cotton candy i have gotten that from people too. This product moisturizes well but the scent is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t win me over.</li>
            <li> Its ok. pretty thick I don&#x27;t like the thickness it made my  skin feel yucky</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this product - had never used it before. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  The scent is a bit fruity and strong at first, but wears off to a very nice scent.  The first time I used it I saw a change in my skin. Fantastic product, definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works pretty well. So if you&#x27;re tired of smelling like coconut when going tanning, this is a nice change of pace.</li>
            <li> This is a rich, creamy moisturizer that I&#x27;m absolutely in love with now.  It has a light scent that reminds me of strawberries.  It does great at moisturizing but it rubs in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile back and really like it... The smell takes awhile to get use to, but it leaves your skin very soft... Not really sure it firms a lot, but my tan does seem to last longer... hope this helps</li>
            <li> I love fake baking but have fair skin so I have to use an after lotion to  help preserve my tan. This lotion has a nice sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t linger for a long time. It&#x27;s also pretty thin so you don&#x27;t have to feel like you have a residue left from it getting all over your clothes. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to extend there tan and keep their skin soft.</li>
            <li> This smells great and works very well. I bought it with the Paint it Black 50X  and together they really work very well. It lasts a pretty long while, the only issue I had was that sometimes it would &#x27;stick&#x27; and you couldn&#x27;t unlock it. I just unscrewed it and used it that way though.  Great lotion at a good price.</li>
            <li> smell is great, effects last a long time, my skin stays hydrated all day. Even when not tanning, i use this as a daily moisturizer</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday, but thought I needed to leave a review because I love it so much! First of all, it&#x27;s not greasy like a lot of lotions. It goes on smooth, soaks in really well, but leaves my skin SO SILKY SOFT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on after tanning yesterday, and woke up still feeling like pure silk.&lt;br /&gt;It smells fresh and fruity. I can&#x27;t really place the exact scent, but it&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s a little strong at first, but definitely yummy once you put it on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;I also really like that a little goes a long way, and it comes in a nice big (22 oz.) bottle vs. the same price I&#x27;ve paid for much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;It helped cover up the &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; smell quite well, too, but I am definitely putting it on more than just after tanning!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely good stuff if you like a fresh and fruity smell with purely silkaliscious skin!</li>
            <li> This product smells so delicious and definitely is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s been keeping my tan from fading and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle great deal for the price.  Lotion is very rich and softens skin well leaving a lovely fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell. It makes your skin feel good if you can get over the smell. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best products used by my wife, the thing that sets it apart is its fragrance and soft texture.</li>
            <li> Compared to Salon prices, it&#x27;s a steal. I like the way this lotion makes my skin feel but I could do WITHOUT the scent.  It smells like melted bubble gum.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell makes my skin really soft but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy anymore it&#x27;s a little pricy</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing. It smells beyond good. (cucumber and strawberry like smell.)&lt;br /&gt;I have excema and am postpartum, it helps firm my skin and my skin has not been this hydrated in years.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it as a daily lotion. I am sure it works well with tanning beds also but that is not why I bought it (;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall. I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again. It is well worth the price. And will last me a while. I&#x27;ve had it a couple months and am not even half way through the bottle. I use it every day and after every shower. So that should help you all have an idea of how long this will last (;</li>
            <li> The size of the lotion is awesome, and the way it feels after you have taken a bath, is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The best lotion for the money, and the size, you can&#x27;t beat it no where.</li>
            <li> I like the product as far as it&#x27;s ability to moisturize my skin. The scent doesn&#x27;t appeal to me but I use the product to extend my tan and keep my skin looking and feeling awesome!</li>
            <li> This product works and does an amazing job! Not just for keeping your tan, it really does help firm your skin (noticeably!) and moisturizes for hours and hours. Finally, something that does exactly what it claims!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the lotion is personal opinion, everyone has their own likes and dislikes. I think it smells good and I&#x27;ve compliments from men on how I smell when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as someone having a bad skin reaction to it, this does not happen to everyone. It sounds like an allergy to one or more of the ingredients, and not everyone will have the same results. Certain laundry detergents make me break out, they aren&#x27;t bad. They just don&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be paying 24 or more dollars to buy this in a store, if you are thinking of trying it, I suggest you do. You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived earlier than expected, packaged very well, and no problems at all. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought some overpriced lotion from a salon and then bought this to compare and it was the exact same!!!  I&#x27;m so excited getting this for $15 less!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great, feel good and works well.  My only thing is I don&#x27;t care for strawberry scents and this one is pretty noticeable</li>
            <li> This product definitely does not smell like \\&quot;Fresh Rain.\\&quot; It is more of a girly, bubblegum scent. The best part about this lotion is how soft and supple it makes your skin afterwards.  I definitely can tell a difference in the firmness of my skin from the anti-aging ingredient, although I am still young. I have recommended this lotion to my mother, because of how great for the skin it is and the low price here on Amazon. I&#x27;ve used it after I get out of the shower after I went tanning that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you choose a reputable seller, mine came sealed in a bag and there were no signs of tampering.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy like most lotions. It does have an odd smell at first but you&#x27;ll get use to it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good and it&#x27;s a giant bottle.  It&#x27;s very thick, a quality that I like but others might not. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> For as thick as this stuff is I expected it to be more moisturizing! The smell is pleasant. Overall a good product but I had higher expectations based on the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Product is great and a fraction of the cost at the local tanning salon. Will be reordering when we run out.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! Keeps skin soft and silky. Also the smell is so wonderful!! This keeps tan looking fresh and great !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time tanner and I was never able to get a tan let alone keep one. This has been my life savor. It keeps me smelling amazing right after tanning and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or burned after I put it on.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent!  Makes my skin feel super smooth.  I love the way my skin looks &amp; feels after using Body Kisses.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion you can buy especially if you are a Tanner, It will keep you soft and extend your tan. The smell is Great</li>
            <li> The smell is like bubblegum in my opinion- which isn&#x27;t a kicker for me. It is a huge bottle for the price, which is an amazing deal. The lotion does seem to keep my tan longer than normal, but I honestly wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you for sure since I typically tan every other day. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, and if it weren&#x27;t for the bubblegum smell I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I put it on daily and I find my mystic tan has been lasting longer.  The smell is heavenly!</li>
            <li> Lived it.. Smells good..</li>
            <li> would never buy again</li>
            <li> Favorite lotion ever, love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad they have discontinued it I wasn&#x27;t happy about the price but understand supply and demand please bring this product back</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tone or firm. Doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for someone. They loved it and the price is way better than at the store</li>
            <li> Moisturizer? No. At first it made my skin amazing soft, but as the lotion wore off my skin got so ashy and dry. I had to return it, which proved to also be a terrible process.</li>
            <li> Ok I got this lotion based on other reviews. To me this lotion is very strong smelling, its a pleasant smell but can be a little overpowering. Some said its a bubble gum smell but I would say more of a melon smell.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great but just beware that the fragrance will linger for about 30 minutes. Goes on the skin smooth and enhances your tan.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle taped shut within three days from the time I ordered it. Very pleased! While the smell of Body Kisses isn&#x27;t Horrible, it definitely has a strange smell to it. My daughter thinks it smells like bubble gum; I smell fermented strawberries mixed with a strong chemical smell; however, my husband loves it, so I guess that&#x27;s a plus. I guess it&#x27;s all a matter of opinion. The smell is quite strong at first but fades with time. It really isn&#x27;t an issue to me; you kind of get used to it. The lotion itself, however, I absolutely love! Thick and super moisturizing! After just one application, it made my skin feel very soft and supple. While the smell is less than desirable, the lotion itself makes it all worth it! The bottle is huge and very affordable compared to other lotions, and overall, I am very pleased! Seller was great; super fast shipping. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> it kinda smells like cucumbers but not really, all tanning lotions will have kinda a weird smell but if your a hardcore tanner you get used to it, I think this is one of my favorite lotions to use after , works great</li>
            <li> This stuff is really Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It will help you keep your Tan for a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy at all, makes you feel really refreshed</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past, but never read into it that much. I forgot how great it smells and how amazing my skin feels! Its a great product and a great buy. Its a great size, and i love using it after i tan, or even fresh out of the shower! You won&#x27;t be let down.</li>
            <li> love this lotion. makes your skin really soft. it has like a strawberry cucumber melon scent. i really like it. very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion. It does help to extend my tan and it smells delicious. Additionally, I like to use it as a hand cream. It does not contain petroleum and paraben.It has all kind of vitamins(C,E...) and oils, plant extracts, hemp seeds extract, Shea butter and so on... I could not  pop up those cream dispenser quickly,because  bottle was frozen( snowing outside). I left lotion at room temperature for 3-4 hours to warm up the bottle. My skin feels very soft. I apply it generously after shower and any time during the day as needed. I mix  it with blackberry blast tanning lotion when I go tanning. It smells delicious after using tanning bed, without burning smell. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this item in place of Jergens Skin Firming lotion. It wasn&#x27;t a suitable replacement. I didn&#x27;t absorb well (too thick which some may prefer) and smelled off. I used this product years ago and really liked. This time around not for me. I&#x27;m curious if the odd smell was due to product being old?</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried for firming and moisture! Smells great and perfect for after shaving. Also great for tanners as well as non tanned. Love it and cheaper to purchase off Amazon than in the salons.</li>
            <li> Best body lotion ever!  I even use it on my face because its non greasy and makes my skin incredibly soft compared to other brands I have used in the past.  Bonus: Big bottle of lotion for less $ compared to other brands in a tiny jar that just do not do what they claim.  Smells great too. As a matter of fact I am getting ready to order another bottle now :)</li>
            <li> One of my best purchases had it before and bought again, cheap and smells soooo good does exactly what it says will always use this if just even for lotion. Best ever.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells good and seems thick, but after I apply it my skin was still dry and cracked after it dried. After a week I am softer but still dry.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this, I heard nothing but positive feedback. It came with a package deal with Bombshell through Amazon. I got a sunburn in the tanning bed last week and still haven&#x27;t peeled due to this stuff. Not too greasy, not too thin, but still goes a long way. I usually only use a few pumps per use. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the product, as far as moisture, but the smell is overwhelming. And it&#x27;s way too sticky. My husband makes fun of me and says I smell like a \\&quot;Strawberry Headshop\\&quot; or a \\&quot;Drunk Strawberry\\&quot;. It&#x27;s an ok lotion don&#x27;t get me wrong. Makes your skin feel great if you can get past the smell. Also it&#x27;s way too sticky, so you can&#x27;t really put it on before you go out because you&#x27;ll get negative attention, and you can&#x27;t really put it on before bed because your husband or SO will complain about the stench, and you will feel sticky and gross trying to go to sleep. It will smell like white trash all throughout your house. I mean I may as well go get the playboy seat covers for my car and fuzzy pink steering wheel cover and long neon pink acrylic nails while I&#x27;m at it. I went to Forever After and never plan to look back.</li>
            <li> it smells so good, great product</li>
            <li> It smells sooooo good!! It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or thick feeling after, and that&#x27;s the main reason I will continue to by this lotion.</li>
            <li> Came is fast a I love it</li>
            <li> Great after tan lotion. Makes you silky smooth and I love the smell and the amount that you get lasts a LONG time.  I have recommended it to several of my tanning friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li> Makes skin silky smooth! Love the hemp, it really does the trick. Don&#x27;t be worried about the price, it&#x27;s a bargain! The real thing, works amazing. Your skin will thank you if you buy this stuff! Love!!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this lotion for Anybody, not just us tanners. It smells just like Hempz lotion. Only better, &amp; I&#x27;ll tell you why.. It has Firming (anti-wrinkle) formula. Also \\&quot;firming\\&quot; helps to reduce cellulite. The consistency of the lotion is pretty thick. So it lasts longer - not only in the bottle but hydrating your skin as well.&lt;br /&gt; ** Ingredients in this lotion contain Vitamins A,C, &amp; E. Shea Butter, Hemp Seed Oil, &amp; a few different Root, Sprout, &amp; Seed Extracts. Etc.&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s good for All skin, especially those that go to the tanning salon, post-tan. Keeps your skin hydrated, exactly what you need to maintain that beautiful color, &amp; smelling fresh!</li>
            <li> It smells great!  However, it is very thick and tends to make me feel clammy and sticky so I only use it sometimes.</li>
            <li> Great product for tanning. It was somewhat on time. I recommend  it to all my friends that tan. Great for outdoors too</li>
            <li> Goes well with my Trish Mcevoy No 9.  Has a light blackberry scent.  Nice everyday moisturizer.  This is a great price instead of buying in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> this bottle was way bigger than i expected. so it was def worth the money. smells great and leaves skin soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li> leaves skin soft. smells like roses and sweet fruit. wounderful smell. good feel smooth like silicone. moisture keeps well. nice</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on everyone&#x27;s reviews of the wonderful smell this lotion has. Well...it&#x27;s just not for me. The scent is TOO sweet, and smells like stinky candy to me, for some reason. It feels just like the forever after lotion, which is awesome, but the smell is overwhelming. i can&#x27;t use it. i should have smelled it in person beforehand!</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive or allergic to wheat, avoid this product!  I&#x27;m returning this one!  I have no idea why lotion should contain wheat...</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion before but had difficulties finding it lately in tanning salons.  My current salon would order for me but they are charging a ridiculous price plus shipping and tax.  This price on amazon was absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a great scent but that is also a personal preference. My boyfriend loves the scent.  I use it after tanning if I will be running errands etc and then use it before bed or after shower.  It definitely extends the tan and helps take care of the skin from tanning.  I have psoriasis, a severe case and can only use certain things on my skin. For example, I can only use Ivory bar soap in the shower and Eucerin or Gold bond have been the only lotions I have been able to use. It took a while to find a tanning lotion and after tanning lotion that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  This lotion is just perfect for that, sensitive skin but still being a useful product for it&#x27;s original intentions.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, I get compliments on the scent all the time. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and feels perfect. I only wish it were cheaper so that I could continue buying it as my regular lotion. The bottles lasted only slighter longer than my normal bottles of lotion, so I&#x27;m not sure the price is completely worth it. Otherwise, the scent alone would make me want to continue buying it regularly.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!  It smells great and works even better.  All my friends use mine and I will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> I first used this product years ago when I first started tanning. I gave tanning up a year later but I still use this lotion as my Daily moisturizer because nothing has ever worked as effectively as this lotion. Also, I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how great I smell when I wear this stuff and have convinced several of friends to buy it. The bottle is so big, you buy one and it lasts all year long!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this lotion.  I love the smell and I can&#x27;t ever go without it now.  Its a great size and lasts a really long time. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A deep moisturizing lotion for every part of your body....even your feet!!!!</li>
            <li> absolutely love my lotion makes you feel so soft and has such a pleasant smell</li>
            <li> This bottle lasted forever! I put lotion on about twice daily and it lasted me months! I tan often and this was an amazing after lotion that took great care of my skin. I am currently using the hemp nation vanilla pineapple which is my new favorite (:</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this so much! i feel it hydrating my skin when i put it on, ive been looking for a good after-tanning lotion and this one is always raved about so i thought i would give it a try! i love it !! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. Smells sooo good and I even wear it just as a moisturizer when I havent tanned in a while. My boyfriend loves the smell.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion. Lasts a long time on my skin and continue to smell it all day too. It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feel.</li>
            <li> This stuff has an amazing texture and has actually managed to keep my hands moisturized and soft in the wintertime in Michigan. I&#x27;m the type of person who turned in assignments in school with blood on them because my knuckles would crack open due to allergy to many lotions.&lt;br /&gt; At first, the scent was a bit offensive to me, but somehow I acquired it and now use this instead of perfume (so I really like the scent). It smells like a cross between a watermelon Jolly Rancher and some sort of flower. Definitely unique.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are superficial; the name of the product is tacky and the package is equally embarrassing. The package also says to go to color.australiangold.com, which does not exist and leads me to believe that this product might be rather old. Many of the ingredients are great, but there are some that I have trouble pronouncing-- not that tanners care about health anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this lotion, and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This lotion is an all around great buy. The smell is wonderful and the feel of the lotion is so soft and silky. It came in the mail fast only 5 days from when I placed my order. This lotion became a quick favorite of mine and I would insist on you buying it as well! I cannont get over how delicious it smells!!! Also a grear value I would never buy from the tanning salon..way to over priced. All in all I adore this lotion. MUST BUY!!!</li>
            <li> This is very creamy and moisturizes your skin before and after you tan. Great product and great price. Smells awsome too,.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion! thick and creamy and smells great! very hydrating after a tan or any other time.</li>
            <li> love the feel of the lotion, but the scent is really strong at first then gets better as it fades.  This would be perfect if the scent was a lot lighter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this originally from my tanning salon a couple years ago, and I ran out of it. The current place where I tan didn&#x27;t have it available, and was happy to see it available online. The smell is pretty strong at first, but the intensity goes away quickly. It&#x27;s a very sweet, strawberry scent. It&#x27;s a nice thick consistency, but still goes a long way. Shipping was fast, very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was going every other day and this lasted a while!  Loved the product.  Smelled great and really helped keep my skin sane after going tanning so much for a wedding. Def recommend both the merchant and the lotion.  Would have been cool to have some free samples, that would have taken it to another level:) But that&#x27;s only because people love to get free things.  This product worked really well! And I got it on time.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells, its so good!!  It is really worth buying. I was looking for something that would keep my skin soft and smooth and this does the job! I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the Angel after tanning lotions. This lotion runs a very close race! It smells closely to watermelon and I can see the difference in my skin. It has also extended the life of my tan which is important to me. Would definitely recommend this to the daily tanner! Also, it is a HUGE bottle. Last me around 3 months.</li>
            <li> My daughter used to work at a tanning salon and they used to sell this lotion, we moved to Hawaii and I cant find it anywhere so I was thrilled to find it here for a very resonable price! Love the smell and its very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I use hemp lotion and this is very close to it....the smell is great and it&#x27;s very think and smooth I would buy his again.</li>
            <li> Other Australian Gold products have always been a hit with me...this one has a peculiar, cheap strawberry smell to it.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  It&#x27;s very refreshing and it leaves skins moisturized.  Very good buy.  Suggest it to anyone who tans or not.</li>
            <li> I love this sooooo much. I don&#x27;t even have to wear cologne. I put it on and people actually comment on how &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; I smell. I tell them &amp;#34;it&#x27;s my Kisses lotion.</li>
            <li> I used to use this lotion awhile back when I tanned all of the time. So when I started back, definitely looked for this again. It&#x27;s a great it&#x27;s got a pretty strong scent but one that I like. It&#x27;s really good moisturizer!! It sets my tan so I don&#x27;t peel and retains it longer.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, but the smell. It&#x27;s a strong mix of flowers and fruit. It does fade after a while. Don&#x27;t buy if you don&#x27;t like strong, sweet smells! It&#x27;s a little hard to rub in. But as far as a moisturizer it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase and delivery.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this lotion!  I wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!! Well worth the money and perfect for summer and the smell is delicious!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I will definitely buy more of this again.  Hemp is my favorite anyway and this smells so good!</li>
            <li> love it. smells amazing, to me it kinda smelled like bubble gum.. works great on my skin. i have very sensitive skin, this lotion didnt irritate it at all. and seems to last on me most of the day.</li>

            <li> I love this lotion it firms and makes my skin so soft always after a shower dont dry off just put it on and let your skin drinkit up</li>
            <li> One of the best after tan lotions out there. I have shiny, silky smooth skin and the scent is amazing! Been using this lotion for years and don&#x27;t plan on changing anytime soon! Extends the life of your tan and is more than worth the price!</li>
            <li> My tan rocks whenever I have kisses and its smells awesom. Your skin glows is firmer softer and younger looking</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this purchase. After tanning and showering, KISSES makes your skin feel so soft and hydrated again.  The smell is amazing as well. Great price for a great product !</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! It Is great to use after tanning and the bottle lasts me forever. Shipped quickly and works great. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If I get a sunburn I put this on it before I go to sleep, when I wake up in the morning there is little if any sunburn left.  and it is a great moisturizer and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> This lotion might smell a little weird (husband swears it&#x27;s strawberries, I&#x27;m not convinced), but it works. It feels great right after tanning and after a shower. The moisturizer lasts for quite a while, too.</li>
            <li> im a guy and i use it every day--its great!</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion. I try to never run out of it! I love the smell and Miskito&#x27;s  wont bother u when u wear it a plus to me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hemp lotion before and liked it but hot diggity do I love this stuff. It smells awesome to me and comes at a great price. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! Used for several summers! Great after tanning bed or laying out in the sun! Received from company promptly!</li>
            <li> Was very excited to try this lotion since it&#x27;s had such good reviews. I was pleased to see how large the bottle was when I received it. Then, I smelled it.... Absolutely not my cup o tea. Smells like cheap, generic cherry candy. Then I was kinda bummed it was such a big bottle, cuz I&#x27;m gonna have to smell like this for such a long time. Lol. But luckily, after rubbing the lotion on, the smell began to dissipate. It&#x27;s not over powering, thank goodness. I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic change in my dry, sensitive skin. After using about half the bottle my skin feels tighter (in a good way), extremely moisturized and glowy. My boyfriend has even noticed a difference in softness. And maybe it&#x27;s just in my head, but it seems like my stretch marks are lightening up. Not as noticeable as they once were. I&#x27;m loving that! thumbs up to everything except the smell.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Its smells good and makes my skin silky soft. Great to use after tanning, sunbathing and a shower</li>
