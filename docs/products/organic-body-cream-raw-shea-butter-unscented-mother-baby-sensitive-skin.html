    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I think this is one of the best products out there.</li>
            <li>Best body butter ever.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect consistency for a bedtime lathering session.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 8th month of pregnancy and my belly skin has never been softer and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I researched for hours to find the best butter for my growing pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>and I was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>, I bet one of the MANY ingredients they are just throwing in there aren&#x27;t great for baby).</li>
            <li>okay a lot!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love the ingredients!  </li>
            <li>I love that this is organic and doesn&#x27;t contain any garbage!</li>
            <li>I had bought a popular cream</li>
            <li>This one got good reviews and we&#x27;ve been quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if the packaging was stronger.</li>
            <li>Its good and think but rubs on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even attempted to make my own but nothing works better than this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product has definately soothed any stretch induced itches and keeps it away altogether most of the time.</li>
            <li>Love the organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I came across this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Once it arrived I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li>And I love the fact that it is organic.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get much better, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect to have to buy more than one more bottle during the pregnancy, if we have to buy another one at all.</li>
            <li>There has to be something better for pregnancy belly.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from dry skin and this works perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product worked great.</li>
            <li>it smells of good, hydrates as no other product, and it always comes with free samples!</li>
            <li>I do love this cream, although it is tremendously overpriced.</li>
            <li>I accidentally dropped my jar and cleaning up the fragments (both on the floor and out of the cream itself) was a huge pain.</li>
            <li>but when I read the ingredients I just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>However, what is important to me is that this body butter maintains my skin well hydrated and itch free.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and found out that oils, unlike regular creams, penetrate deeper into your skin and therefore are more effective.</li>
            <li>Great oily moisture for severe dry spots and for shaving without water.</li>
            <li>This is good natural stuff and great to have around sensitive young baby skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 6 months pregnant and have been using this product since 10 wks.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>Oh, and my mother got them when she was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant and after I delivered for like about a month.</li>
            <li>I recommended it to my friend that is 36 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>I will be using it if I get pregnant again.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to all my pregnant friends and will recommend it to you.</li>
            <li>and it would rub off on my clothes quickly</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this product on my belly the itching stopped.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of creams and lotions and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is just right.</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps skin soft &amp; moisturized for sooo long, I feel like it&#x27;s greatly improved my skin.</li>
            <li>In addition, the less ingredients the better because that means that the product is purer and it will nurture your skin more.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to use something very natural, scent free and something that works.</li>
            <li>This is my first time writing a review but for this product I had to do it.</li>
            <li>That was what first prompted me to get this cream.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild and can be mixed with your favorite essential oil scent if you prefer.</li>
            <li>I have used it nearly every night on my belly and hips since I was 5 months pregnant</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a large bottle</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and a hypersensitive sense of smell right now.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t use water so if you are washing your hands a lot this works really well to keep your hands from drying out.</li>
            <li>So many products that say Shea butter are so watered down</li>
            <li>So when I got pregnant I thought that it was not possible for me not to get stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I appreciated that it was organic and natural.</li>
            <li>after my shower in the morning and before going to bed at night has completely worked!</li>
            <li>Leaves him soft and fragrant but, not in a toxic-smelling way.</li>
            <li>The reason I bought it is because I wanted something totally natural to moisturize the skin on my bust.</li>
            <li>This was NOT due to the cream.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on lotions/creams that the first ingredient is water!  </li>
            <li>you might as well put regular old jergens lotion on.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t take much per application and a little really does go a long way.  </li>
            <li>It feels little oily at first, but it gets absorbed after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Not long after, I had some type of allergic reaction on my neck which caused my skin to itch and swell.  </li>
            <li>I have also not developed any stretch-marks thus far</li>
            <li>Daily use during two pregnancies...and not a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li>I would apply this butter minimum twice a day with a little bit of pure almond oil that I bought from Amazon too and massage it for around 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It is a very firm body butter, but it spreads over your skin and soaks in very well as soon as it comes in contact with your natural body heat.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d long wanted to replace my Aveeno moisturizer because of all of the ingredients (I&#x27;m not a chemist but</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts me really long.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t let the price deter you!</li>
            <li> Extremely moisturizing</li>
            <li> This does NOT prevent stretch marks due to pregnancy.</li>
            <li> A small portion goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> Well the swelling went down and the skin around my neck turned brown and flakey.  </li>
            <li> One jar lasted approx a month and a half.</li>
            <li> The bottle was a little small</li>
            <li> I carry a small container in my purse for my lips.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not cheap!</li>
            <li> I used this as a base for a belly butter mix (with the addition of unrefined coconut and some natural lotion).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this cream.</li>
            <li> I was going crazy; My tummy was itching all the time and everyone kept telling me not to scratch</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am 6 months pregnant and have been using this product since 10 wks.  I have very sensitive skin and a hypersensitive sense of smell right now.  This body butter has been the only thing I can use with no reactions in my skin or scent department.  It is a very firm body butter, but it spreads over your skin and soaks in very well as soon as it comes in contact with your natural body heat. It has not marked any of my clothing and has lasted quite well through applications to the belly and hips 2x a day.  This product has definately soothed any stretch induced itches and keeps it away altogether most of the time.</li>
            <li> Bought this product by accident but decided to keep it.  Not long after, I had some type of allergic reaction on my neck which caused my skin to itch and swell.  This was NOT due to the cream.  Well the swelling went down and the skin around my neck turned brown and flakey.  I went to the doctor and they told me it was a form of Dermatitis and there was really no cure for it but to apply some prescribed cream.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I began to apply this cream instead and guess what?!? My skin cleared, the itchiness went away and it&#x27;s no longer flakey!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this cream. I use it on my pregnant belly. I will continue to use it after my pregnancy. I&#x27;m a massage therapist so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of creams and lotions and this is by far my favorite. I&#x27;ve even attempted to make my own but nothing works better than this stuff. It is pricy but a little goes a long way and lasts quite awhile. Love the organic ingredients. Will use it on my baby too. Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time writing a review but for this product I had to do it. Especially since I benefit a lot by reading reviews. Believe me when I say that I have a lot of stretch marks that I got during puberty. So when I got pregnant I thought that it was not possible for me not to get stretch marks. Fortunately, I was wrong. I did not get one single stretch mark! Oh, and my mother got them when she was pregnant. I would apply this butter minimum twice a day with a little bit of pure almond oil that I bought from Amazon too and massage it for around 5 minutes. I would exfoliate my skin before a shower with a brush that I also bought at Amazon. I started applying this butter from the moment I found out I was pregnant and after I delivered for like about a month. I did a lot of research and found out that oils, unlike regular creams, penetrate deeper into your skin and therefore are more effective. In addition, the less ingredients the better because that means that the product is purer and it will nurture your skin more. I think this is one of the best products out there. I recommended it to my friend that is 36 weeks pregnant and she has not gotten any stretch marks either. I don&#x27;t think she will get any. Besides from being effective, I wanted a product that contained no chemicals or bad ingredients that could reach my baby. That was what first prompted me to get this cream. I had bought a popular cream but when I read the ingredients I just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it. I&#x27;m so glad I came across this product. I will be using it if I get pregnant again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Just a dab warmed up in my hands and spread over my growing baby bump and on my breasts (as they are stretching too!) after my shower in the morning and before going to bed at night has completely worked! I was going crazy; My tummy was itching all the time and everyone kept telling me not to scratch or I could get stretch-marks. The very first time I used this product on my belly the itching stopped. I have also not developed any stretch-marks thus far and my baby bump practically doubled in size in the last month. I would highly recommend this product. A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t let the price deter you!</li>
            <li> I used this product throughout my pregnancy and I was very satisfied.  I have very sensitive skin and this product worked great.</li>
            <li> I used this as a base for a belly butter mix (with the addition of unrefined coconut and some natural lotion). Daily use during two pregnancies...and not a single stretch mark. I appreciated that it was organic and natural.</li>
            <li> Requires a bit of work mixing...okay a lot! Great oily moisture for severe dry spots and for shaving without water. It will eventually soak in. Eventually....</li>
            <li> Best body butter ever. I have very sensitive and dry skin. This stuff keeps skin soft &amp; moisturized for sooo long, I feel like it&#x27;s greatly improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I researched for hours to find the best butter for my growing pregnant belly. So many products that say Shea butter are so watered down you might as well put regular old jergens lotion on. I finally came across this product on amazon and the reviews and ingredients seemed to be just what I was looking for. Once it arrived I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased. It is the perfect consistency for a bedtime lathering session. Its good and think but rubs on nice and smooth. I have used it nearly every night on my belly and hips since I was 5 months pregnant and I will likely use it even after baby comes in a few weeks. (still no stretch marks and never got itchy) The scent is very mild and can be mixed with your favorite essential oil scent if you prefer. I have recommended this to all my pregnant friends and will recommend it to you. It&#x27;s well worth the money. One jar lasted approx a month and a half.</li>
            <li> it smells of good, hydrates as no other product, and it always comes with free samples! A small portion goes a long way too. And I love the fact that it is organic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a while for something for baby&#x27;s skin. I&#x27;d long wanted to replace my Aveeno moisturizer because of all of the ingredients (I&#x27;m not a chemist but, I bet one of the MANY ingredients they are just throwing in there aren&#x27;t great for baby). I was very happy with this. We tried Argon oil for a while but it was too greasy. This is just right. Leaves him soft and fragrant but, not in a toxic-smelling way. I might try it on myself sometime too. The bottle was a little small but, I find I only have to use a smidge at a time.</li>
            <li> I use it only on my chest. The reason I bought it is because I wanted something totally natural to moisturize the skin on my bust. And it does the job. One bottle lasts me really long. I am on my second bottle, and have been using it for almost a year. The only drawback is that you need some time for it to penetrate your skin, otherwise it may get your bra oily. However, it is oil, so it is expected.</li>
            <li> This is good natural stuff and great to have around sensitive young baby skin.  It doesn&#x27;t use water so if you are washing your hands a lot this works really well to keep your hands from drying out.</li>
            <li> I love it! I suffer from dry skin and this works perfect for me. I am using it every where in my body including my face. It feels little oily at first, but it gets absorbed after a few minutes. A little goes a long way. I like the fact that does not have any perfume. I carry a small container in my purse for my lips.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have been using it throughout my entire pregnancy.  Extremely moisturizing and I love the ingredients!  Can&#x27;t get much better, in my opinion.  Will continue to repurchase.</li>
            <li> My wife and I recently found out that we are expecting and it was recommended to us that she start using lotion on her stomach daily now in order to reduce the effects of stretch marks down the road.  We wanted to use an organic lotion that was as unscented as possible.  This one got good reviews and we&#x27;ve been quite pleased.  One of the reviews mentioned not letting the price scare you away.  We didn&#x27;t and I agree.  This isn&#x27;t a large bottle but it doesn&#x27;t take much per application and a little really does go a long way.  I don&#x27;t expect to have to buy more than one more bottle during the pregnancy, if we have to buy another one at all.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I need. I&#x27;m in my 8th month of pregnancy and my belly skin has never been softer and beautiful. If I had the energy to do it daily, I&#x27;d use it for my entire body.</li>
            <li> I do love this cream, although it is tremendously overpriced. Beware of dropping the jar, as it will shatter into tiny pieces. I accidentally dropped my jar and cleaning up the fragments (both on the floor and out of the cream itself) was a huge pain. It would be nice if the packaging was stronger.</li>
            <li> I love that this is organic and doesn&#x27;t contain any garbage! I have medium oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t make my face oilier and I do not break out. I think it is creamy without being greasy. Don&#x27;t waste your money on lotions/creams that the first ingredient is water!  This does NOT prevent stretch marks due to pregnancy. I used this numerous times a day and night during pregnancy and it didn&#x27;t prevent anything. It didn&#x27;t help with the itchy belly either. If your belly itches use calamine lotion. I feel like I would put a ton of this on and it would rub off on my clothes quickly and I would have to reapply often and it&#x27;s not cheap! There has to be something better for pregnancy belly.  I will keep using this for my face.</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy and I wanted to use something very natural, scent free and something that works. I don&#x27;t know if I will have stretch marks after my pregnancy, I probably will as I read that stretch marks are genetic. However, what is important to me is that this body butter maintains my skin well hydrated and itch free. I also like that I don&#x27;t need to apply  a lot of it.</li>
