            <li>(AWESOME)</li>

            <li>and it was in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>I turned it on to use it and it works perfectly!!</li>
            <li>and they both are very handy!</li>
            <li>I dropped it all the time and chipped it, but it still works, which is very surprising.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just happy that I received my product</li>

            <li>Take care everyone and better luck with your purchases!</li>
            <li>and of course it&#x27;s really cute too!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this straightener!</li>
            <li>and I immediately fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the packaging was awesome</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthy for your hair and leaves it nice and silky, and it looks cute, too!</li>
            <li>This product is the most amazing straightener I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>This hair straightener is IDEAL for using on weaves and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It has held up great and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;catch\\&quot; on any hair and is very smooth</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flattening iron.</li>
            <li>Plus the zebra print is soo cute.</li>
            <li>Hair looks shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>so I should have known better than to just order something I thought was cute and hope it would work well.</li>
            <li>and at most take an hour or so to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased :)   </li>
            <li>Enjoy, I know I am! :)</li>
            <li>The cost was better on amazon then in the stores.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice gift box, cute design, heats up quickly, and does the job.  </li>
            <li>It is originally $250, but you can buy it on amazon for $52.95 plus about 5 dollars shipping!</li>
            <li>the amika straightener was a great investment so far.</li>
            <li>Having said that, this is a great iron so far.</li>
            <li>so shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li>New box, good gift presentation.  </li>
            <li>I have never been so happy about a flat iron in my life</li>
            <li>It is very, very good for your hair (100% ceramic is the ONLY way to go when purchasing hair irons) and it ships fast, too!</li>
            <li>One of my best friends has very curly hair, she used it and her hair was so straight and silky - completely better than the instyler or any other straightener out there</li>
            <li>The iron is constructed of a very substantial material that seems like metal, although my better sense tells me it&#x27;s plastic.</li>
            <li>I had seen this product in the local mall here and was impressed and when I found it for such a discounted price I HAD TO ORDER IT!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t heat up very hot.</li>
            <li>It came in a beautiful display box with a magnetic front closure flap and included 2 nice black plastic duckbill clips, 2 instruction pamphlets with warranty info and service request card(English and Spanish) and a product advertisement pamphlet.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, I will be able to provide a new product review sometime soon.      </li>
            <li>From their company profile, they have a 96% customer satisfaction rating, but I am very far from satisfied.  </li>
            <li>We got the exact same product through Amazon for only $52 and it works great!  </li>
            <li>Ih heats up really fast and leaves your hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that this product carries the \\&quot;Intertek listed\\&quot; stamp and a statement of UL standards conformity.</li>
            <li>I opened it right away</li>
            <li>I wish I had just bought a NEW and UNUSED CHI straightner from a local store where I could easily keep the receipt and return it if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and works on any type of hair.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice flat iron, especially for the Amazon price!  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I saw this product first in a mall</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone and everyone.... just not in white...:]</li>
            <li>This flat iron is cute, but its design is akward.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron...</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t use any additional products and it turned out soft, smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>I have only had this Amika for a month, but from what I have experienced so far, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>mine is black but still is very good and heats up fast and gets pretty hot so be careful!</li>
            <li>maybe if you took care of it and did not drop it then it would be fine, like all hair straighteners you need to take care of them in order for it too last!</li>
            <li>I really like that you can control the heat level</li>
            <li>Product was very well priced.  </li>
            <li>Came fast.  </li>
            <li>so well I did my whole head.</li>
            <li>I curled my ends and it curled very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As I said, I paid $43.43 with free shipping just last week here on Amazon, and the price has since almost doubled.</li>
            <li>This is important because it insures that the product design has been independently tested for safety as an electrical appliance.</li>
            <li>That is a fair market price, but my motto is retail is for suckers.  </li>
            <li>The plates are black, shiny and very smooth.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of the 1-inch width--it allows me to make sure every little strand of hair is straight.</li>
            <li>when ever they are looking for a new straightener!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from Canada so not only was I charged more for shipping, but I ended up paying extra duty fees.  </li>
            <li>LAFEMME claims they only sell NEW products, so obviously they ripped me off and sold me a used item, probably assuming someone from Canda won&#x27;t be able to do anything about it and won&#x27;t bother paying the S&amp;H to return it.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth your money if it doesn&#x27;t work well enough.</li>
            <li>I normally use Chi but Decided to order this from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I just received my new straightner (march 30/2010)</li>
            <li>Well this is my first time having to write such a review.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, it&#x27;s just odd</li>
            <li>I became interested in this product back when I had</li>
            <li>I love using it, and maybe it&#x27;s naive</li>
            <li>I am a professional stylist</li>
            <li>Only really works if you already have straight-ish hair to begin with.</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed and am warning potential buyers of what may happen.</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair that does not like to stay straight, however this product has helped out so much.</li>
            <li>I ordered a New Amika Zebra Straightener when I recieved it it had chipped paint and looked like someone tried to paint the stripes back on by hand.</li>
            <li>The power light turns from red to green when it has reached the desired temp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found the reviews insightful and generally people warn others before they get screwed over!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy in the least.</li>
            <li>and well it has yellowed due to the high heat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On Youtube, people report having paid as much as $200 for this iron and as little as $80.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new one due to my clumsiness.</li>

            <li> I had to buy a new one due to my clumsiness.</li>
            <li> I have course naturally curly hair and this flat iron smooths it completely with little need for any de-frizzer syrum at all.</li>
            <li> where but we were not going to pay almost $200 for a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I found AMIKA Flat Iron 4 years ago while walking through the mall and a girl stopped me to give me a demonstration of their product</li>
            <li> I recommend buying a case for it too, since the flat iron can be stored in them before fully cooling off!</li>
            <li> I hope it holds up in the long term.</li>
            <li> I will never again buy an item which only has 1 other customer review!  </li>
            <li> Got the product in less time than expected.</li>
            <li> am not surprised because it get&#x27;s reeeeeally hot, but it was still disappointing as you can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only negative is the on/off--hard to see</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, relaxed and average thickness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not worth $80.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is the discoloration.</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to spend a lot of money on a flat iron</li>
            <li> b/c the switch is black like the rest of the iron interior.  </li>
            <li> That is obviously just a number and should not be taken seriously.</li>
            <li> so I just turned it about half way.</li>
            <li> there were little imperfections</li>
            <li> My only complaint is since we have bought it, the price has gone way up?!</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over a year</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to set the temperature control because the control knob is on the inside of the flat iron instead of the outside.  </li>
            <li> and though the print was slightly dirty from being in the box, it is new and</li>
            <li> What I was not prepared for was to open the box and find a used straightner with broken ceramic plates!  </li>
            <li> I intended to just test it out on a small section, but it worked</li>
            <li> We wanted to buy one more for my daughter but the price is almost as outrageous as the mall price!!</li>
            <li> NEEDLESS to say I have sent my Amika straightener back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I will say this I would rather pay extra money at the store to get a new unused than less money on here for a straightener that works horribly.</li>
            <li> have really thick, course curly looong hair...</li>
            <li> I am, however, confused by the drastic price fluctuations.</li>

            <li> Got the product in less time than expected. It was a present for my sister and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to spend a lot of money on a flat iron but I am sooooooo glad I did! This is a wonderful product. Takes no time at all to heat up....doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;catch\\&quot; on any hair and is very smooth</li>
            <li> Update: I just received my new straightner (march 30/2010) and though the print was slightly dirty from being in the box, it is new and i can&#x27;t wait to try it out.  I&#x27;m just happy that I received my product and i will continue to order from amazon!  Update:  I have just been contacted by LaFemme and I hope all goes well in the return/exchange process!  Hopefully, I will be able to provide a new product review sometime soon.      I&#x27;ve trusted amazon and amazon reviews before I&#x27;ve bought things online, or even from stores.  I&#x27;ve always found the reviews insightful and generally people warn others before they get screwed over!  Well this is my first time having to write such a review.  I ordered an AMIKA straightner from LAFEMME PRODUCTS 1.5 weeks ago and received it 1 hour ago.  I&#x27;m from Canada so not only was I charged more for shipping, but I ended up paying extra duty fees.  I knew this could happen, so I was prepared to pay the extra cash.  What I was not prepared for was to open the box and find a used straightner with broken ceramic plates!  The design of the iron was dirty and some parts looked smudged, but I thought this might just be from the box.  When I examined the plates I could see scratch marks and the corners were cracked.  LAFEMME claims they only sell NEW products, so obviously they ripped me off and sold me a used item, probably assuming someone from Canda won&#x27;t be able to do anything about it and won&#x27;t bother paying the S&amp;H to return it.  I don&#x27;t know about that yet, but I can definetely let everyone know about the product I received from this company.  From their company profile, they have a 96% customer satisfaction rating, but I am very far from satisfied.  I wish I had just bought a NEW and UNUSED CHI straightner from a local store where I could easily keep the receipt and return it if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  I will never again buy an item which only has 1 other customer review!  Take care everyone and better luck with your purchases!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flattening iron. I have extremely curly hair that does not like to stay straight, however this product has helped out so much. I am a fan of the 1-inch width--it allows me to make sure every little strand of hair is straight. I have only had this Amika for a month, but from what I have experienced so far, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is IDEAL for using on weaves and I highly recommend it. I love using it, and maybe it&#x27;s naive but I feel that it actually is doing harm to my hair. I can alter the temperature setting and it literally heats up in 10 secs, it&#x27;s not a fluke. I hope this helped, it&#x27;s a miracle worker! Plus the zebra print is soo cute. I recommend buying a case for it too, since the flat iron can be stored in them before fully cooling off! (AWESOME)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my jaguar Amika for over a year and it is all that they say it is. Ih heats up really fast and leaves your hair silky and smooth. I really like that you can control the heat level and of course it&#x27;s really cute too! Great product and I think I prefer it to the CHI I owned before.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is cute, but its design is akward. It is very difficult to set the temperature control because the control knob is on the inside of the flat iron instead of the outside.  The on/off button is also on the inside.  It works fine, it&#x27;s just odd the way it&#x27;s designed.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice flat iron, especially for the Amazon price!  It comes in a nice gift box, cute design, heats up quickly, and does the job.  Hair looks shiny and healthy.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am a professional stylist so I should have known better than to just order something I thought was cute and hope it would work well. It doesn&#x27;t heat up very hot. Only really works if you already have straight-ish hair to begin with. I would go with a more expensive brand like a ghd, chi or something else. It isn&#x27;t worth your money if it doesn&#x27;t work well enough.</li>
            <li> I ordered on a Friday had it here by Monday so shipping was very quick. I LOVE this flat iron...it has made a dramatic improvement on the condition of my hair. I had seen this product in the local mall here and was impressed and when I found it for such a discounted price I HAD TO ORDER IT! If you straighten your hair and want to keep from killing it Amika is the way to go! I have never been so happy about a flat iron in my life and I&#x27;ve been using them for YEARS! I have course naturally curly hair and this flat iron smooths it completely with little need for any de-frizzer syrum at all. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> the amika straightener was a great investment so far. there were little imperfections but i cant complain for the price. the temp control is good, if u are a person who is a complainer about this straightener and how it broke well maybe if you took care of it and did not drop it then it would be fine, like all hair straighteners you need to take care of them in order for it too last! i also got a holder and a heat mat from amika as well and they both are very handy! tho i dont know if all amikas ceramic is suppose to be gold as shown but mine is black but still is very good and heats up fast and gets pretty hot so be careful!</li>
            <li> Product was very well priced.  Came fast.  New box, good gift presentation.  Heats up fast--excellent straightening iron.  Only negative is the on/off--hard to see b/c the switch is black like the rest of the iron interior.  Recommend moving that to top/outside.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightener! I always tell everyone i know to go and buy this one when ever they are looking for a new straightener! (&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Edit - The temp dial shows a max temp of 200 degrees celsius which &#x3D; 320 degrees farhenheit. The company claims it goes up to 400 degrees. So I removed a star because that info is inaccurate and some people may want/need a lot of heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered this iron on May 12th for $43.43. It arrived today, the 18th. I come to write a review and the price is now $76.95! The suggested price printed on the box is $250.00. That is obviously just a number and should not be taken seriously. Having said that, this is a great iron so far. I&#x27;ve only used it once. It came in a beautiful display box with a magnetic front closure flap and included 2 nice black plastic duckbill clips, 2 instruction pamphlets with warranty info and service request card(English and Spanish) and a product advertisement pamphlet. The warranty is for a replacement within 3 months and then repair for the remainder of the year warranty. There is a $22.95 \\&quot;shipping and handling\\&quot; fee for any warranty claim. The mailing address is in Brooklyn, NY.&lt;br /&gt;The iron is a very nice size and the weight is nicely balanced. The plates are black, shiny and very smooth. The iron is constructed of a very substantial material that seems like metal, although my better sense tells me it&#x27;s plastic. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy in the least. The cord rotates and has a hanging hook. This iron does heat up within seconds as advertised. The power light turns from red to green when it has reached the desired temp. The temp control knob and on/off switch are on the inside of the iron and the temp dial is in Celsius (80 to 200.) I didn&#x27;t feel like converting so I just turned it about half way. My hair is shoulder length, relaxed and average thickness. I intended to just test it out on a small section, but it worked so well I did my whole head. I had already moisturized my hair with shea butter so I didn&#x27;t use any additional products and it turned out soft, smooth and straight. There was no smoke or foul smell and no tangling or pulling. I curled my ends and it curled very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier with this purchase. I hope it holds up in the long term. I am, however, confused by the drastic price fluctuations. On Youtube, people report having paid as much as $200 for this iron and as little as $80. As I said, I paid $43.43 with free shipping just last week here on Amazon, and the price has since almost doubled. If you are like me and and want the best product for the best price, do your homework on this iron, and keep watching for price drops. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not worth $80. That is a fair market price, but my motto is retail is for suckers.  lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that this product carries the \\&quot;Intertek listed\\&quot; stamp and a statement of UL standards conformity. This is important because it insures that the product design has been independently tested for safety as an electrical appliance.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I saw this product first in a mall where but we were not going to pay almost $200 for a flat iron.  We got the exact same product through Amazon for only $52 and it works great!  My only complaint is since we have bought it, the price has gone way up?! We wanted to buy one more for my daughter but the price is almost as outrageous as the mall price!!</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over a year and it works just as it did day one.&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick, course curly looong hair... and at most take an hour or so to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the discoloration. I purchased this in zebra print to tell mine from my sisters&#x27; and well it has yellowed due to the high heat.&lt;br /&gt;I am not surprised because it get&#x27;s reeeeeally hot, but it was still disappointing as you can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could&#x27;ve gotten it replaced since this happened soon after using it, but it would have just happened again anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone and everyone.... just not in white...:]</li>
            <li> I found AMIKA Flat Iron 4 years ago while walking through the mall and a girl stopped me to give me a demonstration of their product and I immediately fell in love with it! I had to buy a new one due to my clumsiness. I dropped it all the time and chipped it, but it still works, which is very surprising. So I ordered this one on Tuesday - May 10, 2011 and the estimated time of delivery was supposed to be between the 16th - 19th, but it got here TODAY!!! (May 12, 2011) It arrived through regular mail, which means they must have shipped it the same day I ordered it. I am VERY Happy with the service and prompt delivery. I did not expect to receive it so soon! I opened it right away and it was in perfect condition! I turned it on to use it and it works perfectly!! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased :)   If you&#x27;re considering purchasing this product, don&#x27;t hesitate and go for it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product is the most amazing straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s healthy for your hair and leaves it nice and silky, and it looks cute, too! It heats up very fast and works on any type of hair. One of my best friends has very curly hair, she used it and her hair was so straight and silky - completely better than the instyler or any other straightener out there (and I&#x27;ve used the instyler before and I don&#x27;t not recommend it what-so-ever). If you buy this straightener, you are getting a great deal. It is originally $250, but you can buy it on amazon for $52.95 plus about 5 dollars shipping! That&#x27;s an amazing deal! If you are on the fence as to whether or not you should buy this product, I say go for it - you definitely won&#x27;t regret your purchase. It is very, very good for your hair (100% ceramic is the ONLY way to go when purchasing hair irons) and it ships fast, too! Enjoy, I know I am! :)</li>
            <li> I became interested in this product back when I had an Amika Rep try it on my hair I normally use Chi but Decided to order this from Amazon.com. Bad decision. I ordered a New Amika Zebra Straightener when I recieved it it had chipped paint and looked like someone tried to paint the stripes back on by hand. Also it would not heat to 100% (it was straightening and heating worse than my CHI that I have had for over a yr) which makes it seem USED. I am very dissapointed and am warning potential buyers of what may happen. NEEDLESS to say I have sent my Amika straightener back for a refund. I will say this I would rather pay extra money at the store to get a new unused than less money on here for a straightener that works horribly.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron that I have ever used. It has held up great and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great Flat Iron. The cost was better on amazon then in the stores. Shipping was fast and the packaging was awesome</li>
