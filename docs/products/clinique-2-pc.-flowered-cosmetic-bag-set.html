I always have so many cosmetics, lotions, and free samples lying around that I decided to use these to organize the clutter.  I love the print.</li>
            <li> Bought for granddaughter for Christmas. She loved the bag. Kind of along the line&lt;br /&gt;of a vera wang print. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Big purse just enough for my gym bag. Colors are so bright and funky. My mom likes the small purse</li>
            <li> I thought from the pic that this would be pretty, but it also is so well made!  Durable and pretty and just the right size for me.</li>

            <li> I just love having a bag for every color day.  It is great to org. the products that go together and just grab the bag and go.&lt;br /&gt;Toss it in the back pack and you are set for the day.  Great product.</li>
            <li> So very cute. Love it</li>
            <li> Bright vibrant colors! Large enough for all my make up, yet small enough to in my purse perfectly! I honestly think the shipping cost more than the actual product!</li>
            <li> This was bought as a Boss&#x27; Day gift for my supervisor.  She clearly enjoyed and appreciated it.  It arrived in a timely manner and was even prettier in actuality as it was in the Amazon image.</li>
            <li> Very pretty!  Wonderful pattern, soft &amp;#34;canvas-like&amp;#34; nylon weave material.  Great price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought these mostly for the small one as it fits perfectly in my purse.  Most makeup bags are taller and get in the way of zipping up the purse.  This is a perfect size for anyone with a zipper on the top of the purse.  Holds just enough.  The larger one I use for travel it holds a ton of makeup or misc.</li>
            <li> This was so beautiful, I couldn&#x27;t keep it, but had to give it away as a gift.  And my friend really loved it!</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that the bright colors that caught my eye on line were just as nice up close. The bags seemed to be made of quality material and not too flimsy. To get a 2-piece set in different sizes for the price was a great deal compared to what I&#x27;ve seen in the stores. They were given to my teenage daughter for a gift; she loves the set!</li>
            <li> Seemed fine for what I needed It was an amazingly low price I would recommend it to anyone needing simple bags for makeup</li>

I have always used Clinique make-up bags, so I&#x27;m really pleased with this set. It&#x27;s really cute, and now my daughter and I have matching bags :)</li>
            <li> Bought all the Clinique makeup bags I found on amazon, but this is my fav. The inside has a silky layer of material so it can be cleaned if it gets dirty. Also I like that the smaller purse is sort of long so it hold all my lip stains that are in longer tubes... Along with some of my lip and eye pencils ... Overall great quality and very pretty ... Material is also very strong... Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Nice.  Exactly as described.  Great Service.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have two sizes of clutch, which is what I use these makeup bags for.  When I have a lot of stuff, I use the bigger bag, and when all I have is my keys, I use the smaller one.</li>
            <li> I really do like my new Clinique cosmetic bad.  I am elderly, and no longer need to carry a large purse, full of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;, when I go out.  Just my ID, a comb, and a few items of makeup.  Last week I was invited out for lunch with my family, and carried it with me.  I got several compliments on my new spring bag ....  ;)</li>
            <li> very pretty cosmetic bags. arrived quickly.</li>
