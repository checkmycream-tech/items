            <li>WOW again,This is truly amazing without any hype.</li>
            <li>I think it probably does even if only as a good glycerin soap would.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty good, I used for my face and body, but since they leave you pretty much odorless, I tend to used a body wash lotion right after cleaning up with the soap.</li>

            <li>It leaves skin and hair supple, soft and healthy.  </li>

            <li>;)</li>
            <li>yesterday I went to the swapmeet and found this exact product for only $1.50 I couldve gotten 8 more soaps then what I got here for the price I paid here.</li>
            <li>it worked fine on my face but not on my back.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves it.  </li>
            <li>shipment comes fast-</li>
            <li>and i also can tell a difference with my sister acne thanks.</li>

            <li> I have been using this Rattlesnake Oil Soap for about a month now, and I have enjoyed using it.  It does make my face feel squeaky clean (and a little bit dry, which is not a problem for me because I have rather oily skin).  I lather up and put on my face and let sit for 2-10 minutes, kind of making a mask, then washing off.  One thing I definitely have to note is that it does really dry out my hands, so make sure to use lotion after using this soap.  Worth a try if you haven&#x27;t had luck with anything else!</li>
            <li> Tried all kinds of creams for rash that I&#x27;d&lt;br /&gt;get after shaving my legs.&lt;br /&gt;This soap worked for the itching &amp; took away&lt;br /&gt;The bumps/rash.&lt;br /&gt;This is all I use on my legs!&lt;br /&gt;Also found that my face &amp; neck look more&lt;br /&gt;even &amp; very soft!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son, and it has worked wonders for his acne, not only is it clearing up, it has given him a more confidence in his appearance.   Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> So after using it for 3 months I have finally decided it is okay. It smells really good and it works really good as a body soap if your oily person. it worked fine on my face but not on my back. I seemed to have been breaking out more than usual. The problem i have is if the soap has too much scum left on the skin my back will break out. So unfortunately this product did not do well for my back. I originally used dead sea minerals brand and it would be the white soap that was sea salt. best soap for my back.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap.  It&#x27;s the only soap we use now.  My whole family loves it.  Can&#x27;t keep it in the house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s- I&#x27;ve had extreme acne problems since my teens- l tried everything in the book and proscribed by the dermatologist: proactive, creams, pills, face cleaning procedures, home remedies, diets... NOTHING worked! The Acne just kept on creeping out! (Plus, how embarrassing was it over the years with acne problems and the pimples, blood, the grotesque- on dates, interviews, work, class. smh...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the use of this product my face has been clean as a whistle- Haven&#x27;t had a single pimple or any break outs since I started using this product.  Incredible!! Clean! Clean! Clean! When I look at a mirror, my self-confidence just spikes through the roof- clean face, charming smile- life has been better with this soap- ;) Thank you, Rattle Snakes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment comes fast- and it is an essential product of my life now (next to having clean underwear).</li>
            <li> It was really good Thank You!!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  I have tried a lot of soaps and I will say this one is one of the best.  I know it is the snake oil that helps with any kind of skin issues.  I even use this to wash my hair; it makes a great hair cleanser and helps with any kind of scalp issues.  It leaves skin and hair supple, soft and healthy.  I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much but the price is ridiculously expensive yesterday I went to the swapmeet and found this exact product for only $1.50 I couldve gotten 8 more soaps then what I got here for the price I paid here. Will not be buying from here.</li>
            <li> Great deal for a pack of 6</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and was well packaged.  The soap smells nice - clean.  It lathers up nicely.  I have been using it for a little less than a week and I am starting to see improvement on my acne.  I will update my review when I have been using it a little longer.  Update: I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 10 days and it is clearing up my acne along with some acne scars I had on my cheeks.  It is nothing short of a miracle.  I told the dermatologist about it and she has never heard of it but told me to keep using it.  I wash my face at least once in the morning and once at night.</li>
            <li> I love this soap i bought for me and my mom and sister we have that skin where we just cant use any kind a soap but this soap is the bomb and i will be ordering more in the future my skin looking good and i also can tell a difference with my sister acne thanks.</li>
            <li> Ive ben to dermatologists  ive tryed epiduo wich is 300$. Im in my early 20s. Im glad i found this stuff again i think more people showed know about this soap. A nice lady from my work gave this to me one day. I didnt think it would work just like the rest of the stuff i tryed.My face is more clear than it has ever ben and i have more convidence i love  this soap!!</li>
            <li> Great for acne and keeps skin soft as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many expensive products to clear up my skin and This is IT!!&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive but work awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my nephew and he really love it it works perfectly for him,</li>
            <li> They are pretty good, I used for my face and body, but since they leave you pretty much odorless, I tend to used a body wash lotion right after cleaning up with the soap.</li>
            <li> One bar lasts a long time. Takes all the oils out of your skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you for quality soap that  cleanses my face thoroughly. I have always had acne producing skin. This product show results of unclogging the pores as well as over time reducing pots. Thank you</li>
            <li> I just bought this today at a local place for only $5 !! Way cheaper than here total ripoff I have to say. As of my first use my face feels amazing i hope this will be the end of my search for cures :). Although I heard even eating rattle snake will do wonders??!</li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to just try something for yourself.  This &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34; soap is reported to help with acne.  I think it probably does even if only as a good glycerin soap would.  The snake oil may or may not help but if you have teen boys in need it may be the added boost to keep them washing their faces.</li>
            <li> WOW, I have to admit I was skeptical.I had never heard of this product.For years my oldest son suffered with acne.We had seen the dermatologist and tried acne washes and creams,antibiotics,nothing helped.Then my younger son started getting acne and being the little steamer he is,he found this wonderful product on Amazon. Hesitantly I purchased it and it really works,and really fast.The boys do say that it works on contact,so I would not suggest leaving it on you skin for any length of time.WOW again,This is truly amazing without any hype.</li>
            <li> The mailing service was great, I got them fast and the price was also great. But I knew the price was too good to be true, this product seems like the original one but it&#x27;s not.  The smell and the texture and color are different, and they don&#x27;t work as good as the original brand.  It was the first time I bought it from amazon, and I thought the price was good because of the quantity I was buying.  The reason why I use the rattlesnake oil soap is to control the dryness of my scalp and some acne, the original brand works great but this one doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
