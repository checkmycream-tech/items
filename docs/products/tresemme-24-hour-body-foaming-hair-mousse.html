            <li>Great price, too.</li>
            <li>It smells great, doesn&#x27;t cause a ton of build up in my hair, and there is great volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Happy with product.</li>
            <li>The price is great for the quality product that you get.</li>
            <li>It provides great body as well as volume</li>
            <li>and I get compliments all the time on how great my hair smells.</li>
            <li>This provided good volume to my normal/dry med-thick med-length hair  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This mousse is recommended for straight hair, but I have wavy hair and it is excellent.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and hope it sticks around.</li>
            <li>There is significantly more volume (that stays) when I use the mousse as opposed to going productless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheaper hair spray works better.</li>
            <li>goes on light not sticky at all so much better than hair spray</li>
            <li>Adds body and volume to fine hair.  </li>
            <li>light weight</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair full of body all</li>
            <li>I have tried many mousses that claim to volumize but this one actually works on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Affordable, smells great, and it works whether you blow dry or air dry.</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference when used properly!</li>
            <li>but makes my hair so much fuller looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just that I used too much.</li>
            <li>Several of my friends noticed how nice my hair looked after using this mousse, and they are currently ordering a bottle for themselves!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought products that were a lot more expensive and didn&#x27;t do nearly as nice of a job.</li>
            <li>Makes my fine hair feel thick and full of body.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Root Boosting Spray, but I use both the root boosting spay and the mouse daily on my fine limp hair.</li>
            <li>It will be crunchy if you apply too much mousse, so be careful.</li>
            <li>I have thin blonde hair that tends to go flat 10 minutes after blow drying, but this stuff keeps my hair looking nice all day.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin long hair.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes my fine hair feel thick and full of body. Love it!</li>
            <li> love it. light weight but makes my hair so much fuller looking.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin long hair.  I use this in my damp towel dried hair in the morning and blow dry upside down or with a round brush and my hair has texture and volume all day.  I really love this product and hope it sticks around.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have much luck with styling products, my hair is stick straight and thick. I don&#x27;t invest in high-end salon products because i can&#x27;t get them to work the same way that my hair stylist does. But one day there was a 3 for $10 sale at my local store and I picked up this product, along with some others in the same line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. That&#x27;s all I can say! It made a huge difference when used properly! Just follow the directions; put the mousse in shampooed, damp hair and blow dry upside down with a round brush. My hair looks totally voluminous and has tons of body! I love it!</li>
            <li> I must be doing something wrong because I was not lucky enough to have the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine/oily hair that must be washed daily. So after my shower, I applied a squirt of mousse to my hair and dried upside down. However, it just ended up being flat flat. Almost like I had to wash it again. Finally, I ended up putting my hair in a pony tail for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just have unruly unmanageable hair. I find it difficult to use any product without it turning oily. For me this product did not really do it for me. I plan on giving it another shot and I&#x27;m going to try to use less then the squirt I used earlier. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just that I used too much.</li>
            <li> This product does what it advertises; it gave my hair some body.... but it also left it feeling greasy. I switched to the Nexus volumizing mousse and won&#x27;t ever go back - it gives my hair body without the greasy feeling that comes with this product.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair great, long-lasting body and smells great.. Great price, too. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This mouse is wonderful.  I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and it does the trick.  Keeps my hair full of body all day.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> The best mousse for curly hair. I have searched long and hard for a brand that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This mousse is recommended for straight hair, but I have wavy hair and it is excellent. My wavy hair is very heavy, so it weighs it down at the roots, causing a &amp;#34;triangle hair&amp;#34; effect, where the roots are flat and the rest of my hair is wavy. Not cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply about an egg sized amount just to my roots, around my crown area. I just massage it in to damp roots, and then I apply different curling products to the rest of my hair. I let everything air dry. It will be crunchy if you apply too much mousse, so be careful. It smells great, doesn&#x27;t cause a ton of build up in my hair, and there is great volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this with a blow dryer on days I want to straighten my hair and I want volume at my roots. I apply it to my damp roots, as I would do when wearing my hair curly, but after this, I take a round brush and blow dry my hair. There is significantly more volume (that stays) when I use the mousse as opposed to going productless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable, smells great, and it works whether you blow dry or air dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mousses that claim to volumize but this one actually works on my fine hair. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I have terribly thinking hair.  This product gives it the extra body it needs to look like I&#x27;m trying to cover bald spots</li>
            <li> * This provided good volume to my normal/dry med-thick med-length hair  * Recommend it for others to try  * A great buy for the price</li>
            <li> Adds body and volume to fine hair.  Happy with product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It gives your hair a lot of extra body without making it hard.

I&#x27;ve bought products that were a lot more expensive and didn&#x27;t do nearly as nice of a job.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Root Boosting Spray, but I use both the root boosting spay and the mouse daily on my fine limp hair. It provides great body as well as volume and I get compliments all the time on how great my hair smells.</li>
            <li> Good product great price! goes on light not sticky at all so much better than hair spray I recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as I expected. I thought it would give some volume to my thin hair but I couldn&#x27;t see any difference. Cheaper hair spray works better.</li>
