            <li> Had to have a back&#x3D;up for my stamper.</li>
            <li> Tried without priming, wouldn&#x27;t pickup. Primed, still wouldn&#x27;t pickup. Really sick of trying different stamper heads. The only one I have found that works really well is a cheap little pink rubber one.</li>
            <li> Very deceiving description. I thought I was ordering two sets of three marshmallow heads, because the picture shows three. When I really only got two single stamper heads. NEVER ordering from this store again.</li>
            <li> It as you see it. Spongy Soft</li>
            <li> took a bit of getting used to since a lighter touch is required but the size makes it the only one that works for me.  Still have to work at keeping the sponge in the holder.  I hope that gets figured out soon.</li>
            <li> Decent refill but not marshmallow.  After I primed it, it worked fine.  Please note that seller shows 3 refill heads, but that is extremely misleading.  You only get one.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It&#x27;s big and squishy! Sooooo easy to stamp your designs. Ahoy for large designs and long nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick tip:&lt;br /&gt;Do not use cotton with acetone to remove excess polish from stamper. Use sticky tape instead.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for these they were hard and hard to use didn&#x27;t really pick up the images at all my messy mention stamping heads work fabulously but these kind of suck.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and the shipping was in reasonable time.</li>
            <li> nice to have these replacements</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only one, not three like the picture. Read carefully.</li>
            <li> Glad to have a replacement.</li>
            <li> This is a great item and I really love this. It&#x27;s a high quality rubber stamper head to use with stamping plates to make your nails look pretty.</li>
            <li> The picture shows 3 and because I did not read the description thoroughly I ended up with only 1.  1.95 + 2.95 shipping?  No, don&#x27;t do it.  Purchase the whole set, it is less expensive in the long run!!!</li>
            <li> These are NOT the sought after marshmallow stamper heads.  They are squishy firm at best.</li>
            <li> Works very well love it its not too firm n not too squishy perfect for curved nail beds</li>
