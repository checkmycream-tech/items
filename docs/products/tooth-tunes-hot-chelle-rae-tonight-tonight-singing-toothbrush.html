    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For what I paid I can honestly say it was five stars, very happy.</li>
            <li>Good idea, but the quality of this product should be improved</li>
            <li>Great service pleased with product.</li>
            <li>But It has encouraged my child to brush more!</li>
            <li>My son brushes his teeth more than ever!  </li>
            <li>And, yes, my kids fight over it even though my daughter has her own.</li>
            <li>the concept is better than the design.</li>
            <li>so I felt like the kids were doing a better job of brushing and not just sucking on the brush for the novelty of the music playing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>My son loves the toothbrush, but it would be much better if it were a spin type brush.</li>
            <li>I love Queen</li>
            <li>You is his jam :)</li>
            <li>the dentist and orthodontist are always telling him he needs to do better with brushing.  </li>
            <li>They enjoy brushing their teeth and hearing their music.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea that totally backfired.  </li>
            <li>though I tend to go for the sonic care type, this tooth brush makes it fun for kids to brush and thats worth a lot more than this brush cost.</li>
            <li>We weren’t expecting much out of this product but it really wasn’t worth buying – you can barely hear the music playing, it works best when you stop brushing and press the brush against your teeth.  </li>
            <li>My kids will listen to the tooth brush, so I&#x27;m delighted that I no longer have to fight with them about how long to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>Concept is great, but both the batteries are non replaceable, and have died less than two months</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fun for both of us</li>
            <li>My son got this and now brushes his teeth with a smile.</li>
            <li>He brushes the full 2 minutes so he can hear the whole song!</li>
            <li>the sound of the music is decent.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not going to last more than 3 months or so.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush works really well!</li>
            <li>I really thing for the money, the unit should occilate.</li>
            <li>My grandson would brush his teeth and being 7 really had no concept of what 2 minutes meant.  </li>
            <li>this really helps mt child in hsi brushing.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the kids ended up dancing far more than actually brushing.</li>
            <li>Who wants to spend $20 every time you need a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is such a fun idea.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 7 yr old- mainly because she has another one</li>
            <li>I first said his was defective because the song plays so quietly</li>
            <li>The songs are pretty quiet if you listen to them without putting the brush in your mouth, but, according to my son, when the brush is in your mouth, you can hear the songs \\&quot;in your head\\&quot;, which is what keeps him brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, when I came on Amazon &amp; saw this price, at first I thought it must be for a double pack.  </li>
            <li>Although, big box stores have it for more than half the price.</li>
            <li>sent as a gift to my 3 year old nephew.....</li>
            <li>Not too loud, and I would buy again.  </li>
            <li>We bought this for my 3 year old who loves \\&quot;we will rock</li>
            <li>But these are toothbrushes with soft bristles that don&#x27;t have replaceable heads.  </li>
            <li>Until we got these Tooth Tunes brushes, getting him to do more than a 15-second brush was a serious challenge.  </li>
            <li>We left them for our kids to use and they ended up using their old tooth brushes, there was no reason to use these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally - a toothbrush that gives my 9 year old son the incentive to actually brush for two minutes!  </li>
            <li>It used to be a chore getting my 5 year old son to brush his teeth properly.</li>

            <li> It used to be a chore getting my 5 year old son to brush his teeth properly.</li>
            <li> We love this, my 8 and 5 yr olds both randomly hum this song all day long!</li>
            <li> I do wish they were a bit cheaper, but we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts before I make a value-for-money statement.</li>
            <li> this is the coolest thing ever to help kids brush their teeth for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Paying close to $20 for a disposable toothbrush, no matter how much it sings and dances, is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This was a total hit with the 9 year old who has never liked brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was way too expensive for something that dies so quickly and can&#x27;t have it&#x27;s battery replaced.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering other songs soon.</li>
            <li> In stores and at other online sites this product is $8.99 or $9.99&lt;</li>
            <li> The selection of songs is often limited to just a few when you are there.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to mess with returning the product.</li>
            <li> but we both think the song should play a little louder..</li>
            <li> Especially with kids using them they are bound to get dirty quicker.</li>
            <li> am extremely disappointed with Amazon that they would allow such price gouging.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Like the concept, but unable to change the battery.</li>
            <li> and I hate hearing that song every morning</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great service pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I really thing for the money, the unit should occilate. I was hoping it would,  but no. But It has encouraged my child to brush more!</li>
            <li> bought two brushes for my kids for Christmas.  Concept is great, but both the batteries are non replaceable, and have died less than two months later.&lt;br /&gt;Advertisement states batteries should last 3 months!  Will not buy again!  This $9.00 toothbrush is now just a $1.00 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t hear it. HUH? What are they singing while the water is running??? the concept is better than the design.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong product. It was for a boy so I order the song by Kiss. I got a One Direction song instead. I was furious. Now I have to mess with returning the product.</li>
            <li> This was a total hit with the 9 year old who has never liked brushing his teeth. He brushes twice a day now for the entire song. I will be ordering other songs soon.</li>
            <li> Good idea, but the quality of this product should be improved</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is such a fun idea. And, yes, my kids fight over it even though my daughter has her own. I guess they both need the same song!  They enjoy brushing their teeth and hearing their music. I do wish they were a bit cheaper, but we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts before I make a value-for-money statement. I wish it combined the functionality of a Spin Brush too so I felt like the kids were doing a better job of brushing and not just sucking on the brush for the novelty of the music playing. But I can always help them brush also. I&#x27;d buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Like the concept, but unable to change the battery. The brush lost it appeal after the battery died.  Grandson wanted it to sing, so I had to purchase another singing brush.</li>
            <li> We weren’t expecting much out of this product but it really wasn’t worth buying – you can barely hear the music playing, it works best when you stop brushing and press the brush against your teeth.  We left them for our kids to use and they ended up using their old tooth brushes, there was no reason to use these.</li>
            <li> My son loves the toothbrush, but it would be much better if it were a spin type brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was way too expensive for something that dies so quickly and can&#x27;t have it&#x27;s battery replaced.  Oh, and the kids ended up dancing far more than actually brushing.</li>
            <li> sent as a gift to my 3 year old nephew.....he loves it!!</li>
            <li> My grandson would brush his teeth and being 7 really had no concept of what 2 minutes meant.  He now knows that when the music stops he is done.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea that totally backfired.  The kids just listen to the song as apposed to actually brushing their teeth.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 7 yr old- mainly because she has another one and I hate hearing that song every morning (it&#x27;s some Selena Gomez garbage). I love Queen so it&#x27;s fun for both of us</li>
            <li> My kids will listen to the tooth brush, so I&#x27;m delighted that I no longer have to fight with them about how long to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> We love this, my 8 and 5 yr olds both randomly hum this song all day long!</li>
            <li> My son loves it but we both think the song should play a little louder..I first said his was defective because the song plays so quietly</li>
            <li> My son brushes his teeth more than ever!  He brushes two or three times a day now.  It used to be a fight to get him to brush.</li>
            <li> this is the coolest thing ever to help kids brush their teeth for a long period of time. We Will Rock You is his jam :)</li>
            <li> Toothbrush encourages my reluctant son to keep brushing until the music stops and it beeps.  Not too loud, and I would buy again.  Although, big box stores have it for more than half the price.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my 3 year old who loves \\&quot;we will rock you\\&quot; The toothbrush is a bit over priced. the sound of the music is decent. But the only draw back is that you cant just replace the head of the toothbrush. It does not have replacement heads. Who wants to spend $20 every time you need a new toothbrush. Especially with kids using them they are bound to get dirty quicker.</li>
            <li> My son got this and now brushes his teeth with a smile. I have been into fancy tooth brushes for years, though I tend to go for the sonic care type, this tooth brush makes it fun for kids to brush and thats worth a lot more than this brush cost. For what I paid I can honestly say it was five stars, very happy. Please consider rating my review.</li>
            <li> this review is not for the product but for the PRICE!!! In stores and at other online sites this product is $8.99 or $9.99&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to understand why is it almost double on Amazon?!&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed with Amazon that they would allow such price gouging.</li>
            <li> The product gets 5 stars...The price at the time this review is being written gets 1 star....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally - a toothbrush that gives my 9 year old son the incentive to actually brush for two minutes!  He has an expander &amp; will soon have brackets added &amp; the dentist and orthodontist are always telling him he needs to do better with brushing.  Until we got these Tooth Tunes brushes, getting him to do more than a 15-second brush was a serious challenge.  The songs are pretty quiet if you listen to them without putting the brush in your mouth, but, according to my son, when the brush is in your mouth, you can hear the songs \\&quot;in your head\\&quot;, which is what keeps him brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I came on Amazon &amp; saw this price, at first I thought it must be for a double pack.  They sell for $7.99-8.99 at my local CVS, Rite-aid, Walgreens, Walmart, and Target stores. Last time I bought one I used a $1.00 off coupon from the local newspaper insert.  The selection of songs is often limited to just a few when you are there.  But these are toothbrushes with soft bristles that don&#x27;t have replaceable heads.  They&#x27;re not going to last more than 3 months or so. They may not be in local stores everywhere, but hopefully they are coming soon.  Paying close to $20 for a disposable toothbrush, no matter how much it sings and dances, is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> this really helps mt child in hsi brushing. before tooth tunes it was a hit and a miss, now he brushes longer</li>
            <li> This tooth brush works really well! It used to be a chore getting my 5 year old son to brush his teeth properly. He loves Queen, so when I saw Toothtunes had a \\&quot;We will rock you\\&quot; brush, i bought it as a Christmas present for him. He loves it! He brushes the full 2 minutes so he can hear the whole song!</li>
