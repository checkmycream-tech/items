            <li>and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a problem however, I wanted silver ones and the price of this was great</li>
            <li>I also pranked a best friend of mine who wanted piercings more than me</li>
            <li>Omg, these are great, I really loved them.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>I guess practise makes it kind of easier</li>
            <li>I was kind of dissapointed that they gave me all silver</li>
            <li>Lol look real!!!</li>
            <li>They gave me a variety of colors and are good quality:) I highly recommend these and the price is great!</li>
            <li>These earnings are really cute!:)</li>
            <li>they are in excellent condition and came 3 weeks early.  </li>
            <li>but I love how they look.</li>
            <li>I wanted silver anyway. :)</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>but you get the hang of them very quickly.</li>
            <li>but they aren&#x27;t durable and break easily.</li>
            <li>It was nice at first</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cool they look real but break easily</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, but i guess it&#x27;s too big for my lip.</li>
            <li>Fun for my 13 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I kinda expected more for $2</li>
            <li>Was really hoping I would get one in each color...</li>
            <li>I have wanted real piercings for a while now</li>
            <li>They came in a small package, the delivery was fast, and overall I consider this to be a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>they do pinch you for a few minutes but it stops after a bit and feels perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>no colored ones been packed its just looks old like they been not storaged well or been just laying around ,</li>
            <li>Even though they aren&#x27;t real, I can feel like I have piercings until I actually get them.  </li>
            <li>Though they make a good fake septum piercing...</li>
            <li>its kind of difficult to put them on</li>
    </ol>

            <li> its kind of difficult to put them on</li>
            <li> And hard to put on at first.</li>
            <li> so the extra pink and red rings were like an extra.</li>
            <li> i love these i got them to make my parents crazy</li>
            <li> Pink, red, and silver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get my nose pierced for a long time but been to scared.</li>
            <li> and they just scotch taped the bag closed.</li>
            <li> the other 2 are the one&#x27;s that work well.</li>
            <li> they are a little thicker than I expected</li>
            <li> They are a little difficult to maneuver at first</li>
            <li> They are way to tight.</li>
            <li> They poked holes in the skin after having on for a little while.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> of course i&#x27;m gonna use them for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Received 5 of them , one of it was Rusty another one deformed and looking rusty not made for the nose even to small as a use for ears or any else</li>
            <li> Looks real but hurts the crap out of where ever you put it on</li>
            <li> The packaging they arrived in was downright irresponsible and one of them was broken when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Came all broken and in</li>
            <li> The hoops themselves aren&#x27;t bad, just delicate.</li>
            <li> I like the punk fake rings</li>
            <li> So, I bought fake rings.  </li>
            <li> Although, They were very POORLY packaged.  </li>
            <li> also they all having a dirty silver look</li>
            <li> and she was so mad.  </li>
            <li> They wete all silver and gold, no colors. :(</li>
            <li> They are fake they are horrible</li>
            <li> AS ADVERTISED in the picture :(.</li>

            <li> I got all of them. its kind of difficult to put them on and once you put them on they start to hurt after a while leaving your ear sore. I was about to throw them away but I might just end up using them for Halloween or something.</li>
            <li> I like the punk fake rings</li>
            <li> Fun for my 13 year old daughter</li>
            <li> They wete all silver and gold, no colors. :(</li>
            <li> It was nice at first but they aren&#x27;t durable and break easily.</li>
            <li> They hurt a tiny bit but I love how they look.</li>
            <li> They are fake they are horrible they keep falling off</li>
            <li> The packaging they arrived in was downright irresponsible and one of them was broken when I opened it. The hoops themselves aren&#x27;t bad, just delicate. I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with colors. And hard to put on at first. I guess practise makes it kind of easier</li>
            <li> I kinda expected more for $2 but it&#x27;s cool they look real but break easily</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re great! i got them to trick my friends and family. and it worked perfectly! of course i&#x27;m gonna use them for everyday use. they do pinch you for a few minutes but it stops after a bit and feels perfectly fine. i gave it 4 stars because i got four silver and one blue.. even though it was supposed to come with a variety of colors. but it&#x27;s okay! I wanted silver anyway. :)</li>
            <li> It took a while, but i got them. They are easy to use, but i guess it&#x27;s too big for my lip. I use them as nose piercing. I lost 2, 1 doesn&#x27;t quite work and the other 2 are the one&#x27;s that work well. As soon as i got them, i wiped them with rubbing alcohol just in cade</li>
            <li> Looks real but hurts the crap out of where ever you put it on</li>
            <li> I was kind of dissapointed that they gave me all silver but it freaked my mom out which i wanted!</li>
            <li> Though they make a good fake septum piercing...it came with 4 pinks and a red. Was really hoping I would get one in each color...AS ADVERTISED in the picture :(.</li>
            <li> oversized, all one color, deformed</li>
            <li> i love these i got them to make my parents crazy and it worked</li>
            <li> I recieved 6 but they came in pairs of three colors- Pink, red, and silver. It wasn&#x27;t a problem however, I wanted silver ones and the price of this was great so the extra pink and red rings were like an extra. They came in a small package, the delivery was fast, and overall I consider this to be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Just got them today and I love them.  They gave me a variety of colors and are good quality:) I highly recommend these and the price is great!</li>
            <li> I have wanted real piercings for a while now but my parents wouldn&#x27;t let me.  So, I bought fake rings.  Even though they aren&#x27;t real, I can feel like I have piercings until I actually get them.  I also pranked a best friend of mine who wanted piercings more than me and she was so mad.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  they are in excellent condition and came 3 weeks early.  Although, They were very POORLY packaged.  They looked like they were just thrown into a bag and they just scotch taped the bag closed.</li>
            <li> Omg, these are great, I really loved them. I&#x27;ve been wanting to get my nose pierced for a long time but been to scared. Lol look real!!!</li>
            <li> They are way to tight. They poked holes in the skin after having on for a little while.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy!!!!  Came all broken and in tarnish silver not colored.</li>
