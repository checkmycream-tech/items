            <li>My favorite scent is Lily of the Valley</li>
            <li>I do not recommend purchasing this even though I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>More like 7 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents along with lavender</li>
            <li>I love sprinkling floral bath powders onto the mattress cover when I change the bed linens.</li>
            <li>I hope Taylor of London continues to make it for those of us who still love it.</li>
            <li>Freesia is one of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li>I think it is sure to please.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>They should  pack it better for shipping.</li>
            <li>Its light and warm.</li>
            <li>I have a bottle of Taylor&#x27;s spray cologne that I bought in London some time ago, but I can&#x27;t find any more online.</li>
            <li>The freesia fragrance is so springlike and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with Taylor&#x27;s freesia talc 3 years ago  and have been using it as if it were gold....</li>
            <li>Wonderful fragrance and not an easily found product on local store shelves.  </li>
            <li>Found my first tin of this at Home Goods store and loved it.  </li>
            <li>This works out fine for me; pretty tin, too.&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of London has a good product.</li>
            <li>a lovely light fragrance</li>
            <li>This is great to deal with the oily skin, Southern summer sweats, and night flashes.</li>
            <li>it has a rich freesia scent</li>
            <li>When I first sniffed this powder, I wasn&#x27;t too sure:</li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>That should hold me until I fall in love with a new fragrance!</li>
            <li>I used to use the toilet water and loved it.</li>
            <li>This is a super smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li>Women appreciate pretty displays of product and these look like they&#x27;ve been around the block- twice!</li>
            <li>I  have fluctuating hormones, hot flashes galore!</li>
            <li>God bless for selling a product that she loves so much!!</li>
            <li>The powder has a pleasant scent, a little stronger than Yardley products.</li>
            <li>This is a delicate scent that makes me happy every day.  </li>
            <li>The only way I could buy more was to look online and find some through AmazonSmile.  </li>
            <li>works like any other talcum powder, but, it smells nice, on ladies.  </li>
            <li>It is very refreshing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she just loves the fragrance so much.</li>
            <li>and I am very fussy...</li>
            <li>and I love the delicate clean notes.</li>
            <li>Bath powders are becoming increasingly harder to find.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;s of high quality and</li>
            <li>I wish this fragrance was available in other forms.</li>
            <li>I still want the spray cologne but have to repurchase it as the first one never came (different shipper).</li>
            <li>A terrific price for a large amount of smoothness in the summer heatwave:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for young and old alike--</li>
            <li>It is true to the freesia fragrance, and a little luxury each morning.</li>
            <li>But, if you use this on top of your lotion where you use the moisture as a base, then powdering over it, will prolong this lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love  this delicate powder!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft subtle aroma keeps me feeling and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very disappointed because I&#x27;m a Prime member and have appreciated the great shipping.</li>

            <li> works like any other talcum powder, but, it smells nice, on ladies.  my fianc&amp;eacute; and i go sock less in a lot of our shoes and talcum powder has been a staple in our household in the form of goldbond.  i wanted something nicer and ladylike so i purchased this by the nice reviews it had.  the container is beautiful.  it&#x27;ll probably last me for years.  and it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> The powder has a pleasant scent, a little stronger than Yardley products. It comes in a pretty tin; unfortunately, that tin has a leak.

            <li> I love this fragrance! Its light and warm. I have a bottle of Taylor&#x27;s spray cologne that I bought in London some time ago, but I can&#x27;t find any more online. I wish this fragrance was available in other forms.</li>
            <li> Prompt mailing. Love&lt;br /&gt;The product is great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It smells so good! Like other reviewers I was disappointed that the container was bent. I&#x27;ll definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I used to use the toilet water and loved it. This smells just like it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about a month. It is very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;If you like the smell of freesia, this will do.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome body powder!  Smells wonderful.  You should try it.</li>

            <li> This works out fine for me; pretty tin, too.&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of London has a good product. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Found my first tin of this at Home Goods store and loved it.  The only way I could buy more was to look online and find some through AmazonSmile.  I bought out a vendor&#x27;s supply from Florida.  That should hold me until I fall in love with a new fragrance!</li>
            <li> The scent is very heavy, and a bit overbearing. Only faintly like freesia, which is a pity. Still, it is usable if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> The freesia fragrance is so springlike and refreshing.  I could happily recommend it to anyone who enjoys the luxuriousness of talcum powder.</li>
            <li> Product I&#x27;s of high quality and the fragrance is like., Lying down in a field of wildflowers on a midsummer day.</li>
            <li> My 78 year mum has been using this and she just loves the fragrance so much. She tells me it reminds her of some great moments.God bless for selling a product that she loves so much!!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Taylor&#x27;s freesia talc 3 years ago  and have been using it as if it were gold....and I am very fussy...so happy I found it again!!!  Beats Johnson&#x27;s powder...Gold Bond or any of the other standards on the Market...bought 2... one for friend who introduced it to me.</li>
            <li> This is a super smelling fragrance. I used this as a child. However this one doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the one I remember! Did someone change the fragrance somehow?  But, if you use this on top of your lotion where you use the moisture as a base, then powdering over it, will prolong this lovely fragrance.</li>
