    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with this moisturizer and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Best product ever for aging skin</li>
            <li>In my opinion this  is a superb quality product that works quite well.</li>
            <li>Which is to say that its inert, non-medicinal ingredients are very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Good luck to those of you trying it out!</li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>If it was up to me, I would say that my wife doesn&#x27;t need any of this stuff to look beautiful</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m happy with it...</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great that skin can be rehydrated without being made to breakout again.</li>
            <li>I got this product for my daughter who has successfully used Proactiv products for years.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Had my wife try this cream out as she is always striving to have good skin</li>
            <li>Well received in good conditions</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s good to see you can purchase them separately now.</li>
            <li>in all, my lady is very satisfied with the Proactive+</li>
            <li>It is great for acne prone skin as it hydrates safely while also delivering anti acne medication.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad she did!</li>
            <li>it feels amazing on your skin.  </li>
            <li>hydrator is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a once a day and done kind of product.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular - no drastic change</li>
            <li>The gel does not have any kind of SPF to it and with the chemical that drys out your skin</li>
            <li>Others have commented on ingredients but honestly, I haven&#x27;t glanced at them.</li>
            <li>I found it perfect for adult skin.</li>
            <li>It is very light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>and she was quite pleased with the Proactive</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t extremely impressed with this product, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>sure you put on plenty of sunblock.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s still a bit shiny/oily for my taste, it does go on with a more matte-like finish than most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Nice light weight moisturizer for summer.  </li>
            <li>I have acne along my jawline, and I have for many years.  </li>
            <li>I tend on the dry side on the best of days.</li>
            <li>This Proactiv acne treatment cream smells and looks nice and goes on easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li>every week I started to see better results and felt my skin was smooth and</li>
            <li>It has a very, very mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I apply in the morning after I wash my face with a very mild cleanser and apply some witch hazel.</li>
            <li>so doesn&#x27;t appear to work very quickly on acne-prone areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>They report that it is working fine.</li>
            <li>They all say oil free</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t necessarily think this product is so great that you can&#x27;t shop around.</li>
            <li>The scent is also light, so there&#x27;s no issue with that.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product from Pro-Active that she would buy again and recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and hydrated but not oily.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth it !</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, leaves the skin feeling fabulous, and provides a silky smooth, soft skin feel without any greasiness on the fingers applying.</li>
            <li>The consistency is non-greasy and very light and my skin has not broken out since she started using it about three weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>I, of course, use it as part of my skin care regiment so please don&#x27;t expect this to clear up your skin all on its own.</li>
            <li>The acne fighting dose is not prescription strength so gentle for most skin types.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely feel some of the drying effects although I can also see good results.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really say this product is leaps and bounds better.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t make my skin sticky and doesn&#x27;t contribute to summer acne.</li>
            <li>As a lightweight moisturizer, it&#x27;s absorbed quickly and leaves the skin feeling dewy.</li>
            <li>Using too much of the cream can cause dry spots as I experienced 1st hand and there was no hydrating</li>
            <li>I thought coming from Proactiv, it would be a little more effective.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer - apply to dry skin, rub in, skin isn&#x27;t so dry any more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She commented on how easy it was to apply, how quickly results came in (just over one week), and how long the 3oz supply lasts (been over a month and still going strong).  </li>
            <li>Combining both seems to leave an oily mess that neither treats acne nor leaves a pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li>This does not work any better than the  previous hydrator my doctor recommended and it costs about 5 times more.  </li>
            <li>But if that&#x27;s not your situation, you&#x27;re far better off getting real medical intervention to get better skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m leaning towards pillowcase, because at the low, low concentration of salicylic acid that you&#x27;re getting out of this, it probably isn&#x27;t much more effective than, say, Burts Bees or similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the nice long swath of breakouts along my jaw that I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>last is important, since this isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>It sounds backwards but has been fine for me so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from acne my whole life (decades!).</li>
            <li>Maybe this just isn&#x27;t a great product for my skin type but it hasn&#x27;t worked well for me and to pay $70 for a 3 ounces of something, it should at least work well.</li>
            <li>The product packaging suggests you start at once a day to see how you skin reacts first and then build up to about three times a day.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is a Proactiv fan, and this moisturizer turned out to be exactly what she needed.</li>
            <li>My wife does not have the first two steps of the program, however she did use it as a moisturizer after exfoliation treatments.  </li>
            <li>but it does seem to be having a positive effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>This might be fine if you rarely break out, but you can&#x27;t rely on it if you have more serious acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of application quality, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether this was the Proactiv, or the clean pillowcase and sponge, but I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I really like what the Proactiv+</li>
            <li>and this product really helps to prevent that.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be really susceptible to the sun.</li>
            <li>Assuming the REAL price is under $20 or so, I would say go ahead and give it a try.</li>
            <li>She says it is not greasy and leaves her skin feeling soft, supple, and fresh.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really for acne.  </li>
            <li>It does work reasonably well on oily skin.  </li>
            <li>So you&#x27;ve got to see what your skin really needs or not.  </li>
            <li>Instead, I&#x27;ve gotten my clear skin back, and I love how it looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin that gets that T-zone shine very quickly.  </li>
            <li>First of all after I shower my face is super dry.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic changes, but then again, I had a pretty good regiment in place before using this product.</li>
            <li>Sadly, despite the very hefty price tag and the purpose of the product, that is pretty much all it is good for.</li>
            <li>I used this formula in combination with washing my pillowcase weekly and using a charcoal sponge during showers, with some decent results.  </li>
            <li>but it works, and I can no longer live without it...</li>
            <li>main thing this contains is salicylic acid 0.5% which helps to clear acne and skin blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried buying him facial cleansing items (Aveda for acne and generic Target brand Proactiv line more recently).</li>
            <li>As with every OTC medicine, its effectiveness is far slower and more partial than any prescription product whose strength and possible risks or side-effects are why a doctor&#x27;s supervision is required by law for their distribution and use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She has noticed no adverse effects from using this product; only beneficial results in the form of clearer skin, tighter pores and a more even skin tone with less occurrence of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a 27 year old professional who works with children and their parents, I can&#x27;t tell you how embarrassing it is to still have acne.</li>
            <li>Use this as your absolute last step when taking care of your face.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it was quite moisturizing.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product</li>
            <li>that items can be purchased separately as I used Proactiv as a young adult and had difficulties canceling their program.</li>
            <li>But overall, it&#x27;s really an acne treatment as it contains salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>Compared with the many other similar treatments I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s neither better nor worse</li>
            <li>product is a moisturizing gel and it feels cool going on and maybe a little bit sticky.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and am NEVER clear.</li>
            <li>If the price could come down, this would be worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice hydrator with a little bit of acne fighting power, but I think the same results can be had for far less money.</li>
            <li>I was concerned when I tried this cream that it would dry my skin out too much.</li>
            <li>I was an early user of Proactiv products, and only stopped when I developed an allergy to one of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m a month into my &amp;#34;90&amp;#34; day supply and the little jar seems to be holding up well, the consistency of the cream is light an airy and as long as you find your application amount</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a major acne problem</li>
            <li>It is a general anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-allergen agent.  </li>
            <li>It evens out excess oiliness and generally makes the appearance of acne prone skin look smoother.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve been using it long enough (2 weeks) to really get a feel for how my skin is doing long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We like that it is paraben-free and contains several natural ingredients to combat my facial skin concerns (acne, acne scars, and pores).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, this is the same thing you can buy for much cheaper in other over-the-counter acne creams.</li>
            <li>When I was younger and gushing oil, moisturizer was not even a consideration, but now that I&#x27;m older, my cheeks/outer portions of my face get dry from my acne medications, especially in winter.  </li>
            <li>All one has to do is take a small dab on your finger and carefully rub it on your face, leave it there, and enjoy the results around a week or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you take it easy on the lotion, it should help keep acne-prone skin from dying out without making the acne problem worse.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately the same results -- mild reddening, with no marked decrease in blackheads, or the more annoying cysts that are far too deep for this medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic changes, but then again, I had a pretty good regiment in place before using this product.</li>
            <li> Sadly, despite the very hefty price tag and the purpose of the product, that is pretty much all it is good for.</li>
            <li> I used this formula in combination with washing my pillowcase weekly and using a charcoal sponge during showers, with some decent results.  </li>
            <li> but it works, and I can no longer live without it...</li>
            <li> main thing this contains is salicylic acid 0.5% which helps to clear acne and skin blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried buying him facial cleansing items (Aveda for acne and generic Target brand Proactiv line more recently).</li>
            <li> As with every OTC medicine, its effectiveness is far slower and more partial than any prescription product whose strength and possible risks or side-effects are why a doctor&#x27;s supervision is required by law for their distribution and use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She has noticed no adverse effects from using this product; only beneficial results in the form of clearer skin, tighter pores and a more even skin tone with less occurrence of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a 27 year old professional who works with children and their parents, I can&#x27;t tell you how embarrassing it is to still have acne.</li>
            <li> Use this as your absolute last step when taking care of your face.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it was quite moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product</li>
            <li> that items can be purchased separately as I used Proactiv as a young adult and had difficulties canceling their program.</li>
            <li> But overall, it&#x27;s really an acne treatment as it contains salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> Compared with the many other similar treatments I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s neither better nor worse</li>
            <li> product is a moisturizing gel and it feels cool going on and maybe a little bit sticky.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and am NEVER clear.</li>
            <li> If the price could come down, this would be worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice hydrator with a little bit of acne fighting power, but I think the same results can be had for far less money.</li>
            <li> I was concerned when I tried this cream that it would dry my skin out too much.</li>
            <li> I was an early user of Proactiv products, and only stopped when I developed an allergy to one of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m a month into my &amp;#34;90&amp;#34; day supply and the little jar seems to be holding up well, the consistency of the cream is light an airy and as long as you find your application amount</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a major acne problem</li>
            <li> It is a general anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-allergen agent.  </li>
            <li> It evens out excess oiliness and generally makes the appearance of acne prone skin look smoother.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve been using it long enough (2 weeks) to really get a feel for how my skin is doing long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We like that it is paraben-free and contains several natural ingredients to combat my facial skin concerns (acne, acne scars, and pores).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, this is the same thing you can buy for much cheaper in other over-the-counter acne creams.</li>
            <li> When I was younger and gushing oil, moisturizer was not even a consideration, but now that I&#x27;m older, my cheeks/outer portions of my face get dry from my acne medications, especially in winter.  </li>
            <li> All one has to do is take a small dab on your finger and carefully rub it on your face, leave it there, and enjoy the results around a week or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you take it easy on the lotion, it should help keep acne-prone skin from dying out without making the acne problem worse.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately the same results -- mild reddening, with no marked decrease in blackheads, or the more annoying cysts that are far too deep for this medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lot of this goes a long way -- I&#x27;d expect this tub to last 45</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t use any other products (just washes his face in the shower with a generic male facial cleanser) and uses this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have to be extra careful using this type of product during the summer when I am outside a lot.  </li>
            <li> Other creams do serve the same purpose so really only devotees of the line will abs need this.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s active ingredient is salicylic acid and is infused into the product in quite low doses, making it benign enough to be sold as an over the counter product.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared to wait a very long time for the limited results you&#x27;re likely to get.</li>
            <li> cream also has Baikal skullcap root extract which has a long list of uses, one of them being psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> Although it is a hydrator/moisturizer it can actually dry out your skin since there is the benzoyl peroxide included</li>
            <li> We tested over a three week period and based upon our experience can only report an average result.</li>
            <li> I used only a very small amount over a week period and it dried my skin too much, so I immediately stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> The skin on my face has been very sensitive lately.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate some of Proactiv&#x27;s other products, but this is a strange combination of a &amp;#34;hydrator&amp;#34; and acne solution, which dries out skin.</li>
            <li> It comes with a tiny little spoon-type scoop and you use your fingers to apply the hydrator onto your face focusing on problem areas.  </li>
            <li> even the $5 supermarket version doesn&#x27;t seem to be that much worse for being so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> so I tend to get a few at different times in my cycle.</li>
            <li> She finds a lot of products with salicylic acid to be too harsh and irritating for my skin (combination and acne prone), but this one leaves my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I constantly have my Dr. telling me &amp;#34;moisturize after washing&amp;#34; but every product I&#x27;ve used has made me slightly greasier (eww, I know!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and I&#x27;ve broken out in no less than three different areas.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally I find it a little more difficult to apply because of that, and fairly sloppy.</li>
            <li> A little bit does go a long way, so this small tub will probably last you even longer than 90-days.</li>
            <li> I get from other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s basically just salicylic acid, just like any number of other cleansers and foundation creams.</li>
            <li> Just like any other cream.</li>
            <li> I only need to use a small amount of this product to hydrate the skin and it soaks in without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> It takes only a small amount and it worked on my oily complexion.  </li>
            <li> My teenage son has been prone to horrid breakouts this past year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously hoping that&#x27;s a typo because if that is what Proactiv expects you to pay for this, it&#x27;s a major rip off.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and there is no strong odor.</li>
            <li> Week one: I read the directions an applied the cream everyday, hoever I found that was too drying for my skin type and had to switch it up to every other day.</li>
            <li> Although I still got a few pimples (probably due to hormonal shifts over the month)</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s so you don&#x27;t over-apply, but it&#x27;s a little odd.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a jar with a little scoop for dispensing, if desired.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The salicylic acid in this product is very little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for a teen with acne to find a moisturizer that works without adding to the oil burden.</li>
            <li> It contains a small amount of salicylic acid, a known acne fighter.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, which is not something I&#x27;m used to, but I use a very tiny amount and spread it thinly, *</li>
            <li> You probably want an SPF 30 at least or you&#x27;ll burn.</li>
            <li> Knock on wood, I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost three weeks, and have shown no signs of a negative reaction.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a thick liquid rather than a cream.  </li>
            <li> The secret ingredient is a small percentage of salicylic acid which fights breakouts while you hydrate.</li>
            <li> It is expensive to use and is part three of a three step process.  </li>
            <li> That said, this is really, really expensive.</li>
            <li> but it is staggeringly expensive.</li>
            <li> If you have acne-prone skin, you know how difficult it can be to find a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it&#x27;s VERY thin.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne my whole life (decades!). When I was younger and gushing oil, moisturizer was not even a consideration, but now that I&#x27;m older, my cheeks/outer portions of my face get dry from my acne medications, especially in winter.  Moisturizer is definitely a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Proactiv+ hydrator is nice. It comes in a jar with a little scoop for dispensing, if desired.  It has a very, very mild fragrance. It is very thick, which is not something I&#x27;m used to, but I use a very tiny amount and spread it thinly, *after* applying my acne meds.  It gives a matte finish to the skin, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salicylic acid in this product is very little (0.5%)--the maximum you can buy over-the-counter is 2%.  This might be fine if you rarely break out, but you can&#x27;t rely on it if you have more serious acne. Think of it as a moisturizer only (which is what it is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it, but it&#x27;s quite pricey!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, leaves the skin feeling fabulous, and provides a silky smooth, soft skin feel without any greasiness on the fingers applying. Proactiv+ has established itself as a respected brand and this product doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have very oily skin and am NEVER clear. For a 27 year old professional who works with children and their parents, I can&#x27;t tell you how embarrassing it is to still have acne. I constantly have my Dr. telling me &amp;#34;moisturize after washing&amp;#34; but every product I&#x27;ve used has made me slightly greasier (eww, I know!). They all say oil free but my t-zone disagrees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister bought this for me as a gift and I am so glad she did! It is very light and non-greasy. I simply scoop it out with my finger, rub my hands together, then rub it onto my face and neck. When I rub my fingers together afterwards, I don&#x27;t have that residual greasy feeling I get from other moisturizers. It definitely helps keep my breakouts to a minimum. I&#x27;ve also noticed a difference in the appearance of my makeup. I used to use powder over my foundation to help eliminate some of my t-zone greasiness, but after a month of using this I am no longer using powder! Of course, with summer around the corner that may change so I&#x27;ll try to update everyone in about 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this moisturizer and recommend it to everyone. I, of course, use it as part of my skin care regiment so please don&#x27;t expect this to clear up your skin all on its own. Use this as your absolute last step when taking care of your face. Even if you apply acne cream like I do, apply this afterwards. It sounds backwards but has been fine for me so far. Good luck to those of you trying it out!</li>
            <li> The acne fighting dose is not prescription strength so gentle for most skin types.  I found it perfect for adult skin. I have been using this since February and I apply in the morning after I wash my face with a very mild cleanser and apply some witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by this product, having heard about proactive for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s basically just salicylic acid, just like any number of other cleansers and foundation creams. I noticed immediately the same results -- mild reddening, with no marked decrease in blackheads, or the more annoying cysts that are far too deep for this medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, this is the same thing you can buy for much cheaper in other over-the-counter acne creams. It was unrealistic to hope for more, but the price of the item seems to require that hope.</li>
            <li> Just like any other cream. Applies it. Sees no result</li>
            <li> Week one: I read the directions an applied the cream everyday, hoever I found that was too drying for my skin type and had to switch it up to every other day. Using too much of the cream can cause dry spots as I experienced 1st hand and there was no hydrating feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Week 2 an on! :after switching up how often I used the product every week I started to see better results and felt my skin was smooth and hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m a month into my &amp;#34;90&amp;#34; day supply and the little jar seems to be holding up well, the consistency of the cream is light an airy and as long as you find your application amount I think it&#x27;s well worth it !</li>
            <li> Had my wife try this cream out as she is always striving to have good skin and she was quite pleased with the Proactive +.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She commented on how easy it was to apply, how quickly results came in (just over one week), and how long the 3oz supply lasts (been over a month and still going strong).  All one has to do is take a small dab on your finger and carefully rub it on your face, leave it there, and enjoy the results around a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, my lady is very satisfied with the Proactive+ and will be requesting a refill when her current supply runs out.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for aging skin</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t extremely impressed with this product, especially considering the price. I appreciate some of Proactiv&#x27;s other products, but this is a strange combination of a &amp;#34;hydrator&amp;#34; and acne solution, which dries out skin. Combining both seems to leave an oily mess that neither treats acne nor leaves a pleasant feeling. Maybe this just isn&#x27;t a great product for my skin type but it hasn&#x27;t worked well for me and to pay $70 for a 3 ounces of something, it should at least work well. I can&#x27;t recommend it although I will keep using it to see if my skin &amp;#34;adjusts&amp;#34; to it somehow. So far the results are not promising.</li>
            <li> Well received in good conditions</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter have been using this for some time. They report that it is working fine. Pricey for a .5 salicylic acid cream. No redness resulted from its use. Just seems quite pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li> I really like what the Proactiv+ Complexion Perfecting Hydrator is doing for my face. First of all after I shower my face is super dry. I only need to use a small amount of this product to hydrate the skin and it soaks in without a greasy feel. I am noticing smaller pores and this is coming from someone that uses a 10X magnifying mirror. I do at my age,68, still have a tendency to break out and this product really helps to prevent that. In my opinion this  is a superb quality product that works quite well. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a solid performer and i&#x27;m happy with it...I don&#x27;t have a major acne problem but i do have some blemishes, dryness and overall often unclear complexion. For that it has been helpful my pores are smaller and my troubled areas are looking better (clear/smooth). A little goes a long way and there is no strong odor. It is a bit pricey so if you are of a mind to save some bucks you can find cheaper products with the same &amp;#34;key&amp;#34; ingredients. I would recommend it it works well no surprise there its Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my daughter who has successfully used Proactiv products for years.&lt;br /&gt;The main thing this contains is salicylic acid 0.5% which helps to clear acne and skin blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream also has Baikal skullcap root extract which has a long list of uses, one of them being psoriasis.  It is a general anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-allergen agent.  There is also sophora angustifolia and licorice root extract which is sometimes found in cosmetics for skin-whitening effects. Morus Alba, or white mulberry prevents the formation of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  My daughter finds that it clears up acne and brightens skin.  It evens out excess oiliness and generally makes the appearance of acne prone skin look smoother.  She uses it with companion products such as the skin exfoliator and pore-targeting treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has noticed no adverse effects from using this product; only beneficial results in the form of clearer skin, tighter pores and a more even skin tone with less occurrence of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product does hydrate as promised.  It takes only a small amount and it worked on my oily complexion.  I had no adverse reaction to the product.  It is expensive to use and is part three of a three step process.  I have not used the products for step one or two.  This does not work any better than the  previous hydrator my doctor recommended and it costs about 5 times more.  I will go back to it after I finish using this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product after cleansing my face. It has salicylate acid in it but is not too drying. I was surprised that it was quite moisturizing. After one application, it cleared a pimple.</li>
            <li> Proactiv makes me feel like a metrosexual product junkie...but it works, and I can no longer live without it...</li>
            <li> I was never a fan of the Proactiv subscription model (I had some difficulties canceling my subscription), but I was a fan of the Proactiv products. So, it&#x27;s good to see you can purchase them separately now. That said, this is really, really expensive. Given the amount that you need to use, this should last the 90 days they are forecasting. Still, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot of bang for the buck. It&#x27;s a nice hydrator with a little bit of acne fighting power, but I think the same results can be had for far less money. Overall, I the product has been working well enough. I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic changes, but then again, I had a pretty good regiment in place before using this product. So, it seems to be keeping everything going well. That said, I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend $23/month for this product. If the price could come down, this would be worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is LOADED with comedogenic/mildly comedogenic ingredients. I broke out immediately with bumps everywhere on my face. You are taking your chances. I can&#x27;t imagine why they would include squalane in a product for acne sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;Comedogenic: Squalane&lt;br /&gt;Mildly comedogenic: Butylene Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Hexylene Glycol, Safflower Oil/palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters</li>
            <li> As a lightweight moisturizer, it&#x27;s absorbed quickly and leaves the skin feeling dewy. It&#x27;s basically a salicylic acid treatment but has a very low percentage so doesn&#x27;t appear to work very quickly on acne-prone areas. The product is odorless and leaves no indication that it&#x27;s been applied. Compared with the many other similar treatments I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s neither better nor worse but it is staggeringly expensive. Compared with a $12 Burts Bees equivalent, there&#x27;s no noticeable difference and even the $5 supermarket version doesn&#x27;t seem to be that much worse for being so much cheaper. We tested over a three week period and based upon our experience can only report an average result.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve been using it long enough (2 weeks) to really get a feel for how my skin is doing long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a moisturizing gel and it feels cool going on and maybe a little bit sticky. It comes with a tiny little spoon-type scoop and you use your fingers to apply the hydrator onto your face focusing on problem areas.  Although it is a hydrator/moisturizer it can actually dry out your skin since there is the benzoyl peroxide included but it is a smaller amount - .5% I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a once a day and done kind of product. The product packaging suggests you start at once a day to see how you skin reacts first and then build up to about three times a day.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day: morning and bedtime and I definitely feel some of the drying effects although I can also see good results.  Nothing spectacular - no drastic change but it does seem to be having a positive effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - if you are going outside while using this make sure you put on plenty of sunblock.  The gel does not have any kind of SPF to it and with the chemical that drys out your skin you&#x27;ll be really susceptible to the sun. You probably want an SPF 30 at least or you&#x27;ll burn.</li>
            <li> My teenage son has been prone to horrid breakouts this past year. I have tried buying him facial cleansing items (Aveda for acne and generic Target brand Proactiv line more recently). This is more expensive than both but it&#x27;s the only thing he will use. The Avenda line didn&#x27;t work at all for him. It&#x27;s like pulling teeth to get this kid to use anything on his face (even though he hates the pimples) but he will use this. He doesn&#x27;t use any other products (just washes his face in the shower with a generic male facial cleanser) and uses this lotion. His skin has cleared up A LOT. My teenage daughter and others  have commented on it. I like that items can be purchased separately as I used Proactiv as a young adult and had difficulties canceling their program. Others have commented on ingredients but honestly, I haven&#x27;t glanced at them. It&#x27;s working for my son and I would buy this again for my son (or my daughter).</li>
            <li> I was an early user of Proactiv products, and only stopped when I developed an allergy to one of the ingredients.  Knock on wood, I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost three weeks, and have shown no signs of a negative reaction.  Instead, I&#x27;ve gotten my clear skin back, and I love how it looks and feels.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> If you have acne-prone skin, you know how difficult it can be to find a moisturizer. It seems like they all either break you out or make you shiny. This moisturizer by Proactiv has been working well for me. The secret ingredient is a small percentage of salicylic acid which fights breakouts while you hydrate. A little bit does go a long way, so this small tub will probably last you even longer than 90-days. Although it&#x27;s still a bit shiny/oily for my taste, it does go on with a more matte-like finish than most moisturizers. Also I haven&#x27;t noticed any chemical burns or redness which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: The current price on Amazon.com is $69.95. I&#x27;m seriously hoping that&#x27;s a typo because if that is what Proactiv expects you to pay for this, it&#x27;s a major rip off. There are lots of hydrators with salicylic acid and I can&#x27;t really say this product is leaps and bounds better. I like the less-oily appearance it has, but there&#x27;s no way I would ever pay $70. Assuming the REAL price is under $20 or so, I would say go ahead and give it a try. For those of us with acne-prone skin, you will definitely need a moisturizer with some trace of salicylic acid - but I don&#x27;t necessarily think this product is so great that you can&#x27;t shop around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for a teen with acne to find a moisturizer that works without adding to the oil burden. My daughter is a Proactiv fan, and this moisturizer turned out to be exactly what she needed. It&#x27;s lightweight, so the skin isn&#x27;t clogged. The scent is also light, so there&#x27;s no issue with that. It contains a small amount of salicylic acid, a known acne fighter. And a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last is important, since this isn&#x27;t cheap. If you take it easy on the lotion, it should help keep acne-prone skin from dying out without making the acne problem worse. My daughter likes it, so I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was concerned when I tried this cream that it would dry my skin out too much. I tend on the dry side on the best of days. That didn&#x27;t happen. It seemed to keep any acne at bay while I used it. I&#x27;m 40 so I tend to get a few at different times in my cycle. The scent is pleasant. A lot of this goes a long way -- I&#x27;d expect this tub to last 45+ days based on my current use. Now I&#x27;ve got my 14 yo trying it to see how it works with her skin.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle hydrator.  It is great for acne prone skin as it hydrates safely while also delivering anti acne medication. it feels amazing on your skin.  thank you Proactiv!</li>
            <li> My wife does not have the first two steps of the program, however she did use it as a moisturizer after exfoliation treatments.  She says it is not greasy and leaves her skin feeling soft, supple, and fresh.  The added bonus of the vitamins and any anti-microbial effect are added bonuses for her.</li>
            <li> If you have acne but don&#x27;t have health insurance and can&#x27;t pay out of pocket to see a dermatologist, get this product. Otherwise, save your money. This Proactiv acne treatment cream smells and looks nice and goes on easily and cleanly. Which is to say that its inert, non-medicinal ingredients are very pleasant. However, it&#x27;s active ingredient is salicylic acid and is infused into the product in quite low doses, making it benign enough to be sold as an over the counter product. As with every OTC medicine, its effectiveness is far slower and more partial than any prescription product whose strength and possible risks or side-effects are why a doctor&#x27;s supervision is required by law for their distribution and use. So if you can&#x27;t afford to see a doctor to get your skin cleared up, this may help. Just be prepared to wait a very long time for the limited results you&#x27;re likely to get. But if that&#x27;s not your situation, you&#x27;re far better off getting real medical intervention to get better skin.</li>
            <li> If it was up to me, I would say that my wife doesn&#x27;t need any of this stuff to look beautiful but she has tried several pricey facial moisturizers for my acne-prone skin and this is one of her favorites.  We like that it is paraben-free and contains several natural ingredients to combat my facial skin concerns (acne, acne scars, and pores).  She finds a lot of products with salicylic acid to be too harsh and irritating for my skin (combination and acne prone), but this one leaves my skin soft and clear. The consistency is non-greasy and very light and my skin has not broken out since she started using it about three weeks ago.  She wouldn&#x27;t say her pores are smaller but rather her skin overall looks smoother and brighter. It works well under foundation as well, so she applies it morning and night.  Overall, a great product from Pro-Active that she would buy again and recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is billed as a complexion hydrator but it&#x27;s really for acne.  It does work reasonably well on oily skin.  But overall, it&#x27;s really an acne treatment as it contains salicylic acid.  So you&#x27;ve got to see what your skin really needs or not.  It&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  Definitely try this out only on a small part of your face first just in case you have a reaction.  Beyond that, it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this $70 product didn&#x27;t do much more than similar $20 products.  I have to be extra careful using this type of product during the summer when I am outside a lot.  I used only a very small amount over a week period and it dried my skin too much, so I immediately stopped using it.  The skin on my face has been very sensitive lately.  I have dry skin that gets that T-zone shine very quickly.  I don&#x27;t think this product was meant for skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Nice light weight moisturizer for summer.  Absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t make my skin sticky and doesn&#x27;t contribute to summer acne. My skin looks smooth and hydrated but not oily.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind trying steps 1 &amp; 2 of this Proactiv+ system.</li>
            <li> Any acne treatment causes drying of the skin so it&#x27;s great that skin can be rehydrated without being made to breakout again. Texture and smell of product match others in proactive line. Other creams do serve the same purpose so really only devotees of the line will abs need this.</li>
            <li> I have acne along my jawline, and I have for many years.  I used this formula in combination with washing my pillowcase weekly and using a charcoal sponge during showers, with some decent results.  Although I still got a few pimples (probably due to hormonal shifts over the month) I didn&#x27;t get the nice long swath of breakouts along my jaw that I&#x27;m used to.  I&#x27;m not sure whether this was the Proactiv, or the clean pillowcase and sponge, but I&#x27;m pleased. I&#x27;m leaning towards pillowcase, because at the low, low concentration of salicylic acid that you&#x27;re getting out of this, it probably isn&#x27;t much more effective than, say, Burts Bees or similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of application quality, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty decent.  It comes with a spoon (!) to scoop it out with.  Who uses a spoon to put on moisturizer?  I suppose it&#x27;s so you don&#x27;t over-apply, but it&#x27;s a little odd.  Secondly, it&#x27;s VERY thin.  It&#x27;s almost like a thick liquid rather than a cream.  Personally I find it a little more difficult to apply because of that, and fairly sloppy.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer - apply to dry skin, rub in, skin isn&#x27;t so dry any more. Sadly, despite the very hefty price tag and the purpose of the product, that is pretty much all it is good for. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and I&#x27;ve broken out in no less than three different areas. I don&#x27;t recommend this. I thought coming from Proactiv, it would be a little more effective.</li>
