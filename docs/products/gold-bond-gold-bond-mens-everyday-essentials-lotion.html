            <li>It smells good and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>I headed to the store to buy some more of this amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best mens lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The best part about this lotion is how quickly it gets absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, feels good and really makes my hands feel softer and hydrated.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a very smooth application.  </li>
            <li>and my face looks very smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li>Good lotion that does not leave the greasy feeling, soaks in quickly and off</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and is easy to apply.</li>

            <li>more thing, I even like the scent</li>
            <li>Favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>but kinda over priced it does noting better then</li>
            <li>pleased with results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Daughter likes more that my husband and took it from him</li>
            <li>and I had to get more for him.</li>
            <li>Not floral or perfumey like many others.</li>
            <li>and I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>What more can you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pleased with product.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, absorbs into skin fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling grody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But many lotions do this.</li>
            <li>I prefer St. Ives Naturaly Indulgent a much better product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have never been the type of guy to wear lotion but mostly because it&#x27;s too greasy or it smells girly.</li>
            <li>After many years of searching I have found an after shave lotion that soothes and calms my face but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is reasonably inexpensive is also a great plus.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and seems to work OK.</li>
            <li>My son-in-law likes this and was pleased that I gave it to him.  </li>
            <li>Most lotions I try seem to take forever to soak in/ dry/ absorb.  </li>
            <li>Great product, really fast absorption.</li>
            <li>so I am pleased to use this product.</li>
            <li>I had severe skin itching for many days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Gold Bond foot balm for many years, but never any Gold Bond body lotion.</li>
            <li>So far this has been awesome and leaving my skin very nice and never dry, even when I forget for a day or three.</li>
            <li>Non Greasey, dries quick and has a nice smell thats not over powering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend highly to friends :o)</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer with a non-descript, but slightly masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>So far its great</li>
            <li>Good stuff works real well</li>
            <li>This lotion is very quick to absorb into the skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy like Vasoline brand, it absorbs very quickly and does not smell &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But the scent is too strong to use on my face, so thus 3 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was hoping the scent wasn&#x27;t too strong, but it is for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Good overall lotion but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong, though.</li>
            <li>this is a good brand of lotion and this particular one works well.</li>
            <li>but I find the fragrance too strong.</li>
            <li>I would buy more once I finish the one I have right now. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>i like this product is very good for the face when the skin is dry</li>
            <li>The smell is incredible and my hands are no longer dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light, it goes on easy, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way it absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>Only wish it had a more pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my body very smooth and fresh</li>
            <li>My husband has a huge pet peeve about lotions but this does not creep him out to use.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, it arrived wrapped in its own plastic bag because the top was almost completely unscrewed and there was spilled lotion in the bag and all over the bottle itself.  </li>
            <li>Smooth like silk....</li>
            <li>Took a while to get to Australia but was worth the wait :-)</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>However it works fantastic and keeps skin from drying</li>
            <li>Smells like i sprayed cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for men, especially after the gym steam room.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great especially on Men&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample with an on-line order from a sporting goods store.</li>
            <li>However, as a welcome change it does pump out much faster (makes sense considering its so much thinner) and unlike some products I have placed on my face this one does not burn.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with how fast it absorbs and it really does make your skin feel great for a long time.</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent which is fine</li>
            <li>great mens lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li>While I do like the triple action with aloe version better - I love the scent of this one.</li>
            <li>For older men without a lot of money this is a perfect product for reducing the dry, wrinkling skin we all get in the process of&lt;br /&gt;ageing</li>
            <li>This is some great lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>despite what it says it is a little greasy, but all in all very good</li>
            <li>Works great on dry skin!</li>
            <li>It does a great job against super dry skin brought on by never ending winter months of Moscow.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin perfect after hard workout.</li>
            <li>If is good enough for Shack if good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Great fantastic lotion, works great, wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li>This lotion did a very good job keeping my skin in good shape and a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li>Smells good, not an over powering or cologne type smell, but overall a clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Very good product for dry skin particularly in the winter.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Adequate although my face seemed to get bumpy and break out after using it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been trying to find an adequate one ever since.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands sticky.  </li>
            <li>the gold bond lotion rubs right in, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it smells clean, not over powering, and not like the powder, I use it every day</li>
            <li>and this helps ten fold plus smells great with the polo cologne I wear definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on my dark skin ,  look shinny all day.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good hand lotion for a long time.  </li>
            <li>My skin can get dry in the winter, but this lotion has done a good job keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li>Its fast absorbing but smells way too strong!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li>recommend Highly!!!</li>
            <li>and there were small samples in our room and instantly loved it!</li>
            <li>This is the cure, it is absorbed and gone from skin surface in 15 seconds or less and leaves you feeling great.</li>
            <li>Works very well for everyday use and smells great, not too strong.</li>
            <li>Most lotions that I&#x27;ve tried have been mostly water based and very loose.</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It does need to be rubbed in, both to be absorbed and to provide coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I liked it but couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the local stores.</li>
            <li>better half, who is sensitive to this sort of thing, says that the scent is pleasant and that she likes it.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after toweling off from the shower.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast, pleasant scent, gentle enough to use on face</li>
            <li>I am new to lotion and this was a good starting point.</li>
            <li>Price is higher than some, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe my body, to a large degree, needed this lotion!  </li>
            <li>The only way to get the great benefits from this bottle of lotion is to use it daily.  </li>
            <li>It rubs in to your skin very quickly and leaves your hands with simply a soft feeling.</li>
            <li>The smell is definitely masculine (possibly bordering on \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;), and the lotion itself is good.  </li>
            <li>The Gold Bond goes on well, you don&#x27;t need very much, and it rubs in well.</li>
            <li>Smells better than I expected, and it absorbed extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>As an avid swimmer, I need to use lotion</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better, is some protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>I love this all will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Just tried this out for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I also have a smaller tube of this stuff that I use after working out, smell isn&#x27;t as noticeable if putting on and heading out though still quite potent.</li>
            <li>so be aware.</li>
            <li>OK, if Shaq is man enough to use it so am I.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>I noticed the bottle design was definitely geared more to a guys attention.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this lotion, especially the smell.  </li>
            <li>I found this lotion last year and love it.</li>
            <li>gets absorbed fast and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>First lotion that has ever made me peel.</li>
            <li>My husband love the smell and he loves the way the lotion holds up in the winter time when he works outside.</li>
            <li>As if you didn&#x27;t love the Gold Bond company enough...</li>
            <li>I first used this product when I was away on a ski vacation</li>
            <li>Wish it had no scent to it or dial it back by like 70% or more.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion that I have tried that doesn&#x27;t act that way.  </li>
            <li>Only thing that could make it better is bacon.</li>
            <li>Use this lotion everyday and have seen good results.</li>
            <li>so I picked Gold Bond Men&#x27;s Everyday Essentials Lotion after reading some good reviews.</li>
            <li>recommend this as it seems to clear up dry skin pretty quick and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Absorbs extremely well, nice scent</li>
            <li>any other kind</li>
            <li>It does, however, have a fairly strong smell to it, kind of like they were trying too hard to make it &amp;#34;masculine.&amp;#34;  I will not be purchasing again for my pre-bed routine since it is just too strong of a smell for me personally, actually makes my eyes water sometimes lying in bed.  </li>
            <li>It has very little scent, albeit a good one.  </li>
            <li>My fingers get cracked from water and this stuff heals it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t replace the usual Gold Bond for hand moisturizer as it is just not that good a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice, dries relatively quickly, not too &amp;#34;greasy.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion I have horribly dry hands</li>
            <li>It sinks in or is absorbed fairly quickly, you want to spread it around right away.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just lotion,but I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>This lotion works very well.</li>
            <li>Fast drying and not &#x27;perfumed&#x27;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works really well after working on bikes or computers all day.</li>
            <li>Very soothing, like it after shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t require much to get coverage, just quarter sized dabs for each lower leg.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>This stuff is for real.</li>
            <li>Everyone that has tried it at work (where I keep a bottle) really likes it.</li>
            <li>Says it&#x27;s non-greasy; is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also a bit much.</li>
            <li>Because this soaks into your skin fast, you have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The sun really dries out my skin</li>
            <li>very my hands crack from doing dishes all the time and hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(maybe too much lotion?).</li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle and pleasant and the lotion is NOT greasy.</li>
            <li>Gold Bond also offers a money back \\&quot;love it or return it</li>
            <li>Not as good as for the hands as most other Gold Bond products since its not as thick.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin from becoming dry.  </li>
            <li>Most other lotions needed re-applying every time I washed my hands.</li>
            <li>Good Scent and keeps you feeling fresh in the Harsh Chicago winter where your skin gets very dry and chapped.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t go with the &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s&amp;#34; version of this product, Gold Bond in general is worth the money in the lotion category.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different lotions in the past, and this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a mens facial moisturizer that isn&#x27;t stuffed full of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>For black males, Aveeno is a much better product.</li>
            <li>This one has a slight &amp;#34;clean smell&amp;#34;.. which I really love.</li>
            <li>Love the slight scent and feel after use.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great, maybe a little on the greasy/shiny side but good for dry skin and this big bottle is cheaper than the small squeeze container the stores sell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a strong scent at all, but it&#x27;s nice when your hands come near your face</li>
            <li>Just needs to be checked better for a tight seal before shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical at first because I thought Gold Bond was an old-timey formula, but this is a very modern scent to it.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommended and worth the value.</li>
            <li>Gold Bond Men&#x27;s Everyday Lotion took care of the problem better than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I also shave my head and would always put something on to prevent drying, the products I used were very limited due to the sting associated with razor burn, but Gold Bond Men&#x27;s does not stink when I apply it to a freshly shaved head :)</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to men who want a more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; lotion that works well on dry and cracked skin.</li>
            <li>I saw this in a commercial and right then and there did a one-click buy to try</li>
            <li>I guess those are the only things guys use lotion for right.</li>
            <li>Great lotion especially for sensitive skin and dry skin due to winter harshness</li>
            <li>but I live up North.  </li>
            <li>Within minutes after showering and applying this lotion, I was a new person.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a very light fragrance that is not overwhelming</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel slimy, sticky, or overly feminine, and the smell is manly enough that females who get near you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle and nice, the product does everything the manufacturer claims, and the price is</li>
            <li>it says, it leaves no greasy feel and it does seem to dry into the skin rather quickly.</li>
            <li>One of the other things I like about this lotion is that the next time Im in the shower, my skin feels very smooth</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you have sensitive and irritable skin.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and normal.</li>
            <li>Feels like it absorbs in to skin better than others I have tried in past.</li>
            <li>for buying it on Amazon, I have found it for the same exact price at Wal-mart before</li>
            <li>I used to use the regular Gold Bond lotion and it seemed to work pretty well</li>
            <li>Everyone in the house uses this I&#x27;m not sure why they call it just for men fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>cream quickly and easily spreads, and does not leave behind any slick/greasy/sticky</li>
            <li>For years I would just use Lubriderm Advanced Therapy for Extra Dry Skin, and just cake it on.</li>
            <li>and the air seems to just suck the moisture right out of my skin, making my hands look really dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>It makes his skin so soft and takes away the ashy dryness.</li>
            <li>He really likes the feel and scent of this lotion and we will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>am a Type-II diabetic and keeping my feet hydrated, soft and supple is essential.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used many different lotions, cheap and expensive.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Gold Bond for having products that actually work.</li>
            <li>My boot socks show no traces and it washes off my hands completely with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Leaving your skin natural feeling.</li>
            <li>Soft, but manly soft.</li>
            <li>My hands, face and arms are so soft now.  </li>
            <li>It smells like my old YSL cologne I used to use.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is the scent is absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>I cannot come near anything with added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good smelling, a little on the small side though.</li>
            <li>A bottle this size typically does not last more than a month if you apply daily.</li>
            <li>I wear high boot socks, compression support and usually mid boots or hikers.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed completely, it doesn&#x27;t make a mess or stain your clothes.</li>
            <li>so my hands get pretty rough.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly for my hands as winters here are especially rough and my hands get very dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>my hands have been dry and chapped looking and now that is all gone and not the greasy feeling like you get from other lotions this stuff absorbs into your skin and leaves it smooth and refreshed and its made for body and face as well..</li>
            <li>Finally I decided to try something new</li>
            <li>It works very well for my dry skin problems.</li>
            <li>Gold Bond is long lasting and works very well.</li>
            <li>I had gotten 2 free small tubes of it when I bought some Gold Bond powder locally and after i tried it I was hooked.</li>
            <li>and you barely notice you have lotion on after application, so</li>
            <li>I can barely detect one.</li>
            <li>I only use natural products that contain plant oils or beeswax.</li>
            <li>Has a nice faint scent, not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>At 66 the dry skin is all over and the normal lotions did nothing.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older (50+), I have been having patches of dry skin on my legs hips that would last all winter.  </li>
            <li>but my hands crack a lot in cold weather and this not only helps prevent that, but also isn&#x27;t greasy and smells good.</li>
            <li>From the advertising, I expected this to have some sort of \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent, but otherwise be decent hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>The skin was much softer and less flaky.  </li>
            <li>Now, a week out and the dry patch of skin is completely healed.</li>
            <li>This is a decent everyday solution for you are starting to get old.</li>
            <li>My dry, cracked hands were touchably soft after only a day or two of application!</li>
            <li>It really keeps my body comfortable in the cold days.</li>

            <li> This stuff smells great, absorbs into skin fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling grody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But many lotions do this.</li>
            <li> I prefer St. Ives Naturaly Indulgent a much better product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have never been the type of guy to wear lotion but mostly because it&#x27;s too greasy or it smells girly.</li>
            <li> After many years of searching I have found an after shave lotion that soothes and calms my face but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is reasonably inexpensive is also a great plus.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and seems to work OK.</li>
            <li> My son-in-law likes this and was pleased that I gave it to him.  </li>
            <li> Most lotions I try seem to take forever to soak in/ dry/ absorb.  </li>
            <li> Great product, really fast absorption.</li>
            <li> so I am pleased to use this product.</li>
            <li> I had severe skin itching for many days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gold Bond foot balm for many years, but never any Gold Bond body lotion.</li>
            <li> So far this has been awesome and leaving my skin very nice and never dry, even when I forget for a day or three.</li>
            <li> Non Greasey, dries quick and has a nice smell thats not over powering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend highly to friends :o)</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer with a non-descript, but slightly masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> So far its great</li>
            <li> Good stuff works real well</li>
            <li> This lotion is very quick to absorb into the skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy like Vasoline brand, it absorbs very quickly and does not smell &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But the scent is too strong to use on my face, so thus 3 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was hoping the scent wasn&#x27;t too strong, but it is for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Good overall lotion but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong, though.</li>
            <li> this is a good brand of lotion and this particular one works well.</li>
            <li> but I find the fragrance too strong.</li>
            <li> I would buy more once I finish the one I have right now. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> i like this product is very good for the face when the skin is dry</li>
            <li> The smell is incredible and my hands are no longer dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light, it goes on easy, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way it absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Only wish it had a more pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my body very smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> My husband has a huge pet peeve about lotions but this does not creep him out to use.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, it arrived wrapped in its own plastic bag because the top was almost completely unscrewed and there was spilled lotion in the bag and all over the bottle itself.  </li>
            <li> Smooth like silk....</li>
            <li> Took a while to get to Australia but was worth the wait :-)</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> However it works fantastic and keeps skin from drying</li>
            <li> Smells like i sprayed cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for men, especially after the gym steam room.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great especially on Men&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample with an on-line order from a sporting goods store.</li>
            <li> However, as a welcome change it does pump out much faster (makes sense considering its so much thinner) and unlike some products I have placed on my face this one does not burn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with how fast it absorbs and it really does make your skin feel great for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has a mild scent which is fine</li>
            <li> great mens lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li> While I do like the triple action with aloe version better - I love the scent of this one.</li>
            <li> For older men without a lot of money this is a perfect product for reducing the dry, wrinkling skin we all get in the process of&lt;br /&gt;ageing</li>
            <li> This is some great lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li> despite what it says it is a little greasy, but all in all very good</li>
            <li> Works great on dry skin!</li>
            <li> It does a great job against super dry skin brought on by never ending winter months of Moscow.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin perfect after hard workout.</li>
            <li> If is good enough for Shack if good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Great fantastic lotion, works great, wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> This lotion did a very good job keeping my skin in good shape and a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> Smells good, not an over powering or cologne type smell, but overall a clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Very good product for dry skin particularly in the winter.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Adequate although my face seemed to get bumpy and break out after using it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been trying to find an adequate one ever since.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands sticky.  </li>
            <li> the gold bond lotion rubs right in, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it smells clean, not over powering, and not like the powder, I use it every day</li>
            <li> and this helps ten fold plus smells great with the polo cologne I wear definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on my dark skin ,  look shinny all day.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good hand lotion for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My skin can get dry in the winter, but this lotion has done a good job keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li> Its fast absorbing but smells way too strong!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> recommend Highly!!!</li>
            <li> and there were small samples in our room and instantly loved it!</li>
            <li> This is the cure, it is absorbed and gone from skin surface in 15 seconds or less and leaves you feeling great.</li>
            <li> Works very well for everyday use and smells great, not too strong.</li>
            <li> Most lotions that I&#x27;ve tried have been mostly water based and very loose.</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It does need to be rubbed in, both to be absorbed and to provide coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I liked it but couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the local stores.</li>
            <li> better half, who is sensitive to this sort of thing, says that the scent is pleasant and that she likes it.</li>
            <li> I put it on right after toweling off from the shower.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast, pleasant scent, gentle enough to use on face</li>
            <li> I am new to lotion and this was a good starting point.</li>
            <li> Price is higher than some, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my body, to a large degree, needed this lotion!  </li>
            <li> The only way to get the great benefits from this bottle of lotion is to use it daily.  </li>
            <li> It rubs in to your skin very quickly and leaves your hands with simply a soft feeling.</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely masculine (possibly bordering on \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;), and the lotion itself is good.  </li>
            <li> The Gold Bond goes on well, you don&#x27;t need very much, and it rubs in well.</li>
            <li> Smells better than I expected, and it absorbed extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> As an avid swimmer, I need to use lotion</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better, is some protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> I love this all will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Just tried this out for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I also have a smaller tube of this stuff that I use after working out, smell isn&#x27;t as noticeable if putting on and heading out though still quite potent.</li>
            <li> so be aware.</li>
            <li> OK, if Shaq is man enough to use it so am I.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> I noticed the bottle design was definitely geared more to a guys attention.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this lotion, especially the smell.  </li>
            <li> I found this lotion last year and love it.</li>
            <li> gets absorbed fast and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> First lotion that has ever made me peel.</li>
            <li> My husband love the smell and he loves the way the lotion holds up in the winter time when he works outside.</li>
            <li> As if you didn&#x27;t love the Gold Bond company enough...</li>
            <li> I first used this product when I was away on a ski vacation</li>
            <li> Wish it had no scent to it or dial it back by like 70% or more.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion that I have tried that doesn&#x27;t act that way.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that could make it better is bacon.</li>
            <li> Use this lotion everyday and have seen good results.</li>
            <li> so I picked Gold Bond Men&#x27;s Everyday Essentials Lotion after reading some good reviews.</li>
            <li> recommend this as it seems to clear up dry skin pretty quick and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Absorbs extremely well, nice scent</li>
            <li> any other kind</li>
            <li> It does, however, have a fairly strong smell to it, kind of like they were trying too hard to make it &amp;#34;masculine.&amp;#34;  I will not be purchasing again for my pre-bed routine since it is just too strong of a smell for me personally, actually makes my eyes water sometimes lying in bed.  </li>
            <li> It has very little scent, albeit a good one.  </li>
            <li> My fingers get cracked from water and this stuff heals it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t replace the usual Gold Bond for hand moisturizer as it is just not that good a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice, dries relatively quickly, not too &amp;#34;greasy.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion I have horribly dry hands</li>
            <li> It sinks in or is absorbed fairly quickly, you want to spread it around right away.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just lotion,but I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast drying and not &#x27;perfumed&#x27;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works really well after working on bikes or computers all day.</li>
            <li> Very soothing, like it after shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t require much to get coverage, just quarter sized dabs for each lower leg.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is for real.</li>
            <li> Everyone that has tried it at work (where I keep a bottle) really likes it.</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s non-greasy; is very greasy.  </li>
            <li> The smell is also a bit much.</li>
            <li> Because this soaks into your skin fast, you have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The sun really dries out my skin</li>
            <li> very my hands crack from doing dishes all the time and hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (maybe too much lotion?).</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and pleasant and the lotion is NOT greasy.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond also offers a money back \\&quot;love it or return it</li>
            <li> Not as good as for the hands as most other Gold Bond products since its not as thick.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep my skin from becoming dry.  </li>
            <li> Most other lotions needed re-applying every time I washed my hands.</li>
            <li> Good Scent and keeps you feeling fresh in the Harsh Chicago winter where your skin gets very dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t go with the &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s&amp;#34; version of this product, Gold Bond in general is worth the money in the lotion category.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different lotions in the past, and this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mens facial moisturizer that isn&#x27;t stuffed full of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> For black males, Aveeno is a much better product.</li>
            <li> This one has a slight &amp;#34;clean smell&amp;#34;.. which I really love.</li>
            <li> Love the slight scent and feel after use.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great, maybe a little on the greasy/shiny side but good for dry skin and this big bottle is cheaper than the small squeeze container the stores sell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong scent at all, but it&#x27;s nice when your hands come near your face</li>
            <li> Just needs to be checked better for a tight seal before shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical at first because I thought Gold Bond was an old-timey formula, but this is a very modern scent to it.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended and worth the value.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Men&#x27;s Everyday Lotion took care of the problem better than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I also shave my head and would always put something on to prevent drying, the products I used were very limited due to the sting associated with razor burn, but Gold Bond Men&#x27;s does not stink when I apply it to a freshly shaved head :)</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to men who want a more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; lotion that works well on dry and cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I saw this in a commercial and right then and there did a one-click buy to try</li>
            <li> I guess those are the only things guys use lotion for right.</li>
            <li> Great lotion especially for sensitive skin and dry skin due to winter harshness</li>
            <li> but I live up North.  </li>
            <li> Within minutes after showering and applying this lotion, I was a new person.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very light fragrance that is not overwhelming</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel slimy, sticky, or overly feminine, and the smell is manly enough that females who get near you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and nice, the product does everything the manufacturer claims, and the price is</li>
            <li> it says, it leaves no greasy feel and it does seem to dry into the skin rather quickly.</li>
            <li> One of the other things I like about this lotion is that the next time Im in the shower, my skin feels very smooth</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you have sensitive and irritable skin.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and normal.</li>
            <li> Feels like it absorbs in to skin better than others I have tried in past.</li>
            <li> for buying it on Amazon, I have found it for the same exact price at Wal-mart before</li>
            <li> I used to use the regular Gold Bond lotion and it seemed to work pretty well</li>
            <li> Everyone in the house uses this I&#x27;m not sure why they call it just for men fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li> cream quickly and easily spreads, and does not leave behind any slick/greasy/sticky</li>
            <li> For years I would just use Lubriderm Advanced Therapy for Extra Dry Skin, and just cake it on.</li>
            <li> and the air seems to just suck the moisture right out of my skin, making my hands look really dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> It makes his skin so soft and takes away the ashy dryness.</li>
            <li> He really likes the feel and scent of this lotion and we will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> am a Type-II diabetic and keeping my feet hydrated, soft and supple is essential.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used many different lotions, cheap and expensive.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Gold Bond for having products that actually work.</li>
            <li> My boot socks show no traces and it washes off my hands completely with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Leaving your skin natural feeling.</li>
            <li> Soft, but manly soft.</li>
            <li> My hands, face and arms are so soft now.  </li>
            <li> It smells like my old YSL cologne I used to use.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is the scent is absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> I cannot come near anything with added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good smelling, a little on the small side though.</li>
            <li> A bottle this size typically does not last more than a month if you apply daily.</li>
            <li> I wear high boot socks, compression support and usually mid boots or hikers.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed completely, it doesn&#x27;t make a mess or stain your clothes.</li>
            <li> so my hands get pretty rough.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for my hands as winters here are especially rough and my hands get very dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> my hands have been dry and chapped looking and now that is all gone and not the greasy feeling like you get from other lotions this stuff absorbs into your skin and leaves it smooth and refreshed and its made for body and face as well..</li>
            <li> Finally I decided to try something new</li>
            <li> It works very well for my dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond is long lasting and works very well.</li>
            <li> I had gotten 2 free small tubes of it when I bought some Gold Bond powder locally and after i tried it I was hooked.</li>
            <li> and you barely notice you have lotion on after application, so</li>
            <li> I can barely detect one.</li>
            <li> I only use natural products that contain plant oils or beeswax.</li>
            <li> Has a nice faint scent, not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> At 66 the dry skin is all over and the normal lotions did nothing.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older (50+), I have been having patches of dry skin on my legs hips that would last all winter.  </li>
            <li> but my hands crack a lot in cold weather and this not only helps prevent that, but also isn&#x27;t greasy and smells good.</li>
            <li> From the advertising, I expected this to have some sort of \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent, but otherwise be decent hand lotion.  </li>
            <li> The skin was much softer and less flaky.  </li>
            <li> Now, a week out and the dry patch of skin is completely healed.</li>
            <li> This is a decent everyday solution for you are starting to get old.</li>
            <li> My dry, cracked hands were touchably soft after only a day or two of application!</li>
            <li> It really keeps my body comfortable in the cold days.</li>
            <li> It is a decent weight to moisturize his very dry skin even in the winter when its very dry.</li>
            <li> I only buy Gold Bond on a few occasions, I cannot pay this high price all the time but wish I could.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to make him put on lotion after a long day in the cold and wind, but now he will do it on his own.</li>
            <li> It has a very fresh scent and almost smells like a very subtle cologne.</li>
            <li> Since I moved back to Midwest, have been fighting constant battle with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will be a lifetime buyer of this lotion as long as they keep making it the same way!</li>
            <li> it is non greasy but long lasting</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t messy like the other stuff, last all day, and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> and it does last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I get really dry skin during the winter, especially on my face</li>
            <li> My skin has always been dry, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin especially around my fingernails and this moisturizes without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I would sometimes try my wifes/moms and it would leave me dry and itchy the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark brown African american, so I can only speak from that perspective.</li>
            <li> This has been going on for several years now and the hot tub and showers only seemed to make it worse.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to use it</li>
            <li> Not enough of a minus to lose a star.</li>
            <li> Still a little greasy but a small amount does absorb into the skin very fast.  </li>
            <li> it does make a deference on the skin and also it has a manly smell to it, not like other lotions that dont last on the skin</li>
            <li> Not waiting very long after shaver .</li>
            <li> I tried this one and it helped my dry skin a lot during the winter.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s noticeably softer and no longer dry.  </li>
            <li> or I will dry out and feel itchy all day.</li>
            <li> i like the smell of it and the feel of it when my skin is dry and hurts</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle by the bed and one by the TV and in my truck for when I feel dry.</li>
            <li> My hands get so dry</li>
            <li> I thought my skin was permanently damaged, because every morning when I would wake the sides of my mouth would be excessively dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake up in the morning with the sides of my mouth being dry anymore.</li>
            <li> Dry skin.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never had suffer from dry hands since</li>
            <li> had really dry and ashy</li>
            <li> Men need lotion for dry skin also.</li>
            <li> My hands are constantly dry</li>
            <li> This moisturizes the skin...especially dry skin in desert</li>
            <li> I am doing some home remodeling and my hands get dry and ruff from the wood and chemicals.</li>
            <li> Takes away all scaley or dry skin.</li>
            <li> After only using it for a few weeks my skins seems to actually be healing.</li>
            <li> I decided what have a got to loose and applied some of this product.  </li>
            <li> Same as my previous updates.</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skin</li>
            <li> He has very, very dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very dry legs</li>
            <li> so my hands get very dry.</li>
            <li> Arrived and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Keeps me protected from the harsh weather we&#x27;ve been having in the northeast over the last 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Skin still dry not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> had severe dry, hard areas around the sides and back of both</li>
            <li> Can be used on the face as well as other exposed skin.</li>
            <li> and I usually get hangnails in winter, but since I have been using this lotion religiously I haven&#x27;t had an issue with that!</li>
            <li> SEEING THAT I LIVE APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES TO ANY VENDER OF PRODUCTS LIKE THIS.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size vs price.</li>
            <li> One night I was noticing that the dry skin patch on my calf was getting worse, despite having daily applications of name brand moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands oftenly due to the lab work!</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to pay extra for a small specialty bottle of face lotion!</li>
            <li> It has been hard to for me to find a lotion that last for then a few hours.</li>
            <li> By morning the rash was noticeably less inflamed.  </li>
            <li> Can feel slightly greasy on you hands but never anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> In my 40&#x27;s now with dry skin....I have been using this for about a month and have been getting a lot of compliments on my skin lately....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy</li>
            <li> It goes on a little oily but that feeling goes away almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> Write it down on your calendar if you have to!</li>
            <li> This product DRIED the hell out of my face and hands, I always felt like I wanted to just wash this product off and leave my face like that the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can feel it moisturizing my skin after I have dried off.</li>
            <li> and I would rather have a product that is heavy on the moisturizer ingredients instead.</li>
            <li> I do not enjoy the scent and it messes with my cologne&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few lotions I have found that I can use on my face.</li>
            <li> The scent is not strong or overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I. He works outside in the cold and this helped with the dry skin that comes with that.</li>
            <li> I have edema in my lower legs, some due to age, and on one leg worse due to past injuries.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use lotions</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my body and hands at all, this stuff feels so thick on my face.</li>
            <li> Just by chance, I ordered some sporting products through mail order and a small sample was included in the box.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually care for scented body lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some people dislike the odor.</li>
            <li> I use it every day the cold dry weather drys out my hands so quickly and badly that they begin to crack and bleed using this</li>
            <li> I use it heavily now that it&#x27;s cold outside</li>
            <li> it was hard to find because its not stocked in the &amp;#34;men product&amp;#34; section in my store.  </li>
            <li> originally tired this as I was tired of using my wife&#x27;s lotion for my dry hands, especially in the cold months</li>
            <li> After slathering on this caulk-like &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, I have to wait at least 15 minutes before putting clothes on or hopping into bed while I wait for this paste to soak in.</li>
            <li> Sometimes into late spring.  </li>
            <li> I returned this and bought some Eucerin which, while also greasy, at least doesn&#x27;t stink like a teenager wearing Axe body spray.</li>
            <li> It feels like it is going on thick</li>
            <li> however subtle it may be.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking to protect skin or just to moisturize; this lotion is it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my must have for the cold, dry winter months.</li>
            <li> It has a typical artificial \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent that smells alright to me (doesn&#x27;t seem overpowering, at least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am addicted.</li>
            <li> I work inside behind a computer all day</li>
            <li> I tired everything with no relief.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Personally, for me the product is terrible.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for the bottle size.</li>
            <li> it does hydrate but is expensive for the money.</li>
            <li> Is it weird to say I am obsessed with this lotion?</li>
            <li> I hate lotion that doesn&#x27;t dry well, or that leaves a thick nasty coating on my hands.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin feeling non-alligator-like during the cold winter months.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and doesn&#x27;t have a crazy smell to it.</li>
            <li> It also contains artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li> It was getting painful because I play golf and mountain bike a lot.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have leave that greasy feeling I hate.</li>
            <li> Hate fruity smelling products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst product that I put on my skin these days.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absorbs extremely well, nice scent</li>
            <li> Works great, not greasy, just what a manly man needs in lotion.</li>
            <li> Personally, for me the product is terrible. I&#x27;m a dark brown African american, so I can only speak from that perspective. This product DRIED the hell out of my face and hands, I always felt like I wanted to just wash this product off and leave my face like that the rest of the day. For black males, Aveeno is a much better product.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it&#x27;s not too oily</li>
            <li> great lotion releave dry skin all day and has a great sent will buy more when I run out /love this lotion</li>
            <li> Smells great and seems to keep me cool all day...what else can be said. I got a sample in the mail and just had to have some...amazon had the best price...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! Smell so good.  My girlfriend says: &amp;#34;Enchanting scent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Great lotion especially for sensitive skin and dry skin due to winter harshness</li>
            <li> Smooth like silk....smell great too</li>
            <li> My husband likes this product</li>
            <li> Good quality, feels good and really makes my hands feel softer and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Has a nice faint scent, not too overpowering.  Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> my son loves this lotion</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very good product for dry skin particularly in the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude, so never took time to research lotion until now. I tried this one and it helped my dry skin a lot during the winter.</li>
            <li> Bought two bottles of this moisturiser, one for my husband and one for my grandson...both of them very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The moment you use this lotion you will INSTANTLY feel your skin cells bond.</li>
            <li> this low oder well made lotion is the only lotions that my hubby will use now. It is a decent weight to moisturize his very dry skin even in the winter when its very dry.</li>
            <li> the gold bond lotion rubs right in, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it smells clean, not over powering, and not like the powder, I use it every day</li>
            <li> After slathering on this caulk-like &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, I have to wait at least 15 minutes before putting clothes on or hopping into bed while I wait for this paste to soak in. This stuff is terrible. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> In my 40&#x27;s now with dry skin....I have been using this for about a month and have been getting a lot of compliments on my skin lately....and it&#x27;s noticeably softer and no longer dry.  Does not have a greasy feeling when you put it on.....nice scent too.  I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Thank you. Great shipping A++++</li>
            <li> WOW. What a great smell. Not greasy. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very strong fragrance. Can&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star product but because of the scent it is unusable for me hence 1 star. After I put the lotion on my forearms I can feel it for 3 hours around me and if you smell your skin from an inch distance you&#x27;ll feel it 6-8 after you use it. Guys, I buy this to heal my skin not to smell something! Get rid of the scent and I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skin and this product is great. It makes his skin so soft and takes away the ashy dryness.</li>
            <li> Since I moved back to Midwest, have been fighting constant battle with dry skin. This is the cure, it is absorbed and gone from skin surface in 15 seconds or less and leaves you feeling great. After a month or so skin issues gones.</li>
            <li> Still a little greasy but a small amount does absorb into the skin very fast.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> My husband is diabetic and I thought we should give Gold Bond a try for his hands and feet. He really likes the feel and scent of this lotion and we will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Got this for a stocking stuffer for my husband.  I only buy Gold Bond on a few occasions, I cannot pay this high price all the time but wish I could.  Gold Bond is a wonderful product and their lotions are at the top of the list.  This new Men&#x27;s lotion has a wonderful scent and works well on your skin.  Hey, if Shaq likes it then it must be good!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size vs price. Way too expensive for the bottle size. I still would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just lotion,but I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> I was looking for a simple all-round cream to use.  As a moisturizer it&#x27;s great.  But the scent is too strong to use on my face, so thus 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and I was hoping the scent wasn&#x27;t too strong, but it is for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream quickly and easily spreads, and does not leave behind any slick/greasy/sticky feel.&lt;br /&gt;I will use on my hands and arms, etc.</li>
            <li> Just used one day and noticed my skin feels like same as when I took a shower and this is next day!!!&lt;br /&gt;The best moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, I even like the scent however subtle it may be.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking to protect skin or just to moisturize; this lotion is it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Highly!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he is hooked! He raves about the lotion and I like the smell too ... I especially like that he has stopped using my lotions!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very light fragrance that is not overwhelming and it does last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> For those of you men who don&#x27;t use lotion, you should! As an avid swimmer, I need to use lotion or I will dry out and feel itchy all day. This lotion absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel slimy, sticky, or overly feminine, and the smell is manly enough that females who get near you will be pleasantly surprised. Definitely recommended and worth the value. I have both the cream and the pump versions for the gym bag and home/office respectively. Can be used on the face as well as other exposed skin. Even if you don&#x27;t go with the &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s&amp;#34; version of this product, Gold Bond in general is worth the money in the lotion category.</li>
            <li> This is a great produce!</li>
            <li> great mens lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different lotions in the past, and this one is pretty good. Although it says its for everything (face,body) I would not use it for the face. My skin can get dry in the winter, but this lotion has done a good job keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. The only thing that would make it better, is some protection from the sun. Add some SPF 25 protection to this product and it will be GREAT!</li>
            <li> Good lotion that does not leave the greasy feeling, soaks in quickly and off you go</li>
            <li> Shaq likes it so I thought I&#x27;d try it... Works great and doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a lady like so many of the lotions do...</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  No perfume smell</li>
            <li> My husband has a huge pet peeve about lotions but this does not creep him out to use. He loves this stuff and it works well.</li>
            <li> best mens lotion in my opinion</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought, But it is perfact</li>
            <li> It has been hard to for me to find a lotion that last for then a few hours. I have finally found that in this product. Most lotions that I&#x27;ve tried have been mostly water based and very loose. I love this all will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> While I do like the triple action with aloe version better - I love the scent of this one. I put it on right after toweling off from the shower.</li>
            <li> Received as a free sample on the purchase of Gold Bond, very nice scent for a man (or so I have been told), and the quality of Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> Just tried this out for the first time today. I&#x27;m happy with how fast it absorbs and it really does make your skin feel great for a long time. It has a typical artificial \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent that smells alright to me (doesn&#x27;t seem overpowering, at least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too happy with the ingredients, though. I&#x27;ve been working towards eliminating a number of sketchy chemicals from my daily routine. This is probably the worst product that I put on my skin these days. (My deodorant is probably second). I&#x27;d suggest starting by looking up Propyl Paraben and then keep going from there. I&#x27;ll probably take this to work as a backup and buy something else to use daily.</li>
            <li> Great item. I bought this for my boyfriend because he thinks lotion is too girly for him. This got him to put it on or else! It has a sandalwood scent to it. The lotion works wonder and is meant for your hands, face, and body.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve used. Great mild manly scent and I love the way it absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Very nice and refreshing</li>
            <li> Skin still dry not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I just finished up this bottle of lotion.  I keep it next to my bed and lotion up arms/legs before bed.  It goes on nice, dries relatively quickly, not too &amp;#34;greasy.&amp;#34;  It does, however, have a fairly strong smell to it, kind of like they were trying too hard to make it &amp;#34;masculine.&amp;#34;  I will not be purchasing again for my pre-bed routine since it is just too strong of a smell for me personally, actually makes my eyes water sometimes lying in bed.  I also have a smaller tube of this stuff that I use after working out, smell isn&#x27;t as noticeable if putting on and heading out though still quite potent.</li>
            <li> This lotion works very well. It has a nice scent and is easy to apply. It works very well for my dry skin problems. I use it every day to help keep my skin moist.&lt;br /&gt;You also get a lot of lotion for the price</li>
            <li> Good overall lotion but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well. It&#x27;s a little greasy so be aware.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s swears by this.  He has very, very dry skin and it&#x27;s the only thing that works for him.  I tried it and am using it too.  Only wish it was unscented.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hands and body (not face). It really keeps my body comfortable in the cold days. And it smells good!</li>
            <li> Favorite lotion. Arrived and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Great smelling lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy. I was kind of skeptical at first because I thought Gold Bond was an old-timey formula, but this is a very modern scent to it.</li>
            <li> Smells better than I expected, and it absorbed extremely quickly. I highly recommend this lotion to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very dry legs and this works like a charm. Nice scent. It is quickly absorbed and not greasy.</li>
            <li> i like the smell of it and the feel of it when my skin is dry and hurts but kinda over priced it does noting better then any other kind</li>
            <li> Have been using for approx. one(1) month.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with results.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Type-II diabetic and keeping my feet hydrated, soft and supple is essential.&lt;br /&gt;I had severe dry, hard areas around the sides and back of both feet.&lt;br /&gt;Within 1-week there was a noticible difference in the softness and  improvement in hydration!&lt;br /&gt;The product dries rapidly .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that using it liberally and regularly(daily) gets best results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and had it sent to my Grandson. He was happy to have it so he didn&#x27;t have to use his mom and sister&#x27;s stuff.</li>
            <li> Best men&#x27;s lotions I have ever used. Period.</li>
            <li> I order this and it is very good love the smell and it keeps my body very smooth and fresh I would buy more once I finish the one I have right now. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, maybe a little on the greasy/shiny side but good for dry skin and this big bottle is cheaper than the small squeeze container the stores sell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this lotion. It lasts on my hands even after a hand washing or two. Most other lotions needed re-applying every time I washed my hands.</li>
            <li> My son loves this all over face lotion. And it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> works well, manly scent, not greasy. I keep a bottle by the bed and one by the TV and in my truck for when I feel dry.</li>
            <li> Good Scent and keeps you feeling fresh in the Harsh Chicago winter where your skin gets very dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> I have used many different lotions, cheap and expensive.  This seems to be the best of both worlds.  It has very little scent, albeit a good one.  It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  Price is higher than some, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> this is the best gold bond lotion for men i recommend it to every men it has a great smell to it, and not overpowering</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is as good as aveno but I would use this cream if I couldn&#x27;t buy aveno.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion I have horribly dry hands and this helps ten fold plus smells great with the polo cologne I wear definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li> MEETS ALL MY NEEDS; GOOD VALUE AND RECEIVED IN AN EXPEDIOUS MANNER WITHOUT TRAVELING DISTANCES TO OBTAIIN SEEING THAT I LIVE APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES TO ANY VENDER OF PRODUCTS LIKE THIS.</li>
            <li> Daughter likes more that my husband and took it from him and I had to get more for him.</li>
            <li> Not as good as for the hands as most other Gold Bond products since its not as thick.  However, as a welcome change it does pump out much faster (makes sense considering its so much thinner) and unlike some products I have placed on my face this one does not burn.  So, good stuff but doesn&#x27;t replace the usual Gold Bond for hand moisturizer as it is just not that good a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells great!!! What else can be said, it&#x27;s lotion.. It does not cause irritation and has a really nice Manley smell. Not floral or perfumey like many others.</li>
            <li> The only way to get the great benefits from this bottle of lotion is to use it daily.  Write it down on your calendar if you have to! My hands get so dry and I usually get hangnails in winter, but since I have been using this lotion religiously I haven&#x27;t had an issue with that!</li>
            <li> Smells good, not an over powering or cologne type smell, but overall a clean fresh scent.  I get really dry skin during the winter, especially on my face so this stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li> Adequate although my face seemed to get bumpy and break out after using it. Works well on the hands if you can stand the chemicalized fragrant smell. Im bringing mine back.</li>
            <li> Provides great moisture and I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been dry, especially in the winter. If I could buy this by the gallon I would.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older (50+), I have been having patches of dry skin on my legs hips that would last all winter.  Sometimes into late spring.  This has been going on for several years now and the hot tub and showers only seemed to make it worse.  Then last week I bought some gold bond powder for the girl friend and there was a sample of this attached to the powder. One night I was noticing that the dry skin patch on my calf was getting worse, despite having daily applications of name brand moisturizers. I decided what have a got to loose and applied some of this product.  It immediately felt better! The skin was much softer and less flaky.  By morning the rash was noticeably less inflamed.  Now, a week out and the dry patch of skin is completely healed. I headed to the store to buy some more of this amazing stuff.  Thanks Gold Bond for having products that actually work.</li>
            <li> Finally a great men&#x27;s moisturizing lotion with a manly scent.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin especially around my fingernails and this moisturizes without feeling greasy.It&#x27;s also great to treat heal crack</li>
            <li> For older men without a lot of money this is a perfect product for reducing the dry, wrinkling skin we all get in the process of&lt;br /&gt;ageing beyond fifty.  The fragrance is subtle and nice, the product does everything the manufacturer claims, and the price is&lt;br /&gt;right.  What more can you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOD</li>
            <li> Pleased with product.</li>
            <li> i like this product is very good for the face when the skin is dry iwould also recomend to anyone,fine product.</li>
            <li> It is a beautifully fragranced mens product. Took a while to get to Australia but was worth the wait :-)</li>
            <li> it does hydrate but is expensive for the money.</li>
            <li> This is my must have for the cold, dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond is long lasting and works very well. I would recommend this size for home/office use. I use this at home, while I keep the 6.5 ounce size in my car.</li>
            <li> smells great! I dig this stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Fast drying and not &#x27;perfumed&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It does a great job against super dry skin brought on by never ending winter months of Moscow.</li>
            <li> Good products! and it keep my hands hydrate all day... I wash my hands oftenly due to the lab work! it is perfect!</li>
            <li> Husband loves this lotion.  He uses regularly after showering.  It has a very nice scent, does not burn when applied to skin and is well hydrating.</li>
            <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve ever had. I hate lotion that doesn&#x27;t dry well, or that leaves a thick nasty coating on my hands. This stuff smells great, absorbs into skin fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling grody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works really well after working on bikes or computers all day.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this lotion. I used to have to make him put on lotion after a long day in the cold and wind, but now he will do it on his own. He loves the smell and it&#x27;s not too oily after he puts it on.</li>
            <li> Works great on dry skin! Bought this for my husband so he don&#x27;t have to use scenty lady hand lotion. Put this in the bathroom and it encourages him to use it after shower too.</li>
            <li> I am a man, I don&#x27;t know what to say about lotion.  It moisturizes.</li>
            <li> The best for my Skin. Smell well, specialy for mens, top-Lotion. Regards, Kurt from Switzerland</li>
            <li> Very soothing, like it after shaving.</li>
            <li> Perfect moisturizer. Absorbs fast, pleasant scent, gentle enough to use on face</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff! I had gotten 2 free small tubes of it when I bought some Gold Bond powder locally and after i tried it I was hooked. I don&#x27;t usually use lotions but my hands crack a lot in cold weather and this not only helps prevent that, but also isn&#x27;t greasy and smells good. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere around me -- not at the marts, the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;, drugstores, anywhere so I&#x27;m glad amazon has it at a good price.</li>
            <li> Some samples were sent to me and I decided to try them. I have edema in my lower legs, some due to age, and on one leg worse due to past injuries. I wear high boot socks, compression support and usually mid boots or hikers. My legs were drying out and the skin was flaking, severely on my injured leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within two days my skin was vastly improved and by day four all dryness and flaking was gone. Color improved too. Skin feels soft and normal. I use this everyday now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My better half, who is sensitive to this sort of thing, says that the scent is pleasant and that she likes it. The scent is not strong or overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t require much to get coverage, just quarter sized dabs for each lower leg. It does need to be rubbed in, both to be absorbed and to provide coverage. I have settled on the method of using smaller dabs and covering \\&quot;zones\\&quot;. It sinks in or is absorbed fairly quickly, you want to spread it around right away. It is absorbed completely, it doesn&#x27;t make a mess or stain your clothes. My boot socks show no traces and it washes off my hands completely with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no reservations recommending people try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shopped around, no one beat Amazon&#x27;s Add-in price with Prime delivery to the door. Thank you again Amazon and Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no relationship with Gold Bond or Amazon. Just appreciate good products and service.</li>
            <li> I had this lotion for a week now and oh man it feels good and it does make a deference on the skin and also it has a manly smell to it, not like other lotions that dont last on the skin or they are to oily and they smell too nice.</li>
            <li> OK, if Shaq is man enough to use it so am I. At 66 the dry skin is all over and the normal lotions did nothing. They&#x27;re either greasy or they evaporate without doing a thing. The Gold Bond goes on well, you don&#x27;t need very much, and it rubs in well. Leaving your skin natural feeling. Soft, but manly soft.</li>
            <li> Non Greasey, dries quick and has a nice smell thats not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend highly to friends :o) Thanks!</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this. I&#x27;m hooked now.</li>
            <li> Very good face lotion. I love it. Got me 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> Good lotion , I think I need somthing a lil better for my face though</li>
            <li> This lotion is Fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Is it weird to say I am obsessed with this lotion? The product is good, moisturizes. But many lotions do this. This one has a slight &amp;#34;clean smell&amp;#34;.. which I really love.</li>
            <li> This is the best men&#x27;s lotion I have ever used. It&#x27;s pricey but worth it. Goes on smooth and not greasy. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> Just got a bottle of this and just after one application i can tell im going to be buying this again when the bottle runs out..my hands have been dry and chapped looking and now that is all gone and not the greasy feeling like you get from other lotions this stuff absorbs into your skin and leaves it smooth and refreshed and its made for body and face as well..Excellent product</li>
            <li> Best men&#x27;s lotion out there.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, my boyfriend swears by it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I can&#x27;t believe my body, to a large degree, needed this lotion!  My hands, face and arms are so soft now.  Who knew men needed this?  I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to use it... could have spared myself years of dehydrated, clammy skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mens lotion I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t have leave that greasy feeling I hate. Feels like it absorbs in to skin better than others I have tried in past.</li>
            <li> Use this lotion everyday and have seen good results. It&#x27;s not going to drastically change your skin, but it will keep it hydrated and healthy-looking. Best part is it goes on easy and you barely notice you have lotion on after application, so you&#x27;re not going to feel like your face is greasy. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond is always the best...thanks.</li>
            <li> The best part about this lotion is how quickly it gets absorbed.  It goes on a little oily but that feeling goes away almost immediately.  Helps to reduce redness and keep my face moisturized.  It smells good too.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t please with this product.  I just didn&#x27;t like it.  I prefer St. Ives Naturaly Indulgent a much better product.</li>
            <li> Works great! My dry, cracked hands were touchably soft after only a day or two of application! Now, if only I had someone to touch my hands &#x3D;\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and this stuff smells good and is good lotion.</li>
            <li> Good smelling, a little on the small side though. A great add on item since it had a 2 dollar off coupon.</li>
            <li> When I lived in ND for 2 years my skin on the sides of my mouth got damaged from working outside during the Winter months. I thought my skin was permanently damaged, because every morning when I would wake the sides of my mouth would be excessively dry. For years I would just use Lubriderm Advanced Therapy for Extra Dry Skin, and just cake it on. It was greasy, and didn&#x27;t last all day. Finally I decided to try something new so I picked Gold Bond Men&#x27;s Everyday Essentials Lotion after reading some good reviews. This stuff works great! It isn&#x27;t messy like the other stuff, last all day, and absorbs fast. After only using it for a few weeks my skins seems to actually be healing. I don&#x27;t wake up in the morning with the sides of my mouth being dry anymore. At the time that I decided to give it a try it was out of stock, happy that I waited for it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion. It smells like my old YSL cologne I used to use. This lotion is very quick to absorb into the skin so you&#x27;re not left feeling greasy - one of the reasons I know why a lot of my friends don&#x27;t use lotion. The scent is not too strong, though. After a while the scent dissipates quite a bit so you can still wear whatever cologne you want over it without the scent of the lotion combating the scent of your cologne. The lotion is marketed for hands, body and face but I don&#x27;t like the feeling of it on my face. Although it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my body and hands at all, this stuff feels so thick on my face. I used it when I couldn&#x27;t find my regular face moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for buying it on Amazon, I have found it for the same exact price at Wal-mart before so I&#x27;m probably not going to be purchasing it on Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the last guy to use men&#x27;s care products like lotion let alone review it. However, I am impressed with Gold Bond. Just by chance, I ordered some sporting products through mail order and a small sample was included in the box. During the winter with my heater cranked, the skin on my hands started to crack and peel. It was getting painful because I play golf and mountain bike a lot. Saw the Gold Bond on my counter and tried it. Immediate relief. Totally surprising and after a week or so my hands healed and were not cracking or peeling. This stuff is for real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently deployed to Afghanistan so my hands get very dry. I also work out a lot in the gym so my hands get pretty rough. I have never been the type of guy to wear lotion but mostly because it&#x27;s too greasy or it smells girly. This lotion smells great! It has a very fresh scent and almost smells like a very subtle cologne. It&#x27;s not a strong scent at all, but it&#x27;s nice when your hands come near your face and you catch a whiff of it. The lotion is not greasy at all. It rubs in to your skin very quickly and leaves your hands with simply a soft feeling. I will be a lifetime buyer of this lotion as long as they keep making it the same way!</li>
            <li> I used to use the regular Gold Bond lotion and it seemed to work pretty well but didnt feel like it lasted on my skin too well. I saw this in a commercial and right then and there did a one-click buy to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it came in I noticed the bottle design was definitely geared more to a guys attention. The smell of the lotion is actually really nice too. Its not overbearing or bring on any allergic reactions. It smelled like a nice aftershave or something still &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it says, it leaves no greasy feel and it does seem to dry into the skin rather quickly. I started putting it on my arms and legs after the shower and I can feel it moisturizing my skin after I have dried off. One of the other things I like about this lotion is that the next time Im in the shower, my skin feels very smooth still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this as it seems to clear up dry skin pretty quick and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I am new to lotion and this was a good starting point. I would sometimes try my wifes/moms and it would leave me dry and itchy the next day. So far this has been awesome and leaving my skin very nice and never dry, even when I forget for a day or three.</li>
            <li> Works really well and the scent in great! Hate fruity smelling products. Highly recommend this product. Everyone that has tried it at work (where I keep a bottle) really likes it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this lotion, especially the smell.  Thankfully, it arrived wrapped in its own plastic bag because the top was almost completely unscrewed and there was spilled lotion in the bag and all over the bottle itself.  Just needs to be checked better for a tight seal before shipping.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion last year and love it. It is a great lotion with a good smell. It is also not greasy so I can use it on my face without getting a couple of pimples. Now I don&#x27;t have to pay extra for a small specialty bottle of face lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very smooth application.  Keeps me protected from the harsh weather we&#x27;ve been having in the northeast over the last 3 months.  I plan on purchasing this lotion as my mainstay instead of the local pharmacy brands I was so accustomed of buying.</li>
            <li> Dry skin. sunburn. jerking off. Gold Bond lotion has you covered. I guess those are the only things guys use lotion for right. This is a decent everyday solution for you are starting to get old. And don&#x27;t want to admit it. I keep this on the counter in the bathroom and have started using it on arms and face occasionally because I noticed I&#x27;m starting to look like my dad and don&#x27;t want to admit that I&#x27;m going to be 40 someday.</li>
            <li> works great and as described. this is a good brand of lotion and this particular one works well. gets absorbed fast and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> First lotion that has ever made me peel. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> My husband love the smell and he loves the way the lotion holds up in the winter time when he works outside.</li>
            <li> Best thing for me when it comes to lotion. Is discovering gold bond lotion. It&#x27;s great on my dark skin ,  look shinny all day. Is best when use it just after towering your body . Not waiting very long after shaver .</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  The smell is incredible and my hands are no longer dry and cracked.  Dries within seconds and does not feel oily.  I am addicted.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer with a non-descript, but slightly masculine scent.  Keeps my skin feeling non-alligator-like during the cold winter months.  Can feel slightly greasy on you hands but never anywhere else.  As if you didn&#x27;t love the Gold Bond company enough... this is another solid reason.</li>
            <li> Lotion is great. Bottle, however was defective. Dispenser pump doesn&#x27;t work and when I tried to return the damaged bottle, I was asked to pay for return shipping.</li>
            <li> Great scent and doesn&#x27;t feel overly oily.</li>
            <li> Great Product for men</li>
            <li> After many years of searching I have found an after shave lotion that soothes and calms my face but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy. This stuff rocks. It feels like it is going on thick but it disappears. It gets soaked up by my skin. The fact that it is reasonably inexpensive is also a great plus. It has a mild scent which is fine but I would prefer it to be unscented. Not enough of a minus to lose a star. Try it!</li>
            <li> This lotion for MEN is the best that I have used in years.  In fact, I know of nothing else that works as good that feels as greaseless.  Love the slight scent and feel after use.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it every day the cold dry weather drys out my hands so quickly and badly that they begin to crack and bleed using this i&#x27;ve never had suffer from dry hands since</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the smell of this and so do I. He works outside in the cold and this helped with the dry skin that comes with that.</li>
            <li> despite what it says it is a little greasy, but all in all very good</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I use it heavily now that it&#x27;s cold outside and the air seems to just suck the moisture right out of my skin, making my hands look really dry and cracked. This lotion keeps my skin looking and feeling great, no complaints. Not to mention it smells great too. I also use it on my face and neck as well, as it does a good job of relieving razor burn as well. I&#x27;ve had the bottle for 6 months now, and I still have plenty left.</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s non-greasy; is very greasy.  The smell is also a bit much. I returned this and bought some Eucerin which, while also greasy, at least doesn&#x27;t stink like a teenager wearing Axe body spray.</li>
            <li> Because this soaks into your skin fast, you have to use a lot. A bottle this size typically does not last more than a month if you apply daily.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for my hands as winters here are especially rough and my hands get very dry and cracked. It smells good and dries very quickly. This lotion did a very good job keeping my skin in good shape and a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for four days now and my skin is totally hydrated now.&lt;br /&gt;I had really dry and ashy skin.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good too.</li>
            <li> From the advertising, I expected this to have some sort of \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent, but otherwise be decent hand lotion.  The smell is definitely masculine (possibly bordering on \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;), and the lotion itself is good.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and seems to work OK.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually care for scented body lotions. Until now. Kudos to Gold Bond! The fragrance is subtle and pleasant and the lotion is NOT greasy.</li>
            <li> I first used this product when I was away on a ski vacation and there were small samples in our room and instantly loved it! I used to use Vaseline Intensive care for men and have since switched over to Gold Bond Men&#x27;s.  It keeps you smelling great all day, and feels great on the skin.  I also shave my head and would always put something on to prevent drying, the products I used were very limited due to the sting associated with razor burn, but Gold Bond Men&#x27;s does not stink when I apply it to a freshly shaved head :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works very well. Only wish it had a more pleasant odor. However it works fantastic and keeps skin from drying</li>
            <li> I will cut to the chase .... to me, the lotion is very good- it is non greasy but long lasting but I find the fragrance too strong.</li>
            <li> My son-in-law likes this and was pleased that I gave it to him.  Men need lotion for dry skin also.</li>
            <li> Works very well for everyday use and smells great, not too strong.</li>
            <li> Great fantastic lotion, works great, wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this lotion.It smells great.Thanks</li>
            <li> Its fast absorbing but smells way too strong! Smells like i sprayed cheap cologne. Wish it had no scent to it or dial it back by like 70% or more. Besides the scent I like it.</li>
            <li> I am from the South but I live up North.  I never needed lotion until I moved up here over two years ago but I&#x27;ve been trying to find an adequate one ever since.  My hands are constantly dry and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of hand lotions to no avail.  I kid you not, this stuff soaks in quicker than I can believe, is not at all greasy, and smells great.  Gold Bond also offers a money back \\&quot;love it or return it guarantee\\&quot; and for the money, why not give it a try?  I assure you you won&#x27;t regret giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mens facial moisturizer that isn&#x27;t stuffed full of sunscreen. I don&#x27;t need something for white water rafting....I work inside behind a computer all day and I would rather have a product that is heavy on the moisturizer ingredients instead. I finally found this....it was hard to find because its not stocked in the &amp;#34;men product&amp;#34; section in my store.  So far its great and my face looks very smooth and nourished. I&#x27;m not sure why some people dislike the odor. I can barely detect one.</li>
            <li> Good stuff works real well</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good hand lotion for a long time.  Most lotions I try seem to take forever to soak in/ dry/ absorb.  It feels like I have put Crisco on my hands.  This is the first lotion that I have tried that doesn&#x27;t act that way.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands sticky.  It also has a manly scent - no gardenia flowers or coconut.  If you are a guy looking for a good hand lotion, give this a try.</li>
            <li> Great product, really fast absorption. Great fragrance. Manly smell. Moisturized actually longer than 24 hours. I will buy again! Love it!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes like a charm</li>
            <li> The product has a -pleasant scent and is not greasy.  It helps keep my skin from becoming dry.  I am 71 years and a farmer.  The sun really dries out my skin so I am pleased to use this product.</li>
            <li> The scent is light, it goes on easy, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Just what I was looking for.  Only thing that could make it better is bacon.</li>
            <li> This is some great lotion for dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy like Vasoline brand, it absorbs very quickly and does not smell &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I originally tired this as I was tired of using my wife&#x27;s lotion for my dry hands, especially in the cold months very my hands crack from doing dishes all the time and hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great. Definitely recommend to men who want a more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; lotion that works well on dry and cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, the best lotion that doesn&#x27;t overly clog my pores. This keeps my skin hydrated in the coldest of the winter and I even feel some lotion after I shower (maybe too much lotion?). This is a great lotion for those who have eczema as well. The only downfall is the scent is absolute garbage. I do not enjoy the scent and it messes with my cologne&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this lotion</li>
            <li> Same as my previous updates. Great lotion for men, especially after the gym steam room. Keeps my skin perfect after hard workout.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great especially on Men&#x27;s hands. My fingers get cracked from water and this stuff heals it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Works like a dream!  But it takes a while to soak in.</li>
            <li> non greesy with a very good scent that doesnt stain your shirt or anything ... will buy another one for sure</li>
            <li> This moisturizes the skin...especially dry skin in desert climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy, no odor, convenient size to keep in several places around the home and vehicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold Bond products have never been disapointing and for that reason I tried the product.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff, girls love my smooth skin</li>
            <li> I got a free sample with an on-line order from a sporting goods store. I liked it but couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the local stores. Amazon to the rescue. I am doing some home remodeling and my hands get dry and ruff from the wood and chemicals. Gold Bond Men&#x27;s Everyday Lotion took care of the problem better than the others I&#x27;ve tried. After a day of laying tile and sanding floors, the lotion is great for the knees too.</li>
            <li> I had severe skin itching for many days. I tired everything with no relief. Based customer reviews, I tried this. Within minutes after showering and applying this lotion, I was a new person. NO ITCH!!! I&#x27;ve used Gold Bond foot balm for many years, but never any Gold Bond body lotion. HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you have sensitive and irritable skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mens lotion. Does the job and doesn&#x27;t have a crazy smell to it.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff. No complaints...</li>
            <li> This is one of the few lotions I have found that I can use on my face. It&#x27;s both not oily and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> If is good enough for Shack if good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Takes away all scaley or dry skin. This is the best lotion on the market today. Smells good Works good, and repairs any skin problems I can come up with. Good work, Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> I got a sample tube of this with something else that I bought. It contains a petroleum product (petrolatum). I won&#x27;t use products that contain petroleum products. I only use natural products that contain plant oils or beeswax. It also contains artificial fragrance. I cannot come near anything with added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the Environmental Working Group Skin Deep website gives this product a score of 6 out of 10 (1 being the best, 10 the worst for your health).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are just some of the ingredients and the health concerns about them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FRAGRANCE Ecotoxicology, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), Miscellaneous, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROPYLPARABEN Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Ecotoxicology, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Use restrictions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PETROLATUM Contamination concerns (PAHS), Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), Use restrictions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIAZOLIDINYL UREA Allergies/immunotoxicity, Contamination concerns (FORMALDEHYDE), Use restrictions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;METHYLPARABEN Biochemical or cellular level changes, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Use restrictions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POLYSORBATE-60 Contamination concerns (ETHYLENE OXIDE, 1,4-DIOXANE), Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOCOPHERYL ACETATE Cancer, Ecotoxicology, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Contamination concerns (HYDROQUINONE)</li>
            <li> Everyone in the house uses this I&#x27;m not sure why they call it just for men fragrance is lovely. I highly recommend this</li>
