            <li>If it was a tad skinnier/thinner, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my toes.</li>

            <li>Great nail tool.</li>
            <li>Great price, great product.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I am learning how to approach it better each time that I try!!  </li>
            <li>File side is good though for underneath the nail.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and a good price.</li>
            <li>Found this really good</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>she is going to love me for this!</li>
            <li>Love them, had them before but someone stole mine!</li>
            <li>This tool is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This tool is so nice.</li>
            <li>The file is good because  it gives me an accurate aim on the nail.  </li>
            <li>This tool worked better than a nail file to get under the toenail that had become ingrown.</li>
            <li>I recommend this tool and glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>When I try the set I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>why do I need so many words to describe this item.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this tool will be wonderful for a younger, more flexible person.</li>
            <li>I know it sounds funny to be thrilled about a toenail tool, but those of you who suffer like I do with the pain know how important it is to have a good tool that helps to fix the problem.  </li>
            <li>Was able to use this effectively the first time, even though it doesn&#x27;t come with any directions.  </li>
            <li>Good quality stainless steel products.  </li>
            <li>There is not an easy way to file with these.</li>
            <li>The file isn&#x27;t quite as fine as I would like it to be but</li>
            <li>and I am still pain free.</li>
            <li>For some reason i thought it might be a big tool, but its almost the size of a scalpel, very handy and convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saved</li>
            <li>a quick way.&lt;br /&gt;Price was good and product seems to be of professional quality.</li>
            <li>the super bargain price of about $6.00 with free shipping as an Amazon.com Prime add-on item</li>
            <li>This was the second item by Body Toolz that I purchased and like the curette double-angle nail cleaner and the ingrown toenail clipper (see my reviews) that I also bought I am very pleased with this extremely handy, double-sided, all stainless steel ingrown toenail</li>
            <li>and I never had any success with the procedures.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget that it&#x27;s no just for ingrown toenails, but is a great file for general use on the nails of both the lower and the upper extremities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has worked fine so far for me!</li>
            <li>its better than the regular files.  </li>
            <li>This was better than the Satin Edge Toenail file I ordered at the same time.</li>
            <li>This file seems to be of better quality as the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are not as coarse as the Satin Edge.</li>
            <li>I have to buy a shoe with more room for toes next.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted in a nail tool.</li>
            <li>I bought several of these types of tools from Amazon for ingrown nails and this one had the most utility.</li>
            <li>I feel really encouraged to have the right tools for fixing my toe problems.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for fiing the corners of toes, even smaller toddler toes where bulkier tools would be hard to manuever.</li>
            <li>I find my old diamond file is better, only because it is longer and I can get it to the right spot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is essentially my backup to the aforementioned ingrown toenail clippers: Any problem area that the clippers can&#x27;t successfully get to this file with a straight filing surface on one end and a curved surface on the other certainly will be able to reach and painlessly eliminate.</li>
            <li>The product is a bit large for the work area where required.</li>
            <li>It is of very high quality.</li>
            <li>When I finally get it in the right place does a good job of filling down the ingrown part of my toe nail.</li>
            <li>This file really works and helps in</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well with no undue pressure.</li>
            <li>When I got this sweet little tool today I immediately tried a couple of practice moves with it on my nails (for future use) and I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Able to get into the side of the nail that other files don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Works good for hard to get to parts of your toes!</li>
            <li>I am still looking for a product which will be thin enough to do the job successfully.</li>
            <li>purchased mine on the Internet directly from FootSmart - also a seller here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hopefully my pain will be much lessened the next time I have an ingrown nail.  </li>
            <li>It is thin enough to slide easily under the nail, but it&#x27;s also strong enough to lift the corners.</li>

            <li> But No major pain.</li>
            <li> It is thin and fits under the outer edge of the toenail really easily to file down the edge which cuts into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I wish I knew about these products long before I went to a Podiatrist.</li>
            <li> a long wait - - - I needed relief.</li>
            <li> Thought the file was going to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I have a recurring ingrown on my big toe (no terrible but annoying) and since using this I&#x27;ve had no problem.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dull,  not sharp edges or ends.</li>
            <li> At times I wish it was a little bigger to make filing easier, but I realize that if it was it would also  be harder to get into tight areas.  </li>
            <li> had I known it wasn&#x27;t sharp.</li>
            <li> and it is helpful for filing sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to use, but then I am old and stiff with short arms and long legs so reaching my big toes and angling the thing correctly is a difficult feat.</li>
            <li> The finish is not great, but it was the only one with two different shapes of thin files that allow for access to problem areas that other tools did not.</li>
            <li> I will keep up use every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It has been a few of weeks</li>
            <li> This tool is small, narrow and curved , which allowed me to get to the area that was causing all the pain.  </li>
            <li> Considering what I have been working with as tools in the past year....</li>
            <li> It can reach the corners with high precision without aggravating the painful spots.</li>
            <li> I just went through a painful episode of trying to fix my ingrown toenail last week.  </li>
            <li> After that I gave up and decided to do it myself for several years; very painful to said the least.</li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to maneuver around my ingrown toe nails.</li>
            <li> I believe the ingrown nail was stabbing me every time I took a step.</li>
            <li> that is a crazy way to rate this</li>
            <li> I would rather do it myself because I hate going to a doctor.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I suffer from ingrown toenails and this file is a great tool to maintain the edges and keep them from digging in.  The file isn&#x27;t quite as fine as I would like it to be but its better than the regular files.  The ends are thin enough to fit into the corner between the nail and the skin.</li>
            <li> The product is a bit large for the work area where required. File side is good though for underneath the nail. If it was a tad skinnier/thinner, it would be perfect. I am still looking for a product which will be thin enough to do the job successfully.</li>
            <li> This tool worked better than a nail file to get under the toenail that had become ingrown. I recommend this tool and glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to maneuver around my ingrown toe nails. When I finally get it in the right place does a good job of filling down the ingrown part of my toe nail.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work like I had hoped. There is not an easy way to file with these.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my toes. I wish I knew about these products long before I went to a Podiatrist. Twice I did that and I never had any success with the procedures. After that I gave up and decided to do it myself for several years; very painful to said the least. When I try the set I fell in love with it. I&#x27;m buying this file for my sister she is going to love me for this!</li>
            <li> Was able to use this effectively the first time, even though it doesn&#x27;t come with any directions.  Perhaps some should be added?  I have a recurring ingrown on my big toe (no terrible but annoying) and since using this I&#x27;ve had no problem.  I will keep up use every few weeks.  Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was better than the Satin Edge Toenail file I ordered at the same time. This file seems to be of better quality as the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are not as coarse as the Satin Edge.</li>
            <li> This tool is small, narrow and curved , which allowed me to get to the area that was causing all the pain.  I was gonna just let a doctor fix it but the medical appointment process and then the refferal to a foot doctor was going to be a long wait - - - I needed relief.</li>
            <li> works like a charm.. Even used it on my 3 year olds pedicure.  She sees mommy grooming and insists on sharing in the beauty session.  Perfect for fiing the corners of toes, even smaller toddler toes where bulkier tools would be hard to manuever.</li>
            <li> Not what was looking for. Thought the file was going to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> This was the second item by Body Toolz that I purchased and like the curette double-angle nail cleaner and the ingrown toenail clipper (see my reviews) that I also bought I am very pleased with this extremely handy, double-sided, all stainless steel ingrown toenail file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is essentially my backup to the aforementioned ingrown toenail clippers: Any problem area that the clippers can&#x27;t successfully get to this file with a straight filing surface on one end and a curved surface on the other certainly will be able to reach and painlessly eliminate.

            <li> Works good for hard to get to parts of your toes!</li>
            <li> This tool is so nice. I used it last night, what a relief from my ingrown toenail problem. It can reach the corners with high precision without aggravating the painful spots. For some reason i thought it might be a big tool, but its almost the size of a scalpel, very handy and convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saved me the trip to doctor. Although, if my situation worsens i might have to visit a doctor at some point. I have to buy a shoe with more room for toes next.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny. My toe was killing me and I did not want to walk. I soaked my foot prior to using it and my toe hurt while removing the ingrown portion. But No major pain. It was about 5 minutes of pain while I figured out how to position toolz so I could remove the ingrown portion. It was such a difference walking after I had removed the ingrown portion. I believe the ingrown nail was stabbing me every time I took a step. It has been a few of weeks and I am still pain free.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this on July 18th and it was delivered today on July 21st!!!  Isn&#x27;t that great?  I just went through a painful episode of trying to fix my ingrown toenail last week.  I would rather do it myself because I hate going to a doctor.  I feel like I am learning how to approach it better each time that I try!!  When I got this sweet little tool today I immediately tried a couple of practice moves with it on my nails (for future use) and I am thrilled.  I know it sounds funny to be thrilled about a toenail tool, but those of you who suffer like I do with the pain know how important it is to have a good tool that helps to fix the problem.  Considering what I have been working with as tools in the past year....this is primo.  It is thin enough to slide easily under the nail, but it&#x27;s also strong enough to lift the corners. The file is good because  it gives me an accurate aim on the nail.  I have also ordered a heavy duty stainless steel toenail clipper.  It looks like a quality tool for me also. I feel really encouraged to have the right tools for fixing my toe problems.  Hopefully my pain will be much lessened the next time I have an ingrown nail.  I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Good quality stainless steel products.  Toolz worked as advertised and as anticipated. Arrived promptly and a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful tool to use to help get ingrown toenails and any fungus underneath the toenails out of the toes.  Has saved money from going to the doctor to help remove the nail.</li>
            <li> Great product. Wish I had known about it years ago.</li>
            <li> Good and usefull tool!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted in a nail tool. Great for ingrown toenails and use it on my fingernails too. Great nail tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only begun to learn to use this but am finding it helpful in trying to prevent ingrown nail discomfort. It seems sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.  Able to get into the side of the nail that other files don&#x27;t.  Saves a trip to the doctors.</li>
            <li> Love them, had them before but someone stole mine!</li>
            <li> Found this really good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dull,  not sharp edges or ends. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this had I known it wasn&#x27;t sharp. Arrived timely though.</li>
            <li> This file really works and helps in a quick way.&lt;br /&gt;Price was good and product seems to be of professional quality.</li>
            <li> I will ask the pedicurist and perhaps I am not using it correctly.  I do like it for what I have used it.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this file a try for my ingrown toe nails.  I like it and it is helpful for filing sharp edges.  At times I wish it was a little bigger to make filing easier, but I realize that if it was it would also  be harder to get into tight areas.  Good product if you have a need.</li>
            <li> does the job it is supposed to do  why do I need so many words to describe this item.  that is a crazy way to rate this</li>
            <li> It is of very high quality. It works very well. Excellent product</li>
            <li> Love it. Works very well with no undue pressure.</li>
            <li> This tool is amazing.  It is thin and fits under the outer edge of the toenail really easily to file down the edge which cuts into the skin.  Don&#x27;t know how I lived without this tool!</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;Exactly What I Wanted!!</li>
            <li> I bought several of these types of tools from Amazon for ingrown nails and this one had the most utility. The finish is not great, but it was the only one with two different shapes of thin files that allow for access to problem areas that other tools did not.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to use, but then I am old and stiff with short arms and long legs so reaching my big toes and angling the thing correctly is a difficult feat. I find my old diamond file is better, only because it is longer and I can get it to the right spot. I&#x27;m sure this tool will be wonderful for a younger, more flexible person.</li>
