            <li>and I was glad to find it on Amazon since it isn&#x27;t sold in most salons anymore.</li>
            <li>I love this product.....</li>
            <li>I is still one of my favorite affordable tanning lotions</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>I made sure I tanned about 3 times before I used a tingle lotion.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>Love the tanning results I get from using this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will again.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It gives you such an excellent tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews</li>
            <li>I am buying more ..</li>
            <li>This is still my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>It does work though :)</li>
            <li>to get a better color.</li>
            <li>Love this tanning product.</li>
            <li>For a beginning tingler I&#x27;d start with this one, I did and was pleased.</li>
            <li>But this one is mild yet it still gave a lovely color!</li>
            <li>I also loved the smell of the lotion, it is not offensively strong, just light and fresh.</li>
            <li>Wipe down your tanning bed befor you get in with your own cleaner and towel, just a tip !!!</li>
            <li>Tingle is strong for a beginner and it turns your skin very red for a while after tanning, But happy with the long-lasting result.</li>
            <li>This lotion is a tingle but the tingle is light and not felt as much which I liked because</li>
            <li>the consistency of the lotion is smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I needed a boost in my tanning results and with using a light tingle lotion does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference, but</li>
            <li>Such a lite tingle, makes for a great tanning experience.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned cool water or damp rag helps to deactivate the tingler (do NOT use warm or hot water).  </li>
            <li>The real thing!!!</li>
            <li>the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I would have liked it to have more of a bronze color to the lotion.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this one worked out great for me because it was not too intense and the tingle went away quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive to use others, but Pink Diamond is easy on my skin and gives me great color!</li>
            <li>Packaged arrived in amazing condition, clearly unused.</li>
            <li>After using this lotion you should be able to move on to much stronger tingles with no problems.</li>
            <li>Works well in the tanning booth and feels great... not too extreme of s tingler</li>
            <li>but is 100% as good as expected.</li>
            <li>When you rub your fingers across the label the silver rubs right off.</li>
            <li>Slight tingle and good bronzing.  </li>
            <li>this lotion has just the right amount of tingle, it is not uncomfortable hot, but it still does what a tingle lotion is meant to do.</li>
            <li>Corn bread bottom brown from this stuff highly recommended specially if your man likes cornbread.</li>
            <li>I purchased from a salon at much higher price (so goes everyone&#x27;s story)</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a higher tingle this isn&#x27;t the lotion for you.</li>
            <li>At first I bought a sample packet of the Ruby lotion.</li>
            <li>This was the first tingle that I ever used</li>
            <li>For my first tingle lotion, it takes a bit to get used to</li>
            <li>FYI, you will be bright red for several hours where applied!  </li>
            <li>I have tried other tingle lotions in the past and this one is probably my favorite because most tingle lotions cause an overwhelming heat sensation.</li>
            <li>My tan had pretty much plateaued.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much what it&#x27;s going to feel like</li>
            <li>I love Pink Diamond.  </li>
            <li>The tube is much thicker in consistency.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel as though this product is the real product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone not just tingle users!</li>
            <li>This lotion really works in the booth.</li>
            <li>I felt only a light heat and no tingle at all.</li>
            <li>I always prefer tingle lotions cuz they give you fast results.</li>
            <li>You can control how much comes out of the tube and this product works.  </li>
            <li>; feeling I used to feel is no longer there, also, it hasn&#x27;t really enhanced my bronze</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my legs any tanner, really.  </li>
            <li>Tingled a lot after being in the ultra bronze bed, not so much in the meduim pressure bed, maybe thats</li>
            <li>It does leave a nice brown color after about a few hours.</li>
            <li>Item came earlier than expected and in good packaging...</li>
            <li>It offers just the right amount of tingle without making you feel like you just rolled around in fiberglass.</li>
            <li>and I had a decent tab.</li>
            <li>and I mainly use bronzers, but I figured hey lets give it a try.</li>
            <li>Even several hours afterwards, exercising or sweating mildly reactivated the tingler.  </li>
            <li>It does have a high tingle factor</li>
            <li>lotion is not as high of a tingle factor as say, the Ruby lotion</li>
            <li>, I normally use my bronzer one time and</li>
            <li>The product is now in a tube and a slight bit thicker than the old product, but much better.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion because of surprising low the price was especially compared to other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it gives good color yet because it hasn&#x27;t been long since I got out of tanning bed.</li>
            <li>its a very low level tingle, so I would suggest this for a first time tingle user.</li>
            <li>It gave such a nice dark color!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I used it all over, I put a little on my arm, about 15 minutes later, the area had turned red and was warm.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this lotion after talking to a friend who&#x27;s tan look so natural.</li>
            <li>ive tried lots of different tanning products, really really like this one.  </li>
            <li>I like tingle lotions because I think you get tan much quicker, and the color seems to last longer.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>It even added considerable color to the under part of my forearms which never seem to tan.</li>
            <li>Have never used a tingle product before and tend toward sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The tingle is still a slight bit intense at first</li>
            <li>I bought after reading such high reviews.</li>
            <li>Your still gonna be PINK and hot for awhile</li>
            <li>but the hot doesnt last to long.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this lotion was such high quality at a low cost.</li>
            <li>The lid was simply taped shut and wasn&#x27;t professionally sealed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural strawberry blonde and snow white skin.</li>
            <li>but I would rather feel a little hot and itchy for a couple hrs.</li>
            <li>I got really dark, much darker than I had been.</li>
            <li>I can get pretty pale in the winter.</li>

            <li> It even added considerable color to the under part of my forearms which never seem to tan.</li>
            <li> Have never used a tingle product before and tend toward sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The tingle is still a slight bit intense at first</li>
            <li> I bought after reading such high reviews.</li>
            <li> Your still gonna be PINK and hot for awhile</li>
            <li> but the hot doesnt last to long.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this lotion was such high quality at a low cost.</li>
            <li> The lid was simply taped shut and wasn&#x27;t professionally sealed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural strawberry blonde and snow white skin.</li>
            <li> but I would rather feel a little hot and itchy for a couple hrs.</li>
            <li> I got really dark, much darker than I had been.</li>
            <li> I can get pretty pale in the winter.</li>
            <li> Due to sensitive skin and not wanting to be lobster red everywhere, I&#x27;ve taken to just applying legs only.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to a sunburn, maybe not quite as painful, but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> As soon as I stepped out, I was red (as I had expected from reading other reviews) and soon my skin turned into brown--however, it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I expected more but considering how cheap this was Im afraid I ended up being duped by fake tanning lotion.....</li>
            <li> Other than that, same tingle.  </li>
            <li> and then it turns into deep dark color that lasts!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Pink Diamond lotion is intended for indoor tanning bed use.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> The tingle was minimal, which I did like</li>
            <li> The pink lasts for a hour or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already had a nice base tan when I used this product.</li>
            <li> As a previous tanning bed owner, I sold this product in my salon and have used it frequently in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the whole line of swedish beauty products!</li>
            <li> My first time trying this lotion, I had the weird tingly feeling when I was in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> The lotion is an off white color and thick.</li>
            <li> It used to come in a bottle and was a little thinner.  </li>
            <li> It had little to no scent, zero tingle or color.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this lotion to anyone wanting a little tingle but not to be on fire so to speak.</li>
            <li> I would have been a little worried otherwise.</li>
            <li> you should tan atleast a few times before you use this.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this lotion after talking with a few friends.</li>
            <li> , half what the salon charges!  </li>
            <li> I have used swedish beauty tingle in the past.</li>
            <li> but there is a small tingle.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why amazon asked the questions on &amp;#34;how is color&amp;#34;, how often to apply, and does it cause irritation.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in tanning color or darkness...</li>
            <li> Maybe fake?</li>
            <li> I used this and it hurt so bad</li>
            <li> it also does not have an bad &amp;#34;after-tan&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> Irritated my legs really bad.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find it did not give the bronze color even after 5 uses.</li>
            <li> May have helped my tan a bit but already had a base tan.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s not too hot but does give me a great color.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this lotion after talking to a friend who&#x27;s tan look so natural. I love the tingle lotions! So I got it and I love it! This is my favorite lotion !!! You&#x27;ll never catch my gym bag without it !!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Just what I expected.  No yucky burnt after smell.  Slight tingle and good bronzing.  Appropriate for men and women.  I was complimented immediately on my tan!</li>
            <li> THIS stuff is really good.  ive tried lots of different tanning products, really really like this one.  and i got if for a great price on Amazon, half what the salon charges!  I will buy this again</li>
            <li> I used this and it hurt so bad and I turned really red and burned and I thought it was going to die, but it went away after about two hours and I had a decent tab.</li>
            <li> I used it once and I&#x27;m all blotchy ruined the great tan I already had. I&#x27;ve showered twice and the burning has not stopped. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin extremely red once I get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for people that are new to tingle products. It offers just the right amount of tingle without making you feel like you just rolled around in fiberglass. It also leaves you with a nice streak free bronze color. I have used this over the last couple of years and I was glad to find it on Amazon since it isn&#x27;t sold in most salons anymore.</li>
            <li> I love Pink Diamond.  It used to come in a bottle and was a little thinner.  The tube is much thicker in consistency.  Other than that, same tingle.  Same product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect lotion if you are a new tingle user, the tingle is relatively mild but it still creates amazing color and has great bronzers. After using this lotion you should be able to move on to much stronger tingles with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have used swedish beauty tingle in the past. I don&#x27;t feel as though this product is the real product. It had little to no scent, zero tingle or color. When you rub your fingers across the label the silver rubs right off. The lid was simply taped shut and wasn&#x27;t professionally sealed. I expected more but considering how cheap this was Im afraid I ended up being duped by fake tanning lotion.....</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the whole line of swedish beauty products! This lotion is a tingle but the tingle is light and not felt as much which I liked because then I didnt feel like I was frying. Im red fo about an hour after I use it and then it turns into deep dark color that lasts! I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone not just tingle users!</li>
            <li> Pink Diamond lotion is intended for indoor tanning bed use. It is a tingle lotion and will likely cause your skin to turn red and possibly itchy while you are in the tanning bed, and for a short time after. I like tingle lotions because I think you get tan much quicker, and the color seems to last longer. I have sensitive skin and this one worked out great for me because it was not too intense and the tingle went away quickly. I recommend that you do not shower for several hours after tanning to allow the lotion to fully absorb into your skin. I was surprised that this lotion was such high quality at a low cost. I have paid $60 for tanning lotions before, and this stuff works just as well. It also has a nice scent to it, and is not too greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works in the booth. The best one I&#x27;ve run across in 5-10 years! I purchased from a salon at much higher price (so goes everyone&#x27;s story), this is my second purchase, on Amazon, of this product. It does have a high tingle factor and I like that. I feel w/ tingle I get darker. Would not use on face.</li>
            <li> I love this product..... I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a week and I can tell the difference in my tan...sweetish beauty is my favorite!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion because of surprising low the price was especially compared to other tanning lotions. I have tried other tingle lotions in the past and this one is probably my favorite because most tingle lotions cause an overwhelming heat sensation. this lotion has just the right amount of tingle, it is not uncomfortable hot, but it still does what a tingle lotion is meant to do. I also loved the smell of the lotion, it is not offensively strong, just light and fresh. it also does not have an bad &amp;#34;after-tan&amp;#34; smell. the consistency of the lotion is smooth and not greasy. the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I would have liked it to have more of a bronze color to the lotion. I is still one of my favorite affordable tanning lotions</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Very good product if you wish to add some color to your skin.  Works as expected.  &amp;#34;Hot Amaretto&amp;#34; was the ultimate product though.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today. Smells really good. The lotion is an off white color and thick. It is a bit greasy. I felt only a light heat and no tingle at all. Maybe fake? Not sure if it gives good color yet because it hasn&#x27;t been long since I got out of tanning bed. Used this again today all over my body and felt only heat on my arms but no place else. It does leave a nice brown color after about a few hours. If your looking for a higher tingle this isn&#x27;t the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product at my tanning salon. I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a medium olive skin. I can get pretty pale in the winter. But I tan well and my skin is not overly sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t tanned in a salon for years. I made sure I tanned about 3 times before I used a tingle lotion. At first I bought a sample packet of the Ruby lotion. The Ruby lotion made you feel like you had a level 100 sunburn. I actually don&#x27;t mind that feeling since I know how deeply bronze I will be, and that sensation is temporary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS lotion is not as high of a tingle factor as say, the Ruby lotion but there is a small tingle.  I still like it though. And it works. I recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> The real thing!!! Love</li>
            <li> I used this today and yes i did feel a lil burning, so you should tan atleast a few times before you use this. It gave such a nice dark color!! I always prefer tingle lotions cuz they give you fast results. But this one is mild yet it still gave a lovely color! Will buy more. Been a fav of mine since 2008! Very good affordable tanning lotion! :) happy tanning</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite tingler! My skin is too sensitive to use others, but Pink Diamond is easy on my skin and gives me great color! The smell is also a nice plus.</li>
            <li> This will be the second bottle I have bought of this lotion. It smells great and works great. Love the tanning results I get from using this lotion.</li>
            <li> Not sure why amazon asked the questions on &amp;#34;how is color&amp;#34;, how often to apply, and does it cause irritation.  This is a Tingle 2 Bronzer used in tanning beds.  As a previous tanning bed owner, I sold this product in my salon and have used it frequently in the past.  I needed a boost in my tanning results and with using a light tingle lotion does the trick.  The product is now in a tube and a slight bit thicker than the old product, but much better.  You can control how much comes out of the tube and this product works.  The tingle is still a slight bit intense at first but after you use it a couple of times you know what to expect from the tingle.  I love this product and will again.  I alternate this with another product for tanning 2 - 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already had a nice base tan when I used this product. My first time trying this lotion, I had the weird tingly feeling when I was in the tanning bed. As soon as I stepped out, I was red (as I had expected from reading other reviews) and soon my skin turned into brown--however, it didn&#x27;t last very long. I&#x27;ve used the product for over a month and now the &amp;#34;weird tingly&amp;#34; feeling I used to feel is no longer there, also, it hasn&#x27;t really enhanced my bronze color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s okay but I would recommend something else.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this lotion after talking with a few friends. I am not one for the tingle factor and I mainly use bronzers, but I figured hey lets give it a try. I absolutely love it! It gives you such an excellent tan. However, I do not use it everytime I tan, I normally use my bronzer one time and then this the next, or I mix them together and use both. I would recommend this lotion to anyone wanting a little tingle but not to be on fire so to speak.</li>
            <li> The perfect combination of tingle and bronzer!! The lotion goes on evenly and does not leave streaks. Smells like citrus fruits, very pleasant!! Would recommend, shipped quickly, and product was sealed!!</li>
            <li> This was the first tingle that I ever used and I like the color that it gave me. its a very low level tingle, so I would suggest this for a first time tingle user.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product,first time tanner and works very well!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews so I knew what to expect. I would have been a little worried otherwise. It&#x27;s similar to a sunburn, maybe not quite as painful, but the results are amazing. Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference, but wow. My tan had pretty much plateaued. This bronzer put it over the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used it all over, I put a little on my arm, about 15 minutes later, the area had turned red and was warm. This is pretty much what it&#x27;s going to feel like once you tan. The effect last about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again. The stuff works. I got really dark, much darker than I had been. It even added considerable color to the under part of my forearms which never seem to tan. I&#x27;m really impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on for over 5 years.  It does the job for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Item came earlier than expected and in good packaging... I am happy with this product. Works well in the tanning booth and feels great... not too extreme of s tingler</li>
            <li> Tingle is strong for a beginner and it turns your skin very red for a while after tanning, But happy with the long-lasting result. I would buy it again,</li>
            <li> Great product, and the perfect tingle factor for me. Have used this product for several years. Have tried others but keep coming back.</li>
            <li> Have never used a tingle product before and tend toward sensitive skin.  Was looking for something to help legs tan.&lt;br /&gt;Burning and itching sensation 5-10 min after applying and extra heat while tanning.  FYI, you will be bright red for several hours where applied!  As others have mentioned cool water or damp rag helps to deactivate the tingler (do NOT use warm or hot water).  Even several hours afterwards, exercising or sweating mildly reactivated the tingler.  Due to sensitive skin and not wanting to be lobster red everywhere, I&#x27;ve taken to just applying legs only.  Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in tanning color or darkness...</li>
            <li> Great product..timely delivery..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, smells phenomenal and feels awesome . I got great color and my skin feels great afterward . I am buying more .. Ty for a great product. This is still my favorite tanning lotion. I wanted to add, The tingle is perfect...</li>
            <li> For my first tingle lotion, it takes a bit to get used to but is 100% as good as expected. It leaves you with a tingle/hot feeling for about 20 minutes after tanning. It does work though :) I will be buying it again</li>
            <li> I bought after reading such high reviews. I was disappointed to find it did not give the bronze color even after 5 uses. The tingle was minimal, which I did like but I would rather feel a little hot and itchy for a couple hrs. to get a better color. The smell was nice. Product was shipped well.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning product.</li>
            <li> Corn bread bottom brown from this stuff highly recommended specially if your man likes cornbread.</li>
            <li> Irritated my legs really bad.  Never reacted to any lotion whatsoever until now.  Didn&#x27;t make my legs any tanner, really.  Smells really good though!</li>
            <li> Such a lite tingle, makes for a great tanning experience. Packaged arrived in amazing condition, clearly unused.</li>
            <li> Tingled a lot after being in the ultra bronze bed, not so much in the meduim pressure bed, maybe thats becuase I&#x27;d gotten used to it by then. Your still gonna be PINK and hot for awhile but the hot doesnt last to long. The pink lasts for a hour or so. For a beginning tingler I&#x27;d start with this one, I did and was pleased. May have helped my tan a bit but already had a base tan. I&#x27;m a natural strawberry blonde and snow white skin. So its not like I&#x27;m chocolate brown now by any means. Just happy I wont get burned on vacation. Wipe down your tanning bed befor you get in with your own cleaner and towel, just a tip !!!</li>
