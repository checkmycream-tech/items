    <ol>
            <li>and the results are very good.   </li>
            <li>And that for some reason she was incredibly turned on.</li>
            <li>Best buy, great product, I recommend it 100%.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a great spot since your body heat will activate the smell when you want it.</li>
            <li>No idea if it worked lol</li>
            <li>i then tried putting it on, then putting on some of my good colonge</li>
            <li>Good buy and good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best not to think too much about this.</li>
            <li>and they all liked it as well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this to be a magical formula that will work wonders and have women flocking to you, you have to do your own part too.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be scientific guys,each person&#x27;s body chemistry produces its own pheromones,its own unique scent.</li>
            <li>and i got more hookups now</li>
            <li>and I can safely say that I think it works for me.  </li>
            <li>Interesting results, need more testing in me.</li>
            <li>Can we liquefy love and bottle it?</li>
            <li>It also seems to work better if you apply cologne over the areas you applied the pheromone formula to.  </li>
            <li>but then I noticed her being much more sexy to me as the night wore on.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The application to your clothing is ok, but it lacks the body heat activation, although it lasts longer than one day.</li>
            <li>I suggest put some on your favorite jacket.</li>
            <li>Okay, some people say it works for them, for me it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t buy through Amazon any more</li>
            <li>This product makes girls more receptive to approaches.</li>
            <li>keep buying more.</li>
            <li>I already am a good looking guy and good at flirting but this product definitely puts me over the edge!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a trial and error thing at first.  </li>
            <li>In closing, this product is great,  it gives you the extra attention needed for impressing women, 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li>will enjoy what I bought</li>
            <li>This is more like a social lube that just makes you seem more interesting.</li>
            <li>First of all, I do not consider myself a super attractive guy to ladies to begin with, so my experience proves this product really works.  </li>
            <li>and apparently the guy wasn&#x27;t all that good</li>
            <li>and I must say that I have had a very positive experience!</li>
            <li>and where that may actually be true for some</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a few times and I would think it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li>And guys, just add the other things, nice chatting, nice body and be a funny guy, it will be amazing..believe me..</li>
            <li>And your own scent or anyone else&#x27;s cannot be bottled into a liquid and applied externally.    </li>
            <li>Only one girl thought it smelled nice...</li>
            <li>I am hoping to see this more in action though.</li>
            <li>I noticed a very positive response from almost everyone I meet, Men and Women.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s man made,and not natural to your own body type.</li>
            <li>And this one is more of a social icebreaker than a \\&quot;Hey let&#x27;s jump into bed</li>
            <li>Another fun aspect of this product is, it&#x27;s also a sexuality detector, because while most of the guys reacted indifferently, a couple of my \\&quot;straight\\&quot; guy friends actually started to have the abovementioned behavioral changes  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my recent haircut; maybe it&#x27;s my own mood on a particular day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been married for 7 years and we seemed to have lost some of that \\&quot;spark\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>;) oops~      </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what is being advertised, it attracts women to men.  </li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t work on everyone it definitely works with most.  </li>
            <li>It could be I only love it because I&#x27;m smelling it and am now being affected by the attraction to myself.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I did exactly what was said</li>
            <li>on my second bottle and quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;What can be expected is more attention and openness from members of the opposite sex and these products seem to work, as female subjects are more attracted by me and more willing to make friends!</li>
            <li>&quot; I like it that they actually commit to a real quantity and a purity because so many others don&#x27;t.     </li>
            <li>Their focus of attention would stay on me as soon as I was in close proximation, from my own expriene, most ladies will usually start to fix their hair as their initial reaction, and not only they love to have conversation with me, some said they felt really hot</li>
            <li>it really works i can tell the difference when i go out</li>
            <li>I was really just looking for something to \\&quot;rekindle that spark\\</li>
            <li>This and the V-5 work really well for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>This seems to be the real thing guys.</li>
            <li>It works even when you don&#x27;t really notice it&#x27;s there, use sparingly.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t make a smell that is perfect for everyone its impossible</li>
            <li>Or maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination; but I seem to get a little more attention from women when I use this product...only sparingly.  </li>
            <li>I always wear a nice cologne, the fragrance from this is super subtle and your underarm deoderant is enough to mask it.</li>
            <li>But once you find the right ratio for you, women will definitely respond.</li>
            <li>I am buying my second bottle right now</li>
            <li>Seems to produce a more positive than negative effect.  </li>
            <li>Then I did consistently notice various behavioral changes from females around me.  </li>
            <li>Now be aware, you need to follow the directions for this to work properly.  </li>
            <li>I recommend giving it a try; you might be surprised!</li>
            <li>I definitely smelled something unusual.     </li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s more is that there&#x27;s a money back guarantee if you&#x27;re not completely satisfied!  </li>
            <li>I generally use it in combination with</li>
            <li>My words of caution and advise, do not wear them at work or any professional situations, do not wear them while visiting your in-laws, and definitely don&#x27;t wear them during guys night out with your buddies.</li>
            <li>And anyone who thought it smelled kinda weird at first didn&#x27;t smell it later, or easily covered it with cologne to hide it.</li>
            <li>Try out just a little bit at first, and then if you don&#x27;t see results gradually increase.  </li>
            <li>But I can safely say that even when my wife is in a bad mood or really stressed</li>

            <li> I have used this pheromone products and my sex life has not improved a bit...a complete waste of money and prestige...</li>
            <li> She saw the bottle and decided I was wearing the scent of what she judged as a lesser man, another man, and must have been doing so to attract other women.  </li>
            <li> I got a few pheromone products to try them out and this is the only one that actually seems to have pheromones.</li>
            <li> To all you single and want to mingle guys,the girl who is programmed to like you,will come to you,simply said.    </li>
            <li> Did not give me what I expected.</li>
            <li> My after dark activities have doubled since I started using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I hold my finger over the opening and turn the bottle upside down.</li>
            <li> To me, I can&#x27;t smell it, but there&#x27;s a very small % of people who can actually smell these.  </li>
            <li> 1/20 are the odds i got, not good enough for me to spend $40 on.</li>
            <li> It smells utterly disgusting, even at half the recommended dose, even masked with my own cologne.  </li>
            <li> &quot; that&#x27;s been missing.    </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a smell, a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m just your average \\&quot;Joe\\&quot; and</li>
            <li> is the answer i usually got.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe Amazon would allow a company with business ethics which sucks do business on their site.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and earthy, not offensive at all, at least to me.  </li>
            <li> My advice for single desperate batchelors, don&#x27;t buy that stuff.</li>
            <li> Its hard not to talk to a girl when she can&#x27;t take her eyes off of you!    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really smell, but everyone who has been around me as said it smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> bad odors and an overall bad idea...</li>
            <li> It smells bad also.    </li>
            <li> Smells bad.</li>
            <li> This product Smells really really bad</li>
            <li> list of about 20+ said it smelled bad.</li>
            <li> and they said the smell was sickening, one of them almost puked.    </li>
            <li> I am highly disgusted and have ended my purchasing through Amazon cause they have done nothing about it.</li>
            <li> This is worst than a Dear John letter on a swingers night in Hollywood.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it really works i can tell the difference when i go out cuz girls are sexier with me and i got more hookups now i won&#x27;t go out without it</li>
            <li> Ok, so i was a bit skeptical about this stuff before I bought it and I can safely say that I think it works for me.  From all the reading that I&#x27;ve done about pheromones, YMMV.  I&#x27;ve been married for 7 years and we seemed to have lost some of that \\&quot;spark\\&quot;.  But I can safely say that even when my wife is in a bad mood or really stressed and I put this on, it seems to have a calming effect on her.  My after dark activities have doubled since I started using this stuff.  And what&#x27;s more is that there&#x27;s a money back guarantee if you&#x27;re not completely satisfied!  Seriously, I&#x27;m just your average \\&quot;Joe\\&quot; and I was really just looking for something to \\&quot;rekindle that spark\\&quot; that&#x27;s been missing.    I&#x27;m not saying that this stuff is going to make her jump your bones or make her jump into bed with you, but it&#x27;s a calming type pheromone.  I like the effect and the benefits that I&#x27;ve been receiving from this product and will definitely reorder!  To me, I can&#x27;t smell it, but there&#x27;s a very small % of people who can actually smell these.  I also use Eternity for men to cover any possible smell that she might be smelling, if she can even smell it.  I started by using one drop and gradually moved to two drops.  I like the effect I&#x27;ve been getting, so I&#x27;m hesitant to go to three drops.  Again... YMMV!  Different people react differently to the different pheromone products out there.  And this one is more of a social icebreaker than a \\&quot;Hey let&#x27;s jump into bed together.\\&quot;  But some of that is also on your part too.</li>
            <li> My wife once told me, that a dude in her office once was wearing a pheromone cologne. And that for some reason she was incredibly turned on. Now she had no idea why or what the cologne was...and apparently the guy wasn&#x27;t all that good looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In recent years after the birth of our son, my wife&#x27;s sex drive has all but gone. In hopes of kindling something I ordered this M-11. It does nothing. Nothing for my wife, nothing to anyone I am around...just nothing. Bunch of bull if you ask me. Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This and the V-5 work really well for me.  Try out just a little bit at first, and then if you don&#x27;t see results gradually increase.  For instance, I use one drop of the M11 but need 3 drops of the V-5.  Everybody&#x27;s body chemistry varies, so play around with it.  It&#x27;s kind of a trial and error thing at first.  If you have on too much you may get some negative reactions.  But once you find the right ratio for you, women will definitely respond.</li>
            <li> First of all, I do not consider myself a super attractive guy to ladies to begin with, so my experience proves this product really works.  What I did was to \\&quot;go nuts\\&quot;, mixing M-11, M-15, D-17X and V-5 all up, and \\&quot;go silent\\&quot;, applying them without any cologne or aftershave.      Then I did consistently notice various behavioral changes from females around me.  Their focus of attention would stay on me as soon as I was in close proximation, from my own expriene, most ladies will usually start to fix their hair as their initial reaction, and not only they love to have conversation with me, some said they felt really hot, some got emotionally hyper, some said feeling dizzy, some got noticeably sweaty, and some couldnt resist to touch me physically, not to mention what they might feel too embarrassed to tell me...      Another fun aspect of this product is, it&#x27;s also a sexuality detector, because while most of the guys reacted indifferently, a couple of my \\&quot;straight\\&quot; guy friends actually started to have the abovementioned behavioral changes  ;) oops~      My words of caution and advise, do not wear them at work or any professional situations, do not wear them while visiting your in-laws, and definitely don&#x27;t wear them during guys night out with your buddies.</li>
            <li> Interesting results, need more testing in me. And guys, just add the other things, nice chatting, nice body and be a funny guy, it will be amazing..believe me..ahhh..eat a lot of celery too...</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it did absolutely nothing for me.Let&#x27;s be scientific guys,each person&#x27;s body chemistry produces its own pheromones,its own unique scent.And your own scent or anyone else&#x27;s cannot be bottled into a liquid and applied externally.    What these products do is try to imitate what the body does naturally,and it won&#x27;t work cuz it&#x27;s man made,and not natural to your own body type.It smells bad also.    Can we liquefy love and bottle it? Get me?    To all you single and want to mingle guys,the girl who is programmed to like you,will come to you,simply said.    Read a dating guide,talk to women everywhere,be polite,friendly,courteous and you will find the girl for you.    I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all!!</li>
            <li> She saw the bottle and decided I was wearing the scent of what she judged as a lesser man, another man, and must have been doing so to attract other women.  Smells bad.</li>
            <li> This product Smells really really bad I cant stand the odor so I just used it one time and thats it.     (just personal experience)</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what is being advertised, it attracts women to men.  Although it doesn&#x27;t work on everyone it definitely works with most.  Don&#x27;t expect this to be a magical formula that will work wonders and have women flocking to you, you have to do your own part too.  What this product does is give you a bigger edge.  This product creates an opening with the opposite sex so that you can play your part.  You still need to know how to talk to women because while this product does seem to attract them to you, you still need to close the deal.  Now be aware, you need to follow the directions for this to work properly.  Do not over apply this because it will only cause a weird odor because believe me this stuff is strong.  It also seems to work better if you apply cologne over the areas you applied the pheromone formula to.  In closing, this product is great,  it gives you the extra attention needed for impressing women, 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I got a few pheromone products to try them out and this is the only one that actually seems to have pheromones. It says on the bottle: \\&quot;5mg of pheromones minimum purity 98%\\&quot; I like it that they actually commit to a real quantity and a purity because so many others don&#x27;t.     My girlfriend initially said she didn&#x27;t smell anything but then I noticed her being much more sexy to me as the night wore on. I definitely smelled something unusual.     This seems to be the real thing guys.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really smell, but everyone who has been around me as said it smelled terrible. Smells like ammonia is the answer i usually got. i then tried putting it on, then putting on some of my good colonge and it didnt help any. Only one girl thought it smelled nice... she thought it smelled like vanilla. All others... list of about 20+ said it smelled bad. I am going to return it for my money back. You can give it a try... 1/20 are the odds i got, not good enough for me to spend $40 on.</li>
            <li> I love it. It could be I only love it because I&#x27;m smelling it and am now being affected by the attraction to myself. It&#x27;s best not to think too much about this. I hold my finger over the opening and turn the bottle upside down. This leaves enough residue on my finger to wipe a 2 inch line over the back of my neck. This is a great spot since your body heat will activate the smell when you want it. I noticed a very positive response from almost everyone I meet, Men and Women. This is more like a social lube that just makes you seem more interesting. This can lead to anything you want, but it just gives you that attraction. The smell wears out after 1 day since I apply to my skin. The application to your clothing is ok, but it lacks the body heat activation, although it lasts longer than one day. I suggest put some on your favorite jacket. Nobody has ever noticed the smell. I always wear a nice cologne, the fragrance from this is super subtle and your underarm deoderant is enough to mask it. It works even when you don&#x27;t really notice it&#x27;s there, use sparingly.</li>
            <li> the product seem to work! I generally use it in combination with D-5 and sometimes witha a bit of D-17 X and the results are very good.   &lt;br /&gt;What can be expected is more attention and openness from members of the opposite sex and these products seem to work, as female subjects are more attracted by me and more willing to make friends! ;-)</li>
            <li> Yes I bought the stuff, thought it would help my wife and I sex life. I tried it without telling her. No response. like another poster I did exactly what was said, used it for a while, but no results. Okay, some people say it works for them, for me it didn&#x27;t. My biggest problem is getting them to honor the 30 day money back guarantee. I have sent this and another lighter version back and I have yet to hear from them or get a refund. I believe it&#x27;s a big fraud and I can&#x27;t believe Amazon would allow a company with business ethics which sucks do business on their site. I am highly disgusted and have ended my purchasing through Amazon cause they have done nothing about it. Can&#x27;t buy through Amazon any more cause I feel you led me to this fraudulent company and now I can&#x27;t get my money back.</li>
            <li> I am buying my second bottle right now and I must say that I have had a very positive experience! I already am a good looking guy and good at flirting but this product definitely puts me over the edge! This product makes girls more receptive to approaches. Its hard not to talk to a girl when she can&#x27;t take her eyes off of you!    I let friends try it and they all liked it as well. And anyone who thought it smelled kinda weird at first didn&#x27;t smell it later, or easily covered it with cologne to hide it. I had several friends by the product themselves after trying it.    I can&#x27;t review this product highly enough, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Reading about this product, I often got the impression that this would help me attract almost any woman. and where that may actually be true for some, I find it&#x27;s effect a little more subtle. For me, if a woman has any sort of attraction to me, this helps &#x27;facilitate&#x27; physical interaction.  on my second bottle and quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> No idea if it worked lol</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, it doesn&#x27;t work.  It smells utterly disgusting, even at half the recommended dose, even masked with my own cologne.  I had three female friends smell it on me and they said the smell was sickening, one of them almost puked.    So if your intention is to sicken the women around you, go ahead, otherwise save your money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a smell, a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I work at a supermarket in Westlake Village. For two days I was using it and it does not work. The women either turn away or ignore me. This is worst than a Dear John letter on a swingers night in Hollywood. My advice for single desperate batchelors, don&#x27;t buy that stuff. It will turn you into a loser.      Marcus    Westlake Village[[ASIN:B0002TLDRI Pherone Formula M-11 Pheromone Cologne for Men to Attract Women, with 5mg of Human Pheromones]]</li>
            <li> I tried it in all the ways according to instructions it does not work at all. I also tried different environments and weather conditions.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t bought this product but i will in the future to test but knowing what i do in science you can&#x27;t make a smell that is perfect for everyone its impossible i rated it a 5 star because of this fact</li>
            <li> I have used this pheromone products and my sex life has not improved a bit...a complete waste of money and prestige...bad odors and an overall bad idea...</li>
            <li> Best buy, great product, I recommend it 100%.&lt;br /&gt;I keep buying more. Good buy and good experience.&lt;br /&gt;I will enjoy what I bought</li>
            <li> Did not give me what I expected. May not have been the fault of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times and I would think it&#x27;s a good product! I am hoping to see this more in action though.</li>
            <li> Seems to produce a more positive than negative effect.  Maybe it&#x27;s my recent haircut; maybe it&#x27;s my own mood on a particular day.  Or maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination; but I seem to get a little more attention from women when I use this product...only sparingly.  The fragrance is subtle and earthy, not offensive at all, at least to me.  I recommend giving it a try; you might be surprised!</li>
