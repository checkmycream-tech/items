            <li>but even as my hair dries my curls are still getting shorter and shorter, BUT it is an improvement from how my curls would look (length wise) by using this product.</li>

            <li>I love this gel!</li>

            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>It was not flaky and looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>The scent kind of reminds me of a pesticide, however once it dries, you no longer smell it.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, slippery gel....</li>
            <li>fast shipping, great product!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a nice substitute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a wash and go kind of girl</li>
            <li>When my hair was more damp I loved it.</li>
            <li>Its just a whatever kind of smell.</li>
            <li>so I tried my handy dandy Amazon account.</li>
            <li>Nice price, but not for me.</li>
            <li>So I decided to see if I could find a hair gel that was good for my hair, contained flax, and was aloe free.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to pubs on slabs of it for it to be effective :-)</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the end result.  </li>
            <li>it just wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>I will tell more people about it.</li>
            <li>I really love, love this product.</li>
            <li>my hair shrinked more</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Glad I could find it on here.</li>
            <li>I was originally going to make my own flaxseed gel</li>
            <li>It works best for me on dry hair after a twist out or braid out.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I had heard that you could make your own flax seed gel, however it doesn&#x27;t have much of a shelf life.  </li>
            <li>this is the only gel that has worked in my daughters hair hold the curl gives great shine and does what it says prevents the curls from shrinking  .</li>
            <li>I mean beautiful, soft, good smelling curly ringlets!</li>
            <li>Its worth a try for your hair!</li>
            <li>But whether you get this or make authentic flaxseed gel you will get the same amazing results.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>A nice soft smell.</li>
            <li>It was very shiny and healthy looking, but not greasy to the touch.  </li>
            <li>; I used a cream-based leavin conditioner (KBB Sweet Ambrosia) and then shingled the gel through my hair.</li>
            <li>So finding the right products as a natural curly girl has been very challenging.  </li>
            <li>This worked great on my twist out, used in conjunction with other Aunt Jackie&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend that seller, she&#x27;s really great, but I wanted a product that would last me longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this gel does not work so great on wet hair for a wash &#x27;n go style, but it does work good on wet hair for twist outs.</li>
            <li>I used it on freshly washed hair.  </li>
            <li>But with Aunt Jackies&#x27;s gel It can sit there for a while and still be good to use due to the preservatives, I&#x27;m assuming.</li>
            <li>Aunt Jackie&#x27;s Flaxseed gel gives me nice LOOSE curls.</li>
            <li>I have 3c/4a hair, and this really didn&#x27;t define my hair to any extent worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware and practice using oil to break the gel cast.</li>
            <li>Smooth this on to my super, super, super tight coils</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Really defined my curls.</li>
            <li>I have to use lightly other wise later in the day my scalp begins to itch!</li>
            <li>I just did my first wash and go since early in the summer season.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want my batch to expire to quickly because I don&#x27;t use gel regularly.</li>
            <li>The smell is decent</li>
            <li>Product gets really hard on your hair but it adds a nice shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a few dollars more here</li>
            <li>Taking down is easy.</li>
            <li>MY NEW HOLY GRAIL AND FAV..</li>
            <li>Flaxseed gel elongates hair styles, decrease shrinkage considerably, and aids in increasing the duration of your styles!</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd Aunt Jackie&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve tried (In Control and Quench were the first two).</li>
            <li>, it shrunk as usual but it has given me more definition than than the Ecostyler gel</li>
            <li>and I get nice loose curls and a few waves.</li>
            <li>For all you natural ladies like myself please invest in this gel.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft, and I didn&#x27;t find it drying.</li>
            <li>my 14 year old girl did a Bantu knot out</li>
            <li>it bother my eyes(which can be sensitive to what I put in my hair)</li>
            <li>WOW ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a amazed how well this gel works for my 4b-4c natural hair ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold now on the whole line because I&#x27;ve gotten better results from this line of products than any competing product I&#x27;ve tried -- and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few over the years, including more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>The key to avoiding the flaking or crunchiness for my hair is to not use too much of the product.  </li>
            <li>I have type 4B natural hair</li>
            <li>Completely lack luster.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get home fast enough to wash it out.</li>
            <li>I was using a flax seed line from an Etsy seller, which was great, but I didn&#x27;t use the product quickly enough and it went bad too fast for me.</li>
            <li>I am mixed with black and Mexican if that helps, although it may not being that their are so many different hair textures out there.</li>
            <li>Lots of Curls&#x27; gels usually give me nice TIGHT curls, but nothing like this gel.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten rid of the gel cast as of yet, because I am still waiting for it to finish drying, so it is a little crunchy right now.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 5 years now, so you can trust me when I say that I&#x27;ve tried just about every gel there is for African American hair!! &#x27;</li>
            <li>I add a little oil moisturizer first, then I apply the gel.</li>
            <li>If you have THICK natural hair, you need this product ;)</li>
            <li>Its a nice thick gel and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>but that could be a mistake on my part by apply a little too much in that area.</li>

            <li> and this gel just fell flat .</li>
            <li> Until I tried this product, my quest for a defined curl pattern for my natural 4C hair was a complete and total failure.</li>
            <li> I parted my freshly washed and deep conditioned hair into small sections and began to twist my hair using a little of the</li>
            <li> It was soo bad each time I separted a twist it produced more flakes!</li>
            <li> my hair is still soft but some parts of my hair are a little crunchy</li>
            <li> It dried clear and shiny, and I used a lot.</li>
            <li> I have natural , thick curly hair which is hard to tame and on a wash n go, this soft gel REALLY brings out my ringlets!</li>
            <li> But if using in conjunction with other products leaves white residue in hair.</li>
            <li> and  blow dry it with diffuser on the end.</li>
            <li> and it was soft and not crunchy or hard.  </li>
            <li> I scrunch it in my hair and I get luxurious loose, bouncy spiral curls!</li>
            <li> (Same method done with various Miss Jessies styling gels and creams)That was a complete fail, my hair was a wet, droppy, gooey, mess with white residue.  </li>
            <li> Because it make them less curly, my hair looked a barely wavy mess .</li>
            <li> Once it dried my hair had patches of white goop all over.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Its a keeper due to the curl definition, shine, hold, slip, and smell.</li>
            <li> I can start throwing my other products away.</li>
            <li> It does not flake like other gels</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It weigh my hair down neither dies</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel slimey and weighed down.</li>
            <li> Let me tell yall a little something something.</li>
            <li> My hair does still shrink a little, but nothing like before (without this product).</li>
            <li> No dandruffy looking build up when it dried.</li>
            <li> The hold is firm but not crunchy.</li>
            <li> it dried a little too hard than what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> n berries) used less gel and twisted my hair, let it air dry over night.</li>

            <li> Leaves flakes in my hair</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and Service</li>
            <li> Let me tell yall a little something something. For all you natural ladies like myself please invest in this gel. Flaxseed gel elongates hair styles, decrease shrinkage considerably, and aids in increasing the duration of your styles! I was originally going to make my own flaxseed gel but I didn&#x27;t want my batch to expire to quickly because I don&#x27;t use gel regularly. But now I know since that&#x27;s the case I&#x27;ll just make a smaller batch. But with Aunt Jackies&#x27;s gel It can sit there for a while and still be good to use due to the preservatives, I&#x27;m assuming. But whether you get this or make authentic flaxseed gel you will get the same amazing results. Plus this gel smell heavenly. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. I have 3c/4a hair, and this really didn&#x27;t define my hair to any extent worth mentioning. It also didn&#x27;t get rid of frizz for me. It made my hair soft, and I didn&#x27;t find it drying. It&#x27;s in the cabinet under my bathroom sink waiting to be given away.</li>
            <li> THE PERFECT GEL FOR CURLY HAIR..CHECK CURLS&amp;BEAUTY ON YOUTUBE TO SEE  THE RESULTS..PERFECT</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be able to use a gel on my hair but this stuff is AMAZING!!!! I use it on my 4a/4b hair and it defines my curl pattern. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love this gel! Works perfectly on my 3c hair.</li>
            <li> I am horribly allergic to soy and aloe.  So finding the right products as a natural curly girl has been very challenging.  I had heard that you could make your own flax seed gel, however it doesn&#x27;t have much of a shelf life.  So I decided to see if I could find a hair gel that was good for my hair, contained flax, and was aloe free.  That is when I found Aunt Jackie&#x27;s.  Now, when I got it, I read the label and it does contain flax, but it seem not actual flaxseed gel, but flax seed oil.  The scent kind of reminds me of a pesticide, however once it dries, you no longer smell it.  Its a nice thick gel and a little goes a long way.  I just did my first wash and go since early in the summer season.  I LOVE the end result.  I haven&#x27;t gotten rid of the gel cast as of yet, because I am still waiting for it to finish drying, so it is a little crunchy right now.  But it looks great.  I used it on freshly washed hair.  I used coconut oil, As I Am leave in conditioner and Aunt Jackie&#x27;s Don&#x27;t Shrink Flaxseed Gel.  It&#x27;s not sticky.  It isn&#x27;t weighing my hair down.  It is officially part of my wash and go routine.</li>
            <li> This gel worked so well on my hair. No dandruffy looking build up when it dried. It dried clear and shiny, and I used a lot. Lol the smell is also very light. Not too over powering. A nice soft smell.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, slippery gel....it dried a little too hard than what I&#x27;m used to. I&#x27;m aware and practice using oil to break the gel cast. it just wasn&#x27;t my favorite. I&#x27;ll stick to Eco styler.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful. Although i am still in my transition period. I loved the way this product gave me curly curls. I will tell more people about it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel really hard</li>
            <li> I have to use lightly other wise later in the day my scalp begins to itch!😑</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have natural , thick curly hair which is hard to tame and on a wash n go, this soft gel REALLY brings out my ringlets! I mean beautiful, soft, good smelling curly ringlets! I did a twist out and my 14 year old girl did a Bantu knot out and even she loved it!!! I&#x27;m sooooo ordering more!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work on my hair</li>
            <li> This product did not gave me any curl, I don&#x27;t like it i was disappointment with the product.</li>
            <li> Slimy feel but works awesome on my friends hair</li>
            <li> fast shipping, great product!!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible, flacky, did not work for my 3c hair</li>
            <li> I really like it. I section my hair and spray water and then apply. It does. It weigh my hair down neither dies it bother my eyes(which can be sensitive to what I put in my hair) it works. There is hold but not to the point where everything is crunchy. By the way my hair is curly...I am mixed with black and Mexican if that helps, although it may not being that their are so many different hair textures out there. I like it a lot. Especially in regards to the health of this product. Price isn&#x27;t bad either and you don&#x27;t need to pubs on slabs of it for it to be effective :-)</li>
            <li> Love love love it! Smells like heaven and defines my curls. 💜💜💜</li>
            <li> I get like this gel. I have what would be considered 3c and 4a curls. This gel does a great job at defining and clumping my curls! Now for the elongation part there Is some truth to that but my hair shrinks up over 70% of its length so I have yet to find a product that gives me maximum elongation.</li>
            <li> WOW .. I&#x27;m a amazed how well this gel works for my 4b-4c natural hair .. Its a keeper due to the curl definition, shine, hold, slip, and smell. IM OFFICIALLY HOOKED !!</li>
            <li> Great product. Doesnt flake or make hair hard.</li>
            <li> I was using a flax seed line from an Etsy seller, which was great, but I didn&#x27;t use the product quickly enough and it went bad too fast for me. I would absolutely recommend that seller, she&#x27;s really great, but I wanted a product that would last me longer. This is a nice substitute. A good consistency and pleasant smell. I use it in a spray bottle mixed with water for a spritz on my curls for shine and hold.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Aunt Jackie&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve tried (In Control and Quench were the first two). I&#x27;m sold now on the whole line because I&#x27;ve gotten better results from this line of products than any competing product I&#x27;ve tried -- and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few over the years, including more expensive brands. Until I tried this product, my quest for a defined curl pattern for my natural 4C hair was a complete and total failure. I thought it was going to be braids and twists forever to get any shape. This product is a game changer for me. Smooth this on to my super, super, super tight coils and I get nice loose curls and a few waves. I get neatly curled ends as well. After being disappointed by so many products over the years, quite frankly, I&#x27;m shocked and amazed by Aunt Jackie&#x27;s. I can start throwing my other products away.</li>
            <li> This worked great on my twist out, used in conjunction with other Aunt Jackie&#x27;s products.  I parted my freshly washed and deep conditioned hair into small sections and began to twist my hair using a little of the Don&#x27;t Shrink elongating gel on each piece of hair.  Once dried I twisted out my hair, picked out the roots just to enough to cover any showing scalp and the worked the rest with my fingers.  It was very shiny and healthy looking, but not greasy to the touch.  It was not flaky and looked amazing.  I got a lot of compliments on it...and it was soft and not crunchy or hard.  The key to avoiding the flaking or crunchiness for my hair is to not use too much of the product.  Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have type 4B natural hair and I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 5 years now, so you can trust me when I say that I&#x27;ve tried just about every gel there is for African American hair!! &#x27;Eco Styler&#x27; and &#x27;La Belle Lots of Curls&#x27; gels usually give me nice TIGHT curls, but nothing like this gel. Aunt Jackie&#x27;s Flaxseed gel gives me nice LOOSE curls. I&#x27;ve included some pictures, even though my camera does NOT do it justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this gel does not work so great on wet hair for a wash &#x27;n go style, but it does work good on wet hair for twist outs. This gives me some of the best curl definition ever! It works best for me on dry hair after a twist out or braid out. I add a little oil moisturizer first, then I apply the gel. You don&#x27;t need much at all, which is a good thing. I scrunch it in my hair and I get luxurious loose, bouncy spiral curls! They&#x27;re really gorgeous in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t expect for your hair NOT to shrink at all with this. My hair does still shrink a little, but nothing like before (without this product). So, it doesn&#x27;t totally stop it, but it prevents it by up to maybe 85 - 90% on MY hair. I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week and have already received compliments on my hair. My husband says it makes my hair look fuller. It definitely does &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; for me and gets the job done. I&#x27;m going to be stocking up ASAP.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel slimey and weighed down. I was hoping to find a cheaper alternatives to the miss Jessie&#x27;s line with aunt Jackie but so far I&#x27;ve been disappointed in their products . Completely lack luster. I&#x27;m a wash and go kind of girl and this gel just fell flat . Yes it stretches your curls.... Because it make them less curly, my hair looked a barely wavy mess . This bottle is still&lt;br /&gt;Sitting around in my cabinet collecting dust  5 months after buying it.</li>
            <li> Really defined my curls. When my hair was more damp I loved it. but even as my hair dries my curls are still getting shorter and shorter, BUT it is an improvement from how my curls would look (length wise) by using this product. The smell is decent I wouldn&#x27;t say it stinks, and I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells like flowers. Its just a whatever kind of smell. As my hair is dryig my hair is still soft but some parts of my hair are a little crunchy but that could be a mistake on my part by apply a little too much in that area. A little product goes a long way.  I have 3C/4a hair.I will have to do the trial and error! Its worth a try for your hair!</li>
            <li> I tried this over the weekend.  I have very thick course, tightly coily hair and can&#x27;t say that this has elongated my curls, it shrunk as usual but it has given me more definition than than the Ecostyler gel PLUS I didn&#x27;t have the flaking like I had with the gel.  The hold is firm but not crunchy. I have gotten a lot of compliments.  Even though this didn&#x27;t give me the elongation that I wanted I still recommend this production.</li>
            <li> this is the only gel that has worked in my daughters hair hold the curl gives great shine and does what it says prevents the curls from shrinking  . I&#x27;ve tried everything finally something that works</li>
            <li> Love it ! Worked well for me</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel gross. It also flaked a lot. I don&#x27;t like it at all and wish i could return the 95% of unused portion.</li>
            <li> I really love, love this product. Give great definition. Still have some shrinkage though. I usually spray with water first if it&#x27;s dry, twist it, and sleep. Taking down is easy. No tangles.</li>
            <li> If you have THICK natural hair, you need this product ;)</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t serve my purpose of larger curls. my hair shrinked more</li>
            <li> MY NEW HOLY GRAIL AND FAV..I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS :D</li>
            <li> Product gets really hard on your hair but it adds a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Best gel ever.  It does not flake like other gels</li>
            <li> I purchased this product previously at my local beauty supply(s).  They are currently sold out so I tried my handy dandy Amazon account. It&#x27;s a few dollars more here however I need to have it. This product is great.  I use it on my edges and it holds the entire day.  Glad I could find it on here.</li>
            <li> Works well. But if using in conjunction with other products leaves white residue in hair.</li>
            <li> Was looking for an alternative to Miss Jessie styling gels, but this was not it! The product doesn&#x27;t seem to play well with any leavin conditioner be it cream or spray. For a &amp;#34;wash n go&amp;#34; I used a cream-based leavin conditioner (KBB Sweet Ambrosia) and then shingled the gel through my hair. (Same method done with various Miss Jessies styling gels and creams)That was a complete fail, my hair was a wet, droppy, gooey, mess with white residue.  Once it dried my hair had patches of white goop all over. I couldn&#x27;t get home fast enough to wash it out. I figured it must have been the a creamy leavin and being a bit heavy-handed with the gel. Second time around, I used a spray leave-in conditioner (oyin handmade juices n berries) used less gel and twisted my hair, let it air dry over night. Next day, I had a well-defined, yet crunchy twist out with flakes! It was soo bad each time I separted a twist it produced more flakes! I washed it out immediately.  Nice price, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve  tried to post a review for this before but it got overshadowed by another. I like it a lot and it is very good for twists or  how I use it I wrap sections of my hair around a rat tailed comb  and  blow dry it with diffuser on the end.</li>
