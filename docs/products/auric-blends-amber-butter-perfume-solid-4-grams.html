            <li>I have worn and burned amber resin for decades and this is a very nice softer amber!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The aroma of the RA was very good, I like it, however, if I had to choose between the two</li>

            <li>The Amber Butter...is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The container is very attractive, and the screw-on/off lid means the container can be safely carried in a purse.</li>
            <li>To be perfectly honest, the shirts smell like just like the amber with no underlying offensive odor!  </li>
            <li>my mother loved it and immediately ordered some for herself.  </li>
            <li>This paste smells good, but I don&#x27;t think it goes with my chemistry.</li>
            <li>The container is gorgeous</li>
            <li>Smells so good.</li>

            <li>love love love the scent!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>LOVE this!</li>
            <li>I LOVE AMBER!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>OK, so admittedly, I am an amber maniac!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Amazing...</li>
            <li>own 5 pieces and just ordered 2 more!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont understand how anyone enjoys it honestly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear it all the time, kind of just when the mood strikes me</li>
            <li>my wife absolutely loves this and it smells great on her!</li>
            <li>the box is nice too....</li>
            <li>Thanks for excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>An expert in wearable fragrance warned me that my obsession with this amber might result in some skin breakout and took it upon herself to find me a substitute that was safe and cloned the scent that I liked so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this amazing smell.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the scent at all - way too strong for me, kind of reminds me of Este Lauder Youth Dew or something (waay too overpowering).</li>
            <li>It does smell pretty good, but not as nice to use.  </li>
            <li>Very small jar, it is beautifully carved and has the most excellent scent.</li>
            <li>So appealing is this scent to me that I took to wearing it--grating it with a Microplane and dabbing it on with a cosmetic brush.  </li>
            <li>We both love it, and have had many compliments while wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would smell better.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and had to search to find more it is wonderful..it will sink into your skin and release for many hours...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no stranger to oils, I have tried many, and no stranger to Auric Blends, and I like their EMusk as well.  </li>
            <li>If you like oils, and you like musky or woody scents you should give this a try.  :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Once it hits your body and warms up it becomes more of an oil and can be massaged into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this sophisticated scent and</li>
            <li>cute packaging.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>has a screw top which I think is better in keeping the product fresher.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every amber perfume out there, oils and solids, but I prefer the earthy, more natural-smelling ones.</li>
            <li>It has a screw-on lid, so I think it will be ok in my purse.</li>
            <li>The carved box it comes in is lovely too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m In love with this amber butter.</li>
            <li>I want more.</li>
            <li>I need more.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; ever.</li>
            <li>For the summer I will add a bit of my vanilla to make it more sunny.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Amber....</li>
            <li>just wish it held more of the Amber Butter</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times.</li>
            <li>I love this smell.</li>
            <li>Earthly and lovely.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume EVER.</li>
            <li>I love the incense-like smell, and am planning on purchasing more when this runs out.  </li>
            <li>This is a rich, warm scent.</li>
            <li>Great product, arrived fresh and sealed and exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li>It is this type of scent that originally got me hooked on amber!  </li>
            <li>Amber Butter is a very nice clean pure fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, it is beautiful and lasting.</li>
            <li>, it is so easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly from Tom&#x27;s ~~.  </li>
            <li>Sliding your finger across the top of the butter and anointing your throat, earlobes or wrists will swathe you in a sweet amber cloud that will stay with you until you bathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is how my girlfriend came to tell me how much she enjoyed it as she proceeded to steal my favorite tee :)&lt;</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I am more of a cool, clean scent person, I like scents like Cotton, Eucalyptus, mint, lemongrass.</li>
            <li>The smell if Amber was light but lasted all day.</li>
            <li>It came fast and the container is nice.  </li>
            <li>Wooden box is very nice.</li>
            <li>First, I have to say that I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Egyptian Musk by Foxcraft; in my opinion they make the BEST EMusk.  </li>
            <li>BUT, boy is it rich.</li>
            <li>It mixes with your body&#x27;s chemistry and gives each person a unique scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sensual, spicy, and unique.</li>
            <li>Honestly the only problem with the lid is that it takes a while to make sure you are rotating it evenly when closing it, or it won&#x27;t close properly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the latter for many years, and was very happy to find this alternative to give my body a break from a single product.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a natural deodorant and it is quite amazing.  </li>
            <li>do have to admit, that I LOVE the fact that they use real amber and</li>
            <li>Love it so much, I just ordered another one .</li>
            <li>This has a good aroma, with a slightly gritty texture.</li>
            <li>This has a very unique and intense scent.</li>
            <li>have started to use it as a deodorant and personal fragrance as well.&lt;br /&gt;Every container I received was fresh and extremely good smelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Auric Blends tends to sell out quickly and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you love natural scents, you will probably enjoy this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a super strong light natural unadulterated box of pulse point heaven.  </li>
            <li>Not quite what I was expecting, however it blends very well with other sweet scents I own (as well as my own masculine chemistry) to give off an amazing aroma.&lt;br</li>
            <li>small wooden jar is beautiful, about the size of a lip gloss and would be good for reusing if you use resin perfumes often.  </li>
            <li>--I am very happy with how long it is lasting.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong and no one really notices unless they are close to me.  </li>
            <li>I am not sorry!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to take a bath in it, if only there were more of it!</li>
            <li>Lovely carved wood container, and an intoxicating, long lasting, warm scent :)</li>
            <li>The amber is a great smell a little grainy from time.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this amber butter to anyone..male or female who is looking for&lt;br /&gt;that special fragrance which smells wonderful and serves several purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Smells great but seemed dried out.</li>
            <li>I can only relate my own experiences from using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is very potent and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>right away it doesn&#x27;t spread well.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and subtle but for me it is perfect for a daytime perfume.  </li>
            <li>This is a very strong blend an a match head sized portion is plenty for all day long.</li>
            <li>so, just be aware.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are too many chemicals in commercial deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I wish I was able to smell it prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li>Tried this Amber Butter for the first time.</li>
            <li>scent lasts a while though, and it really is a pretty scent for a warmer person.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have been called out to the road more than once while running low on this not-so-easily-obtainable \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I have been called out to the road more than once while running low on this not-so-easily-obtainable \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Received compliments from two strangers while shopping with my family on the first day I wore it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also like this wooden container much better than the stone container which the RA comes</li>
            <li>I bought this amber butter on a whim, and all I can say is that I was absolutely blown away!</li>
            <li>The first amber oil I ever purchased smelled exactly like this butter, but I could never find the oil again, as the supplier went out of business.</li>
            <li>Ordered two, one for daughter, and one for sister, for Christmas, and now, I may have to order one for me ; )</li>
            <li>Smells like it has been stored in a wooden keg underground for too many years.</li>
            <li>While it might be a handy size to fit in a purse or in a travel kit, it is also small enough to get easily lost on a bathroom counter...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x60;Amber Butter&#x27; by Auric Blends produces almost the same aromatic blend albeit in a wearable format that comes in an intriguing little carved pot that looks great on your vanity.  </li>
            <li>Amber has long been one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Love this and the sandalwood for bases everyday and layering on special occasions.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how quickly it showed up on my door step.</li>
            <li>The carved wood canister has a screw on lid, and will be perfect to keep small treasures when empty.  </li>
            <li>The smell can be quite strong so moderation is key; however, though I enjoy the unique wooden container, I think the wood absorbed the moisture from the solid.</li>
            <li>I have finally found a worthy replacement!  </li>
            <li>So, when I saw this advertised and saw that they used real amber, I took a shot and ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic though I had the impression it was going to be a larger amount;</li>
            <li>this AB is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;you only need a tiny amount of this great butter which is long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance and can&#x27;t stop sniffing the pretty little container.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are just a couple minor reasons why I didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars, just so you are aware.  </li>
            <li>Butter\\&quot; is a lovely amber scented solid that will please lovers of amber and especially those who enjoy L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Amber Solid Home Fragrance cubes.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want this to be overly strong, just enough to mix with your natural chemistry.</li>
            <li>If you like the scent of real amber, not the faux commercial, overtly sweet chemical stuff, I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable for cute little luxury.</li>
            <li>Nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too strong for you at first let it melt into your skin for a little while</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>An excellent scent of amber, and only a very little is needed on one wrist; when the other wrist is rubbed over it, the scent transfers well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this little jar.</li>
            <li>I used to wear Amber essential oil, but only found one type that I liked, that smelled like actual Amber resin.  </li>
            <li>This is a really fun way to use solid perfume.</li>
            <li>When that fades you&#x27;re left with a soft sweet musky woodsy scent.  </li>
            <li>It is small enough to keep in my purse and the container is beautiful enough to keep out in my living room.  </li>
            <li>the little wooden jar is sooooo cute!</li>
            <li>When I got it, it was dry, bordering on a paste more than a waxy solid.</li>
            <li>but you only need a tiny bit to rub on your pulse points and the smell is strong all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough that I get lots of compliments but soft enough</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s true the pot is small, and you don&#x27;t seem to get a lot of butter, it is strong, so you only need to rub a bit on your finger then onto your pulse points.  </li>
            <li>Please note the small yet lovely packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Diana Faillace Von Behren&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;reneofc\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The first notes to this scent are deep woodsy vanilla-ish, almost pungent.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, be aware that as the cap doesn&#x27;t secure tightly, I would not recommend this solid for travel in one&#x27;s purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since it is in a wax base, (which, for some people, is better for you that applying full strength essential oil to your skin like I used to do), it is not as strong of a scent as I got with the pure oil.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has a slightly woody, earthy scent, but that fades a bit and leaves behind that lovely, sexy amber note.</li>
            <li>Long lasting with a rich scent.</li>
            <li>I love the butter, but the little wooden box is not closing well now...</li>
            <li>This is a very potent natural Amber Butter and a little tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My co-workers call it a \\&quot;old man\\</li>
            <li>... however, it has ALWAYS washed out completely</li>
            <li>I heard about it through word of mouth (literally over a dozen women raving about it being used on men they know), and even though I&#x27;ve never actually smelled it on anyone else have received very positive reviews from the opposite sex.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be noted, I have not tried any other amber blends and when using this particular amber butter have found some occasional &amp; mild pit discoloration while perspiring in t-shirts</li>
            <li>Lasts a decent amount of time for a solid perfume/butter.</li>
            <li>Very subtle scent, and yet it doesn&#x27;t wane and wraps you in a nice amber smell.  </li>
            <li>It may come in a small package, but the fragrance is huge.</li>
            <li>The scent of this product is very nice--strong enough for a perfume but mellow enough not to give me a headache like some scents do.  </li>
            <li>Considering it&#x27;s so potent, this small container will last a long time.</li>
            <li>i wish was 10 times bigger at an alter near a fountain on an island of paradise.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be smooth like the other solid perfumes I&#x27;ve gotten, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really recommend this to other people, because I probably won&#x27;t re-purchase when I run out, unless the texture is improved.</li>
            <li>I just like wearing more natural scents that some of these weird colognes they have out nowadays.)-</li>
            <li>I just like wearing more natural scents that some of these weird colognes they have out nowadays.)</li>
            <li>But the little box is pretty.</li>
            <li>It took a while to find something \\&quot;less harsh or aggressive\\&quot; that actually worked with my own chemistry &amp; active lifestyle, and eventually settled on Earth Science&#x27;s Liken deodorant line.  </li>
            <li>In their home fragrance line, L&#x27;Occitane en Provence offers an Amber Solid cube that is lush with amber, vanilla, myrrh, and other notes.  </li>
            <li>That mights sound really odd, but I hope it helps a little.  </li>
            <li>Even while at the gym and playing sports it has held strong, and it requires a very small amount to remain efficient!  </li>
            <li>Not a long lasting aroma</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved away from heavy/commercial antiperspirants and deodorants years ago due to the levels of metals (aluminum) and other chemicals potentially being absorbed into my body.  </li>

            <li> To me, there is no scent more beautiful than this Amber Butter.  </li>
            <li> love love love the scent!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!</li>
            <li> I LOVE AMBER!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> OK, so admittedly, I am an amber maniac!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> Amazing...</li>
            <li> own 5 pieces and just ordered 2 more!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont understand how anyone enjoys it honestly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it all the time, kind of just when the mood strikes me</li>
            <li> my wife absolutely loves this and it smells great on her!</li>
            <li> the box is nice too....</li>
            <li> Thanks for excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> An expert in wearable fragrance warned me that my obsession with this amber might result in some skin breakout and took it upon herself to find me a substitute that was safe and cloned the scent that I liked so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this amazing smell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the scent at all - way too strong for me, kind of reminds me of Este Lauder Youth Dew or something (waay too overpowering).</li>
            <li> It does smell pretty good, but not as nice to use.  </li>
            <li> Very small jar, it is beautifully carved and has the most excellent scent.</li>
            <li> So appealing is this scent to me that I took to wearing it--grating it with a Microplane and dabbing it on with a cosmetic brush.  </li>
            <li> We both love it, and have had many compliments while wearing it.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would smell better.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and had to search to find more it is wonderful..it will sink into your skin and release for many hours...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to oils, I have tried many, and no stranger to Auric Blends, and I like their EMusk as well.  </li>
            <li> If you like oils, and you like musky or woody scents you should give this a try.  :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Once it hits your body and warms up it becomes more of an oil and can be massaged into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this sophisticated scent and</li>
            <li> cute packaging.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> has a screw top which I think is better in keeping the product fresher.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every amber perfume out there, oils and solids, but I prefer the earthy, more natural-smelling ones.</li>
            <li> It has a screw-on lid, so I think it will be ok in my purse.</li>
            <li> The carved box it comes in is lovely too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m In love with this amber butter.</li>
            <li> I want more.</li>
            <li> I need more.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.</li>
            <li> but this is my favorite \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; ever.</li>
            <li> For the summer I will add a bit of my vanilla to make it more sunny.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Amber....</li>
            <li> just wish it held more of the Amber Butter</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times.</li>
            <li> I love this smell.</li>
            <li> Earthly and lovely.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume EVER.</li>
            <li> I love the incense-like smell, and am planning on purchasing more when this runs out.  </li>
            <li> This is a rich, warm scent.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived fresh and sealed and exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li> It is this type of scent that originally got me hooked on amber!  </li>
            <li> Amber Butter is a very nice clean pure fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it is beautiful and lasting.</li>
            <li> , it is so easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly from Tom&#x27;s ~~.  </li>
            <li> Sliding your finger across the top of the butter and anointing your throat, earlobes or wrists will swathe you in a sweet amber cloud that will stay with you until you bathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is how my girlfriend came to tell me how much she enjoyed it as she proceeded to steal my favorite tee :)&lt;</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I am more of a cool, clean scent person, I like scents like Cotton, Eucalyptus, mint, lemongrass.</li>
            <li> The smell if Amber was light but lasted all day.</li>
            <li> It came fast and the container is nice.  </li>
            <li> Wooden box is very nice.</li>
            <li> First, I have to say that I love this scent.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Egyptian Musk by Foxcraft; in my opinion they make the BEST EMusk.  </li>
            <li> BUT, boy is it rich.</li>
            <li> It mixes with your body&#x27;s chemistry and gives each person a unique scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensual, spicy, and unique.</li>
            <li> Honestly the only problem with the lid is that it takes a while to make sure you are rotating it evenly when closing it, or it won&#x27;t close properly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the latter for many years, and was very happy to find this alternative to give my body a break from a single product.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a natural deodorant and it is quite amazing.  </li>
            <li> do have to admit, that I LOVE the fact that they use real amber and</li>
            <li> Love it so much, I just ordered another one .</li>
            <li> This has a good aroma, with a slightly gritty texture.</li>
            <li> This has a very unique and intense scent.</li>
            <li> have started to use it as a deodorant and personal fragrance as well.&lt;br /&gt;Every container I received was fresh and extremely good smelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Auric Blends tends to sell out quickly and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you love natural scents, you will probably enjoy this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a super strong light natural unadulterated box of pulse point heaven.  </li>
            <li> Not quite what I was expecting, however it blends very well with other sweet scents I own (as well as my own masculine chemistry) to give off an amazing aroma.&lt;br</li>
            <li> small wooden jar is beautiful, about the size of a lip gloss and would be good for reusing if you use resin perfumes often.  </li>
            <li> --I am very happy with how long it is lasting.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong and no one really notices unless they are close to me.  </li>
            <li> I am not sorry!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to take a bath in it, if only there were more of it!</li>
            <li> Lovely carved wood container, and an intoxicating, long lasting, warm scent :)</li>
            <li> The amber is a great smell a little grainy from time.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this amber butter to anyone..male or female who is looking for&lt;br /&gt;that special fragrance which smells wonderful and serves several purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Smells great but seemed dried out.</li>
            <li> I can only relate my own experiences from using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is very potent and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> right away it doesn&#x27;t spread well.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and subtle but for me it is perfect for a daytime perfume.  </li>
            <li> This is a very strong blend an a match head sized portion is plenty for all day long.</li>
            <li> so, just be aware.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are too many chemicals in commercial deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I wish I was able to smell it prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> Tried this Amber Butter for the first time.</li>
            <li> scent lasts a while though, and it really is a pretty scent for a warmer person.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I have been called out to the road more than once while running low on this not-so-easily-obtainable \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> I have been called out to the road more than once while running low on this not-so-easily-obtainable \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Received compliments from two strangers while shopping with my family on the first day I wore it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also like this wooden container much better than the stone container which the RA comes</li>
            <li> I bought this amber butter on a whim, and all I can say is that I was absolutely blown away!</li>
            <li> The first amber oil I ever purchased smelled exactly like this butter, but I could never find the oil again, as the supplier went out of business.</li>
            <li> Ordered two, one for daughter, and one for sister, for Christmas, and now, I may have to order one for me ; )</li>
            <li> Smells like it has been stored in a wooden keg underground for too many years.</li>
            <li> While it might be a handy size to fit in a purse or in a travel kit, it is also small enough to get easily lost on a bathroom counter...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x60;Amber Butter&#x27; by Auric Blends produces almost the same aromatic blend albeit in a wearable format that comes in an intriguing little carved pot that looks great on your vanity.  </li>
            <li> Amber has long been one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Love this and the sandalwood for bases everyday and layering on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quickly it showed up on my door step.</li>
            <li> The carved wood canister has a screw on lid, and will be perfect to keep small treasures when empty.  </li>
            <li> The smell can be quite strong so moderation is key; however, though I enjoy the unique wooden container, I think the wood absorbed the moisture from the solid.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a worthy replacement!  </li>
            <li> So, when I saw this advertised and saw that they used real amber, I took a shot and ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic though I had the impression it was going to be a larger amount;</li>
            <li> this AB is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;you only need a tiny amount of this great butter which is long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance and can&#x27;t stop sniffing the pretty little container.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are just a couple minor reasons why I didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars, just so you are aware.  </li>
            <li> Butter\\&quot; is a lovely amber scented solid that will please lovers of amber and especially those who enjoy L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Amber Solid Home Fragrance cubes.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want this to be overly strong, just enough to mix with your natural chemistry.</li>
            <li> If you like the scent of real amber, not the faux commercial, overtly sweet chemical stuff, I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable for cute little luxury.</li>
            <li> Nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too strong for you at first let it melt into your skin for a little while</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> An excellent scent of amber, and only a very little is needed on one wrist; when the other wrist is rubbed over it, the scent transfers well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this little jar.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Amber essential oil, but only found one type that I liked, that smelled like actual Amber resin.  </li>
            <li> This is a really fun way to use solid perfume.</li>
            <li> When that fades you&#x27;re left with a soft sweet musky woodsy scent.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to keep in my purse and the container is beautiful enough to keep out in my living room.  </li>
            <li> the little wooden jar is sooooo cute!</li>
            <li> When I got it, it was dry, bordering on a paste more than a waxy solid.</li>
            <li> but you only need a tiny bit to rub on your pulse points and the smell is strong all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough that I get lots of compliments but soft enough</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s true the pot is small, and you don&#x27;t seem to get a lot of butter, it is strong, so you only need to rub a bit on your finger then onto your pulse points.  </li>
            <li> Please note the small yet lovely packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Diana Faillace Von Behren&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;reneofc\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The first notes to this scent are deep woodsy vanilla-ish, almost pungent.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, be aware that as the cap doesn&#x27;t secure tightly, I would not recommend this solid for travel in one&#x27;s purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since it is in a wax base, (which, for some people, is better for you that applying full strength essential oil to your skin like I used to do), it is not as strong of a scent as I got with the pure oil.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has a slightly woody, earthy scent, but that fades a bit and leaves behind that lovely, sexy amber note.</li>
            <li> Long lasting with a rich scent.</li>
            <li> I love the butter, but the little wooden box is not closing well now...</li>
            <li> This is a very potent natural Amber Butter and a little tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My co-workers call it a \\&quot;old man\\</li>
            <li> ... however, it has ALWAYS washed out completely</li>
            <li> I heard about it through word of mouth (literally over a dozen women raving about it being used on men they know), and even though I&#x27;ve never actually smelled it on anyone else have received very positive reviews from the opposite sex.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be noted, I have not tried any other amber blends and when using this particular amber butter have found some occasional &amp; mild pit discoloration while perspiring in t-shirts</li>
            <li> Lasts a decent amount of time for a solid perfume/butter.</li>
            <li> Very subtle scent, and yet it doesn&#x27;t wane and wraps you in a nice amber smell.  </li>
            <li> It may come in a small package, but the fragrance is huge.</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is very nice--strong enough for a perfume but mellow enough not to give me a headache like some scents do.  </li>
            <li> Considering it&#x27;s so potent, this small container will last a long time.</li>
            <li> i wish was 10 times bigger at an alter near a fountain on an island of paradise.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be smooth like the other solid perfumes I&#x27;ve gotten, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really recommend this to other people, because I probably won&#x27;t re-purchase when I run out, unless the texture is improved.</li>
            <li> I just like wearing more natural scents that some of these weird colognes they have out nowadays.)-</li>
            <li> I just like wearing more natural scents that some of these weird colognes they have out nowadays.)</li>
            <li> But the little box is pretty.</li>
            <li> It took a while to find something \\&quot;less harsh or aggressive\\&quot; that actually worked with my own chemistry &amp; active lifestyle, and eventually settled on Earth Science&#x27;s Liken deodorant line.  </li>
            <li> In their home fragrance line, L&#x27;Occitane en Provence offers an Amber Solid cube that is lush with amber, vanilla, myrrh, and other notes.  </li>
            <li> That mights sound really odd, but I hope it helps a little.  </li>
            <li> Even while at the gym and playing sports it has held strong, and it requires a very small amount to remain efficient!  </li>
            <li> Not a long lasting aroma</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved away from heavy/commercial antiperspirants and deodorants years ago due to the levels of metals (aluminum) and other chemicals potentially being absorbed into my body.  </li>
            <li> It is small and a little gritty but def worth it!</li>
            <li> Not sure how long the whole vial is going to last though, so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> so it should last me a long while.</li>
            <li> its not going to last long!</li>
            <li> and I suspect it will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> A tiny tad goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> far as what you get for the money, it is a little on the pricey side, but</li>
            <li> I miss it and have been out for so long.</li>
            <li> Given he softer consistency of this solid perfume when compared to other solid scents, it seems as if Amber Butter will not last very long given the small amount in the pot and the quantity that your finger will pick up if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> Royal Amber (RA) was hard, similar to a wax candle hardness, this Amber Butter (AB) is soft like gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be aware that it is small, but a little goes a long way with this!!!</li>
            <li> , I think this one container should last me about a Month, so $10.00 a Month is actually not that bad if I really enjoy the aroma, and I&#x27;m retired living on a small fixed income.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I received it, it was in a little wooden box.  </li>
            <li> Light and yet subtle and sensuous, sadly it does not last a long time.</li>
            <li> ... had to go ahead and order something else to fill the box with for when its empty...</li>
            <li> Luckily so...very small amount and difficult to remove from wooden container</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> A little bit seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned,there is not a lot of product included in the package, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I want to try the other scents as well.</li>
            <li> Remember, you only need to apply a small amount.</li>
            <li> This thing will last FOREVER, even though it is small.</li>
            <li> it may be small in size but its big on fragrance</li>
            <li> and I love that it is in a wax base</li>
            <li> Due to being on the road over 6 months of the year, I am a RAVING fan of Amazon&#x27;s customer service and escalated Prime Membership!  </li>
            <li> Takes only a small amount (on wrists, behind ears and behind knees) and it lasts all day, not overwhelming, just a nice subtle scent...PERFECT!</li>
            <li> with less mess.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a small carved wooden container and inside is a small amount of the Amber Butter.</li>
            <li> also found the amber fragrance in this little container keeps me grounded and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I cleaned out the little splinters and bits, I put some on my wrist to test it out.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a little smokiness to it, which I like.</li>
            <li> and I prefer bolder scents, so a little bit of this rubbed on the inside of my wrist</li>
            <li> A small bit goes a long way and the scent lasts for at least a day.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about the lid because of all the reviews I&#x27;ve read, but it screws on and secures firmly.  </li>
            <li> now there will be little fear of when the product will ship or arrive!road over 6 months of the year, I am a RAVING fan of Amazon&#x27;s customer service and escalated Prime Membership!  </li>

            <li> It it small</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small container disappoint you, the butter isn&#x27;t something to be slathered on the body.</li>

            <li> Very heavy, spicy scent.</li>
            <li> (Also, since I use the Unscented Liken, the amber butter is also a way to bring a hint of \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; back into the personal mix by putting a dab across my chest or at at the base of my neck when desired.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a rather small jar, however, it lasted at least three/four months</li>

            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> Scent is weak.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to just trust the positive reviews however this stuff smells so nasty.</li>
            <li> But when I moved in 1997, I could not find that brand of oil anywhere else, and everything I could find smelled weird or was synthetic.  </li>
            <li> expensive mens&#x27; fragrances are just that...</li>
            <li> not all that bad</li>
            <li> In the am put some on your wrists and at the base of your throat.  </li>
            <li> This is HORRIBLE!</li>

            <li> Waxy, lacks depth in frangance notes. Scent is weak. Get Kuumba Amber Paste instead.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the scent at all - way too strong for me, kind of reminds me of Este Lauder Youth Dew or something (waay too overpowering). But the little box is pretty.</li>
            <li> This is a wax perfume. Tiny jar of wax perfume. Nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li> LOVE this! I have worn and burned amber resin for decades and this is a very nice softer amber!</li>
            <li> In their home fragrance line, L&#x27;Occitane en Provence offers an Amber Solid cube that is lush with amber, vanilla, myrrh, and other notes.  So appealing is this scent to me that I took to wearing it--grating it with a Microplane and dabbing it on with a cosmetic brush.  An expert in wearable fragrance warned me that my obsession with this amber might result in some skin breakout and took it upon herself to find me a substitute that was safe and cloned the scent that I liked so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x60;Amber Butter&#x27; by Auric Blends produces almost the same aromatic blend albeit in a wearable format that comes in an intriguing little carved pot that looks great on your vanity.  Sliding your finger across the top of the butter and anointing your throat, earlobes or wrists will swathe you in a sweet amber cloud that will stay with you until you bathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that as I am unaware of the actual ingredients that formulate the composition of Amber Butter, I can only say that the aroma is similar to that of L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Amber Solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two negatives.  Given he softer consistency of this solid perfume when compared to other solid scents, it seems as if Amber Butter will not last very long given the small amount in the pot and the quantity that your finger will pick up if you are not careful.  Additionally, be aware that as the cap doesn&#x27;t secure tightly, I would not recommend this solid for travel in one&#x27;s purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line?  Auric Blends \\&quot;Amber Butter\\&quot; is a lovely amber scented solid that will please lovers of amber and especially those who enjoy L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Amber Solid Home Fragrance cubes.  Highly Recommended.  Please note the small yet lovely packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Diana Faillace Von Behren&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;reneofc\\&quot;</li>
            <li> First, I have to say that I love this scent.  I used to wear Amber essential oil, but only found one type that I liked, that smelled like actual Amber resin.  But when I moved in 1997, I could not find that brand of oil anywhere else, and everything I could find smelled weird or was synthetic.  So, when I saw this advertised and saw that they used real amber, I took a shot and ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is PERFECT!  It is the correct scent of amber and I love that it is in a wax base, it is so easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are just a couple minor reasons why I didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars, just so you are aware.  It was not anything big, but was enough to catch my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Since it is in a wax base, (which, for some people, is better for you that applying full strength essential oil to your skin like I used to do), it is not as strong of a scent as I got with the pure oil.  But not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  When I ordered it, it showed it in a carved stone container.  When I received it, it was in a little wooden box.  I see that they are now showing the correct picture, so maybe my sale caused them to update the site or something, but was just not what I was expecting.  I worry that some of the essential oils in the wax can be lost by seeping into the wood, which might not have happened with the stone box, but will have to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  It is tiny.  Seriously.  I was expecting it to be about the diameter of a silver dollar or so.  This is barely bigger than a quarter.  The actual scent wax is smaller than a nickel.  so, just be aware.  While it might be a handy size to fit in a purse or in a travel kit, it is also small enough to get easily lost on a bathroom counter...so just be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to admit, that I LOVE the fact that they use real amber and the smell is spot on.  If you like the scent of real amber, not the faux commercial, overtly sweet chemical stuff, I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(and yes, I am a guy - I just like wearing more natural scents that some of these weird colognes they have out nowadays.)- I just like wearing more natural scents that some of these weird colognes they have out nowadays.)</li>
            <li> I purchased one for my mom and myself based off a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  We both love it, and have had many compliments while wearing it.  The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it lasts all day.  It&#x27;s earthy without hinting toward a stinky hippie.</li>
            <li> OMG this stuff is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;Smells so yummy. I get tons of compliments when I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easier than the oils  with less mess.&lt;br /&gt;I can pick up my lab jacket and smell it weeks after I&#x27;ve worn it.&lt;br /&gt;Now that&#x27;s a lasting scent!&lt;br /&gt;But....it&#x27;s always out of stock when I try to repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;One day I&#x27;ll get.lucky and have it again. I miss it and have been out for so long.</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is very nice--strong enough for a perfume but mellow enough not to give me a headache like some scents do.  It is a really beautiful fragrance that lasts all day--I am very happy with how long it is lasting.  No skin irritation at all.  Going to order a back-up.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! It&#x27;s smells awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would smell better.  My co-workers call it a \\&quot;old man\\&quot; smell but my mother loved it and immediately ordered some for herself.  The scent does stay on for hours and even after a bath.</li>
            <li> This amber butter is so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I own 5 pieces and just ordered 2 more!&lt;br /&gt;As I do not listen to negative reviews I can only relate my own experiences from using it.&lt;br /&gt;Although there is a tiny amount in the wooden container it is a spot on amber fragrance and&lt;br /&gt;you only need a tiny amount of this great butter which is long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I have started to use it as a deodorant and personal fragrance as well.&lt;br /&gt;Every container I received was fresh and extremely good smelling.&lt;br /&gt;There are too many chemicals in commercial deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;And expensive mens&#x27; fragrances are just that...expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this amber butter to anyone..male or female who is looking for&lt;br /&gt;that special fragrance which smells wonderful and serves several purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Have also found the amber fragrance in this little container keeps me grounded and&lt;br /&gt;centered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stocked up on it as amber butter from&lt;br /&gt;Auric Blends tends to sell out quickly and&lt;br /&gt;I cannot find it at local health food stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s Incense is the best seller on Amazon and their customer service is&lt;br /&gt;outstanding.  I highly recommend them.  And the Auric Blends Amber Butter.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and had to search to find more it is wonderful..it will sink into your skin and release for many hours...people will ask what it is that you are wearing continuosly</li>
            <li> This is HORRIBLE! It smells and stings like eucalyptus and feels like sandy wax and now I can&#x27;t seem to wash it off!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before (from another supplier) and this batch smells a bit rancid or something</li>
            <li> This is a really fun way to use solid perfume. The box is beautiful and the Amber is intoxicating! I want to try the other scents as well.</li>
            <li> I wish I was able to smell it prior to purchasing. I was hoping to just trust the positive reviews however this stuff smells so nasty. I dont understand how anyone enjoys it honestly. Its smells like a wax candle titled &amp;#34;hippie grandma&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the butter, but the little wooden box is not closing well now... I have it in my bathroom, so maybe the moisture is getting to it?  The Amber Butter...is AMAZING! I LOVE AMBER!</li>
            <li> I usually use Egyptian Musk by Foxcraft; in my opinion they make the BEST EMusk.  I&#x27;m no stranger to oils, I have tried many, and no stranger to Auric Blends, and I like their EMusk as well.  I couldn&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;d ever tried Amber Butter or Amber oil, and decided to buy this product because of the glowing reviews.  I am not sorry!  While it&#x27;s true the pot is small, and you don&#x27;t seem to get a lot of butter, it is strong, so you only need to rub a bit on your finger then onto your pulse points.  If you don&#x27;t know what Amber smells like I&#x27;ll try to describe it.  The first notes to this scent are deep woodsy vanilla-ish, almost pungent.  When that fades you&#x27;re left with a soft sweet musky woodsy scent.  That mights sound really odd, but I hope it helps a little.  If you like oils, and you like musky or woody scents you should give this a try.  :)</li>
            <li> Butter is great! The amber is a great smell a little grainy from time. The smell if Amber was light but lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend bought this for me because he knows I like amber-based perfumes. This stuff has a slightly woody, earthy scent, but that fades a bit and leaves behind that lovely, sexy amber note. Boyfriend finds it irresistible. A little goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this stuff.  It is a VERY tiny pot but you only need a tiny bit to rub on your pulse points and the smell is strong all day.  I don&#x27;t wear it all the time, kind of just when the mood strikes me so it should last me a long while.</li>
            <li> Amber Butter is a very nice clean pure fragrance.  There is no musk odor to it and I suspect it will last a very long time.  A tiny tad goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Tried this Amber Butter for the first time. Got it today. Love it so much, I just ordered another one . Smells just like my Amber resin... AWESOME</li>
            <li> Smells great but seemed dried out.</li>
            <li> This has a good aroma, with a slightly gritty texture. To me, it&#x27;s more of a vanilla amber than just an uncut amber. A piece of the inside rim had cracked off, but Amazon customer service resolved the issue in minutes. I don&#x27;t know whether or not it cracked in transit, though, since it was on the inside. Once I cleaned out the little splinters and bits, I put some on my wrist to test it out. There&#x27;s also a little smokiness to it, which I like. BUT, boy is it rich. After having it on for about 20 minutes I wish I had only applied it to my wrists instead of my wrists and the inside of my elbows. Considering it&#x27;s so potent, this small container will last a long time. The container itself is just beautiful, too.</li>
            <li> This paste smells good, but I don&#x27;t think it goes with my chemistry. The butter is crumbly, pasty substance and right away it doesn&#x27;t spread well. Once it hits your body and warms up it becomes more of an oil and can be massaged into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent lasts a while though, and it really is a pretty scent for a warmer person. I am more of a cool, clean scent person, I like scents like Cotton, Eucalyptus, mint, lemongrass. This is a rich, warm scent.</li>
            <li> It may come in a small package, but the fragrance is huge. Takes only a small amount (on wrists, behind ears and behind knees) and it lasts all day, not overwhelming, just a nice subtle scent...PERFECT!</li>
            <li> If you like smelling like an incense stick, this product is for you.  It it small but it is very potent and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Amber has long been one of my favorite scents. It can be used by men or women and is distinctive in its aroma. This is a very strong blend an a match head sized portion is plenty for all day long.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Wooden box is very nice.</li>
            <li> An excellent scent of amber, and only a very little is needed on one wrist; when the other wrist is rubbed over it, the scent transfers well. The container is very attractive, and the screw-on/off lid means the container can be safely carried in a purse.</li>
            <li> I love this sophisticated scent and how it lasts all day!  The jar this amber butter comes in is a piece of art itself.  It is small enough to keep in my purse and the container is beautiful enough to keep out in my living room.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I use this as a natural deodorant and it is quite amazing.  It mixes with your body&#x27;s chemistry and gives each person a unique scent.  Even while at the gym and playing sports it has held strong, and it requires a very small amount to remain efficient!  I heard about it through word of mouth (literally over a dozen women raving about it being used on men they know), and even though I&#x27;ve never actually smelled it on anyone else have received very positive reviews from the opposite sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved away from heavy/commercial antiperspirants and deodorants years ago due to the levels of metals (aluminum) and other chemicals potentially being absorbed into my body.  It took a while to find something \\&quot;less harsh or aggressive\\&quot; that actually worked with my own chemistry &amp; active lifestyle, and eventually settled on Earth Science&#x27;s Liken deodorant line.  I&#x27;ve used the latter for many years, and was very happy to find this alternative to give my body a break from a single product.  I started using Auric Blend&#x27;s Temple Essence Amber Butter about a year ago and am now about using it about 75% of the time.  (Also, since I use the Unscented Liken, the amber butter is also a way to bring a hint of \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; back into the personal mix by putting a dab across my chest or at at the base of my neck when desired.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be noted, I have not tried any other amber blends and when using this particular amber butter have found some occasional &amp; mild pit discoloration while perspiring in t-shirts... however, it has ALWAYS washed out completely so I assume it is simply the product transferring to the material.  To be perfectly honest, the shirts smell like just like the amber with no underlying offensive odor!  This is how my girlfriend came to tell me how much she enjoyed it as she proceeded to steal my favorite tee :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit pricing has changed, but I see the shipping is now included and the product also now falls into the Prime category.  Due to being on the road over 6 months of the year, I am a RAVING fan of Amazon&#x27;s customer service and escalated Prime Membership!  I have been called out to the road more than once while running low on this not-so-easily-obtainable \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot;... now there will be little fear of when the product will ship or arrive!road over 6 months of the year, I am a RAVING fan of Amazon&#x27;s customer service and escalated Prime Membership!

            <li> This isn&#x27;t anything like the Bath and Body Work&#x27;s \\&quot;Sensual Amber\\&quot; fragrance, so don&#x27;t expect it to be. This is a very potent natural Amber Butter and a little tiny bit goes a long way. Great for both Men and Woman. Im a Woman and I prefer bolder scents, so a little bit of this rubbed on the inside of my wrist was perfect. I also like to mix it with the Auric Blends Eygptian Goddess, or another one of my perfume oils, etc.&lt;br /&gt;If you love natural scents, you will probably enjoy this one.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a small carved wooden container and inside is a small amount of the Amber Butter. Remember, you only need to apply a small amount. If it&#x27;s too strong for you at first let it melt into your skin for a little while and then it&#x27;ll be fine. You don&#x27;t want this to be overly strong, just enough to mix with your natural chemistry. It&#x27;s sensual, spicy, and unique. Try it!</li>
            <li> musky. cute packaging. definitely not an amber smell I am used to buying. will return.</li>
            <li> Not a long lasting aroma</li>
            <li> Very small jar, it is beautifully carved and has the most excellent scent. It is a perfume balm meant to be swiped with finger then wiped on pulse points not scooped out and rubbed in like lotion. I got this for my sister as a gift and she loves it! Cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing...my wife absolutely loves this and it smells great on her! Great buy!</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic though I had the impression it was going to be a larger amount; my mistake. Lasts a decent amount of time for a solid perfume/butter. Not sure how long the whole vial is going to last though, so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Love the way it smells. I&#x27;d like to take a bath in it, if only there were more of it!</li>
            <li> love love love the scent!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A small bit goes a long way and the scent lasts for at least a day.  I scrape some onto the back of my fingernail and rub into pulse points.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this little jar. The Amber Butter reminds me of the 60&#x27;s, I&#x27;m gonna refill it with some solid perfume when it runs out.</li>
            <li> This smells so good!  It is very soft and subtle but for me it is perfect for a daytime perfume.  It is also the perfect size to pop in your purse and take with you for a touch up if you need it.  A little bit seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> This has a very unique and intense scent. I love it! People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing and ask where I bought it.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I was expecting, however it blends very well with other sweet scents I own (as well as my own masculine chemistry) to give off an amazing aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received compliments from two strangers while shopping with my family on the first day I wore it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply just enough to cover your fingertip to pulse points, and go! This thing will last FOREVER, even though it is small.</li>
            <li> I purchased both this, and the Royal Amber that came in a stone container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Royal Amber (RA) was hard, similar to a wax candle hardness, this Amber Butter (AB) is soft like gel.&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of the RA was very good, I like it, however, if I had to choose between the two this AB is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as what you get for the money, it is a little on the pricey side, but not all that bad, I think this one container should last me about a Month, so $10.00 a Month is actually not that bad if I really enjoy the aroma, and I&#x27;m retired living on a small fixed income.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like this wooden container much better than the stone container which the RA comes in.&lt;br /&gt;I like the stone container, it&#x27;s just that the wooden container this AB comes in has a screw top which I think is better in keeping the product fresher.</li>
            <li> OK, so admittedly, I am an amber maniac! Always have been. I have tried almost every amber perfume out there, oils and solids, but I prefer the earthy, more natural-smelling ones. I bought this amber butter on a whim, and all I can say is that I was absolutely blown away! It is this type of scent that originally got me hooked on amber!  The first amber oil I ever purchased smelled exactly like this butter, but I could never find the oil again, as the supplier went out of business. I have been searching for over 10 years! I have finally found a worthy replacement!  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH, and the little wooden jar is sooooo cute! It has a screw-on lid, so I think it will be ok in my purse. Be aware that it is small, but a little goes a long way with this!!!</li>
            <li> To me, there is no scent more beautiful than this Amber Butter.  The carved box it comes in is lovely too.</li>
            <li> Lovely carved wood container, and an intoxicating, long lasting, warm scent :) Ordered two, one for daughter, and one for sister, for Christmas, and now, I may have to order one for me ; )</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance and can&#x27;t stop sniffing the pretty little container.</li>
            <li> The smell can be quite strong so moderation is key; however, though I enjoy the unique wooden container, I think the wood absorbed the moisture from the solid. When I got it, it was dry, bordering on a paste more than a waxy solid. The scent is a spot on likeness of Tabu perfume. If I order it again it&#x27;ll have to be in a stone container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m In love with this amber butter. I want more. I need more. I can&#x27;t stop smelling it and myself.I wish I had a gallon of it. It came fast and the container is nice.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it is beautiful and lasting. Don&#x27;t let the small container disappoint you, the butter isn&#x27;t something to be slathered on the body. I use small amounts to wrists and neck.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find amber butter for years! I couldn&#x27;t even remember what it was called but this is my favorite \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; ever. Great product, arrived fresh and sealed and exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li> Luckily so...very small amount and difficult to remove from wooden container BUT the wooden container is part of its charm....</li>
            <li> In the am put some on your wrists and at the base of your throat.  Now spritz your perfume on.  Magnifique!.  Love this and the sandalwood for bases everyday and layering on special occasions.</li>
            <li> Very heavy, spicy scent. Smells like it has been stored in a wooden keg underground for too many years.</li>
            <li> Love it! Have one at home, another in my bag, and another in my car.</li>
            <li> Long lasting with a rich scent. It is a rather small jar, however, it lasted at least three/four months and that was with daily wear.</li>
            <li> i feel like the jimi hendrix orphanage when i wear this stuff.  this is a super strong light natural unadulterated box of pulse point heaven.  artsy craft i wish was 10 times bigger at an alter near a fountain on an island of paradise.</li>
            <li> The best! it may be small in size but its big on fragrance and you only need a touch! Cant beat the price either, I want another one to have on hand.</li>
            <li> For days I want to wear something earthy yet feminine...this is it.  It lasts and only a bit it needed.  It&#x27;s strong enough that I get lots of compliments but soft enough it&#x27;s not cloying or obnoxious.  For the summer I will add a bit of my vanilla to make it more sunny.</li>
            <li> Got this stuff cause I love the smell of Amber.... the box is nice too.... just wish it held more of the Amber Butter... had to go ahead and order something else to fill the box with for when its empty... its not going to last long!</li>
            <li> Very subtle scent, and yet it doesn&#x27;t wane and wraps you in a nice amber smell.  I was worried about the lid because of all the reviews I&#x27;ve read, but it screws on and secures firmly.  Honestly the only problem with the lid is that it takes a while to make sure you are rotating it evenly when closing it, or it won&#x27;t close properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small wooden jar is beautiful, about the size of a lip gloss and would be good for reusing if you use resin perfumes often.  It arrived with in a matter of days I was surprised at how quickly it showed up on my door step.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Fragrance last all day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times. I love this smell. Earthly and lovely.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I use it at work.  It isn&#x27;t too strong and no one really notices unless they are close to me.  It is small and a little gritty but def worth it!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume EVER.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned,there is not a lot of product included in the package, but a little goes a long way.  The carved wood canister has a screw on lid, and will be perfect to keep small treasures when empty.  I love the incense-like smell, and am planning on purchasing more when this runs out.  Arrived very quickly from Tom&#x27;s ~~.  Price was reasonable for cute little luxury.</li>
            <li> way smaller than appeared when ordering</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much--light touch is perfect!</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars because it is so grainy.  I expected it to be smooth like the other solid perfumes I&#x27;ve gotten, but it isn&#x27;t.  It does smell pretty good, but not as nice to use.  I can&#x27;t really recommend this to other people, because I probably won&#x27;t re-purchase when I run out, unless the texture is improved.</li>
            <li> Love this amazing smell. Light and yet subtle and sensuous, sadly it does not last a long time. The container is gorgeous</li>
            <li> Beautiful package. Smells so good. Thanks for excellent customer service.</li>
