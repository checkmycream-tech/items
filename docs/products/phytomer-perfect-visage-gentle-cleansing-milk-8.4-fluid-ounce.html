            <li>A serendipitous high-end facial in my early 20s changed all that when the aesthetician used this product.</li>

            <li> It has a delicate fragrance that doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies.  </li>

            <li> Just what the wife wanted.  Will buy again when the time comes to give her another gift.  Also, fast shipment</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for at least 10 years and it is great. makes my skin feel soft and clean and gets all the make up off in a soothing way. very creamy and rich</li>
            <li> This product is okay.  The liquid is a little more thin than I expected.  Fragrance is nice but again not what I expected based on other reviews.  Overall ratings is just ok.</li>
            <li> I have had combination skin (normal/oily) since my teens and was constantly \\&quot;stripping\\&quot; it with harsh cleansers to get a matte look (which of course would result in overproduction of oil hours later). A serendipitous high-end facial in my early 20s changed all that when the aesthetician used this product. I was amazed by how \\&quot;comfortable\\&quot; my skin felt, and there was no rebound-oil effect. I immediately bought a bottle and have used it for 10 years since. It is critical for my acne control and is excellent for makeup removal as well. A staple - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> my facial lady uses this product and so I thought I would try it.  Don&#x27;t really have an opinion on it yet.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have sensitive skin, and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I use Cetaphil in the summer and this the rest of the year. It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> It gently cleans my sensitive skin, without irritation.  I highly recommend this for cleansing.</li>
            <li> Phytomer is a great product!  The cleansing milk cleans very well and leaves my skin soft and healthy looking.  I have been using Phytomer for three years and all of the products I have used have been excellent.</li>
            <li> I use this every night. I love the smell and the consistency. feels like your washing your face with milk. great for sensitive skin, combo skin, dry skin and oily skin types.</li>
            <li> I used this for years and LOVE it.. Always worked well for me, does not dry out my skin.  I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Gentle facial cleanser.  Cleans off makeup from BOTH face and EYES ...gentle enough for even the most sensitive skin.  HINT...use about a quarter size and massage into face...THEN splash warm water to further massage makeup off.  Only add water AFTER you have applied product and massaged it in.  For eyes, put directly onto cotton ball and gently wipe away the makeup (including mascara)... they use a washcloth and plain water to rinse thoroughly.  Follow with the toner</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleanser at a good price!</li>
            <li> I started using this as recommended by facial gal and it is very gentle.  My skin is happiest when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s not oily, but it cleans my skin and leaves it feeling moisturized rather than &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; of its natural moisture. It&#x27;s a bargain for the amount of it you get, what it takes to clean my skin, and the total cost. It will last me a lonnnnnnngggg time!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have been searching for a gentle cleanser for several months.  I&#x27;ve used other Phytomer products, so thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It cleanses without leaving my skin dry.  It doesn&#x27;t cause redness or breakouts.  I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup (I use the Bareminerals products) and so far, this cleanser removes everything easily and gently.</li>
            <li> Please note: this is for really dry skin. It has a great texture - nice and creamy. A wonderful scent too. But I have oily, blemish prone skin and this product adds a layer of moisture to your skin, so after washing my face my skin felt greasy, not clean.</li>

            <li> so good. my skin is normal and sensitive</li>
            <li> received very quickly and what i&#x27;ve always purchased off the shelf.. smells great too..</li>
            <li> Love it, great product!! Note: it does not remove eye makeup!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, high-quality cleanser that is nice and gentle on the skin.  It&#x27;s rather pricey but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> love this line and smells great.  I extend the product with Cetaphil which helps my very very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;great line of products.</li>
