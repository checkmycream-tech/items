            <li>I don&#x27;t I love to schmear myself before bed.&lt;br /&gt;Peace and Paint,&lt;br /&gt;Debbie</li>

            <li>Love the smell &amp; feel as it goes on &amp; organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>please let me know : )</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It smells like almond extract, it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>You will be amazed at how many toxins and known carcinogens are in the products that you are buying.  </li>
            <li>and I like even more</li>
            <li>I love the 100% line.</li>
            <li>I have loved this line since I first found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is chemical free.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s so natural and good for you, but doesn&#x27;t smell like a hippie.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and smells good.</li>
            <li>Ok, I really wanted to like this product since it has such wonderful ingredients.</li>
            <li>Smooth going on and absorbs well too.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that worked great, was all natural but still girly and fun</li>
            <li>This has a great, light smell, but is pretty easy to rub in even though it has low toxins in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use a line of products that consistently doesn&#x27;t give me an allergic reaction or break my skin out.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re interested in buying more, their body washes match the lotion scents and smell just as amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few of their products and have been more than happy with all.</li>
            <li>This body cream is non greasy, absorbs rather quickly and leaves your skin smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any of their other scents in lotions, but I did try conditioner in coconut, which smelled nice, but didn&#x27;t work well, and I also tried their blood orange body wash, which again, smelled nice, but didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even describe the way it smells, just really sweet &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>The perfect - thick - consistency and goes in without a greasy feeling after.  </li>
            <li>The scent is yummy and sweet without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Just like their entire product line, this 100% pure body cream is great.  </li>
            <li>It did initially smell nice (like sweet almond oil), but within minutes of putting it on, it began to smell like &amp;#34;nauseating mud&amp;#34;, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>LOVE that they are all natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to switch over to all natural products that are better for myself and the environment and this product fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I like places like B&amp;BW because you get to try on fun scents and feel pampered</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong at first but fades nicely.</li>
            <li>I got this in one of those subscription boxes that are sent monthly and loved it so much I tracked down the full size product.</li>
            <li>that it was quite a bit cheaper than from the 100% pure website!</li>
            <li>I smelt funny every time i used it.</li>
            <li>The other scents don&#x27;t all smell consistent, this one does, I love it!</li>
            <li>I settled on this product because of the ingredients being natural, basically vegetarian, and paraban free.</li>
            <li>Each one is even better than the last!!</li>
            <li>I have this scent in and buttercream hand lotion by 100% pure.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of the Vanilla Bean a little better than this one, but the Almond wins the prize for aroma.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this body cream .</li>
            <li>and then it really dries out with this lotion.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize the mistake until after I used some of the product, so I decided to not worry about it, but I would like the seller to be more careful.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Many, many other brands will advertise \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and \\&quot;natural\\&quot; formulations, but they are not entirely organic and natural, they still contain chemicals and</li>
            <li>honey almond lotion feels amazing, and after using it for a few days, your skin becomes so silky!</li>
            <li>usually buy straight from the company, but I tried this seller here on Amazon for the first time and was satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Pure&#x27;s nourishing body creams are all natural, quality products that work!  </li>
            <li>At least I can give them a healthy start!</li>
            <li>At least I can give them a healthy start!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.  </li>
            <li>I searched for natural body care products and came across the 100% pure line here.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The 100% pure brand also makes a makeup line that I have been trying, I can&#x27;t believe how lush the lipsticks are.  </li>
            <li>: I live in a desert climate.</li>
            <li>As I needed a new l body lotion, I decided to go shopping online.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely on the skin, yet not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>a teenager who works part time washing dishes in a restaurant; I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a while&lt;br /&gt;now, and even after a long day&#x27;s worth of menial work, scrubbing and spraying, my hands are still soft and supple.</li>
            <li>If only 100% Pure could lower their prices a bit, I would be a devote customer.</li>
            <li>I might try the body butter next time instead, since I love the whole concept behind 100% pure, but I will not be repurchasing the lotion.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s all natural, the scent does dissipate after applying the product.  </li>
            <li>I use this lotion daily, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>The scents I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>I tried every lotion and body wash in the stores, even the sensitive skin, \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; lotions, and nothing helped.</li>
            <li>This lotion never itches, burns or irritates my sensitive skin, and never causes breakouts.</li>
            <li>Try this brand, the ingredients are all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>Their other lotion scents might smell better, but I&#x27;m not trusting the quality with it&#x27;s lack of moisture, and strange gritty film.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Even if you can&#x27;t make a huge overhaul on everything you use, start small.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin too long after you apply it because it&#x27;s not chemical based, but it&#x27;s still really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only other lotion that I found on Amazon that is not water based is Eco Bella water free lotion which I am going to try next.</li>
            <li>I used it last night and my skin still feels soft and not dried out.  </li>
            <li>It is not oily or greasy, and leaves my skin feeling soft for the entire day!</li>
            <li>No more toxicity, its naturally hydrating and the right thickness without making my skin oily.</li>
            <li>Little changes here and there can really make a difference in how you feel!the ingredients are all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>That being said, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long, the size is not worth the price and on my skin it left a very dry/matte finish that really bothered me.  </li>
            <li>Little changes here and there can really make a difference in how you feel!</li>

            <li> I might try the body butter next time instead, since I love the whole concept behind 100% pure, but I will not be repurchasing the lotion.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s all natural, the scent does dissipate after applying the product.  </li>
            <li> I use this lotion daily, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The scents I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> I tried every lotion and body wash in the stores, even the sensitive skin, \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; lotions, and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> This lotion never itches, burns or irritates my sensitive skin, and never causes breakouts.</li>
            <li> Try this brand, the ingredients are all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> Their other lotion scents might smell better, but I&#x27;m not trusting the quality with it&#x27;s lack of moisture, and strange gritty film.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Even if you can&#x27;t make a huge overhaul on everything you use, start small.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin too long after you apply it because it&#x27;s not chemical based, but it&#x27;s still really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only other lotion that I found on Amazon that is not water based is Eco Bella water free lotion which I am going to try next.</li>
            <li> I used it last night and my skin still feels soft and not dried out.  </li>
            <li> It is not oily or greasy, and leaves my skin feeling soft for the entire day!</li>
            <li> No more toxicity, its naturally hydrating and the right thickness without making my skin oily.</li>
            <li> Little changes here and there can really make a difference in how you feel!the ingredients are all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> That being said, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long, the size is not worth the price and on my skin it left a very dry/matte finish that really bothered me.  </li>
            <li> Little changes here and there can really make a difference in how you feel!</li>
            <li> I totally don&#x27;t get that, but if you were inclined towards almonds, you&#x27;d do better to tuck a pair of biscotti behind your ears rather than slather this mess on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the packaging is recycled and BPA free; seriously.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is quite expensive, I have to say I will definitley be investing in it again, because I&lt;br /&gt;am</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like scented lotions/creams, the smell on this lotion does not stay with you for too long.  </li>
            <li> (plus, I only use the stuff about every other night or so!)</li>
            <li> I just wished the smell would be a little longer present !</li>
            <li> I use them on my little ones especially.  </li>
            <li> I use them on my little ones especially.  </li>
            <li> The ingredient list is the main reason I tried this, but the smell is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I love this product, however was disappointed with the fact that the product came with an attached label saying it was to be sold as a set with something else, which i did not get.</li>
            <li> Everything burned, and my skin was dry again a few minutes after application.  </li>
            <li> Very thick, long lasting body cream.  </li>
            <li> I guess my only complaint it that it&#x27;s not thicker, but I guess that&#x27;s why they also sell body butter.</li>
            <li> Just keep using it, remember that your sking needs a few days to recover from the other chemical junk that you have probably been putting on it for years.</li>
            <li> I gave one less star because I was sent lemon scent instead of honey almond.</li>
            <li> If you are using another brand, spend a few minutes googleing some of the ingredients in your other lotions and shower gels, even your makeup and conditioners!</li>
            <li> A little pricey,</li>
            <li> but it seems a little waxy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey for the size you get</li>
            <li> Almond biscotti, generally speaking, doesn&#x27;t smell FAKE.</li>
            <li> My skin is CRAZY soft now!</li>
            <li> My skin did NOT feel moisturized, and it left me feeling like my skin was suffocating under some fine-gritty film.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on thick but not oily.</li>
            <li> Need some serious moisture.</li>
            <li> In the bottle it smelled yummy, but on me it smelled weird.</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical, as I did not like the smell.</li>
            <li> And this moisturizer&#x27;s odor smells very, very fake.</li>
            <li> the all-natural stuff CAN go bad, since it has no preservatives - but this was seriously one of the worst smelling moisturizers</li>
            <li> And also disappointed that my package came having been tampered with.</li>
            <li> but I hate all the nasty ingredients in the products.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The scent is divine.  The lotion had a great thickness that doesn&#x27;t leave any feeling of greasiness or stickiness.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it. I like it, but don&#x27;t love it. I will still continue to use it. I think it&#x27;s a good product and a great buy!</li>
            <li> 100% Pure&#x27;s nourishing body creams are all natural, quality products that work!  The scent on this one is amazing if you like almond or amaretto scent. Because it&#x27;s all natural, the scent does dissipate after applying the product.  Great lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like this body cream . I just wished the smell would be a little longer present ! That is why I give it 4 instead 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Still very nice cream and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Costly, but smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love that this product smells so delicious, is not tested on animals, is made in the good ol&#x27; USA, plus the packaging is BPA and Phthalate Free!</li>
            <li> I love that this product is natural and has a delicious smell.  That being said, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long, the size is not worth the price and on my skin it left a very dry/matte finish that really bothered me.  I might try the body butter next time instead, since I love the whole concept behind 100% pure, but I will not be repurchasing the lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and smell</li>
            <li> Very thick, long lasting body cream.  Smells divine.  One of the most moist body creams I have ever used.  It is greasy for those who worry about their bedsheets.  I don&#x27;t I love to schmear myself before bed.&lt;br /&gt;Peace and Paint,&lt;br /&gt;Debbie</li>
            <li> The smell just wasn&#x27;t for me. I smelt funny every time i used it. In the bottle it smelled yummy, but on me it smelled weird. It just didn&#x27;t mix well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I think, of all the 100% pure body creams, this one smells best. It is one of my faves, along with Vanilla Bean, Meyer Lemon, and Lavender. I try to keep all of them in good supply. I like the consistency of the Vanilla Bean a little better than this one, but the Almond wins the prize for aroma. It does a great job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome! I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon. No more toxicity, its naturally hydrating and the right thickness without making my skin oily. Can&#x27;t ask for more?!</li>
            <li> These products are amazing! I&#x27;ve never been able to use a line of products that consistently doesn&#x27;t give me an allergic reaction or break my skin out. I use this lotion daily, and it works very well. Smells good (mostly like honey). I guess my only complaint it that it&#x27;s not thicker, but I guess that&#x27;s why they also sell body butter.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance and soothing relief</li>
            <li> I love this product, however was disappointed with the fact that the product came with an attached label saying it was to be sold as a set with something else, which i did not get. And also disappointed that my package came having been tampered with. The package was torn open then taped back shut.</li>
            <li> This honey almond lotion feels smooth and smells great! My skin is so silky and it doesn&#x27;t irritate. I also love that it is chemical free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a nice-smelling moisturizer. This one was NOT it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the sample I got - the all-natural stuff CAN go bad, since it has no preservatives - but this was seriously one of the worst smelling moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I initially tried it, I was initially reminded of Stella D&#x27;oro Almond Biscotti, but that was only for a moment. Almond biscotti, generally speaking, doesn&#x27;t smell FAKE. And this moisturizer&#x27;s odor smells very, very fake. Blecch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would tell me what the urge is for people to want to smell like food. I totally don&#x27;t get that, but if you were inclined towards almonds, you&#x27;d do better to tuck a pair of biscotti behind your ears rather than slather this mess on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor: pass on it.</li>
            <li> Ok, I really wanted to like this product since it has such wonderful ingredients. It did initially smell nice (like sweet almond oil), but within minutes of putting it on, it began to smell like &amp;#34;nauseating mud&amp;#34;, if that makes sense. My skin did NOT feel moisturized, and it left me feeling like my skin was suffocating under some fine-gritty film. Weird. Don&#x27;t do this one. I haven&#x27;t tried any of their other scents in lotions, but I did try conditioner in coconut, which smelled nice, but didn&#x27;t work well, and I also tried their blood orange body wash, which again, smelled nice, but didn&#x27;t work well. Their other lotion scents might smell better, but I&#x27;m not trusting the quality with it&#x27;s lack of moisture, and strange gritty film.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I live in a desert climate. Need some serious moisture.</li>
            <li> This has a great, light smell, but is pretty easy to rub in even though it has low toxins in it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this 5 stars the only reason I don&#x27;t is because my only problem with this cream is I feel it doesn&#x27;t last all day. Love the smell &amp; feel as it goes on &amp; organic ingredients. I use it all the time still because I do think it&#x27;s a great product. If anyone knows of any organic body cream that smells great &amp; lasts all day please let me know : )</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. I&#x27;ve used a few of their products and have been more than happy with all. The ingredient list is the main reason I tried this, but the smell is ridiculous! So good and yummy.  It doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin too long after you apply it because it&#x27;s not chemical based, but it&#x27;s still really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in buying more, their body washes match the lotion scents and smell just as amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy straight from the company, but I tried this seller here on Amazon for the first time and was satisfied.  They had a problem with my address and called me directly to clear it up; I was impressed.</li>
            <li> I have this scent in and buttercream hand lotion by 100% pure. The scent is a little strong at first but fades nicely. I have the hand creams and some of the bigger tubes of body lotion. All are amazing. The scents I&#x27;ve tried so far (Blood Orange, white peach, honey almond, and acai berry) all fade nicely after applying and all the products make my skin feel great! LOVE that they are all natural.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because it organic and it is NOT water based.  Water based lotion/creams just evaporate off of your skin within an hour after putting it on your skin.  Complete waste of money.  I used it last night and my skin still feels soft and not dried out.  I also loved the smell.  If you don&#x27;t like scented lotions/creams, the smell on this lotion does not stay with you for too long.  Highly recommend and will buy again.  The only other lotion that I found on Amazon that is not water based is Eco Bella water free lotion which I am going to try next.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. The perfect - thick - consistency and goes in without a greasy feeling after.  Also like the scent.  A little pricey, but it&#x27;s a good treat when I&#x27;m feeling like I need one. The packaging is nice - like all their products, so it would make a nice gift, too.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but it seems a little waxy.  My skin seems to be moisturized for a short time and then it really dries out with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I got this in one of those subscription boxes that are sent monthly and loved it so much I tracked down the full size product. It&#x27;s a little pricey for the size you get but it smells so good I don&#x27;t mind paying it at all. I don&#x27;t like almonds at all so if you&#x27;re worried about it smelling &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t even describe the way it smells, just really sweet &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever found, it smells great on my girlfriend, personally I like the coconut for me though.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and works so much better than any junk-filled lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;I love how everything from the ingredients to how it&#x27;s made is just perfect - you can&#x27;t find any flaws.&lt;br /&gt;Even the packaging is recycled and BPA free; seriously.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is quite expensive, I have to say I will definitley be investing in it again, because I&lt;br /&gt;am a teenager who works part time washing dishes in a restaurant; I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a while&lt;br /&gt;now, and even after a long day&#x27;s worth of menial work, scrubbing and spraying, my hands are still soft and supple. (plus, I only use the stuff about every other night or so!) I&#x27;m one very impressed gal, folks. If only 100% Pure could lower their prices a bit, I would be a devote customer.</li>
            <li> The other scents don&#x27;t all smell consistent, this one does, I love it! Love that it&#x27;s so natural and good for you, but doesn&#x27;t smell like a hippie.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion. It is non-greasy....I love that it is natural and smells good. Almond is my signature scent!</li>
            <li> a lovely cream with a wonderful scent of almond. Smooth going on and absorbs well too. Great after a shower.</li>
            <li> This works well at moisturizing my hands and elbows during winter. I gave one less star because I was sent lemon scent instead of honey almond. I didn&#x27;t realize the mistake until after I used some of the product, so I decided to not worry about it, but I would like the seller to be more careful. Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> As I needed a new l body lotion, I decided to go shopping online. I settled on this product because of the ingredients being natural, basically vegetarian, and paraban free. The price made it easier to pick. When it arrived and I opened it up to give it a sniff I was definitely skeptical, as I did not like the smell. Since I probably could not return it, I decided to give it a go after my next shower. I love this stuff. It smells lovely on the skin, yet not overwhelming. It is not oily or greasy, and leaves my skin feeling soft for the entire day! I&#x27;d like to try the body scrub next.</li>
            <li> I have loved this line since I first found it here on Amazon. I have used \\&quot;mall brand\\&quot; lotions and body care products for years.  My skin began savagely breaking out, and took forever to heal.  I tried every lotion and body wash in the stores, even the sensitive skin, \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; lotions, and nothing helped. Everything burned, and my skin was dry again a few minutes after application.  I searched for natural body care products and came across the 100% pure line here.  This is one of the only two body care lines that I have found that actually has ALL (100%!)natural ingredients.  Many, many other brands will advertise \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and \\&quot;natural\\&quot; formulations, but they are not entirely organic and natural, they still contain chemicals and carcinogens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This honey almond lotion feels amazing, and after using it for a few days, your skin becomes so silky! Just keep using it, remember that your sking needs a few days to recover from the other chemical junk that you have probably been putting on it for years. My skin is CRAZY soft now! This lotion never itches, burns or irritates my sensitive skin, and never causes breakouts. It smells like almond extract, it is fantastic!  I know I have said it before, but this scent is my favorite! Each one is even better than the last!! It leaves my skin feeling great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100% pure brand also makes a makeup line that I have been trying, I can&#x27;t believe how lush the lipsticks are.  If you are using another brand, spend a few minutes googleing some of the ingredients in your other lotions and shower gels, even your makeup and conditioners! You will be amazed at how many toxins and known carcinogens are in the products that you are buying.  Your skin is your biggest organ, and it absorbs what you put on it. Overloading your body with toxic chemicals (lotions, makeup, etc.) can affect your hormones, your energy levels and your health. Even if you can&#x27;t make a huge overhaul on everything you use, start small.  Try this brand, the ingredients are all natural and organic. I use them on my little ones especially.  At least I can give them a healthy start! Give this brand a chance, you won&#x27;t regret it! Little changes here and there can really make a difference in how you feel!the ingredients are all natural and organic. I use them on my little ones especially.  At least I can give them a healthy start! Give this brand a chance, you won&#x27;t regret it! Little changes here and there can really make a difference in how you feel!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I like even more that it was quite a bit cheaper than from the 100% pure website!</li>
            <li> Just like their entire product line, this 100% pure body cream is great.  I&#x27;m trying to switch over to all natural products that are better for myself and the environment and this product fits the bill. This body cream is non greasy, absorbs rather quickly and leaves your skin smooth and hydrated.  The scent is yummy and sweet without being overpowering.  My husband cant get enough of me when I have it on!  I like places like B&amp;BW because you get to try on fun scents and feel pampered but I hate all the nasty ingredients in the products.  I wanted a product that worked great, was all natural but still girly and fun and this delivers.</li>
            <li> I love the 100% line. This lotion goes on thick but not oily.</li>
