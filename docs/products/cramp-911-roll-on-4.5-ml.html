            <li> I actually had a foot cramp (normally you should stand on a bar of soap to get it to go away)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already empty.</li>
            <li> Only use a few drops of the cramp 911 even though it is a roll on applicator.  </li>
            <li> The roll on bottle is small, but it only takes a little to relieve a cramp.  </li>
            <li> Plus there&#x27;s so little in this bottle, three applications</li>
            <li> It also helps the soreness left behind when the cramp ends.</li>
            <li> Also, this product is very expensive especially the standard size dispenser.</li>
            <li> I usually use Doan&#x27;s backache pills for leg cramps, and it works within a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> hard to find this product</li>
            <li> and it was not effective for my muscle spasm</li>
            <li> It relieves even my worse cramps within 20 seconds and the peace of mind this gives me is indescribable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are expensive -  Please make them cheaper.</li>
            <li> there is nothing wrong with cramp911 we have used it for years but the expiration dates are too soon to use the medicine</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but it helps.</li>
            <li> Waaaay too expensive for what you get though.</li>
            <li> I was miserable until I found this online and ordered a few bottles.  </li>
            <li> Find something else, sorry!</li>
            <li> Although I was very disappointed in the products ability to stop leg cramps.  </li>
            <li> Chemo and radiation brought on horrible leg and thigh cramps almost every night and also during the day.  </li>

            <li> Love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;It really works. It helps my husband during the hot summer months&lt;br /&gt;Its hard to find this product</li>
            <li> I get cramps in my toes. This stuff works great. Great price and good product!</li>
            <li> I keep 1 of these in my purse and one in the bathroom.  Whenever you feel pain in an area just roll it on and it takes the pain away.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without this stuff! I works almost like a miracle. I get spasms in my foot and leg from sciatic nerve damage. Helps to relieve the charlie horse within seconds of rubbing it on.</li>
            <li> For those with sudden severe muscle cramps this product offers fast - not instantaneous - relief.  I keep some by the bed.</li>
            <li> there is nothing wrong with cramp911 we have used it for years but the expiration dates are too soon to use the medicine&lt;br /&gt;up before it expires.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted and at a far cheaper price than I expected. would recommend to friend and enemey alike.</li>
            <li> My son plays high school football and swears by this product that was actually recommend by another player.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  I usually use Doan&#x27;s backache pills for leg cramps, and it works within a couple of minutes. This was an ankle cramp, and the pills weren&#x27;t fast enough. My husband put Cramp 911 all over my ankle, and the cramp disappeared immediately! I highly recommend this product for fast cramp pain relief!!</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t work for me.  but compression socks did.</li>
            <li> Best relief for leg cramps we have found!</li>
            <li> I think cramp 911 is a gift from the gods.  Chemo and radiation brought on horrible leg and thigh cramps almost every night and also during the day.  I was miserable until I found this online and ordered a few bottles.  It relieves even my worse cramps within 20 seconds and the peace of mind this gives me is indescribable.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that it doesn&#x27;t work as well on foot and ankle cramps-and for that I use Hyland&#x27;s cream.  It takes a couple of minutes to work-but it does a good job for those areas.&lt;br /&gt;I want to add that this seller has great customer service.  When I experienced a small problem with my order they immediately offered to refund or replace the bottle. I opted for replacement and received the new bottle very fast.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> this is  the best product for reliving cramps fast and easy. my husband works in the heat and gets alot of muscle cramps.</li>
            <li> wow was I surprise by the size of the bottle i got 2 uses and it was gone never again</li>
            <li> I have used this cramp 911 for over a year.  I don&#x27;t believe I suffered with leg cramps for years when it is so easy to put this on and in a minute or so the cramp is gone.  I have recommended this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have extensive cramps and I still found that mixing up an electrolyte powder worked best for me.  Also, this product is very expensive especially the standard size dispenser.</li>
            <li> Works great. Cramp 911 does the job immediately. It is def buy.</li>
            <li> Actually works. Not perfect, but it helps. Waaaay too expensive for what you get though.</li>
            <li> Cramp 911 almost Instantly relieves leg and foot cramps, which is what we got it for.  If you suffer from leg or foot cramps, you need to keep Cramp 911 in your cupboard.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  He says it doesn&#x27;t really provide him with relief.</li>
            <li> My husband gets leg cramps frequently when not eating his share of bananas.  I purchased this for him and it seems to really help easing the cramps away.  I actually had a foot cramp (normally you should stand on a bar of soap to get it to go away)...I tried this product and it helped tremendously!</li>
            <li> This works well if you use it use it with some moisturizer so it penetrates into the skin better. Only use a few drops of the cramp 911 even though it is a roll on applicator.  I tried it without any moisturizer and it was not effective for my muscle spasm so the key is to use it with a carrier cream on the skin.  My spasms are severe due to nerve damage and this is as effective as a muscle relaxant without the drowsy side effects.</li>
            <li> My item arrived on time and in good condition.  Although I was very disappointed in the products ability to stop leg cramps.  Plus you receive such a minute amount for your money.</li>
