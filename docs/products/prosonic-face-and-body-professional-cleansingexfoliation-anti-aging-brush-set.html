    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have perfect skin before this</li>
            <li>I have got to say I am really impressed with this item.  </li>
            <li>, I take it in the shower and it works perfectly well.  </li>
            <li>The Prosonic brush system is an excellent product that lives up to its promise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li>My unit has been perfectly functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think they understand the issue now, but the&lt;br /&gt;system is awesome</li>
            <li>I used it for about a month and was very happy with the results until it exploded in the shower while I was using it on my face.</li>
            <li>It deserves the BEST.</li>
            <li>nothing in life is perfect.</li>
            <li>Very happy Pro Sonic User!</li>
            <li>and it worked great for 1 week, then died.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for like 3 days then died.</li>
            <li>I also must say that I am the type of person that has worn make up to bed for over 15 years and have always had great skin.</li>
            <li>and I thought it worked great... until it stopped working for no reason.</li>
            <li>My skin looked and felt great.  </li>
            <li>I loved this when I got it</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy another brand with a good reputation.</li>
            <li>it will treat you as good as it is treating me now.  </li>
            <li>I loved this scrubber when it worked</li>
            <li>I must say I really loved the Prosonic when I received it as a gift from a friend.</li>
            <li>Please make a wise decision and spend your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li>As stated, I did get mine on Groupon for $59 which was a fair price.</li>
            <li>My skin had never looked so good before.</li>
            <li>I am done with this company for good.</li>
            <li>My skin is better than ever before!</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I bought one for $129.99 (sale),  I LOVE this!</li>
            <li>Worked nicely for the 6 weeks it worked - when the rotating head broke, I returned it to the company and after stalling and delaying for over 6 months, I received a replacement today.  </li>
            <li>To be honest I wasn&#x27;t cleaning my skin after wearing make up, and I sucked at moisturizing.</li>
            <li>On the plus side this does a really nice job cleaning your face.</li>
            <li>I have not yet contacted the company for resolution and to be honest</li>
            <li>Like many others, I thought this was the greatest product ever for the first 4 weeks I had it.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the microdermabrasion cream that came with the pack and use it consistently with great results.  </li>
            <li>The device appears to be working perfectly, and I love the thing to pieces all ready.</li>
            <li>I have had great success with both of these supplements</li>
            <li>Chose something else, for sure.</li>
            <li>Has a facial cleanser that smells so delicious</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to elaborate on them</li>
            <li>My skin never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li>It did everything it said it would, and more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing that I liked about the Prosonic is how light it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy her one.  :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;After almost three months of daily use by two people, the Prosonic has worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li>cleanser has a great smell and works very well.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I want to make sure that I gradually get my skin used to this brush so that I don&#x27;t cause any dryness or redness.</li>
            <li>I paid a lot of money for a face brush and should be able to get a lot more than just 4 months out of it.</li>
            <li>Now I just hope Prosonic is able to replace this defective unit for me without a hassle.</li>
            <li>That said I find it way overpriced and see no reason for anyone to have to pay more than $50-$75 for a product like this.</li>
            <li>You should be able to wash your face without worrying about getting products into  your eyes.</li>
            <li>Stick with a reputable company like Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Also, it does not hold a charge for more than a day</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite things for myself  (besides my Sonicare toothbrush).</li>
            <li>and  lotion goes on better too.</li>
            <li>With the body brush it spins (when it isn&#x27;t touching my face), but with the face brush it does nothing....</li>
            <li>The device is still working perfectly and I am amazed at how long the battery lasts.</li>
            <li>I loved this when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product through Groupon and loved it for the first couple of months.  </li>
            <li>Wow!, great stuff.</li>
            <li>I loved the brush since it really seemed to help my skin ...</li>
            <li>but I am very lucky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>Still gives my skin that healthy, clean, freakishly smooth glow.</li>
            <li>My skin was cleaner and smoother and I was noticing diminishing fine lines.</li>
            <li>I charged it for the full 24 hours; however, as soon as it touched my skin ever so lightly, the spinning action was greatly reduced or stopped all together.</li>
            <li>+ this little beauty works the best.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t much care forthe microdermabrasion cleanser, but it works fine and was a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have seen this around but the price was a huge deterrent for me.</li>
            <li>Purchased thru Groupon and thought I had finally found something to make my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>It was a great value for $59, especially considering the price of the comparable Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>When using the gritty exfoliating cleanser I had to keep my eyes shut because the stuff will fly into your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this flaw is why they are selling them off for cheap on Groupon.</li>
            <li>I put it out on the stone patio because I feared it would catch fire since the power light would not go off.</li>
            <li>Within 3 months of light use, it would no longer charge.  </li>
            <li>purchased it from Groupon, it made my skin smooth, but it stopped working after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It may sound paranoid, yet I have read</li>
            <li>If they address this problem and make the price more reasonable I feel it would be a better item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what effect it will have (if any) on fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I bought it through groupon as well $59 bucks great device to realy clean the pores but the one time i left it without charging for about two weeks it does not start.</li>
            <li>My skin felt great, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have paid full price even IF the thing had continued to work.</li>
            <li>*Original review May 8th 2012</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this product.</li>
            <li>It worked really good leaves your face smooth and younger looking ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true the original wand was an issue, BUT it was quickly replaced and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first 4 months that it actually worked.</li>
            <li>sometimes you get what you pay for, in this case that phrase stands true.</li>
            <li>, I recommend twisting the brush in the plastic cover after putting it on to make sure the bristles are straight.</li>
            <li>but I wish I would&#x27;ve bought it off amazon because it took a full month to get it</li>
            <li>I immediately called the company and requested full refund.</li>
            <li>In full disclosure, I must admit that I did not purchase the ProSonic brush through Amazon; instead, I ordered it from Groupon.  </li>
            <li>much more reasonably priced</li>
            <li>I found my favorite way of using it is with my favorite facial cleanser... organic milk.</li>
            <li>and I was the maid of honor in a wedding two weeks after I bought it and the difference in pictures is tremendous.  </li>
            <li>The brush PERMANENTLY STOPPED SPINNING THE VERY FIRST DAY of use.</li>
            <li>Like the positive review for this product, it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love my Prosonic brush so far!</li>
            <li>(good this I kept the old charger as the new one did not have a charging station)</li>
            <li>This product is worth it and will save you in exfoliating washes, zit creams, masks, etc</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that has given me problems with acne even through adulthood, and using the brush for sensitive skin cleared up most of that acne within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to read the many reviews about how the Prosonic stopped working or didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s more like two speeds not three), and the entire unit just felt rather cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth one star.  </li>
            <li>The product initially worked well, although it wasn&#x27;t as nice as the 100 dollar clarisonic</li>
            <li>I think there are two options here - either you go with the low end option Olay Pro-X (which has great reviews and at the lower price point) or you go with the high end option of the Clarisonic (and really get your money&#x27;s worth).</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I purchased this, and although I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far, I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing my skin continue to improve!</li>
            <li>And this is right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I have lost hearing in my right ear now for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>(I guess I was right about that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not the type of girl to tell people to go drop this much money on something to clean your face.</li>
            <li>I am probably going to buy the full size and a microdermabrasion cream which I didn&#x27;t care much for.</li>
            <li>the red light no longer cheerily blinks red indicating it is charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend spending a little more to get something from a reputable company.</li>
            <li>I followed charging instructions and was very gentle.</li>
            <li>I enjoy how clean my face feels and have used the different brushes as indicated.  </li>
            <li>I received my first prosonic as a Christmas gift, which then broke in January.</li>
            <li>so I could use it first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>Everything was in pristine condition, and it turned on before its first charge.</li>
            <li>It arrived at my house on December 27, 2012 - more than one month later.</li>
            <li>First I got the Prosonic and then after a couple months it just stopped charging.</li>
            <li>I would love the product if it actually worked.</li>
            <li>I noticed results after the FIRST time I used it.</li>
            <li>and I ended up on my hands and knees, not being able to hear for several seconds.  </li>
            <li>I am making an appointment with an ear doctor first thing tomorrow morning.  </li>
            <li>I used it after letting it charge overnight, and right away I noticed how much cleaner and smoother</li>
            <li>While the brush worked wonders while it WORKED, I would strongly advise against paying full price for this when clearly the company is majorly lacking  in the customer service department.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste your money and more importantly don&#x27;t risk your health and well being.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good money perfectly wasted!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they replaced it without much suffering on my end, however it seems that the incident rate is pretty high, and the wait times are pretty long.</li>
            <li>I look forward to washing my face now because it&#x27;s so easy to hold it in one hand and get my entire face.  </li>
            <li>It took nearly TWO MONTHS TO GET THE REPLACEMENT WHICH ALSO DIED WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF USE!</li>
            <li>I am very lucky that I escaped with no major injury.</li>
            <li>I felt like my skin was cleaner and prettier but the pictures absolutely prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used either of the cleaning products because my skin is really sensitive and it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>Am very satisified.</li>
            <li>(Which I thought was the whole point.)</li>
            <li>Be gentle with it, it&#x27;s no lawn,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>(because the red light stopped blinking after it was plugged in for awhile).</li>
            <li>It really deserve no stars.</li>
            <li>I was looking for my skin to look even better as great skin unfortunately doesn&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen this advertised for as much as $204 and that&#x27;s just highway robbery.  </li>
            <li>so much for the quality of this product and so much for buying on groupon.  </li>
            <li>It was also really improving the acne on my son&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>My toner soaks in much easier and faster</li>
            <li>I really should have read the reviews for this product before purchasing it from Groupon.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t even rate it one star.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, like many other users of the product, mine stopped working after about a month</li>
            <li>, like many other reviewers, purchased this brush on Groupon for $59.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off with one of the other 2 options for face brushes.  </li>
            <li>this is many other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, my skin feels SO ridiculously clean</li>
            <li>I swear by Purity by Philosophy, but I like this cleanser so much that I will buy the full sized bottle and alternate between the two.</li>
            <li>to my dismay I just tried to change the brush head for the first time and the entire component came right off and broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TWO full MONTHS of waiting for a replacement, I finally received it and guess what-</li>
            <li>It has a full year warranty, but doesn&#x27;t even last 90 days!</li>
            <li>If I had had the brush near my eye, I very well could have damaged my sight!  </li>
            <li>I went to switch the brush head from the normal to the sensitive and the brush broke and the heads no longer attach!!!</li>
            <li>The one thing I wasn&#x27;t happy with about this product is the fact the brush for normal skin (black ring in the center) had bent bristles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so excited to break open the new device and promptly went home and put it on the charger</li>
            <li>I received an email back from them saying that they were in the process of upgrading the ProSonic 1 and the new product would be available by June and at that point they would mail me a new one.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company by email and telephone within an hour, after talking to doctors, icing my neck and hand (my neck has a huge red ring around it and the skin is all crepey and sensitive this morning).  </li>
            <li>Super bummed things didn&#x27;t work out, but take my advice and RUN in a different direction.</li>
            <li>There was a loud, explosive sound, like a firecracker, next to my ear.  </li>
            <li>After a couple months of use, I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone based on these things alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them as a part of your skin care routine.</li>
            <li>This is especially important for me because my mom has rheumatoid arthritis, so she can&#x27;t lift very heavy objects or hold things for very long.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this little gadget.</li>
            <li>The other brushes were fine.</li>
            <li>Mine has worked fine using every other day and charging it once a week</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want a new one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in contact with the company, and they promised to mail me a new one (the Prosonic 2).</li>
            <li>Then the new replacement unit quit after just 3-4 months.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any new acne or breakouts since I started using the Prosonic, and the breakouts that were already there are fading.</li>
            <li>I refuse to ask for a replacement at this point its more aggravation and a complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>I bought the prosonic face brush on sale, thinking it was a cheaper alternative than the expensive name brand, but better quality than the cheap department store brands.</li>
            <li>but wow what a change!</li>
            <li>Within 5 weeks, the unit will only work on the first speed.</li>
            <li>Finally received my replacement and guess what, they gave me an Exact \\&quot;replacement\\&quot;</li>
            <li>First unit broke, got a second unit and it broke.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The second one doesn&#x27;t vibrate as much as the first one did (so presumably it wasn&#x27;t working as well?) and does not operate at all on the 3rd and 4th speeds.  </li>
            <li>think the Clarisonic product is more expensive but in the long run, you&#x27;ll probably be better off.</li>
            <li>Hopefully any new product will address this as it can be a safety concern and someone could potentially have damage to an eye during use and that&#x27;s a real issue.</li>
            <li>My oily skin is also more manageable, and I find myself needing less facial moisturizer during</li>
            <li>The brushes come with little plastic covers which are fantastic for storing them, they have holes</li>
            <li>It worked fabulous for three weeks, then some little piece broke off and the brush no longer spins.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, about a week before I started using the Prosonic, I also started using two supplements in hope that they would help clear my acne:</li>
            <li>(Note: not purchased through Amazon - but directly from the company Make(me)Heal.)</li>
            <li>but they have completely stopped now.</li>
            <li>Even after the explosion and the power and cycle speed button completely imploded, it kept on spinning.</li>
            <li>I really think that there are enough complaints of this nature for Prosonic to have an official recall of the affected batches!</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother, my pores are smaller, and the blackhead issue I&#x27;ve always had on my nose is gone.</li>
            <li>This is a complete rip off.</li>
            <li>There was a extremely loud pop and sparks/debris shot out of the power button.  </li>
            <li>Loud as a shotgun, it shot sparks and metal pieces at my head.</li>
            <li>The company can expect a class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B007RQSRKU Prosonic Face &amp; Body Professional Cleansing/Exfoliation</li>
            <li>yesterday morning, I was about ten seconds in, and thank God doing my neck, when the whole thing exploded in my hand, sending shocks up my arm.  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer described, when it did spin, it felt and sounded like a rickety old wheel.</li>
            <li>I always dried my hands before touching it and only washed the brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Right now I am only using it 3 times a week, will go to daily in another 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>and my head is still hurting and my hearing still isn&#x27;t back to normal!</li>
            <li>At the same time, I only paid $59 for the product through Groupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the month that it took to get to me, I was so excited once I finally received this product.</li>
            <li>Last week, after only having it maybe 4 weeks, the whole thing literally exploded while I was using it!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I am more disappointed than pleased however.  </li>
            <li>Luckily my hearing did come back, about 5 minutes later, but my ears are still ringing, my left eye hurts</li>
            <li>The first thing I did is to check instructions to make sure that I didn&#x27;t do something wrong.</li>
            <li>My cat normally likes to sit on the countertop next to me as I&#x27;m washing up</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I could have been using clarisonic without losing money or time, which is partially my fault for not choosing the superior brand from the get go, but this company claims to match its effectiveness; I now know this is a clear case of false advertising and misrepresentation.</li>
            <li>The email I got back stated that they took out the spinning feature of the ProSonic 1 and the ProSonic 2 only \\&quot;oscillates\\&quot; since a \\&quot;large number of customers preferred oscillating to spinning.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I contacted ProSonic and, after several follow-up emails, they sent me a new one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got in on a Groupon and am only out $50, but it still sucks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dead red light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the same experience as the many negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>It is unfortunate for those who have had a negative experience, for the record, mine has been great!</li>
            <li>am definitely not pleased with this \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; since I purchased the product originally for the spinning effect.  </li>
            <li>I find this a MAJOR flaw with this product.</li>
            <li>Let me first state I did not by this product through Amazon but rather through Groupon like a lot of the other reviewers and had I read all of the reviews here, I would have never wasted my money nor put my teenager at such risk.</li>
            <li>The brush is gentle enough that I can use it daily, and I alternate the cleanser and microdermabrasion cream to prevent over-exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li>The unit can cleanse both body and face with different brushes and vibration settings, yet it&#x27;s not heavy or cumbersome like the comparably functioning Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I have only tried the sensitive skin brush and the lowest speed setting.</li>
            <li>the explosion was so loud I still cannot hear correctly in my left ear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my brush for about 2-3 months and it has completely stopped working for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li>It comes with a sensitive skin brush, the pure white, and also a body buffing brush, the black outer ring one.</li>
            <li>Last night, it exploded near my left eye and ear as I was cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product with a living social promotion.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush head is by far the body buffer brush, I had breakouts every now and then on random areas on my body.</li>
            <li>It may be the first day or the 2nd month, but it is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH BUYING!</li>
            <li>Clarsonic should thank them for improving their customer base, my 3 year old Clarsonic is used daily and is amazing!</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t have perfect skin before this</li>
            <li> I have got to say I am really impressed with this item.  </li>
            <li> , I take it in the shower and it works perfectly well.  </li>
            <li> The Prosonic brush system is an excellent product that lives up to its promise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li> My unit has been perfectly functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think they understand the issue now, but the&lt;br /&gt;system is awesome</li>
            <li> I used it for about a month and was very happy with the results until it exploded in the shower while I was using it on my face.</li>
            <li> It deserves the BEST.</li>
            <li> nothing in life is perfect.</li>
            <li> Very happy Pro Sonic User!</li>
            <li> and it worked great for 1 week, then died.  </li>
            <li> Worked great for like 3 days then died.</li>
            <li> I also must say that I am the type of person that has worn make up to bed for over 15 years and have always had great skin.</li>
            <li> and I thought it worked great... until it stopped working for no reason.</li>
            <li> My skin looked and felt great.  </li>
            <li> I loved this when I got it</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy another brand with a good reputation.</li>
            <li> it will treat you as good as it is treating me now.  </li>
            <li> I loved this scrubber when it worked</li>
            <li> I must say I really loved the Prosonic when I received it as a gift from a friend.</li>
            <li> Please make a wise decision and spend your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> As stated, I did get mine on Groupon for $59 which was a fair price.</li>
            <li> My skin had never looked so good before.</li>
            <li> I am done with this company for good.</li>
            <li> My skin is better than ever before!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I bought one for $129.99 (sale),  I LOVE this!</li>
            <li> Worked nicely for the 6 weeks it worked - when the rotating head broke, I returned it to the company and after stalling and delaying for over 6 months, I received a replacement today.  </li>
            <li> To be honest I wasn&#x27;t cleaning my skin after wearing make up, and I sucked at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> On the plus side this does a really nice job cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> I have not yet contacted the company for resolution and to be honest</li>
            <li> Like many others, I thought this was the greatest product ever for the first 4 weeks I had it.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the microdermabrasion cream that came with the pack and use it consistently with great results.  </li>
            <li> The device appears to be working perfectly, and I love the thing to pieces all ready.</li>
            <li> I have had great success with both of these supplements</li>
            <li> Chose something else, for sure.</li>
            <li> Has a facial cleanser that smells so delicious</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to elaborate on them</li>
            <li> My skin never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li> It did everything it said it would, and more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing that I liked about the Prosonic is how light it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy her one.  :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After almost three months of daily use by two people, the Prosonic has worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li> cleanser has a great smell and works very well.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I want to make sure that I gradually get my skin used to this brush so that I don&#x27;t cause any dryness or redness.</li>
            <li> I paid a lot of money for a face brush and should be able to get a lot more than just 4 months out of it.</li>
            <li> Now I just hope Prosonic is able to replace this defective unit for me without a hassle.</li>
            <li> That said I find it way overpriced and see no reason for anyone to have to pay more than $50-$75 for a product like this.</li>
            <li> You should be able to wash your face without worrying about getting products into  your eyes.</li>
            <li> Stick with a reputable company like Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Also, it does not hold a charge for more than a day</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite things for myself  (besides my Sonicare toothbrush).</li>
            <li> and  lotion goes on better too.</li>
            <li> With the body brush it spins (when it isn&#x27;t touching my face), but with the face brush it does nothing....</li>
            <li> The device is still working perfectly and I am amazed at how long the battery lasts.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first got it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product through Groupon and loved it for the first couple of months.  </li>
            <li> Wow!, great stuff.</li>
            <li> I loved the brush since it really seemed to help my skin ...</li>
            <li> but I am very lucky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> Still gives my skin that healthy, clean, freakishly smooth glow.</li>
            <li> My skin was cleaner and smoother and I was noticing diminishing fine lines.</li>
            <li> I charged it for the full 24 hours; however, as soon as it touched my skin ever so lightly, the spinning action was greatly reduced or stopped all together.</li>
            <li> + this little beauty works the best.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t much care forthe microdermabrasion cleanser, but it works fine and was a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen this around but the price was a huge deterrent for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased thru Groupon and thought I had finally found something to make my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> It was a great value for $59, especially considering the price of the comparable Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> When using the gritty exfoliating cleanser I had to keep my eyes shut because the stuff will fly into your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this flaw is why they are selling them off for cheap on Groupon.</li>
            <li> I put it out on the stone patio because I feared it would catch fire since the power light would not go off.</li>
            <li> Within 3 months of light use, it would no longer charge.  </li>
            <li> purchased it from Groupon, it made my skin smooth, but it stopped working after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It may sound paranoid, yet I have read</li>
            <li> If they address this problem and make the price more reasonable I feel it would be a better item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what effect it will have (if any) on fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I bought it through groupon as well $59 bucks great device to realy clean the pores but the one time i left it without charging for about two weeks it does not start.</li>
            <li> My skin felt great, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have paid full price even IF the thing had continued to work.</li>
            <li> *Original review May 8th 2012</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product.</li>
            <li> It worked really good leaves your face smooth and younger looking ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true the original wand was an issue, BUT it was quickly replaced and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first 4 months that it actually worked.</li>
            <li> sometimes you get what you pay for, in this case that phrase stands true.</li>
            <li> , I recommend twisting the brush in the plastic cover after putting it on to make sure the bristles are straight.</li>
            <li> but I wish I would&#x27;ve bought it off amazon because it took a full month to get it</li>
            <li> I immediately called the company and requested full refund.</li>
            <li> In full disclosure, I must admit that I did not purchase the ProSonic brush through Amazon; instead, I ordered it from Groupon.  </li>
            <li> much more reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I found my favorite way of using it is with my favorite facial cleanser... organic milk.</li>
            <li> and I was the maid of honor in a wedding two weeks after I bought it and the difference in pictures is tremendous.  </li>
            <li> The brush PERMANENTLY STOPPED SPINNING THE VERY FIRST DAY of use.</li>
            <li> Like the positive review for this product, it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love my Prosonic brush so far!</li>
            <li> (good this I kept the old charger as the new one did not have a charging station)</li>
            <li> This product is worth it and will save you in exfoliating washes, zit creams, masks, etc</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that has given me problems with acne even through adulthood, and using the brush for sensitive skin cleared up most of that acne within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to read the many reviews about how the Prosonic stopped working or didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s more like two speeds not three), and the entire unit just felt rather cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Worth it</li>
            <li> , definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even worth one star.  </li>
            <li> The product initially worked well, although it wasn&#x27;t as nice as the 100 dollar clarisonic</li>
            <li> I think there are two options here - either you go with the low end option Olay Pro-X (which has great reviews and at the lower price point) or you go with the high end option of the Clarisonic (and really get your money&#x27;s worth).</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I purchased this, and although I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far, I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing my skin continue to improve!</li>
            <li> And this is right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I have lost hearing in my right ear now for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> (I guess I was right about that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not the type of girl to tell people to go drop this much money on something to clean your face.</li>
            <li> I am probably going to buy the full size and a microdermabrasion cream which I didn&#x27;t care much for.</li>
            <li> the red light no longer cheerily blinks red indicating it is charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend spending a little more to get something from a reputable company.</li>
            <li> I followed charging instructions and was very gentle.</li>
            <li> I enjoy how clean my face feels and have used the different brushes as indicated.  </li>
            <li> I received my first prosonic as a Christmas gift, which then broke in January.</li>
            <li> so I could use it first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Everything was in pristine condition, and it turned on before its first charge.</li>
            <li> It arrived at my house on December 27, 2012 - more than one month later.</li>
            <li> First I got the Prosonic and then after a couple months it just stopped charging.</li>
            <li> I would love the product if it actually worked.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after the FIRST time I used it.</li>
            <li> and I ended up on my hands and knees, not being able to hear for several seconds.  </li>
            <li> I am making an appointment with an ear doctor first thing tomorrow morning.  </li>
            <li> I used it after letting it charge overnight, and right away I noticed how much cleaner and smoother</li>
            <li> While the brush worked wonders while it WORKED, I would strongly advise against paying full price for this when clearly the company is majorly lacking  in the customer service department.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money and more importantly don&#x27;t risk your health and well being.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good money perfectly wasted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they replaced it without much suffering on my end, however it seems that the incident rate is pretty high, and the wait times are pretty long.</li>
            <li> I look forward to washing my face now because it&#x27;s so easy to hold it in one hand and get my entire face.  </li>
            <li> It took nearly TWO MONTHS TO GET THE REPLACEMENT WHICH ALSO DIED WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF USE!</li>
            <li> I am very lucky that I escaped with no major injury.</li>
            <li> I felt like my skin was cleaner and prettier but the pictures absolutely prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used either of the cleaning products because my skin is really sensitive and it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> Am very satisified.</li>
            <li> (Which I thought was the whole point.)</li>
            <li> Be gentle with it, it&#x27;s no lawn,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> (because the red light stopped blinking after it was plugged in for awhile).</li>
            <li> It really deserve no stars.</li>
            <li> I was looking for my skin to look even better as great skin unfortunately doesn&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this advertised for as much as $204 and that&#x27;s just highway robbery.  </li>
            <li> so much for the quality of this product and so much for buying on groupon.  </li>
            <li> It was also really improving the acne on my son&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> My toner soaks in much easier and faster</li>
            <li> I really should have read the reviews for this product before purchasing it from Groupon.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t even rate it one star.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, like many other users of the product, mine stopped working after about a month</li>
            <li> , like many other reviewers, purchased this brush on Groupon for $59.</li>
            <li> I would have been better off with one of the other 2 options for face brushes.  </li>
            <li> this is many other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my skin feels SO ridiculously clean</li>
            <li> I swear by Purity by Philosophy, but I like this cleanser so much that I will buy the full sized bottle and alternate between the two.</li>
            <li> to my dismay I just tried to change the brush head for the first time and the entire component came right off and broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TWO full MONTHS of waiting for a replacement, I finally received it and guess what-</li>
            <li> It has a full year warranty, but doesn&#x27;t even last 90 days!</li>
            <li> If I had had the brush near my eye, I very well could have damaged my sight!  </li>
            <li> I went to switch the brush head from the normal to the sensitive and the brush broke and the heads no longer attach!!!</li>
            <li> The one thing I wasn&#x27;t happy with about this product is the fact the brush for normal skin (black ring in the center) had bent bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so excited to break open the new device and promptly went home and put it on the charger</li>
            <li> I received an email back from them saying that they were in the process of upgrading the ProSonic 1 and the new product would be available by June and at that point they would mail me a new one.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company by email and telephone within an hour, after talking to doctors, icing my neck and hand (my neck has a huge red ring around it and the skin is all crepey and sensitive this morning).  </li>
            <li> Super bummed things didn&#x27;t work out, but take my advice and RUN in a different direction.</li>
            <li> There was a loud, explosive sound, like a firecracker, next to my ear.  </li>
            <li> After a couple months of use, I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone based on these things alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them as a part of your skin care routine.</li>
            <li> This is especially important for me because my mom has rheumatoid arthritis, so she can&#x27;t lift very heavy objects or hold things for very long.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little gadget.</li>
            <li> The other brushes were fine.</li>
            <li> Mine has worked fine using every other day and charging it once a week</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want a new one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in contact with the company, and they promised to mail me a new one (the Prosonic 2).</li>
            <li> Then the new replacement unit quit after just 3-4 months.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any new acne or breakouts since I started using the Prosonic, and the breakouts that were already there are fading.</li>
            <li> I refuse to ask for a replacement at this point its more aggravation and a complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I bought the prosonic face brush on sale, thinking it was a cheaper alternative than the expensive name brand, but better quality than the cheap department store brands.</li>
            <li> but wow what a change!</li>
            <li> Within 5 weeks, the unit will only work on the first speed.</li>
            <li> Finally received my replacement and guess what, they gave me an Exact \\&quot;replacement\\&quot;</li>
            <li> First unit broke, got a second unit and it broke.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The second one doesn&#x27;t vibrate as much as the first one did (so presumably it wasn&#x27;t working as well?) and does not operate at all on the 3rd and 4th speeds.  </li>
            <li> think the Clarisonic product is more expensive but in the long run, you&#x27;ll probably be better off.</li>
            <li> Hopefully any new product will address this as it can be a safety concern and someone could potentially have damage to an eye during use and that&#x27;s a real issue.</li>
            <li> My oily skin is also more manageable, and I find myself needing less facial moisturizer during</li>
            <li> The brushes come with little plastic covers which are fantastic for storing them, they have holes</li>
            <li> It worked fabulous for three weeks, then some little piece broke off and the brush no longer spins.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, about a week before I started using the Prosonic, I also started using two supplements in hope that they would help clear my acne:</li>
            <li> (Note: not purchased through Amazon - but directly from the company Make(me)Heal.)</li>
            <li> but they have completely stopped now.</li>
            <li> Even after the explosion and the power and cycle speed button completely imploded, it kept on spinning.</li>
            <li> I really think that there are enough complaints of this nature for Prosonic to have an official recall of the affected batches!</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother, my pores are smaller, and the blackhead issue I&#x27;ve always had on my nose is gone.</li>
            <li> This is a complete rip off.</li>
            <li> There was a extremely loud pop and sparks/debris shot out of the power button.  </li>
            <li> Loud as a shotgun, it shot sparks and metal pieces at my head.</li>
            <li> The company can expect a class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B007RQSRKU Prosonic Face &amp; Body Professional Cleansing/Exfoliation</li>
            <li> yesterday morning, I was about ten seconds in, and thank God doing my neck, when the whole thing exploded in my hand, sending shocks up my arm.  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer described, when it did spin, it felt and sounded like a rickety old wheel.</li>
            <li> I always dried my hands before touching it and only washed the brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Right now I am only using it 3 times a week, will go to daily in another 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> and my head is still hurting and my hearing still isn&#x27;t back to normal!</li>
            <li> At the same time, I only paid $59 for the product through Groupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the month that it took to get to me, I was so excited once I finally received this product.</li>
            <li> Last week, after only having it maybe 4 weeks, the whole thing literally exploded while I was using it!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am more disappointed than pleased however.  </li>
            <li> Luckily my hearing did come back, about 5 minutes later, but my ears are still ringing, my left eye hurts</li>
            <li> The first thing I did is to check instructions to make sure that I didn&#x27;t do something wrong.</li>
            <li> My cat normally likes to sit on the countertop next to me as I&#x27;m washing up</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I could have been using clarisonic without losing money or time, which is partially my fault for not choosing the superior brand from the get go, but this company claims to match its effectiveness; I now know this is a clear case of false advertising and misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> The email I got back stated that they took out the spinning feature of the ProSonic 1 and the ProSonic 2 only \\&quot;oscillates\\&quot; since a \\&quot;large number of customers preferred oscillating to spinning.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I contacted ProSonic and, after several follow-up emails, they sent me a new one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got in on a Groupon and am only out $50, but it still sucks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dead red light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same experience as the many negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> It is unfortunate for those who have had a negative experience, for the record, mine has been great!</li>
            <li> am definitely not pleased with this \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; since I purchased the product originally for the spinning effect.  </li>
            <li> I find this a MAJOR flaw with this product.</li>
            <li> Let me first state I did not by this product through Amazon but rather through Groupon like a lot of the other reviewers and had I read all of the reviews here, I would have never wasted my money nor put my teenager at such risk.</li>
            <li> The brush is gentle enough that I can use it daily, and I alternate the cleanser and microdermabrasion cream to prevent over-exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li> The unit can cleanse both body and face with different brushes and vibration settings, yet it&#x27;s not heavy or cumbersome like the comparably functioning Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the sensitive skin brush and the lowest speed setting.</li>
            <li> the explosion was so loud I still cannot hear correctly in my left ear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my brush for about 2-3 months and it has completely stopped working for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> It comes with a sensitive skin brush, the pure white, and also a body buffing brush, the black outer ring one.</li>
            <li> Last night, it exploded near my left eye and ear as I was cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product with a living social promotion.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush head is by far the body buffer brush, I had breakouts every now and then on random areas on my body.</li>
            <li> It may be the first day or the 2nd month, but it is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH BUYING!</li>
            <li> Clarsonic should thank them for improving their customer base, my 3 year old Clarsonic is used daily and is amazing!</li>
            <li> Starting tomorrow I will use the normal skin brush (white with black ring).</li>
            <li> Hopefully, Groupon will do the right thing and at least give me my money back.  </li>
            <li> Just really combination skin, a lot of dry patches, oily around my nose, lot of black heads</li>
            <li> Less than 6 months after I bought it, and I have to go buy a new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a complete scam and waste of money and an incredibly huge waste of time!!!</li>
            <li> A day later, my ear was STILL in pain with some minor on-and-off ringing.  </li>
            <li> this one didn&#x27;t last very long either it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge ...</li>
            <li> Due to apparent service problems they downgraded the product by redesigning it and it didn&#x27;t oscillate anymore, just vibrated.  </li>
            <li> There is something loose in the back that I can hear rolling around.  </li>
            <li> Return Policy\\&quot; offered by Groupon, but after reading other comments that this thing exploded on people, I think I&#x27;ll just toss it or use it as the most expensive non-spinning exfoliating brush ever.</li>
            <li> The company knows their product stinks, and is off-loading as many as they can.</li>
            <li> I am sadden to see that sooo many people are unhappy with their Pro Sonic purchase and</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems, and only have to charge it about once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, for the price this costs, it was truly a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Why am I not surprised?</li>
            <li> I should have spent the extra money on a Clairsonic....</li>
            <li> I let it charge for a little less than 24 hours, but I could tell that it was fully charged much before that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, after a few days I developed dry, irritated patches on my face that no amount of moisturizer could fix.</li>
            <li> This is a rip-off, pure and simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the same boat with other reviewers who reported that it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> but like all the other reviews, my Prosonic suddenly stopped turning on about 6 months after I bought it.</li>
            <li> I am now moisturizing with a VERY SMALL amount of coconut oil, which I also really recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the body buffer brush bristles are starting to poke out a little further from the rest of the brush, but they don&#x27;t come out and the brush still works just as when I got it.</li>
            <li> These are minor drawbacks and really not a big deal, but it did loose a star due to it.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen a single bump or zit in over a week, which is an all time life record.</li>
            <li> And even worse, you have to really watch your eyes!</li>
            <li> I only used the product 1-2 times a week, and within a matter of months (less than 50 uses), it just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I did however read the reviews on makemeheal.com which gave it a much different review of 4.47 out of 5 stars ( not a true rating in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I stopped using the Prosonic for a few days, only used it once a day, and the dry patches are no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> This is the second day I have used this little guy</li>
            <li> Sound crazy?</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off exfoliating with the actual cash you&#x27;d spend on the stupid thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other electronic cleaners with attachments just like this and don&#x27;t recall any of them making such a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t seen this complaint before.</li>
            <li> The light on the base still lights up like it is charging, but it will only groan for a split second now.  </li>
            <li> I have had absolutely NO PROBLEMS at all.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> After about a week of using it in the morning and night, I noticed my dark spots fading away and no new acne was coming in.</li>
            <li> I was used to exfoliating my skin every other week and doing a mask roughly every week.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of others I was very careful not to get the product wet when I used it since I read</li>
            <li> I am not happy that living social would promote such junk.</li>
            <li> and they said oh sorry it&#x27;s been a year since your first purchase...</li>
            <li> But I use it now every time I shower, specifically in the shower(every other day) because it doesn&#x27;t matter if soap or water gets splattered everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to even try to contact them, after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first</li>
            <li> As some of the other reviewers said i bought the prosonic on groupon in April for $59.  </li>
            <li> This is the only reason I am removing a star from its rating - this shipping time was unbelievable and unprofessional.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure which company to reach out to yet, but I am definitely thinking about contacting a lawyer!!</li>
            <li> I use it every other day</li>
            <li> My advice is spend the money and actually use it everyday!  </li>
            <li> the other reviews that said for a $204 item</li>
            <li> Thankfully I had it angled slightly away from my face at the time</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt the authenticity of any 4-5 star reviews; if legitimate, they must have only used it a few times, as I am convinced THIS PRODUCT WILL CEASE TO OPERATE EVENTUALLY NO MATTER</li>
            <li> I have given up on this sorry excuse of a company-but not without a letter to their local BBB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I screamed and looked down, only to see the brush completely broken apart.  </li>
            <li> On the down side this thing makes a mess!</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I took the brush off, and the little wheel inside wasn&#x27;t spinning either (even though the motor was still running).</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> While it can be a little messy when using...</li>
            <li> I will do an update after using it for a few weeks just to verify everything is working well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have  attempted to trouble shoot</li>
            <li> Its completely dead-</li>
            <li> and now it doesn&#x27;t spin when used on skin--like motor is worn out or battery is dead.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> it stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> and it was dead.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money...</li>
            <li> It was not worth even half that!!</li>
            <li> Based on these other reviews this seems to be a common problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this product via Groupon (worst $60 I have spent in my life), two weeks after purchase it stopped charging, emailed and contacted Make Me Heal (the manufacturer), filled out their ridiculous replacement form in three separate occasions within the past 6 months and still haven&#x27;t heard back from them.</li>
            <li> It is clearly cheaply made and has serious dangerous defects!  </li>
            <li> It is just a spinning brush and not sure what is sonic about this.</li>
            <li> sorry I did not read reviews prior to purchasing.  </li>
            <li> tried troubleshooting, but no light no nothing!  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t fix it myself,and I&#x27;m not sure I want to try customer service after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I was afraid to open my eyes.</li>
            <li> not only was this frightening, but my ear has been in pain and ringing ever since!</li>
            <li> I started on my forehead, as usual, and then it just exploded!</li>
            <li> I wrote the company and they sent me a new replacement wand (not the base).  </li>
            <li> But seriously, buy this thing now.</li>
            <li> or I could have been seriously burned.  </li>
            <li> brush itself is quite weak.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, ENORMOUS HASSLE &amp; WASTE OF TIME, &amp; WEAK FUNCTIONALITY</li>
            <li> Stay away from this inferior product and the company who will not stand behind their warranty.  </li>
            <li> So frustrating that this company doesn&#x27;t even stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> The end result could have been even worse</li>
            <li> it spins it sounds like a broken wheel.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts only a couple of days and then needs recharging....very annoying.</li>
            <li> a sad few I&#x27;m afraid.  </li>
            <li> Customer service is very hard to get a hold of and shouldn&#x27;t be this difficult.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I turned it on the next morning...</li>
            <li> Another thing I thought was weird was in the instruction booklet it says it comes with a storage pouch</li>
            <li> I used it for about 4 months before it randomly stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced anything like it before and am too afraid to try another one.</li>
            <li> Expensive junk.</li>
            <li> The Prosonic is expensive junk.</li>
            <li> Just a sad piece of non-working plastic on my bathroom counter, taunting me with</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wont charge at all, now its just a useless piece of plastic collecting dust in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> A DISGUSTING COMPANY WITH HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE ETHICS in customer relations) has had my money for 3 months while I&#x27;ve only had the opportunity to use this brush</li>
            <li> Wrong, wrong, wrong!</li>
            <li> This is a dangerous product.  </li>
            <li> Mad at myself for trusting this place and wasting money..</li>
            <li> I just spoke to my lawyer and am trying to figure out who can look at the pieces before I return it to see if they can determine what went wrong!  </li>
            <li> This is VERY expensive at a &amp;#34;groupon discount rate&amp;#34; of over a dollar per use.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I am so frustrated.  </li>
            <li> Groupon will not accept the return. :(</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed anything on the internet before, but I am so appalled by this company&#x27;s product that I am seeking out any avenue to share my experience so others can be spared.</li>
            <li> Why do I hate this product?</li>
            <li> This product is crap.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> The ringing in my ear and the headache it caused were horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It worked really good leaves your face smooth and younger looking ....after 2 months it broke ..I sent them a email they sent me another one ... this one didn&#x27;t last very long either it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge ...I emailed them again and they said oh sorry it&#x27;s been a year since your first purchase...the warranty doesn&#x27;t cover... within a year they both broke... my son&#x27;s girlfriend  also  has a prosonic and hers broke too ...it&#x27;s just garbage don&#x27;t buy it ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the same boat with other reviewers who reported that it stopped working.  I&#x27;ll eventually get around to contacting the company but I don&#x27;t want a new one.  This product is defective.</li>
            <li> This was the only item I requested for Christmas.  After forwarding the Groupon to my husband and asking him to get me the Prosonic for Christmas, he followed through and I found it under the tree on Christmas morning.  It worked fantastically until April and then just refused to turn on.  Save your money for the Clarsonic...sometimes you get what you pay for, in this case that phrase stands true.</li>
            <li> System worked for a number of months and now is deader than a doornail.  Purchased thru Groupon and thought I had finally found something to make my skin look and feel great. Waiting to hear from company re replacement, though when I read reviews, I may look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I loved the brush since it really seemed to help my skin ... but like all the other reviews, my Prosonic suddenly stopped turning on about 6 months after I bought it. I&#x27;ve been in contact with the company, and they promised to mail me a new one (the Prosonic 2). That was 2 months ago, and I&#x27;ve yet to see it. Just wish their customer service was faster.</li>
            <li> (Note: not purchased through Amazon - but directly from the company Make(me)Heal.) Worked nicely for the 6 weeks it worked - when the rotating head broke, I returned it to the company and after stalling and delaying for over 6 months, I received a replacement today.  No longer has a rotating head, came with no charger, and of the 4 power settings, only 3 work.  And this is right out of the box.  I don&#x27;t expect any satisfaction from this company, and as I was part of an initial email chain of about 100 people (way to honor privacy Make Me Heal), I can attest to the fact that no one has received any satisfaction.  Chose something else, for sure.</li>
            <li> *Original review May 8th 2012* I am not the type of girl to tell people to go drop this much money on something to clean your face. But seriously, buy this thing now. My pores are smaller, my skin feels SO ridiculously clean I am staring at the mirror every five seconds in disbelief. You can&#x27;t even see my pores on my nose, it looks like I just got airbrushed. This is the second day I have used this little guy but wow what a change! I didn&#x27;t have perfect skin before this but it wasn&#x27;t terrible. Just really combination skin, a lot of dry patches, oily around my nose, lot of black heads ETC. After two days of use my skin is like butter, make up goes on freakishly well. I was used to exfoliating my skin every other week and doing a mask roughly every week. To be honest I wasn&#x27;t cleaning my skin after wearing make up, and I sucked at moisturizing. I am now moisturizing with a VERY SMALL amount of coconut oil, which I also really recommend. The one thing I wasn&#x27;t happy with about this product is the fact the brush for normal skin (black ring in the center) had bent bristles. The brushes come with little plastic covers which are fantastic for storing them, they have holes so they drain well, I recommend twisting the brush in the plastic cover after putting it on to make sure the bristles are straight. The other brushes were fine. It comes with a sensitive skin brush, the pure white, and also a body buffing brush, the black outer ring one. Has a facial cleanser that smells so delicious I am probably going to buy the full size and a microdermabrasion cream which I didn&#x27;t care much for. I got mine from Make me Heal from a groupon promotion but I wish I would&#x27;ve bought it off amazon because it took a full month to get it and then I had the brush issue. Another thing I thought was weird was in the instruction booklet it says it comes with a storage pouch but it wasn&#x27;t included in mine, nor was it advertised on the groupon so I wasn&#x27;t too upset. These are minor drawbacks and really not a big deal, but it did loose a star due to it. The device appears to be working perfectly, and I love the thing to pieces all ready. I will do an update after using it for a few weeks just to verify everything is working well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE July 12th, 2012* So I said I would do an update and this is it. The device is still working perfectly and I am amazed at how long the battery lasts. I don&#x27;t use it everyday anymore because I noticed I was getting red splotchy skin (too much exfoliation). But I use it now every time I shower, specifically in the shower(every other day) because it doesn&#x27;t matter if soap or water gets splattered everywhere and it&#x27;s waterproof... Still gives my skin that healthy, clean, freakishly smooth glow. I found my favorite way of using it is with my favorite facial cleanser... organic milk. Sound crazy? Try it on those blackheads on your nose. Even the 2% stuff in your fridge works with a cotton ball but organic + this little beauty works the best. Just dip the bristles and rinse everything off after washing your face.  My favorite brush head is by far the body buffer brush, I had breakouts every now and then on random areas on my body. I don&#x27;t want to elaborate on them but they have completely stopped now. I&#x27;ve noticed that the body buffer brush bristles are starting to poke out a little further from the rest of the brush, but they don&#x27;t come out and the brush still works just as when I got it. After a couple months of use, I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money. I received my first prosonic as a Christmas gift, which then broke in January. I received a replacement in May which proceeded to break in July. I was promised the updated product (the ProSonic 2) by August and I just received it at the end of October after relentless pestering. The catch? I went to switch the brush head from the normal to the sensitive and the brush broke and the heads no longer attach!!! I got to use this product for maybe 3 months max since receiving it last Christmas. I refuse to ask for a replacement at this point its more aggravation and a complete waste of time and money. Customer service is a joke. DO NOT BUY!!!! I have never reviewed anything on the internet before, but I am so appalled by this company&#x27;s product that I am seeking out any avenue to share my experience so others can be spared.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first got it. My skin never felt or looked better. Why do I hate this product? Within 5 weeks, the unit will only work on the first speed. I have tried for 5 weeks to get the company to send me a replacement. They have told me each time they would send one out in a couple of weeks. They are still telling me this. Haven&#x27;t seen a replacement yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost two months now and I cannot imagine going without it. My wedding was the week before I bought and I was the maid of honor in a wedding two weeks after I bought it and the difference in pictures is tremendous.  I felt like my skin was cleaner and prettier but the pictures absolutely prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used either of the cleaning products because my skin is really sensitive and it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk. My skin got both tiny bumps and white heads and I haven&#x27;t seen a single bump or zit in over a week, which is an all time life record. This product is worth it and will save you in exfoliating washes, zit creams, masks, etc so it will eventually pay for itself.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I got it but now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Less than 6 months after I bought it, and I have to go buy a new one. I&#x27;m not going to even try to contact them, after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I also bought this product via Groupon. Last night, it exploded near my left eye and ear as I was cleaning my face. The ringing in my ear and the headache it caused were horrible. It has been over 12 hours and my head is still hurting and my hearing still isn&#x27;t back to normal! Even after the explosion and the power and cycle speed button completely imploded, it kept on spinning. I really think that there are enough complaints of this nature for Prosonic to have an official recall of the affected batches!</li>
            <li> I bought this product through Groupon and loved it for the first couple of months.  I only used the product 1-2 times a week, and within a matter of months (less than 50 uses), it just stopped working.  The light on the base still lights up like it is charging, but it will only groan for a split second now.  This is VERY expensive at a &amp;#34;groupon discount rate&amp;#34; of over a dollar per use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little gadget. Every time I use it I get that same tingly feeling that I would get after a facial. Makeup definitely goes on much smoother after just a few weeks of using it. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with acne, so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I&#x27;m excited to see what effect it will have (if any) on fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have got to say I am really impressed with this item.  I was a bit skeptical at first but I am sold.  Holds a charge very well.  I have only charged it once in three weeks.  Right now I am only using it 3 times a week, will go to daily in another 3 weeks.  Am very satisified.</li>
            <li> This just happened to me!!! Terrifying! I have lost hearing in my right ear now for 24 hours. What if that was closer to my eye?!?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;Is anybody filing a law suit against these people???</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Groupon in December 2012. I used it for about 4 months before it randomly stopped working. Since it had a 1-year product warranty, I contacted the company for a replacement device. I received an email back from them saying that they were in the process of upgrading the ProSonic 1 and the new product would be available by June and at that point they would mail me a new one. I received my replacement product TWO days ago (October 5, 2013 to be exact).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to break open the new device and promptly went home and put it on the charger (good this I kept the old charger as the new one did not have a charging station) so I could use it first thing in the morning. I was very disappointed when I turned it on the next morning... the device only vibrated, it no longer spun. (Which I thought was the whole point.) I thought my replacement device was defective so I promptly emailed the company to voice my concern. The email I got back stated that they took out the spinning feature of the ProSonic 1 and the ProSonic 2 only \\&quot;oscillates\\&quot; since a \\&quot;large number of customers preferred oscillating to spinning.\\&quot; I would not even call what the head is doing \\&quot;oscillating\\&quot;. It is a vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely not pleased with this \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; since I purchased the product originally for the spinning effect.  I&#x27;m also terrified to used it now after reading reviews of the device exploding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will be asking for a clarisonic for Christmas...</li>
            <li> My Prosonic quit charging after 6 months.  I wrote the company and they sent me a new replacement wand (not the base).  Due to apparent service problems they downgraded the product by redesigning it and it didn&#x27;t oscillate anymore, just vibrated.  Then the new replacement unit quit after just 3-4 months.  Now the company says they won&#x27;t replace it again, but I can purchase another at a reduced price.  Are they kidding?  I would never give them my money again.  Stay away from this inferior product and the company who will not stand behind their warranty.  Save your money and buy another brand with a good reputation.</li>
            <li> Like the positive review for this product, it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic. I have combination skin that has given me problems with acne even through adulthood, and using the brush for sensitive skin cleared up most of that acne within 2 weeks. The brush is gentle enough that I can use it daily, and I alternate the cleanser and microdermabrasion cream to prevent over-exfoliating my skin. I would highly recommend this product to anyone based on these things alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, like many other users of the product, mine stopped working after about a month (I purchased it from Groupon). However, I contacted the company at MakeMeHeal.com and they sent out a replacement...5 weeks later. The replacement is holding up well for now (I&#x27;ve had it for about a week), but we&#x27;ll see if it endures. I&#x27;m glad they replaced it without much suffering on my end, however it seems that the incident rate is pretty high, and the wait times are pretty long. Just a heads up.</li>
            <li> Even tho I bought this with a Groupon for $60.. It was not worth even half that!! It is just a spinning brush and not sure what is sonic about this. It even sounds cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Not enough quality power.. Mad at myself for trusting this place and wasting money..</li>
            <li> I was surprised to read the many reviews about how the Prosonic stopped working or didn&#x27;t work.  I have had mine for over 4 months and ordered it through Groupon.  I have had absolutely NO PROBLEMS at all.  I have dropped it a couple times, I take it in the shower and it works perfectly well.  I enjoy how clean my face feels and have used the different brushes as indicated.  I am very pleased with the microdermabrasion cream that came with the pack and use it consistently with great results.  It is unfortunate for those who have had a negative experience, for the record, mine has been great!</li>
            <li> I bought it through groupon as well $59 bucks great device to realy clean the pores but the one time i left it without charging for about two weeks it does not start. I put it to charge and it shows it is charging but after hours and over night chargng it does not turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really bumbed bc i was looking to purchase another one but after reading these reviews i will stick to the clarisonic. More expensive but i know people who have it and have no complains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your self money DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> sorry I did not read reviews prior to purchasing.  Total junk. Stopped working. Total waste of money. I am not happy that living social would promote such junk.</li>
            <li> It did everything it said it would, and more.  Be gentle with it, it&#x27;s no lawn,&lt;br /&gt;and it will treat you as good as it is treating me now.  Wow!, great stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is junk!  I am so frustrated.  As some of the other reviewers said i bought the prosonic on groupon in April for $59.  Finally recieved the 1st \\&quot;new\\&quot; prosonic 5 weeks later and it worked great for 1 week, then died.  Just did not  turn on...tried troubleshooting, but no light no nothing!  Called and emailed prosonic asking for a replacement...a total of 8 times over the next 7 weeks.  Finally received my replacement and guess what, they gave me an Exact \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; alright, this one doesn&#x27;t work either!  I am so done with this company-  I think they knew their product didn&#x27;t work and were just trying to stall so i would give up and move on.  I just feel totally duped... I think i&#x27;ll be contacting groupon to see if they can help me.  whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
            <li> The Prosonic brush system is an excellent product that lives up to its promise. My skin is much smoother, my pores are smaller, and the blackhead issue I&#x27;ve always had on my nose is gone. My oily skin is also more manageable, and I find myself needing less facial moisturizer during application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my Prosonic system off of Groupon on August 16th, and it arrived on September 1st. It was a great value for $59, especially considering the price of the comparable Clarisonic. Everything was in pristine condition, and it turned on before its first charge. I used it after letting it charge overnight, and right away I noticed how much cleaner and smoother my face looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I liked about the Prosonic is how light it is. The unit can cleanse both body and face with different brushes and vibration settings, yet it&#x27;s not heavy or cumbersome like the comparably functioning Clarisonic. This is especially important for me because my mom has rheumatoid arthritis, so she can&#x27;t lift very heavy objects or hold things for very long. I&#x27;m going to buy her one.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after a few days I developed dry, irritated patches on my face that no amount of moisturizer could fix. I stopped using the Prosonic for a few days, only used it once a day, and the dry patches are no longer an issue. My skin is better than ever before! I sometimes use the system twice a day with no adverse result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost three months of daily use by two people, the Prosonic has worked flawlessly. I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems, and only have to charge it about once every two weeks. It&#x27;s excellent! I read that some people on here had issues with defective units, and that&#x27;s a bummer. My unit has been perfectly functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser has a great smell and works very well. I swear by Purity by Philosophy, but I like this cleanser so much that I will buy the full sized bottle and alternate between the two. I didn&#x27;t much care forthe microdermabrasion cleanser, but it works fine and was a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: buy this. You won&#x27;t regret it. The deal is on Groupon again, and I just purchased another one in purple.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this Prosonic brush through Groupon on November 26, 2012. It arrived at my house on December 27, 2012 - more than one month later. This is the only reason I am removing a star from its rating - this shipping time was unbelievable and unprofessional. At the same time, I only paid $59 for the product through Groupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the month that it took to get to me, I was so excited once I finally received this product. I let it charge for a little less than 24 hours, but I could tell that it was fully charged much before that (because the red light stopped blinking after it was plugged in for awhile). I have used it for three mornings in a row. I love my Prosonic brush so far! I have only tried the sensitive skin brush and the lowest speed setting. I want to make sure that I gradually get my skin used to this brush so that I don&#x27;t cause any dryness or redness. Starting tomorrow I will use the normal skin brush (white with black ring). I have definitely noticed an improvement in my skin. It feels and looks softer. I have not had any new acne or breakouts since I started using the Prosonic, and the breakouts that were already there are fading. I am so happy that I purchased this, and although I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far, I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing my skin continue to improve! I recommend this product, though only purchase it through Groupon if you are not in a hurry to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, about a week before I started using the Prosonic, I also started using two supplements in hope that they would help clear my acne: [[ASIN:B00238DI9W Hair, Skin and Nails Collagen Support Vitamins 120 count]] and [[ASIN:B000KI6Z7O Zinc for Acne 100 Tablets]]. I have had great success with both of these supplements and I highly recommend them as a part of your skin care routine.</li>
            <li> It really deserve no stars. This product is crap. First unit broke, got a second unit and it broke. I&#x27;m done. Will never purchase any prosonic products again.</li>
            <li> I had this brush for 4 months before it broke. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It worked great for the first 4 months that it actually worked. Customer service is very hard to get a hold of and shouldn&#x27;t be this difficult. I paid a lot of money for a face brush and should be able to get a lot more than just 4 months out of it. I will never buy ProSonic again.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever! Worked great for like 3 days then died. This is a complete rip off. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I just typed &amp;#34;Prosonic Glow stopped charging&amp;#34; on Google search to see if like me there were others with the same problem. I am taken aback by all the reviews I found here and I feel relieved that I am not the only one that has gotten stuck with this &amp;#34;not-worth-$60&amp;#34; piece of junk! I bought this product via Groupon (worst $60 I have spent in my life), two weeks after purchase it stopped charging, emailed and contacted Make Me Heal (the manufacturer), filled out their ridiculous replacement form in three separate occasions within the past 6 months and still haven&#x27;t heard back from them. So frustrating that this company doesn&#x27;t even stand behind their product. Whatever you do,,, do not buy this product and Ariel please don&#x27;t even bother responding to this review... Thank you for nothing.</li>
            <li> I had a similar experience as another reviewer. The product exploded in my hand, burning my neck, ringing in my ears and shock up my arm. I have never experienced anything like it before and am too afraid to try another one. Since I&#x27;m not the only one this happened to, I would NOT recommend it to anyone. The end result could have been even worse if it would of hit my eye instead of my neck</li>
            <li> It was bought and given as a gift and used about 15-20 times before it just stopped working.  I contacted the company (Prosonic) and their only response was that it was shipped over a year ago and that is all that matters.  They offer no suggestions, no assistance, no options to repair or replace it.  Clarsonic should thank them for improving their customer base, my 3 year old Clarsonic is used daily and is amazing!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of others I was very careful not to get the product wet when I used it since I read the seals were iffy.  I always dried my hands before touching it and only washed the brush heads.  Last week, after only having it maybe 4 weeks, the whole thing literally exploded while I was using it!  There was a extremely loud pop and sparks/debris shot out of the power button.  Thankfully I had it angled slightly away from my face at the time or I could have been seriously burned.  I couldn&#x27;t hear properly for two days afterwards and my ear ached for several days.  It may have done permanent damage.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  It is clearly cheaply made and has serious dangerous defects!  Don&#x27;t risk your hearing!!!</li>
            <li> Expensive junk. It worked fabulous for three weeks, then some little piece broke off and the brush no longer spins. You can hear it rattling around inside the unit. I&#x27;m glad I got in on a Groupon and am only out $50, but it still sucks. My skin felt great, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have paid full price even IF the thing had continued to work. The speeds aren&#x27;t all that different from one another (it&#x27;s more like two speeds not three), and the entire unit just felt rather cheaply made. (I guess I was right about that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy something from another company. I guess I missed up the Clarisonic/Prosonic thing. The lady who did my facial at the spa recommended the former, and I&#x27;m definitely planning on giving them a try. Super bummed things didn&#x27;t work out, but take my advice and RUN in a different direction. The Prosonic is expensive junk. You&#x27;re better off exfoliating with the actual cash you&#x27;d spend on the stupid thing.</li>
            <li> I loved this scrubber when it worked but it broke after 12 months and 2 weeks.  Because the warranty only lasts a year they said there was nothing I could do.  Horrible service!</li>
            <li> I must say I really loved the Prosonic when I received it as a gift from a friend. It had four pulsating settings and did everything it said it would. My skin was cleaner and smoother and I was noticing diminishing fine lines. I also must say that I am the type of person that has worn make up to bed for over 15 years and have always had great skin. I was looking for my skin to look even better as great skin unfortunately doesn&#x27;t last forever. 3 weeks into owning the Prosonic, it died. No warning. Nothing. Just a sad piece of non-working plastic on my bathroom counter, taunting me with it&#x27;s dead red light.  I have  attempted to trouble shoot and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to want to charge and the red light no longer cheerily blinks red indicating it is charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, for the price this costs, it was truly a complete waste of money. I think there are two options here - either you go with the low end option Olay Pro-X (which has great reviews and at the lower price point) or you go with the high end option of the Clarisonic (and really get your money&#x27;s worth). There are no in between choices here. Now I just hope Prosonic is able to replace this defective unit for me without a hassle. :/ Please make a wise decision and spend your money elsewhere. I wish I had read more reviews advising me of what an ill purchase this was.</li>
            <li> I luve quality products for my face.  I have seen this around but the price was a huge deterrent for me. When I saw on Groupon for $59 I decided to give it a try. On the plus side this does a really nice job cleaning your face. I like the various speeds and brushes.  That said I find it way overpriced and see no reason for anyone to have to pay more than $50-$75 for a product like this. I&#x27;ve seen this advertised for as much as $204 and that&#x27;s just highway robbery.  As stated, I did get mine on Groupon for $59 which was a fair price. Unfortunately I am more disappointed than pleased however.  On the down side this thing makes a mess! I&#x27;ve used other electronic cleaners with attachments just like this and don&#x27;t recall any of them making such a mess. This flings the cleanser or exfoliator all over. If you stand in front of a mirror as you do this you will see it flying off all over the  mirror, countertops, sink, etc. My cat normally likes to sit on the countertop next to me as I&#x27;m washing up and she ran off because the stuff was flying around.  And even worse, you have to really watch your eyes! When using the gritty exfoliating cleanser I had to keep my eyes shut because the stuff will fly into your eyes.  I find this a MAJOR flaw with this product. You should be able to wash your face without worrying about getting products into  your eyes. And for the record: this happened on the LOWEST setting.  Maybe this flaw is why they are selling them off for cheap on Groupon. Hopefully any new product will address this as it can be a safety concern and someone could potentially have damage to an eye during use and that&#x27;s a real issue. I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t seen this complaint before. If they address this problem and make the price more reasonable I feel it would be a better item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true the original wand was an issue, BUT it was quickly replaced and&lt;br /&gt;I have had no issues ever since.  Not all the wands are this way though,&lt;br /&gt;just a sad few I&#x27;m afraid.  I think they understand the issue now, but the&lt;br /&gt;system is awesome and my face appreciates it.  Worth it, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing through groupon.  It was delivered during my winter holiday.  By the time I got back home - unpacked  it and was eager to try it.  However - it simply never worked - out of the box - turning it on did make it hum and vibrate - however the head does not spin or move at all.  I emailed groupon asking for a repair/replacement/reimbursement but they said they only offer return or money back until 10days after delivery (I was still skiing then!)&lt;br /&gt;Well so much for the quality of this product and so much for buying on groupon.  That&#x27;s good money perfectly wasted!</li>
            <li> this product exploded while i was using it on my face! not only was this frightening, but my ear has been in pain and ringing ever since! do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> Almost blew my face off last night when this thing EXPLODED in my hand while I was using it to. wash my face. Loud as a shotgun, it shot sparks and metal pieces at my head. My ears are still ringing. If you have one of these (by Prosonic), throw it out immediately. Don&#x27;t risk your health or your money. The company can expect a class action lawsuit. Several others have posted the same review.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over a month and when I went to use it tonight it exploded in my face! It was horrifying! I started on my forehead, as usual, and then it just exploded! It sounded like a gunshot went off. I was so terrified. I started screaming and thought I lost my hearing and I was afraid to open my eyes. Luckily my hearing did come back, about 5 minutes later, but my ears are still ringing, my left eye hurts and I have a terrible headache. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I bought this on gilt so I am not sure which company to reach out to yet, but I am definitely thinking about contacting a lawyer!! What a truly horrible experience!</li>
            <li> First I got the Prosonic and then after a couple months it just stopped charging. After sending a handful of emails within my 1 year warranty I finally received a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; prosonic 2 in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my dismay I just tried to change the brush head for the first time and the entire component came right off and broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> *****Updated review 2/5/13*****&lt;br /&gt;After TWO full MONTHS of waiting for a replacement, I finally received it and guess what- it DOESN&#x27;T WORK! Why am I not surprised? Not only that, it came in a damaged box without any protective packing and without the brush head (promised in the letter sent as a token of apology.) I have given up on this sorry excuse of a company-but not without a letter to their local BBB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like many other reviewers, purchased this brush on Groupon for $59. It stopped working after 6 weeks. Its completely dead- it&#x27;s wont charge at all, now its just a useless piece of plastic collecting dust in my bathroom. I&#x27;ve been trying to contact customer service for days and have yet to hear anything regarding a replacement. While the brush worked wonders while it WORKED, I would strongly advise against paying full price for this when clearly the company is majorly lacking  in the customer service department. Stick with a reputable company like Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> My Prosonic machine does not work.  I keep it fully charged, however, it stopped working about three months ago.  Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Let me first state I did not by this product through Amazon but rather through Groupon like a lot of the other reviewers and had I read all of the reviews here, I would have never wasted my money nor put my teenager at such risk. I did however read the reviews on makemeheal.com which gave it a much different review of 4.47 out of 5 stars ( not a true rating in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these, one for me and one for my teenager. Mine has worked fine using every other day and charging it once a week BUT I will no longer use it after my daughter&#x27;s exploded in her hand in the middle of washing her face last evening. She had pieces of plastic casing and battery coating stuck to her chest with red whelps where the pieces hit her. Not to mention her ears ringing, sending shocks up her arm and scaring her. Today she still has intermittent ringing and a headache but thankfully the ENT says there will be no permanent damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device literally exploded into pieces, the battery coating was split in two. The power and speed buttons were blown out. I put it out on the stone patio because I feared it would catch fire since the power light would not go off. I have not yet contacted the company for resolution and to be honest I want nothing to do with this product anymore. I intend to get rid of mine as well and buy the clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion- don&#x27;t waste your money and more importantly don&#x27;t risk your health and well being.</li>
            <li> Received as a Christmas gift and like another reviewer, used once and now it doesn&#x27;t spin when used on skin--like motor is worn out or battery is dead. Charging does not make any difference. I would love the product if it actually worked.</li>
            <li> I, too, purchased this product on Groupon. I used it a few times and I thought it worked great... until it stopped working for no reason. I was using it in the shower, on my legs, and the brush stopped spinning. I could still hear the motor running, but no brush spin. I took the brush off, and the little wheel inside wasn&#x27;t spinning either (even though the motor was still running). I was going to try to repair it myself, since I&#x27;m well beyond the \\&quot;14 day Return Policy\\&quot; offered by Groupon, but after reading other comments that this thing exploded on people, I think I&#x27;ll just toss it or use it as the most expensive non-spinning exfoliating brush ever. DON&#x27;T BUY, FOLKS! NOT WORTH IT! This is a rip-off, pure and simple. The company knows their product stinks, and is off-loading as many as they can.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I thought this was the greatest product ever for the first 4 weeks I had it.  My skin looked and felt great.  It was also really improving the acne on my son&#x27;s face.  Too bad it stopped working.  The brush no longer spins, even thought the motor is working.  Groupon will not accept the return. :(</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product with a living social promotion. I used it for about a month and was very happy with the results until it exploded in the shower while I was using it on my face. I am very lucky that I escaped with no major injury. I couldn&#x27;t hear for several minutes. The first thing I did is to check instructions to make sure that I didn&#x27;t do something wrong. I followed all of the instructions. I immediately called the company and requested full refund. My hope is that they stop selling it. Awful experience but I am very lucky.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product. My skin had never looked so good before. It thoroughly cleaned and exfoliated my face. However, after 2 months of use, it just stopped working. It has a full year warranty, but doesn&#x27;t even last 90 days! I&#x27;ve tried contacting customer service, but they&#x27;re a joke. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> In full disclosure, I must admit that I did not purchase the ProSonic brush through Amazon; instead, I ordered it from Groupon.  However, after using it for only two weeks, the brush literally EXPLODED while I was using it!  There was a loud, explosive sound, like a firecracker, next to my ear.  I screamed and looked down, only to see the brush completely broken apart.  The power switch as well as the speed switch were melted away.  I had ringing in my ears for hours after this.  A day later, my ear was STILL in pain with some minor on-and-off ringing.  When I called the company, they said they would not provide a refund because I had not ordered it from them; however, the woman with whom I spoke sounded quite mortified that such a thing would happen.  Hopefully, Groupon will do the right thing and at least give me my money back.  The bottom line is this:  I don&#x27;t want anyone to get hurt!  If I had had the brush near my eye, I very well could have damaged my sight!  PLEASE, consider another product before you buy this one.  It&#x27;s not even worth one star.  I should have just stuck with the brush I&#x27;d been using from Olay.</li>
            <li> Wow! I am sadden to see that sooo many people are unhappy with their Pro Sonic purchase and it stopped working after a few months. I looovveeee my Pro Sonic Brush. I have had it for almost 9 months. I use it every other day and I have NOT had 1 problem with it. Your face is the 1st thing ppl see! It deserves the BEST. While it can be a little messy when using...nothing in life is perfect. So you learn to deal with the lil messy-ness. Very happy Pro Sonic User!</li>
            <li> The product initially worked well, although it wasn&#x27;t as nice as the 100 dollar clarisonic my mom has in either looks, build quality or function. After a month I went to use it and it was dead. Silent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend spending a little more to get something from a reputable company. The people that make this brush are borderline scam artists.</li>
            <li> I bought the prosonic face brush on sale, thinking it was a cheaper alternative than the expensive name brand, but better quality than the cheap department store brands. Wrong, wrong, wrong! I&#x27;ve had my brush for about 2-3 months and it has completely stopped working for no apparent reason. Based on these other reviews this seems to be a common problem. I would have been better off with one of the other 2 options for face brushes.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same experience as the many negative reviews.  I bought my unit with a Groupon.  Within 3 months of light use, it would no longer charge.  I contacted ProSonic and, after several follow-up emails, they sent me a new one.  The second one doesn&#x27;t vibrate as much as the first one did (so presumably it wasn&#x27;t working as well?) and does not operate at all on the 3rd and 4th speeds.  Also, it does not hold a charge for more than a day so I have to put it on the charger after every use.&lt;br /&gt;I think the Clarisonic product is more expensive but in the long run, you&#x27;ll probably be better off.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite things for myself  (besides my Sonicare toothbrush). After reading the reviews I bought one for $129.99 (sale),  I LOVE this! I noticed results after the FIRST time I used it. My toner soaks in much easier and faster and  lotion goes on better too. After about a week of using it in the morning and night, I noticed my dark spots fading away and no new acne was coming in. I look forward to washing my face now because it&#x27;s so easy to hold it in one hand and get my entire face.  I use Cetaphil cleanser and I have also used a exfoliator scrub with the brush and the results were immediate. My advice is spend the money and actually use it everyday!  It&#x27;s waterproof too!</li>
            <li> I really should have read the reviews for this product before purchasing it from Groupon.  I just got it in, used it a total of ONE time, and the brush won&#x27;t turn.  There is something loose in the back that I can hear rolling around.  I can&#x27;t fix it myself,and I&#x27;m not sure I want to try customer service after reading some of the reviews.  I should have dropped the money on Clarisonic.  Now I&#x27;m out $60 and I still don&#x27;t have a working \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; facial cleanser.  I should have learned this lesson by now.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B007RQSRKU Prosonic Face &amp; Body Professional Cleansing/Exfoliation Anti-Aging Brush Set]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it from Groupon, it made my skin smooth, but it stopped working after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I used the product I bought from Groupon after following the directions and leaving it plugged in over night to charge the battery.  yesterday morning, I was about ten seconds in, and thank God doing my neck, when the whole thing exploded in my hand, sending shocks up my arm.  it flew apart in numerous pieces and I ended up on my hands and knees, not being able to hear for several seconds.  I contacted the company by email and telephone within an hour, after talking to doctors, icing my neck and hand (my neck has a huge red ring around it and the skin is all crepey and sensitive this morning).  Also, still ringing in my ears.  It&#x27;s after noon and no one has called back yet!  This was a disaster!  If I had been doing my cheekbones or forehead, I would have burned my retina or put my eye out!  Ditto the other reviews that said for a $204 item, this does not feel like a quality product.  I just spoke to my lawyer and am trying to figure out who can look at the pieces before I return it to see if they can determine what went wrong!  Please don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this from Makemeheal.com and received it just 5 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work at all. It stops spinning as soon as it touches my face even the lightest touch.&lt;br /&gt;When it spins it sounds like a broken wheel. It is a waste of money...I cannot stress it enough. With the body brush it spins (when it isn&#x27;t touching my face), but with the face brush it does nothing....no spin, no noise....nothing!!&lt;br /&gt;Make me heal doesn&#x27;t accept returns for this product once it is opened, so I am out 74 dollars plus 17 for shipping. I should have spent the extra money on a Clairsonic....which I just did now on here; I hope that doesn&#x27;t let me down.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, from the pit of my soul this prosonic really was the biggest waste of money and the makers of this product should be downright ashamed that they sell it.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, ENORMOUS HASSLE &amp; WASTE OF TIME, &amp; WEAK FUNCTIONALITY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a complete scam and waste of money and an incredibly huge waste of time!!! I ordered this brush from a groupon deal and waited an inordinate amount of time to receive it (about a month). The brush PERMANENTLY STOPPED SPINNING THE VERY FIRST DAY of use. I followed charging instructions and was very gentle. I contacted the company and was told I would have to pay for return shipping in order to get a refund. I don&#x27;t understand this since they are the ones who sent me a faulty product, so I opted for a replacement.  It took nearly TWO MONTHS TO GET THE REPLACEMENT WHICH ALSO DIED WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF USE! I am done with this company for good. I will contact them and ask about a refund, but I already went ahead an ordered the clarisonic pro on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They claimed that they were waiting for replacements to be shipped to them from the manufacturer since many brushes were faulty, yet this information was only revealed to me the second or third time I called asking for a tracking number for the replacement, as I grew skeptical thinking that they were baiting me along until I forgot or lost interest. It may sound paranoid, yet I have read this is many other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makemeheal.com (prosonic&#x27;s retailer: A DISGUSTING COMPANY WITH HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE ETHICS in customer relations) has had my money for 3 months while I&#x27;ve only had the opportunity to use this brush (both brushes I was sent) for about 3-4 days. In the meantime, I could have been using clarisonic without losing money or time, which is partially my fault for not choosing the superior brand from the get go, but this company claims to match its effectiveness; I now know this is a clear case of false advertising and misrepresentation. Please save yourself the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is quite weak. I charged it for the full 24 hours; however, as soon as it touched my skin ever so lightly, the spinning action was greatly reduced or stopped all together. This was the case with both brushes I was sent. As another reviewer described, when it did spin, it felt and sounded like a rickety old wheel. I seriously doubt the authenticity of any 4-5 star reviews; if legitimate, they must have only used it a few times, as I am convinced THIS PRODUCT WILL CEASE TO OPERATE EVENTUALLY NO MATTER WHAT! It may be the first day or the 2nd month, but it is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH BUYING!</li>
            <li> The charge lasts only a couple of days and then needs recharging....very annoying. I purchased from Groupon and will now try Olay product...much more reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I used this product three times.  This LAST and third time, it exploded.  It didn&#x27;t come apart but it flashed red and the explosion was so loud I still cannot hear correctly in my left ear.  I am making an appointment with an ear doctor first thing tomorrow morning.  This is a dangerous product.  I really can&#x27;t even rate it one star.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
