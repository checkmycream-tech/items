            <li>Love these!  </li>
            <li>Will order some more!</li>

            <li>I Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loving the sonicare kids brushes and my kids have never had cleaner</li>
            <li>But she is getting more and more thorough!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best way to get their teeth very clean and fast.</li>
            <li>this product is great for kids and makes brushing teeth fun.</li>
            <li>Best brush for kids and the adult version can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>These are the perfect size for my 7 year old.</li>
            <li>Fits my kid&#x27;s teeth which is important for good brushing.  </li>
            <li>I use the adult version myself and am very happy with the Philips products.  </li>
            <li>Very happy to find brush replacement heads online since the target near us used to carry them</li>
            <li>These do not stay on my daughters toothbrush - fly right off</li>
            <li>The prices on Amazon for these are generally the best.</li>
            <li>5 year old brushing her teeth on her own and no cavities!!  </li>
            <li>Very good design for my three years old son.</li>
            <li>Make sure you match up your model correctly though.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use the Sonicare for Kids for my children because I feel that it does a better job cleaning their teeth than if I were to brush them using a manual brush.  </li>
            <li>It reduced the surface staining of my son&#x27;s teeth by many fold.  </li>
            <li>But I guess that&#x27;s a worthwhile investment compared to the alternative.</li>
            <li>Our dentist recommended that we use this brand of electric toothbrush and it has been great--the kids actually ENJOY brushing their teeth!</li>
            <li>Now I make sure to always have a replacement head on hand for whenever needed.  </li>
            <li>Our kids love their Sonicare and we have these heads delivered every 4-months when it&#x27;s time to replace them.</li>
            <li>My daughter, my husband and I all have theses tooth brushes and we love them.  </li>
            <li>Kids love brushing teeth with this.</li>
            <li>No cavities. :)</li>
            <li>no complaints :)</li>
            <li>We are a family of Sonicare users - we love the ease of use and durability.</li>
            <li>I love the Philips Sonicare toothbrush for kids.</li>
            <li>but oh well better for kids</li>
            <li>Love kids sonic care toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Getting the kids to brush well is a &amp;#34;chore&amp;#34; but using the Sonicare electric toothbrush has been helpful with getting better checkups when they visit the dentist.  </li>
            <li>We love the toothbrush and needed replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I figure better to spend a bit more on replacement heads than spend on dental bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>alwas love using sonicare product for our family.</li>

            <li>My kids love it</li>
            <li>Love the brush head.</li>
            <li>Kids love the way the brush beeps when it&#x27;s time to move to another spot in the mouth.</li>
            <li>I guess I may have to buy a childs unit to be able to use the child size brush.</li>
            <li>Love this brush teeth and the head that goes with it.</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare Kids toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My Kids (age 6 and 8) don&#x27;t mind using the sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I just wish they were more affordable.</li>
            <li>This is a much better pet innate solution</li>
            <li>Can you expect any more?  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves it and I am glad to find a 2 pack of replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Kids love it; easy to use;</li>
            <li>My five year old has great dental checkups</li>
            <li>Reasonable pricing, good quality factory replacements.</li>
            <li>Better to stick with original manufacturer&#x27;s parts in this case.</li>
            <li>-On Brush Heads for Easy Replacement and Cleaning&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush heads snap onto the Sonicare for Kids handle for easy replacement and optimal hygiene.</li>
            <li>Great brush, son loves the stickers, I love the quality, the musical tones, and</li>
            <li>I buy these replacement heads specifically for ages 4-7 because they are the perfect size for her little mouth.  </li>
            <li>perfect brush for my little one.</li>
            <li>These are the perfect size for my little ones and it&#x27;s nice that they have different colors to differentiate, but I wish there were more color options for those of us with more than 2 kids.</li>
            <li>Plus, it makes brushing teeth more fun for my children.</li>
            <li>free materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is important for kids to learn to brush correctly.</li>
            <li>Use these in my son&#x27;s electronic toothbrush and they work and fit well.  </li>
            <li>They tested the fit over the phone before I ordered.  </li>
            <li>so it is important to watch them.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t fit the brush like the originals</li>
            <li>They fit on the brush and work just as they are supposed to.</li>
            <li>Fit the Sonicare just as advertised.</li>
            <li>probably a cheap copy</li>
            <li>Bought one for my 5 year old and she loved it.</li>
            <li>So far we are happy with this purchase and the price was about right too.</li>
            <li>Love this, it&#x27;s just the right size and speed.</li>
            <li>I caution buyers to be sure the heads they order are for the right age group of kid(s)</li>
            <li>Sonic care kids really helps my kids clean their teeth effectively.  </li>
            <li>These were a genuine replacement for the original heads.  </li>
            <li>These brushes really clean well and the kids enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>These replacement brush heads are just like the ones shipped with the original product.</li>
            <li>I bought originally.</li>
            <li>yes, and are the original ones.</li>
            <li>They work great, have a good fit and last just as long.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy and fun to brush her teeth with the motorized handle the brush attaches to.</li>
            <li>Gives feeling of clean mouth.  </li>
            <li>It does well to keep their teeth clean and fits each of their mouth sizes well.</li>
            <li>The tooth are really clean after the 2 minutes time suggested.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t spend hours trying to get his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>and I know her teeth are getting clean even if I only get one good sweep in</li>
            <li>I will be looking for a better option that does not cost as much.</li>
            <li>My 2, 4 and 6 year old each have their own head that we change on one handle for the sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Our whole family uses Sonicare toothbrushes and we love them.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly once ordered.  </li>
            <li>More importantly my 6 year old loves</li>
            <li>My kids love brushing their teeth with these new brushes.</li>
            <li>But still worth</li>
            <li>, I figured they&#x27;d be worth a shot.</li>
            <li>They are sorta pricey, but worth it, in my view.</li>
            <li>I could have gone directly to the Phillips site, but I found a better deal on Amazon...  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years, but when my two boys each had a cavity at last year&#x27;s dentist visit, I immediately bought them their own.</li>
            <li>it worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Makes tooth brushing fun experience and my son loves it.</li>
            <li>but he likes how colorful it is and</li>
            <li>Maybe, but piece of mind is worth something, too.</li>
            <li>The price is right here on amazon esp.</li>
            <li>At the 4th beep/2 min mark, the toothbrush turns off automatically so we&#x27;re always brushing for the right amount of time.  </li>
            <li>they are sticking it to parents who need a smaller brush head for kids.&lt;br /&gt;Charging 50% more than the same 50 cents worth of plastic for adults, nice.</li>
            <li>I double checked the original brushes and they work fine with both of my children&#x27;s toothbrush handles, its definitely these new brushes...waste of good money.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to brush my two year old daughter&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>The HX6032 Sonicare really made a difference in my kids brushing habits (became more of a game..6 and 3 years old) and it was affordable.  </li>
            <li>We like the replacement heads very much.</li>
            <li>they are still getting much more in than using just a regular rotating brush.</li>
            <li>if you use subscribe and save--- which by the way really helps you remember when to change the brush heads!</li>
            <li>so we know exactly when to switch sides.  </li>
            <li>It can be ordered in various size heads, so therefore I bought myself one to and love it.</li>
            <li>these replacement heads also fit, and work with, the adult toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Just that the bristles tend to wear out more often than they are said to last according the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>because most stores only carry the 7+ sized heads.</li>
            <li>I looked all over locally and could not find an appropriate replacement.  </li>
            <li>My son giggles the whole time we brush his teeth!  </li>
            <li>It does  much better job at cleaning the teeth than a regular manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I kept them anyway, but will do better next time</li>
            <li>You can tell by looking at these brush heads that it is not expensive to manufacture them.</li>
            <li>Much more efficient than a regular brush teeth.</li>
            <li>Were exactly what I needed to replace lost brush heads for my son&#x27;s sonicare.  </li>
            <li>We have tried many different cheaper $10 types and found that they were a one and done type of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the brush heads will soften over time and i feel become less effective at cleaning.</li>
            <li>hard to find in stores glad they are so easy to find here.</li>
            <li>So, you could just buy the heads for your little one and use with your own Sonicare.....</li>
            <li>My 3-year-old son really likes his toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These work really well for him.</li>
            <li>it knowing that with has much vibration the Sonicare toothbrush puts out it even if they shortened their brushing</li>
            <li>This toothbrush was recommended by his pediatric dentist and cleaned his teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>They remove more plaque than a children&#x27;s manual toothbrush in children aged four to ten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than purchasing them in the store.  </li>
            <li>Was reasonable for the money.</li>
            <li>I really just have to direct/maneuver the brush to each tooth</li>
            <li>They work great for getting the 3 year-old&#x27;s teeth cleaned, which was much more difficult to do with a regular brush.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are working very well for the kids.  </li>
            <li>Works very well with the sonic are child&#x27;s set.</li>
            <li>This is a 2 pack of the same size toothbrush head to fit the kids Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt but you have to teach your kid to use it gently on the gum.</li>
            <li>This product was reasonably priced and what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t think they are really Philips brand -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of a bummer for me, as I liked the idea of having each child with a different color, but such is life.  </li>
            <li>These are good but they were smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>The kids tips are just right for our 4 year old</li>
            <li>the rest will fall out so quickly that it is less important to maintain them over time.</li>
            <li>Just starting using it, but likes it &amp; is excited about brushing.</li>
            <li>and it vibrates enough to clean each tooth.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush removed built on plaque that we couldn&#x27;t get off with other tooth brushes... it is SOOO worth the price to have some clean teeth kids</li>
            <li>(Colors May Vary)]], which is pretty much exactly the same as this product, except that both replacement heads in the package are light blue.  </li>
            <li>The actual brush heads had to be special ordered -</li>
            <li>$20 in many other retail stores! ...</li>
            <li>Does an amazing job on their teeth, but this is already our second one because the kids broke one from being too rough putting the head on and off over time.</li>
            <li>But this head is nice and soft, lasts for a decent amount of time as long as your child doesn&#x27;t chew on it, and is the proper size for kids to maneuver inside their mouths.</li>
            <li>It is the only place were I have been able to find these Philips replacement heads that fit small mouths.</li>
            <li>the kids&#x27; toothbrush is about the same length as the adult one, (the actual toothbrush not the head) only a bit chunkier so kids should be able to manipulate the adult Sonicare as easily as they would the kids.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>The kids and I have used Sonicare as long as I can remember; however, at times we get a toothbrush head that comes apart when I take it off the unit to clean it (about once or twice a week).</li>
            <li>They are teaching my kids how long to brush which is nice when people feel rushed and want to cut short an important daily personal hygiene.</li>
            <li>They seem to last longer than my adult heads from sonicare, the diamond clean.</li>
            <li>however, just be mindful that this particular set is small, good enough for kids under 5.</li>
            <li>The 5 year old girl thinks it tickles too much.</li>
            <li>Great item, but they are just so darned expensive</li>
            <li>I believe this part number is becoming obsolete and the current cost is double the MSRP.  </li>
            <li>I love that they have a timer, so I know they are using it long enough.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend for others that need new brush heads</li>
            <li>This makes it fast and easy with few tantrums.</li>
            <li>This item was not specified as the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; heads only that it fit the Sonic care for kids, I needed the ones for older kids which is a slightly bigger head.  </li>
            <li>Grandchildren like the new toothbrushes....especially the boys, ages 5 and 7.  </li>
            <li>With the amount of money I paid, I could have purchased a new brush (of course the problem does not rectify it.</li>
            <li>They come in two colors, light blue and red.  </li>
            <li>They definitely work much better than the other kids rotating toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>not only is it a better deal, it helps me save 20% on other purchases because i bump of the 20% limit.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old loves this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>and this is exactly the same brush head that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It originally came with one small head and one large but I could not find that combo anywhere for replacement.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter has been using the Sonicare toothbrush since she was 4 years old, and she loves it!  </li>
            <li>Luckily I could just snap it back on again, but it should be possible to remove the head from the toothbrush without breaking either item.</li>
            <li>Not sure what to say about these other than this is a good product.</li>
            <li>The heads are small, about 0.5 inches long, making them ideal for little mouths.</li>
            <li>My son has had problems with staining since he was 2 years old.  </li>
            <li>My son is 5 1/2 years old now</li>
            <li>that way we know when the old brushes should be replaced.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Perfect for young children&#x27;s teeth and gums, Sonicare for Kids toothbrush heads have soft bristles to ease them into using a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Does sonicare make an ultra soft head for periodontal disease.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 5 year old.  </li>
            <li>The price is too much for only receiving two of the replacements brush heads.</li>
            <li>My six year old uses these</li>
            <li>Fits my adult sonic care handle (check the model design or call Philips Sonicare).  </li>
            <li>This was for backup on the unit that I bought for my 2-year old, which already came with brush heads.</li>
            <li>My sister claims that it really is the owner of the brush that makes the difference between a person having cavities or not, but I can definitely say that it helps that this brush does the brushing for you.</li>
            <li>These are the replacement heads for my 4-year old&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My old ones were not.</li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush for my two yr old.</li>
            <li>so it is not because they are old.</li>
            <li>Almost right away these were not working on the sonicare handle, they vibrate off when my son tries to use his toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I can breath easy knowing the this Sonicare is doing all the work for my lazy boy.</li>
            <li>Simply awesome, wish they were not this expensive as it last less time than adults.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the smaller brush heads for any kid regardless of age just because they actually fit in their little mouths all the way.</li>
            <li>focus obviously on the new incoming teeth as well as</li>
            <li>Glad to find this very hard to find replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to call your attention that the description says soft, but if you look at the package photo closer you can see that it is actually &amp;#34;extra soft&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>focus on the molars in kids as those will last until 10-12 years old.</li>
            <li>Another year, and my granddaughter will be old enough to split the 2 replacement heads with me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll tell you what, this soft outer skin maybe ought to be standard on all of their brush</li>
            <li>The bristles appear to be soft enough but also wear well, so</li>
            <li>We have been using the adult version for ten years and have no complaints.</li>
            <li>just right for little ones.</li>
            <li>Not a single cavity since.</li>
            <li>That size head is significantly longer (closer to the length of the replacement heads for adults) and is much harder for little ones to control.  </li>
            <li>As is usual with electric toothbrushes, they tend to get a little gunky if you don&#x27;t stay on top of it.  </li>
            <li>He got used to it quickly, but had some difficulty with keeping the hard plastic from contacting his teeth.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra effort to find the small brush heads at Amazon and wait for them to be delivered as I could NOT find them in they stores.</li>
            <li>Brush head is too soft and lost its shape after single use</li>
            <li>Most stores don&#x27;t carry this small size just the larger kids size which is too big for the little ones.</li>
            <li>The small size is just right for younger children.</li>
            <li>These are the smaller ones) for half as much.</li>

            <li> I Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving the sonicare kids brushes and my kids have never had cleaner</li>

            <li> These do not stay on my daughters toothbrush - fly right off</li>
            <li> The prices on Amazon for these are generally the best.</li>
            <li> 5 year old brushing her teeth on her own and no cavities!!  </li>
            <li> Very good design for my three years old son.</li>
            <li> Make sure you match up your model correctly though.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use the Sonicare for Kids for my children because I feel that it does a better job cleaning their teeth than if I were to brush them using a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> It reduced the surface staining of my son&#x27;s teeth by many fold.  </li>
            <li> But I guess that&#x27;s a worthwhile investment compared to the alternative.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended that we use this brand of electric toothbrush and it has been great--the kids actually ENJOY brushing their teeth!</li>
            <li> Now I make sure to always have a replacement head on hand for whenever needed.  </li>
            <li> Our kids love their Sonicare and we have these heads delivered every 4-months when it&#x27;s time to replace them.</li>

            <li> We are a family of Sonicare users - we love the ease of use and durability.</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Sonicare toothbrush for kids.</li>
            <li> but oh well better for kids</li>
            <li> Love kids sonic care toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Getting the kids to brush well is a &amp;#34;chore&amp;#34; but using the Sonicare electric toothbrush has been helpful with getting better checkups when they visit the dentist.  </li>
            <li> We love the toothbrush and needed replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I figure better to spend a bit more on replacement heads than spend on dental bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Kids love the way the brush beeps when it&#x27;s time to move to another spot in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I guess I may have to buy a childs unit to be able to use the child size brush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush teeth and the head that goes with it.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare Kids toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My Kids (age 6 and 8) don&#x27;t mind using the sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I just wish they were more affordable.</li>
            <li> This is a much better pet innate solution</li>
            <li> Can you expect any more?  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and I am glad to find a 2 pack of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Kids love it; easy to use;</li>
            <li> My five year old has great dental checkups</li>
            <li> Reasonable pricing, good quality factory replacements.</li>

            <li> -On Brush Heads for Easy Replacement and Cleaning&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush heads snap onto the Sonicare for Kids handle for easy replacement and optimal hygiene.</li>
            <li> Great brush, son loves the stickers, I love the quality, the musical tones, and</li>
            <li> I buy these replacement heads specifically for ages 4-7 because they are the perfect size for her little mouth.  </li>
            <li> perfect brush for my little one.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for my little ones and it&#x27;s nice that they have different colors to differentiate, but I wish there were more color options for those of us with more than 2 kids.</li>
            <li> Plus, it makes brushing teeth more fun for my children.</li>
            <li> free materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is important for kids to learn to brush correctly.</li>
            <li> Use these in my son&#x27;s electronic toothbrush and they work and fit well.  </li>
            <li> They tested the fit over the phone before I ordered.  </li>
            <li> so it is important to watch them.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t fit the brush like the originals</li>
            <li> They fit on the brush and work just as they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> Fit the Sonicare just as advertised.</li>
            <li> probably a cheap copy</li>
            <li> Bought one for my 5 year old and she loved it.</li>
            <li> So far we are happy with this purchase and the price was about right too.</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s just the right size and speed.</li>
            <li> I caution buyers to be sure the heads they order are for the right age group of kid(s)</li>
            <li> Sonic care kids really helps my kids clean their teeth effectively.  </li>
            <li> These were a genuine replacement for the original heads.  </li>
            <li> These brushes really clean well and the kids enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are just like the ones shipped with the original product.</li>
            <li> I bought originally.</li>
            <li> yes, and are the original ones.</li>
            <li> They work great, have a good fit and last just as long.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy and fun to brush her teeth with the motorized handle the brush attaches to.</li>
            <li> Gives feeling of clean mouth.  </li>
            <li> It does well to keep their teeth clean and fits each of their mouth sizes well.</li>
            <li> The tooth are really clean after the 2 minutes time suggested.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t spend hours trying to get his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> and I know her teeth are getting clean even if I only get one good sweep in</li>
            <li> I will be looking for a better option that does not cost as much.</li>
            <li> My 2, 4 and 6 year old each have their own head that we change on one handle for the sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Our whole family uses Sonicare toothbrushes and we love them.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly once ordered.  </li>
            <li> More importantly my 6 year old loves</li>
            <li> My kids love brushing their teeth with these new brushes.</li>
            <li> But still worth</li>
            <li> , I figured they&#x27;d be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> They are sorta pricey, but worth it, in my view.</li>
            <li> I could have gone directly to the Phillips site, but I found a better deal on Amazon...  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years, but when my two boys each had a cavity at last year&#x27;s dentist visit, I immediately bought them their own.</li>
            <li> it worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Makes tooth brushing fun experience and my son loves it.</li>
            <li> but he likes how colorful it is and</li>
            <li> Maybe, but piece of mind is worth something, too.</li>
            <li> The price is right here on amazon esp.</li>
            <li> At the 4th beep/2 min mark, the toothbrush turns off automatically so we&#x27;re always brushing for the right amount of time.  </li>
            <li> they are sticking it to parents who need a smaller brush head for kids.&lt;br /&gt;Charging 50% more than the same 50 cents worth of plastic for adults, nice.</li>
            <li> I double checked the original brushes and they work fine with both of my children&#x27;s toothbrush handles, its definitely these new brushes...waste of good money.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to brush my two year old daughter&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> The HX6032 Sonicare really made a difference in my kids brushing habits (became more of a game..6 and 3 years old) and it was affordable.  </li>
            <li> We like the replacement heads very much.</li>
            <li> they are still getting much more in than using just a regular rotating brush.</li>
            <li> if you use subscribe and save--- which by the way really helps you remember when to change the brush heads!</li>
            <li> so we know exactly when to switch sides.  </li>
            <li> It can be ordered in various size heads, so therefore I bought myself one to and love it.</li>
            <li> these replacement heads also fit, and work with, the adult toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Just that the bristles tend to wear out more often than they are said to last according the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> because most stores only carry the 7+ sized heads.</li>
            <li> I looked all over locally and could not find an appropriate replacement.  </li>
            <li> My son giggles the whole time we brush his teeth!  </li>
            <li> It does  much better job at cleaning the teeth than a regular manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I kept them anyway, but will do better next time</li>
            <li> You can tell by looking at these brush heads that it is not expensive to manufacture them.</li>
            <li> Much more efficient than a regular brush teeth.</li>
            <li> Were exactly what I needed to replace lost brush heads for my son&#x27;s sonicare.  </li>
            <li> We have tried many different cheaper $10 types and found that they were a one and done type of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the brush heads will soften over time and i feel become less effective at cleaning.</li>
            <li> hard to find in stores glad they are so easy to find here.</li>
            <li> So, you could just buy the heads for your little one and use with your own Sonicare.....</li>
            <li> My 3-year-old son really likes his toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These work really well for him.</li>
            <li> it knowing that with has much vibration the Sonicare toothbrush puts out it even if they shortened their brushing</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended by his pediatric dentist and cleaned his teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> They remove more plaque than a children&#x27;s manual toothbrush in children aged four to ten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than purchasing them in the store.  </li>
            <li> Was reasonable for the money.</li>
            <li> I really just have to direct/maneuver the brush to each tooth</li>
            <li> They work great for getting the 3 year-old&#x27;s teeth cleaned, which was much more difficult to do with a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are working very well for the kids.  </li>
            <li> Works very well with the sonic are child&#x27;s set.</li>
            <li> This is a 2 pack of the same size toothbrush head to fit the kids Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt but you have to teach your kid to use it gently on the gum.</li>
            <li> This product was reasonably priced and what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t think they are really Philips brand -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a bummer for me, as I liked the idea of having each child with a different color, but such is life.  </li>
            <li> These are good but they were smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> The kids tips are just right for our 4 year old</li>
            <li> the rest will fall out so quickly that it is less important to maintain them over time.</li>
            <li> Just starting using it, but likes it &amp; is excited about brushing.</li>
            <li> and it vibrates enough to clean each tooth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush removed built on plaque that we couldn&#x27;t get off with other tooth brushes... it is SOOO worth the price to have some clean teeth kids</li>
            <li> (Colors May Vary)]], which is pretty much exactly the same as this product, except that both replacement heads in the package are light blue.  </li>
            <li> The actual brush heads had to be special ordered -</li>
            <li> $20 in many other retail stores! ...</li>
            <li> Does an amazing job on their teeth, but this is already our second one because the kids broke one from being too rough putting the head on and off over time.</li>
            <li> But this head is nice and soft, lasts for a decent amount of time as long as your child doesn&#x27;t chew on it, and is the proper size for kids to maneuver inside their mouths.</li>
            <li> It is the only place were I have been able to find these Philips replacement heads that fit small mouths.</li>
            <li> the kids&#x27; toothbrush is about the same length as the adult one, (the actual toothbrush not the head) only a bit chunkier so kids should be able to manipulate the adult Sonicare as easily as they would the kids.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> The kids and I have used Sonicare as long as I can remember; however, at times we get a toothbrush head that comes apart when I take it off the unit to clean it (about once or twice a week).</li>
            <li> They are teaching my kids how long to brush which is nice when people feel rushed and want to cut short an important daily personal hygiene.</li>
            <li> They seem to last longer than my adult heads from sonicare, the diamond clean.</li>
            <li> however, just be mindful that this particular set is small, good enough for kids under 5.</li>
            <li> The 5 year old girl thinks it tickles too much.</li>
            <li> Great item, but they are just so darned expensive</li>
            <li> I believe this part number is becoming obsolete and the current cost is double the MSRP.  </li>
            <li> I love that they have a timer, so I know they are using it long enough.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend for others that need new brush heads</li>
            <li> This makes it fast and easy with few tantrums.</li>
            <li> This item was not specified as the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; heads only that it fit the Sonic care for kids, I needed the ones for older kids which is a slightly bigger head.  </li>
            <li> Grandchildren like the new toothbrushes....especially the boys, ages 5 and 7.  </li>
            <li> With the amount of money I paid, I could have purchased a new brush (of course the problem does not rectify it.</li>
            <li> They come in two colors, light blue and red.  </li>
            <li> They definitely work much better than the other kids rotating toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> not only is it a better deal, it helps me save 20% on other purchases because i bump of the 20% limit.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old loves this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> and this is exactly the same brush head that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It originally came with one small head and one large but I could not find that combo anywhere for replacement.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has been using the Sonicare toothbrush since she was 4 years old, and she loves it!  </li>
            <li> Luckily I could just snap it back on again, but it should be possible to remove the head from the toothbrush without breaking either item.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say about these other than this is a good product.</li>
            <li> The heads are small, about 0.5 inches long, making them ideal for little mouths.</li>
            <li> My son has had problems with staining since he was 2 years old.  </li>
            <li> My son is 5 1/2 years old now</li>
            <li> that way we know when the old brushes should be replaced.</li>
            <li> Soft Bristles Designed for Sensitive Mouths&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfect for young children&#x27;s teeth and gums, Sonicare for Kids toothbrush heads have soft bristles to ease them into using a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Does sonicare make an ultra soft head for periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 5 year old.  </li>
            <li> The price is too much for only receiving two of the replacements brush heads.</li>
            <li> My six year old uses these</li>
            <li> Fits my adult sonic care handle (check the model design or call Philips Sonicare).  </li>
            <li> This was for backup on the unit that I bought for my 2-year old, which already came with brush heads.</li>
            <li> My sister claims that it really is the owner of the brush that makes the difference between a person having cavities or not, but I can definitely say that it helps that this brush does the brushing for you.</li>
            <li> These are the replacement heads for my 4-year old&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My old ones were not.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush for my two yr old.</li>
            <li> so it is not because they are old.</li>
            <li> Almost right away these were not working on the sonicare handle, they vibrate off when my son tries to use his toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I can breath easy knowing the this Sonicare is doing all the work for my lazy boy.</li>
            <li> Simply awesome, wish they were not this expensive as it last less time than adults.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the smaller brush heads for any kid regardless of age just because they actually fit in their little mouths all the way.</li>
            <li> focus obviously on the new incoming teeth as well as</li>
            <li> Glad to find this very hard to find replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to call your attention that the description says soft, but if you look at the package photo closer you can see that it is actually &amp;#34;extra soft&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> focus on the molars in kids as those will last until 10-12 years old.</li>
            <li> Another year, and my granddaughter will be old enough to split the 2 replacement heads with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you what, this soft outer skin maybe ought to be standard on all of their brush</li>
            <li> The bristles appear to be soft enough but also wear well, so</li>
            <li> We have been using the adult version for ten years and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> just right for little ones.</li>
            <li> Not a single cavity since.</li>
            <li> That size head is significantly longer (closer to the length of the replacement heads for adults) and is much harder for little ones to control.  </li>
            <li> As is usual with electric toothbrushes, they tend to get a little gunky if you don&#x27;t stay on top of it.  </li>
            <li> He got used to it quickly, but had some difficulty with keeping the hard plastic from contacting his teeth.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra effort to find the small brush heads at Amazon and wait for them to be delivered as I could NOT find them in they stores.</li>
            <li> Brush head is too soft and lost its shape after single use</li>
            <li> Most stores don&#x27;t carry this small size just the larger kids size which is too big for the little ones.</li>
            <li> The small size is just right for younger children.</li>
            <li> These are the smaller ones) for half as much.</li>
            <li> Our 3½ year old son has been using a Sonicare with the standard small adult brush head for about a year.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend getting this size replacement brush head for any little ones who uses the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re already a Sonicare user, you know what a &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34; this can transmit into your skull (my wife had the same complaint when we first got the Sonicare, and</li>
            <li> pearly white instead of toilet stain brown.</li>
            <li> Once you get the kids used to the vibration - mine laughed hysterically for the first week</li>
            <li> I color coded one kid red, other blue.</li>
            <li> The brushes have been great, but now that my 4-year old is doing it all by himself, I think he&#x27;s pulling on it so hard that the brushhead base pops off and stays on the metal rod.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although that small adult brush head was working well enough, when I found these for replacement</li>
            <li> she because of that she stayed away from it for a long time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These heads do not fit as well as the ones that came with the Sonicare for Kids Toothbrush (red and blue pair).</li>
            <li> The brush heads themselves look to be about the same size as the standard small adult brush heads, though the overall length of each attachment is perhaps a half inch shorter, making these just a bit easier to handle for small kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She brushes for 2 minutes every single time!  </li>
            <li> Negative - The brush head is a little large.</li>
            <li> It beeps in 30 sec intervals</li>
            <li> It also has a timer that sounds at the 30 sec, 60 sec, 90 sec, and 2 minute mark.  </li>
            <li> I order this this twice, first time no problem, second time one of the two heads kept coming apart, afraid to order it again.</li>
            <li> The length of the brush head from base to top is about 2 3/4 inches long and the head itself is just over .5 inches.      </li>
            <li> I can hear them beep from the other room if my kids try to cheat.  </li>
            <li> Have to buy replacement heads sometime or the other).</li>
            <li> They are pretty expensive to have this problem.</li>
            <li> The average price for this item is about $25 on other sites - FYI</li>
            <li> Bought these for my kids use and since they&#x27;re so hard to find locally</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Although the heads do seem expensive, they last for 3 months, but the results from using this toothbrush will last a lifetime!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these less than a month ago and one of them broke already.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are just small enough for the small mouth she has.</li>
            <li> Since box was open I had to have my kids use them especially since they are quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of buying spin brushes e dry week as my ten two year old was obsessed with brushing her teeth..</li>
            <li> They are a bit pricey, but much less expensive in the long run than cavities and multiple dental visits.</li>
            <li> I the only bad thing is the price is quite high for the replacement bushes.</li>
            <li> Replaces the little kids (ages 4 &amp; up) brush head that came with the Sonicare kids brush.  </li>
            <li> Is it a little pricey?  </li>
            <li> The bristles became uneven lengths, causing the gums to bleed.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, my daughter did such a poor job of using the toothbrush with the longer head that my husband and I had to brush her teeth for her.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few places that sells the compact kids toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> Heads are not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Even though my daughter will be seven in a few months I plan on using this size for at least another year.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush trains gums to tolerate the massage function and sonic takes care of the spaces that might be missed by an ordinary toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Price, as for all the Sonicare brush heads, is ridiculously expensive, which is why I only give them 3 stars.</li>
            <li> My son is 7, so these were definitely small.</li>
            <li> Need the small size for kids to brush around braces.</li>
            <li> We were searching for electric toothbrushes for our small children.</li>
            <li> just wish they were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> Lasts three months and my kid brushes her teeth without complaint.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find these heads in any store so you&#x27;re forced to buy online.</li>
            <li> Philips sonicare brush heads are expensive compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> These smaller, softer replacement brushes are very difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> The smaller head did not fit into the sonic base that I already have.  </li>
            <li> Once the battery needed replacement it was next to impossible to unscrew the flap where the battery is even with eye glass screw drivers.</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> The brush heads are very hard to get on and off the brush.  </li>
            <li> I bought an extra set for Grandma to use during sleepovers with her Sonicare, and found out these heads aren&#x27;t compatible with her base unit.</li>
            <li> Lifts all those stains and doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind...</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these ones and hated the next size up.</li>
            <li> No more writing it on the calendar!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s where I went wrong here.</li>
            <li> However, replacement heads should not be this expensive.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was for my fault for choosing the wrong size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> but I think it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist and finding these replacement heads for the kids Sonicare was very difficult and expensive until I found these.</li>
            <li> terrible waste of money - the brush and the heads.</li>
            <li> Something snapped on the inside, they&#x27;re very difficult to get on and off.</li>
            <li> I see this product now sells for close to $50, which is completely crazy!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My 3-year-old son really likes his toothbrush. These work really well for him. We actually subscribed to get these every 6 months and save an extra 5%.</li>
            <li> ...in fact I stood in the toothbrush aisle while I ordered these from Amazon! Make sure you match up your model correctly though. I bought an extra set for Grandma to use during sleepovers with her Sonicare, and found out these heads aren&#x27;t compatible with her base unit. Oh well, we&#x27;ve now got extras.</li>
            <li> Once my kids were only enough I immediately switched them over to Sonicare kids toothbrushes.  They definitely work much better than the other kids rotating toothbrushes.  Since my kids are younger they still chew on the head sometimes which wears them out a bit quicker.  This makes it a bit more expensive to replace.  But still worth it knowing that with has much vibration the Sonicare toothbrush puts out it even if they shortened their brushing they are still getting much more in than using just a regular rotating brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles became uneven lengths, causing the gums to bleed.  It was like brushing with a weed-wacker.  Manufacturer didn&#x27;t care, and did nothing for us to replace the brush heads.</li>
            <li> good buy would buy again</li>
            <li> I prefer to use the Sonicare for Kids for my children because I feel that it does a better job cleaning their teeth than if I were to brush them using a manual brush.  Plus, it makes brushing teeth more fun for my children.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for our boys forever and have had great luck with them. The price is right here on amazon esp. if you use subscribe and save--- which by the way really helps you remember when to change the brush heads! When they arrive on your doorstep, you know it&#x27;s time!! No more writing it on the calendar!!!</li>
            <li> Love these!  5 year old brushing her teeth on her own and no cavities!!  I highly recommend.  ps of course we also brush her teeth! But she is getting more and more thorough!</li>
            <li> My son has had problems with staining since he was 2 years old.  This toothbrush was recommended by his pediatric dentist and cleaned his teeth very well.  It reduced the surface staining of my son&#x27;s teeth by many fold.  It beeps in 30 sec intervals so we know exactly when to switch sides.  At the 4th beep/2 min mark, the toothbrush turns off automatically so we&#x27;re always brushing for the right amount of time.  My son is 5 1/2 years old now and we&#x27;re still using the same toothbrush.  My only problem is the price of the replacement heads, hence 4 stars rather than 5.  But I guess that&#x27;s a worthwhile investment compared to the alternative.</li>
            <li> My kids love brushing their teeth with these new brushes. We like the replacement heads very much. They seem to last longer than my adult heads from sonicare, the diamond clean.</li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrush heads are perfect for our kids Sonicare Toothbrush.  Our dentist recommended that we use this brand of electric toothbrush and it has been great--the kids actually ENJOY brushing their teeth! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very happy with everything</li>
            <li> These are great brush heads.  I use the subscribe &amp; save option so when they arrive I know it&#x27;s time to change!</li>
            <li> Reasonable pricing, good quality factory replacements. Made in USA unlike the Sonicare handle which is China made. Will order some more!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say about these other than this is a good product. I try to replace my son&#x27;s brush head every 2 months or so. Amazon is the best place to get these.</li>
            <li> We have a subscription to receive these every 3 months...that way we know when the old brushes should be replaced.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my 5 year old and she loved it. It makes it easy and fun to brush her teeth with the motorized handle the brush attaches to. It can be ordered in various size heads, so therefore I bought myself one to and love it.</li>
            <li> Very good design for my three years old son. The size is perfect.my son start to learn how to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has been using the Sonicare toothbrush since she was 4 years old, and she loves it!  I buy these replacement heads specifically for ages 4-7 because they are the perfect size for her little mouth.  Even though my daughter will be seven in a few months I plan on using this size for at least another year.  They come in two colors, light blue and red.  The length of the brush head from base to top is about 2 3/4 inches long and the head itself is just over .5 inches.      Once when I ran out of this size replacement heads I used the size up, (the one for ages 7-10) and immediately noticed the difference.  That size head is significantly longer (closer to the length of the replacement heads for adults) and is much harder for little ones to control.  As a matter of fact, my daughter did such a poor job of using the toothbrush with the longer head that my husband and I had to brush her teeth for her.  Now I make sure to always have a replacement head on hand for whenever needed.  I buy them through Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save so I never run out.      I would highly recommend getting this size replacement brush head for any little ones who uses the Sonicare toothbrush.  FYI these replacement heads also fit, and work with, the adult toothbrush.  So, you could just buy the heads for your little one and use with your own Sonicare.....the kids&#x27; toothbrush is about the same length as the adult one, (the actual toothbrush not the head) only a bit chunkier so kids should be able to manipulate the adult Sonicare as easily as they would the kids.    [Update 8/26/14]  Since I wrote this review, Amazon has removed this item from its subscribe and save program.  They have substituted [[ASIN:B00G5L89JM Philips Sonicare HX6032/94 2 Piece Kids Brush Head, Compact (Colors May Vary)]], which is pretty much exactly the same as this product, except that both replacement heads in the package are light blue.  It&#x27;s a bit of a bummer for me, as I liked the idea of having each child with a different color, but such is life.  I see this product now sells for close to $50, which is completely crazy!</li>
            <li> Soft Bristles Designed for Sensitive Mouths&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for young children&#x27;s teeth and gums, Sonicare for Kids toothbrush heads have soft bristles to ease them into using a sonic toothbrush. The age-appropriate brush heads are designed with rubber molding to protect teeth at key developmental stages. They remove more plaque than a children&#x27;s manual toothbrush in children aged four to ten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For safety, these brush heads are made from BPA free materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snap-On Brush Heads for Easy Replacement and Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads snap onto the Sonicare for Kids handle for easy replacement and optimal hygiene. The Sonicare for Kids brush heads work exclusively with the Sonicare for Kids sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replace your brush head every three months for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in the Box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Sonicare for Kids brush heads and two hygienic travel caps.</li>
            <li> I had hoped the bristles would have been softer, but like the smaller head for my 7yo.  Does sonicare make an ultra soft head for periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist and finding these replacement heads for the kids Sonicare was very difficult and expensive until I found these.</li>
            <li> These are OEM replacement heads so they work well with the Sonicare Kids toothbrush.  The heads are small, about 0.5 inches long, making them ideal for little mouths.</li>
            <li> Does an amazing job on their teeth, but this is already our second one because the kids broke one from being too rough putting the head on and off over time.</li>
            <li> It is important for kids to learn to brush correctly. This toothbrush trains gums to tolerate the massage function and sonic takes care of the spaces that might be missed by an ordinary toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I thought Amazon&#x27;s robot software makes sure it has the lowest price!? I guess not!!!  The average price for this item is about $25 on other sites - FYI</li>
            <li> Kids love it; easy to use; Gives feeling of clean mouth.  Need to get replacement in future for the next age.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but my daughter loves the brush.  Charged the day we got it and have been using it for weeks now and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 5 year old.  He can use it by himself and it works great. Negative - The brush head is a little large.</li>
            <li> I order this this twice, first time no problem, second time one of the two heads kept coming apart, afraid to order it again.</li>
            <li> keeps my kids teef pearly white instead of toilet stain brown. they can drink monster energy drink for breakfast lunch dinner and while they&#x27;re sleeping and not appear to have meth mouth like teef</li>
            <li> Our kids love their Sonicare and we have these heads delivered every 4-months when it&#x27;s time to replace them. This package contains two heads.</li>
            <li> The price is too much for only receiving two of the replacements brush heads. I will be looking for a better option that does not cost as much.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for my little ones and it&#x27;s nice that they have different colors to differentiate, but I wish there were more color options for those of us with more than 2 kids.</li>
            <li> Works great! Just that the bristles tend to wear out more often than they are said to last according the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these ones and hated the next size up. just right for little ones. hard to find in stores glad they are so easy to find here.</li>
            <li> My daughter, my husband and I all have theses tooth brushes and we love them.  The kids tips are just right for our 4 year old</li>
            <li> The brushes have been great, but now that my 4-year old is doing it all by himself, I think he&#x27;s pulling on it so hard that the brushhead base pops off and stays on the metal rod. Luckily I could just snap it back on again, but it should be possible to remove the head from the toothbrush without breaking either item. ;)</li>
            <li> This was a gift from the tooth fairy. The actual brush heads had to be special ordered - the smaller heads (for 2 kids) because most stores only carry the 7+ sized heads. I&#x27;m a teeth freak. I guess I&#x27;m reviewing the brush (even though I didn&#x27;t purchase it thru amazon) and the heads. The brush is the bomb. Once you get the kids used to the vibration - mine laughed hysterically for the first week I used it with them. I would recommend the smaller brush heads for any kid regardless of age just because they actually fit in their little mouths all the way.</li>
            <li> Replaces the little kids (ages 4 &amp; up) brush head that came with the Sonicare kids brush.  Fits perfectly, works as it should</li>
            <li> Kids love brushing teeth with this. Can&#x27;t go wrong. I wish they sold different colors separately. I have two girls and they both like to have red one.</li>
            <li> My six year old uses these and they&#x27;re great. Much cheaper than purchasing them in the store.  You get a blue and a red one.</li>
            <li> Use these in my son&#x27;s electronic toothbrush and they work and fit well.  No issues and it appears they will last a while too.</li>
            <li> If you want two different colored brush heads, know that you won&#x27;t necessarily get them. I have two kids and want them to share the brushing unit, so I ordered this product to ensure that they wouldn&#x27;t be sharing a brush head. I was sent two brush heads the same color as the ine that came with the unit.</li>
            <li> Fits my adult sonic care handle (check the model design or call Philips Sonicare).  They tested the fit over the phone before I ordered.  My daughter loves it.  And her teeth are sparkling white.  No cavities. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased the replacement head for my daughter&#x27;s toothbrush.  I looked all over locally and could not find an appropriate replacement.  Was reasonable for the money.</li>
            <li> These work well and as described. These make brushing my kids teeth easier and they do an excellent job. The prices on Amazon for these are generally the best. They can fluctuate quite a lot so it is important to watch them.</li>
            <li> Have used these brush heads for years. The small size is just right for younger children. A good price online.</li>
            <li> Great brush, son loves the stickers, I love the quality, the musical tones, and knowing that my son is getting a really good brushing.  He uses it and I know he&#x27;s brushing longer.</li>
            <li> This was for backup on the unit that I bought for my 2-year old, which already came with brush heads. no complaints :)</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy part number HX6032/94 (mini or \\&quot;4to7\\&quot;.  These are the smaller ones) for half as much. I believe this part number is becoming obsolete and the current cost is double the MSRP.  These tooth brush heads and the toothbrushes themselves are very nice and work well.  They are teaching my kids how long to brush which is nice when people feel rushed and want to cut short an important daily personal hygiene.</li>
            <li> As is usual with electric toothbrushes, they tend to get a little gunky if you don&#x27;t stay on top of it.  But this head is nice and soft, lasts for a decent amount of time as long as your child doesn&#x27;t chew on it, and is the proper size for kids to maneuver inside their mouths.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect item for us to have on auto-refill; when they arrive I know it&#x27;s time to change them.  We are a family of Sonicare users - we love the ease of use and durability.</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Sonicare toothbrush for kids. Both my 4 and 2 year olds brush daily and have no cavities. My sister claims that it really is the owner of the brush that makes the difference between a person having cavities or not, but I can definitely say that it helps that this brush does the brushing for you. I really just have to direct/maneuver the brush to each tooth and it vibrates enough to clean each tooth. Worth the extra effort to find the small brush heads at Amazon and wait for them to be delivered as I could NOT find them in they stores.</li>
            <li> My 2, 4 and 6 year old each have their own head that we change on one handle for the sonicare toothbrush.  It does well to keep their teeth clean and fits each of their mouth sizes well.</li>
            <li> Item is as advertised. I bought these because Philips site indicates you have to use a head designed for Sonicare for Kids. Just wanted to call your attention that the description says soft, but if you look at the package photo closer you can see that it is actually &amp;#34;extra soft&amp;#34;.  They feel softer than the one mine came with. I would prefer a stiffer brush but oh well better for kids I guess.</li>
            <li> I can breath easy knowing the this Sonicare is doing all the work for my lazy boy. Great product to buy for the kids</li>
            <li> Love kids sonic care toothbrush. Makes it easy to brush my two year old daughter&#x27;s teeth. She loves brushing her teeth now</li>
            <li> Fits last years model toothbrush (sonicare) well and does the job it was intended for. So far we are happy with this purchase and the price was about right too.</li>
            <li> Getting the kids to brush well is a &amp;#34;chore&amp;#34; but using the Sonicare electric toothbrush has been helpful with getting better checkups when they visit the dentist.  These replacement brush heads are needed but I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so costly.</li>
            <li> The kids&#x27; teeth have never been cleaner, and the quality and build of the brush heads is excellent.  Better to stick with original manufacturer&#x27;s parts in this case.</li>
            <li> This product is not the same as the picture.  The actual product is a compact version and are two blue brush heads.  These heads do not fit as well as the ones that came with the Sonicare for Kids Toothbrush (red and blue pair).</li>
            <li> We love the toothbrush and needed replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I put these on subscribe and save. not only is it a better deal, it helps me save 20% on other purchases because i bump of the 20% limit. I get these every 4 months currently. trying to figure out best timing still. I&#x27;ve been loving the sonicare kids brushes and my kids have never had cleaner teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the brush heads will soften over time and i feel become less effective at cleaning. I figure better to spend a bit more on replacement heads than spend on dental bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;again focus on the molars in kids as those will last until 10-12 years old. the rest will fall out so quickly that it is less important to maintain them over time. focus obviously on the new incoming teeth as well as those are permanent.</li>
            <li> I Love it!  My son giggles the whole time we brush his teeth!  This is a must for all kids!</li>
            <li> Its not 5 star because of the price.  The brushes are great.  I can hear them beep from the other room if my kids try to cheat.  It makes it easy to take good care of their teeth!</li>
            <li> perfect brush for my little one. alwas love using sonicare product for our family. we using it from eight years ago and never want to change again.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and replacement heads for my children, ages 5 and 7.  It does  much better job at cleaning the teeth than a regular manual toothbrush.  It also has a timer that sounds at the 30 sec, 60 sec, 90 sec, and 2 minute mark.  This is helpful for brushing the recommended 2 minutes.  Love it!</li>
            <li> These are the replacement heads for my 4-year old&#x27;s toothbrush. I LOVE Sonicare&#x27;s toothbrushes!!! Although the heads do seem expensive, they last for 3 months, but the results from using this toothbrush will last a lifetime!!! Lifts all those stains and doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind...</li>
            <li> this product is great for kids and makes brushing teeth fun. The electric toothbrush makes my daughter feel like a big kid.</li>
            <li> After 8-tooth cavity, we bought this and brush twice/day. My kid has had 0 cavity for more than 1 yr since.</li>
            <li> Just starting using it, but likes it &amp; is excited about brushing. I&#x27;ll let you know soon if opinion changes.</li>
            <li> These were a genuine replacement for the original heads.  They work great for getting the 3 year-old&#x27;s teeth cleaned, which was much more difficult to do with a regular brush.  This makes it fast and easy with few tantrums.</li>
            <li> I always used compact heads in manual toothbrushes, so I prefer these for the Sonicare, too. Another year, and my granddaughter will be old enough to split the 2 replacement heads with me.</li>
            <li> Our 3½ year old son has been using a Sonicare with the standard small adult brush head for about a year. He got used to it quickly, but had some difficulty with keeping the hard plastic from contacting his teeth. If you&#x27;re already a Sonicare user, you know what a &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34; this can transmit into your skull (my wife had the same complaint when we first got the Sonicare, and she because of that she stayed away from it for a long time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although that small adult brush head was working well enough, when I found these for replacement, I figured they&#x27;d be worth a shot. I&#x27;ll tell you what, this soft outer skin maybe ought to be standard on all of their brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a simple rubbery coating, but when it contacts the teeth, the instant zap of vibration just isn&#x27;t there. The brush heads themselves look to be about the same size as the standard small adult brush heads, though the overall length of each attachment is perhaps a half inch shorter, making these just a bit easier to handle for small kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We continue to use both Oral B and Sonicare in our house, but since we&#x27;ve switched our oldest to these heads, he reaches for the Sonicare every time.</li>
            <li> Sonic care kids really helps my kids clean their teeth effectively.  They are sorta pricey, but worth it, in my view.</li>
            <li> These brushes are working very well for the kids.  The bristles appear to be soft enough but also wear well, so no complaints.  Price, as for all the Sonicare brush heads, is ridiculously expensive, which is why I only give them 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Purchased these cheaper online than what I would have to pay for 1 from a store.  I think the Philips Sonicare toothbrush system for kids is great!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my kids use and since they&#x27;re so hard to find locally I am ordering automatically through Amazon.  Toothbrush works great but the brush heads sometimes break from the connection point to the handle.  So if you can get them on and off the base unit without breaking them they&#x27;re great.  But I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s sometimes easier said than done.</li>
            <li> Great bristles.  Two different sizes for kids, based on ages.  Great accompaniment to Sonicare toothbrush.  Wish they had this when I was younger.</li>
            <li> We bought my daughter the kids sonicare and these replacement brush heads and she does a much better job of brushing her teeth now.  Dental visits have gone perfectly.</li>
            <li> Grandchildren like the new toothbrushes....especially the boys, ages 5 and 7.  The 5 year old girl thinks it tickles too much.</li>
            <li> Every time my son brushed with the replacement heads the bristles came off in clumps. I found additional replacement heads at Walmart and they  don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Love the price point on this set. Works very well with the sonic are child&#x27;s set.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few places that sells the compact kids toothbrush heads. It&#x27;s great there are 2 colors for kids.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for Amazon. It is the only place were I have been able to find these Philips replacement heads that fit small mouths.</li>
            <li> I ordered these less than a month ago and one of them broke already. Something snapped on the inside, they&#x27;re very difficult to get on and off. I know sometimes Amazon ends up with counterfeit products and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s where I went wrong here.</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s just the right size and speed. My kids love it and I can tell a difference in their teeth!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for toddler and preschoolers. Most stores don&#x27;t carry this small size just the larger kids size which is too big for the little ones.</li>
            <li> The Philips kids sonicare line is a joke. You can&#x27;t find these heads in any store so you&#x27;re forced to buy online. These don&#x27;t fit the brush like the originals do so they vibrate off while in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A terrible waste of money - the brush and the heads.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had a Sonicare since she was 4...  She has the model for kids her age.  As the dentist recommends, replace the brush head on a regular basis... I could have gone directly to the Phillips site, but I found a better deal on Amazon...  End of story!</li>
            <li> Love the brush head. Not the price. Way cheaper at Walmart.com</li>
            <li> Best brush for kids and the adult version can&#x27;t be beat. Kids love the way the brush beeps when it&#x27;s time to move to another spot in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Finally found what I need for the kids toothbrush! This is a 2 pack of the same size toothbrush head to fit the kids Sonicare toothbrush. It originally came with one small head and one large but I could not find that combo anywhere for replacement. Now I have an extra in this size</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years, but when my two boys each had a cavity at last year&#x27;s dentist visit, I immediately bought them their own. Not a single cavity since. We&#x27;re Sonicare users for life!</li>
            <li> The brush heads are very hard to get on and off the brush.  My old ones were not. My kids could even do it themselves.</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses Sonicare toothbrushes and we love them. I was please to find this set of replacement heads. A relatively good deal for something we always need more of!</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads, I just wish that they were not so expensive. I like the Sonicare line of products.</li>
            <li> This has nothing to with the seller. However, replacement heads should not be this expensive. I purchased compact and regular size brush heads. With the amount of money I paid, I could have purchased a new brush (of course the problem does not rectify it. Have to buy replacement heads sometime or the other).</li>
            <li> These work well but the price is outrageous.&lt;br /&gt;Basically they are sticking it to parents who need a smaller brush head for kids.&lt;br /&gt;Charging 50% more than the same 50 cents worth of plastic for adults, nice.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  Arrived quickly once ordered.  I don&#x27;t know what else I&#x27;m supposed to say to get the min. # of words!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old loves this toothbrush! The replacement brushes are just small enough for the small mouth she has. I the only bad thing is the price is quite high for the replacement bushes. But if your child uses this and the dental checkups come out great, (my kids sure do!!) it worth the cost.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are just like the ones shipped with the original product. They work great, have a good fit and last just as long.</li>
            <li> These are good but they were smaller than I expected. Smaller than the head on the brush I bought originally. Maybe it was for my fault for choosing the wrong size.&lt;br /&gt;As always, very good brand/product- however, just be mindful that this particular set is small, good enough for kids under 5. My son is 7, so these were definitely small. I kept them anyway, but will do better next time I order replacements.</li>
            <li> My son is almost 4 and this is exactly the same brush head that came with the toothbrush. Good price.</li>
            <li> Almost right away these were not working on the sonicare handle, they vibrate off when my son tries to use his toothbrush. I double checked the original brushes and they work fine with both of my children&#x27;s toothbrush handles, its definitely these new brushes...waste of good money.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush comes with a musical beep to remind you to move your tooth brush and also beeps when you are supposed to be done with brushing. Makes tooth brushing fun experience and my son loves it.</li>
            <li> The smaller head did not fit into the sonic base that I already have.  I guess I may have to buy a childs unit to be able to use the child size brush.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money. Philips sonicare brush heads are expensive compared to other brands. You can tell by looking at these brush heads that it is not expensive to manufacture them. Brush head is too soft and lost its shape after single use</li>
            <li> Love this brush teeth and the head that goes with it. The tooth are really clean after the 2 minutes time suggested. Much more efficient than a regular brush teeth. Doesn&#x27;t hurt but you have to teach your kid to use it gently on the gum.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes for the Sonicare for Kids are great.  They are a bit pricey, but much less expensive in the long run than cavities and multiple dental visits.</li>
            <li> Were exactly what I needed to replace lost brush heads for my son&#x27;s sonicare.  would highly recommend for others that need new brush heads</li>
            <li> Perfect for my daughters Sonicare.  She brushes for 2 minutes every single time!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> expensive but my kids needed them.  Over the life of your toothbrush you will buy about a dozen toothbrushes if you keep buying heads.  Heads are not cheap.  No issues with this.</li>
            <li> Great item, but they are just so darned expensive</li>
            <li> These are approx. $20 in many other retail stores! ...yes, and are the original ones.</li>
            <li> More importantly my 6 year old loves it.&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 replacement brush heads in this package. Both fit the children&#x27;s Sonicare perfectly.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this very hard to find replacement heads. Need the small size for kids to brush around braces.</li>
            <li> perfect replacements. I like this toothbrush for my two yr old. sometimes we turn it on, sometimes we don&#x27;t but he likes how colorful it is and when he&#x27;ll let me turn it on it does a very good job :)</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot but I think it is expensive. It makes my 5 year-old granddaughter like brushing her teeth!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush removed built on plaque that we couldn&#x27;t get off with other tooth brushes... it is SOOO worth the price to have some clean teeth kids</li>
            <li> My five year old has great dental checkups and I don&#x27;t spend hours trying to get his teeth clean.  I love the Sonicare Kids toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Brush heads work as advertised.  Its the only way to buy them.  You will not find them in stores for the kids versions.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and perfect replacement for kids toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The HX6032 Sonicare really made a difference in my kids brushing habits (became more of a game..6 and 3 years old) and it was affordable.  Where they get you is the replacement heads.  I&#x27;ll ay the price for good oral hygiene..just wish they were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> These smaller, softer replacement brushes are very difficult to find in stores.  Target used to carry them, but not anymore.  These are the perfect size for my 7 year old.</li>
            <li> My Kids (age 6 and 8) don&#x27;t mind using the sonic toothbrush. I love that they have a timer, so I know they are using it long enough. This set came with two brushes, I color coded one kid red, other blue.</li>
            <li> The kids and I have used Sonicare as long as I can remember; however, at times we get a toothbrush head that comes apart when I take it off the unit to clean it (about once or twice a week). I replace them every 4 months so it is not because they are old. They are pretty expensive to have this problem.</li>
            <li> This item was not specified as the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; heads only that it fit the Sonic care for kids, I needed the ones for older kids which is a slightly bigger head.  Since box was open I had to have my kids use them especially since they are quite expensive.  I caution buyers to be sure the heads they order are for the right age group of kid(s) that they are shopping for.</li>
            <li> These are replacement heads for a Sonicare Toothbrush.  They fit on the brush and work just as they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Kids&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves it&lt;br /&gt;And her dentist recommand it</li>
            <li> not the same as what came with unit</li>
            <li> Fit the Sonicare just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Simply awesome, wish they were not this expensive as it last less time than adults. I would recommend htis product.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using sonicare for several months and needed replacement heads.  This product was reasonably priced and what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> They work as advertised.  Fits my kid&#x27;s teeth which is important for good brushing.  I just wish they were more affordable.</li>
            <li> These do not stay on my daughters toothbrush - fly right off - I don&#x27;t think they are really Philips brand - probably a cheap copy</li>
            <li> Invest in they sonic care for your kid. I got tired of buying spin brushes e dry week as my ten two year old was obsessed with brushing her teeth.. This is a much better pet innate solution and I know her teeth are getting clean even if I only get one good sweep in</li>
            <li> Lasts three months and my kid brushes her teeth without complaint.  Can you expect any more?  Is it a little pricey?  Maybe, but piece of mind is worth something, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the HX6311 and am very happy with both products.  I use the adult version myself and am very happy with the Philips products.  A bit pricey, though.</li>
            <li> The kids Sonicare toothbrush is awesome. My daughter loves it and I am glad to find a 2 pack of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> If you have a child that hates brushing their teeth, this is the best invention ever.  It&#x27;s the best way to get their teeth very clean and fast. Very happy to find brush replacement heads online since the target near us used to carry them and now they don&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> We were searching for electric toothbrushes for our small children. We have tried many different cheaper $10 types and found that they were a one and done type of toothbrush. Once the battery needed replacement it was next to impossible to unscrew the flap where the battery is even with eye glass screw drivers. These brushes really clean well and the kids enjoy using them. We have been using the adult version for ten years and have no complaints. Great toothbrushes!</li>
