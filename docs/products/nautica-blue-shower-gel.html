            <li>Thank you for taking such good care of me.</li>
            <li>overall a good fragrance .</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li>This product arrived on scheduled, in sealed box, fresh condition.</li>
            <li>These colognes are easily worth 3 times the price I paid.</li>
            <li>i RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>The box it arrived in was more than enough.</li>
            <li>It has a more intense and seems to last longer.  </li>
            <li>On a long ride I would most likely wear another pair but for training rides these are fine.</li>
            <li>Large is slightly to large for me.</li>
            <li>and they really helped me choose this with out smelling it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the shape of bottle- not too practical to fit in mandated ziplocks for carryon baggage.</li>
            <li>I received my order in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>guess for $13 you cant complain to much</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s old school</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>i give it three stars only because the smell is very light&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>It has a very clean, fresh citrus base scent but is a bit more complex than Nautica Aqua Rush.  </li>

            <li> Doesnt last for long!!</li>
            <li> I just purchased Nautica Blue to go with the other Nautica scents I have.  </li>
            <li> Could be a little bigger for the price, but then again it is Nautica.</li>
            <li> I would go with N Blue and N Aqua Rush for everyday .  </li>
            <li> this is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Still, getting this size for a price less than 1/2 oz size at Walmart- sign me up.</li>
            <li> I would rather bottle be round or rectangular.</li>
            <li> This product has very little fragrance....</li>
            <li> pad is a little on the thin side</li>

            <li> Nice smelling and not over bearing. For the price it is a good cologn</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne st the last minute for my husband&#x27;s anniversary gift. This was his favorite part of his gift. It smells fantastic. The item arrived just in time. I was so pleased that I didn&#x27;t have yo purchase a box to wrap his gift. The box it arrived in was more than enough. All I added was decorative wrapping paper. Thank you for your dilligence.</li>
            <li> Good bibs for the money. I have a 34 inch waist and was worried that like all bicycling cloths that these would run small.&lt;br /&gt;The fact is that they run true to size. Large is slightly to large for me. They are fine but a medium would have fit better.&lt;br /&gt;The pad is a little on the thin side but ok also. On a long ride I would most likely wear another pair but for training rides these are fine.</li>
            <li> I thought I would get this for my boyfriend he needed a change he&#x27;s old school so he don&#x27;t like change but I just had to get this for him for the price wow plus I have Nautica blue for women so I figured I hope he likes it he loves it even if he don&#x27;t say it he wears it everyday to work so thanks for having a awsome price for this product</li>
            <li> use it for daily&lt;br /&gt;good as explained&lt;br /&gt;quality is good&lt;br /&gt;i bought it for my self and i love it</li>
            <li> This is a great light sent. Perfect for summer.i read the reviews and they really helped me choose this with out smelling it. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Nice, strong scent that can be noticed without drowning yourself in it. Could be a little bigger for the price, but then again it is Nautica.</li>
            <li> Good fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t come on too strong. I&#x27;d used the 1/2 oz travel size before, and was pleased with it. This product arrived on scheduled, in sealed box, fresh condition. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the shape of bottle- not too practical to fit in mandated ziplocks for carryon baggage.

            <li> I received my order in a very timely manner. I believe it was only 3 days after I ordered it. I had gotten the Nautica for my brother .He just loves it! It&#x27;s fragrance is wonderful and it seems to last all day. Thank you for taking such good care of me. I will definitely be back!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as described, smells great!</li>
            <li> Doesnt last for long!! Its decent smelling one.. Cannot be compared to the great perfumes. Could be gifted for someone who doesnt like over powering smells</li>
            <li> NICE PRESENTATION AND SMELL VERY NICE, GOOD FOR PRESENTS IN A NICE PRESENTATION. i RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH AND IT IS A GOOD DEAL</li>
            <li> I received the item yesterday and was very pleased with the item. I would  purchase more items from this company. Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was happy w my purchase and it came on time Im very satisfied thank you</li>
            <li> Nautica rules again!  I just purchased Nautica Blue to go with the other Nautica scents I have.  It has a very clean, fresh citrus base scent but is a bit more complex than Nautica Aqua Rush.  All the Nautica scents I have are 5 Star.  They get compliments by women every time I wear them. I would go with N Blue and N Aqua Rush for everyday .  I would opt for NVoyage for night time activities.  It has a more intense and seems to last longer.  These colognes are easily worth 3 times the price I paid. If you have to limit your choice of colognes , stick with Nautica products.  Kudos to Nautica.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scent for a Man and a fair amount for the price I paid for it. Over all I do like this product.</li>
            <li> i give it three stars only because the smell is very light&lt;br /&gt;but overall a good fragrance . guess for $13 you cant complain to much</li>
            <li> My husband loves this one!</li>
            <li> this is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> great price smell good</li>
            <li> I purchased for my husband.... he loved it, it has a very manly scent and at the same time a light sexy and sweet scent. very nice!!</li>
            <li> This product has very little fragrance....probably came from China,..A 1st class rip&#x3D;off. NOTHING LIKE WHAT YOU&#x27;D BUY OVER THE COUNTER.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, not too strong thou. It smells clean. I would recomend. Im almost finished with mines, and im plaing on getting anotherone</li>
