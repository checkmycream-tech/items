            <li>Great taste and leaves a fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it available from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This Cool Gel is not as good as the Pronamel</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Too many choices for the store to stock them all</li>
            <li>the best, just a personal preference.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to several friends and they also believe this is the best!</li>
            <li>Our favorite toothpaste .</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for many years and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>Clean your teeth!</li>
            <li>Be sure to purchase this one, as Sensodyne has many kinds and they are not all good for sensitive nerves.</li>
            <li>Works great for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I used before - doesn&#x27;t give a strong feeling of clean teeth, and I also need to use more of it.</li>
            <li>Most dentists will tell you that the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is the most gentle on your teeth.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, fair price, easy transaction, my thanks!</li>
            <li>I particularly like the cool gel as it leaves a nice after taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Among the several toothpaste choices they offer this cool mint gel appeals to me more than any other because it stays on the brush better, does not tend to be runny and the taste is great!</li>
            <li>What makes it special is the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I brushed my teeth and all was good with my mouth</li>
            <li>Have been using Sensodyne Cool Gel forever.</li>
            <li>Maybe we get jaded by infomercial-type advertising that exploits people&#x27;s weakness for the promise of a quick fix,</li>
            <li>My favorite Cool Gel as Sensodyne doesn&#x27;t stock it any longer where I live.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using sensodyne new fre years and the gel has been my favorite</li>
            <li>and i actually get it cheaper when using amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save, plus they make sure i don&#x27;t ever run out!  </li>
            <li>Colgate sensitive worked a lot better for me.</li>
            <li>Love the taste and my gums are no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>but now i can actually \\&quot;eat\\&quot; ice cream - who doesn&#x27;t want to be able to do that?  </li>
            <li>Much improved!</li>
            <li>I like the gel much better than the paste, but that is just personal preference.</li>
            <li>Very effective in making teeth and gums less sensitive.</li>
            <li>It certainly works for sensitivity, so all it&#x27;s not lost.</li>
            <li>Itr&#x27;s hard to get away from flouride, it&#x27;s everywhere, but not particularlly good for you.  </li>
            <li>Has worked very well for them.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff that much.</li>
            <li>My husband and I use it faithfully and it really helps.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>The only problem is, where do I store 4 full sized tubes of toothpaste?</li>
            <li>I like this particular one</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t  really believe it would help my sensitive teeth, but it did!  </li>
            <li>I tend to  have sensitive teeth, and it really does work to take that sensitivity away.  </li>
            <li>Really helps my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Cool gel is the only toothpaste I like and that truly works with my sensitive teeth without tasting pasty.  </li>
            <li>I live in a town with fluodated water, therefore I prefer unfloridated tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>my teeth are very sensitive</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>The only disatvange is the tooth paste hardens very fast.</li>
            <li>love this tooth past.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and frequently use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Cleans my sensitive teeth well.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff, I used it, &amp; the problem is fixed.</li>
            <li>used it for years and it helps my sensitive teeth to be less&lt;</li>
            <li>I recommend to all who have problems with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Our dentist recommended Sensodyne for our sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for whitening and deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>I love the thick gel cosisitancy, but Gelkam isn&#x27;t really intended for daily use.</li>
            <li>Its great for sensitive teeth and doesnt leave a bad aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a daily use gel toothpaste for sensitive teeth, and ran across this Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li>recommend this if you are having issues with cold, hot, or sweet drinks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just a few days of rubbing this paste on the sensitive tooth, my problem completely disappeared and I have not had any problems since!  </li>

            <li> recommend this if you are having issues with cold, hot, or sweet drinks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a few days of rubbing this paste on the sensitive tooth, my problem completely disappeared and I have not had any problems since!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying because other toothpastes don&#x27;t do anything for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Not sure why gel is so scarce in a sensitive formula, but I&#x27;m bored with paste and really thrilled to have found this.</li>
            <li> The freshly brushed feeling didn&#x27;t last very long at all.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago, I awoke one morning with a very sensitive upper front tooth.  </li>
            <li> so I will have it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does as is advertised and helps to eliminate the minor paid associated with your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone that has sensitivity to cold and hot as well as minor gum irritation.</li>
            <li> Also, the mint effect was pretty weak.  </li>
            <li> However, I know that I have used Sensodyne for a very long time and when I don&#x27;t use it, my teeth  hurt when I brush.  </li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to something in it and broke out in blisters and dry cracking on my lips and around mouth.  </li>
            <li> sure however, that whatever sensitivity-relieving product you purchase (whether Sensodyne or others) contains the active ingredient Potassium Nitrate (5%), which will fill in the areas in the tooth that are exposed to the cold elements.</li>
            <li> In addition, for some reason, it has become increasingly difficult to consistently find on the shelves of my local drug stores.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this any other way: It works.</li>
            <li> My teeth are less sensitive to cold when using this product daily.</li>
            <li> , I ALSO LIKE THE VALUE WHEN I CAN PURCHASE A FEW OF THEM TOGETHER AND PAY LESS</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was puzzled by this, as I had never had trouble with teeth sensitivity before, but on the advice of my Dad (a dentist)</li>
            <li> It takes a little while,and then one day you notice that you drank ice water without maneuvering it past that &amp;#34;tricky&amp;#34; tooth.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for years for teeth that are sensitive to cold.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to obtain any locally.</li>
            <li> Every so often my teeth get sensitive to cold drinks.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY sensitive teeth to the cold</li>
            <li> Hard to find gel sensodyne  on any shelf so sending for it solved that problem.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I used to get at least one a month, but since I started using this</li>
            <li> I hope at least that it will do its job in protecting from cavities.</li>
            <li> At least now, there are days at a time where I can make it through.</li>
            <li> I am legally blind, therefore have found the green colr easier to see.</li>
            <li> Each time a cold substance (even a rush of air) passed over that tooth, it would send a jolt of pain through my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth had been feeling sore almost all the time (bad news for a chronic ice cruncher).</li>
            <li> I switched to Sensodyne but was disappointed that I started having sensitivity issues again.  </li>
            <li> I HATE the taste of toothpaste.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This has got to be the best toothpaste I have found for sensitive teeth.  It is one of the only ones that is actually a gel and not a paste.  I have used it for years for teeth that are sensitive to cold.  This is a great product that I will probably use for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I have used a version of this product for years.  I tend to  have sensitive teeth, and it really does work to take that sensitivity away.  I particularly like the cool gel as it leaves a nice after taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I brushed my teeth and all was good with my mouth</li>
            <li> Can not find the GEL around me so I order it on Amazon every now and again and get 6 at a time. great flavor and I do not like paste so this GeL is the best</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I awoke one morning with a very sensitive upper front tooth.  Each time a cold substance (even a rush of air) passed over that tooth, it would send a jolt of pain through my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was puzzled by this, as I had never had trouble with teeth sensitivity before, but on the advice of my Dad (a dentist) I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days of rubbing this paste on the sensitive tooth, my problem completely disappeared and I have not had any problems since!  I now alternate brushing with this product and a better-tasting paste (the chalky taste is the one downside of Sensodyne) and that system seems to prevent any sensitivity from developing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure however, that whatever sensitivity-relieving product you purchase (whether Sensodyne or others) contains the active ingredient Potassium Nitrate (5%), which will fill in the areas in the tooth that are exposed to the cold elements.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste. Brusha, brusha, brusha. Clean your teeth! My teeth are less sensitive to cold when using this product daily.</li>
            <li> SENSODYNE IS THE BEST TOOTHPASTE FOR SENSITIVE TEETH. I LIKE THE GEL, I ALSO LIKE THE VALUE WHEN I CAN PURCHASE A FEW OF THEM TOGETHER AND PAY LESS THEN IF I WENT TO A REGULAR PHARMACY.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best. Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> It hurt my teeth. Colgate sensitive worked a lot better for me.</li>
            <li> i was extremely happy to hear about sensodyne!  my teeth are very sensitive but now i can actually \\&quot;eat\\&quot; ice cream - who doesn&#x27;t want to be able to do that?  i love it and i actually get it cheaper when using amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save, plus they make sure i don&#x27;t ever run out!  vicky reinebach</li>
            <li> Excellent product. What makes it special is the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; formula. Most dentists will tell you that the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is the most gentle on your teeth. I highly recommend this product for anyone with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Cleans my sensitive teeth well.</li>
            <li> Someone had told me using this toothpaste would make me stop getting canker sores. I used to get at least one a month, but since I started using this I think I may have gotten one in two years. Much improved!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sensodyne for years - it&#x27;s the only toothpaste that takes away the sensitivity of my teeth. This Cool Gel is not as good as the Pronamel I used before - doesn&#x27;t give a strong feeling of clean teeth, and I also need to use more of it. I hope at least that it will do its job in protecting from cavities. It certainly works for sensitivity, so all it&#x27;s not lost.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to something in it and broke out in blisters and dry cracking on my lips and around mouth.  EWW.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner. I&#x27;ve always heard about it. Maybe we get jaded by infomercial-type advertising that exploits people&#x27;s weakness for the promise of a quick fix, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can&#x27;t say this any other way: It works. I noticed a difference almost immediately. My teeth had been feeling sore almost all the time (bad news for a chronic ice cruncher). I bought this stuff, I used it, &amp; the problem is fixed. I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> My favorite Cool Gel as Sensodyne doesn&#x27;t stock it any longer where I live.</li>
            <li> I used Crest Sensitivity for years until they stopped making the variety I liked.  I switched to Sensodyne but was disappointed that I started having sensitivity issues again.  Also, the mint effect was pretty weak.  The freshly brushed feeling didn&#x27;t last very long at all.  I&#x27;ll be switching brands again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does as it is advertised.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dentist for my husband and son. Has worked very well for them.</li>
            <li> I live in a town with fluodated water, therefore I prefer unfloridated tooth paste.  I was unable to obtain any locally. I am legally blind, therefore have found the green colr easier to see. The only disatvange is the tooth paste hardens very fast.</li>
            <li> Hard to find gel sensodyne  on any shelf so sending for it solved that problem.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it for years and it helps my sensitive teeth to be less&lt;br /&gt;sensitive.</li>
            <li> Cool gel is the only toothpaste I like and that truly works with my sensitive teeth without tasting pasty.  I have tried others styles and brands but nothing gets close to this one.</li>
            <li> I HATE the taste of toothpaste. They changed the flavor of the one I was using for years (another Sensodyne). I tried a bunch, even different brands, and this was the only one I could stand. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it in the drugstore anymore! Too many choices for the store to stock them all, I guess. I loved that this came in a set of 4 so I will have it for a LONG time. The only problem is, where do I store 4 full sized tubes of toothpaste?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone that has sensitivity to cold and hot as well as minor gum irritation. This toothpaste does as is advertised and helps to eliminate the minor paid associated with your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Good value.</li>
            <li> It took me an hour to order.  I like to go w/natural ingredients when I can.  However, I know that I have used Sensodyne for a very long time and when I don&#x27;t use it, my teeth  hurt when I brush.  I like this particular one the best, just a personal preference.  My trade off is to not swallow any of the flouride!!  Itr&#x27;s hard to get away from flouride, it&#x27;s everywhere, but not particularlly good for you.  I recommend to all who have problems with sensitive teeth.  It really works.</li>
            <li> Ugh! I&#x27;ve been looking for this forever! I have very sensitive teeth and frequently use [[ASIN:B0013TTR4M GelKam]] on a couple of exposed roots. I love the thick gel cosisitancy, but Gelkam isn&#x27;t really intended for daily use. So I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a daily use gel toothpaste for sensitive teeth, and ran across this Sensodyne.  This stuff tastes great and makes my mouth feel brisk, clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still get flair-ups that require a few days of Gelkam, but this Sensodyne has really helped a lot. At least now, there are days at a time where I can make it through. And the Gelkam is just for maintenance, like it was intended. Not sure why gel is so scarce in a sensitive formula, but I&#x27;m bored with paste and really thrilled to have found this. Actually, I take a lot of Rx meds that cause dry-mouth, and a &#x27;paste&#x27; toothpaste is the LAST thing I want or need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line - I may never use another toothpaste.  I like this stuff that much. Happy! ;oD</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended Sensodyne for our sensitive teeth. My husband and I use it faithfully and it really helps. It&#x27;s the only one we use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothgel for about five years now and alll I got to say is it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste on the market for sensitive teeth. I have recommended this product to several friends and they also believe this is the best! I would like to see this offered in a travel size.</li>
            <li> Our favorite toothpaste .</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste for nerve exposure.  Be sure to purchase this one, as Sensodyne has many kinds and they are not all good for sensitive nerves.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have sensitive teeth and this has been our go to for toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Have been using Sensodyne Cool Gel forever. Love the taste and my gums are no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li> Great taste and leaves a fresh feeling.  Whitens teeth too.  A good choice of toothpaste that you&#x27;ll be pleased to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, excellent product</li>
            <li> I have used Sensodyne for over 15 years. Among the several toothpaste choices they offer this cool mint gel appeals to me more than any other because it stays on the brush better, does not tend to be runny and the taste is great! In addition, for some reason, it has become increasingly difficult to consistently find on the shelves of my local drug stores. I was delighted to find it available from Amazon. Now I no longer have to visit several local sources to find it.</li>
            <li> Really helps my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Every so often my teeth get sensitive to cold drinks. Thank heavens it is not all the time but when it happens I start brushing with Sensodyne toothpaste and it really works. It takes about a week or two but the sensitivity begins to diminish and eventually stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended this to me years ago and I always have some on hand. I don&#x27;t have to use it all the time as my sensitivity does go away but if I had to use this toothpaste all the time I wouldn&#x27;t mind. It works well, cleans my teeth properly and will freshen your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this if you are having issues with cold, hot, or sweet drinks!</li>
            <li> Happy with buying experience.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY sensitive teeth to the cold and I have to say that Sensodyne does nothing to help</li>
            <li> I like the taste and it definitely helps to reduce tooth sensitivity. It doesn&#x27;t do much for whitening and deep cleaning. I use it with an electric toothbrush. I guess it&#x27;s a tradeoff between deep cleaning and fixing sensitivity. I&#x27;ll keep buying because other toothpastes don&#x27;t do anything for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Works great for sensitive teeth.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  Wish I could still get it in the store.</li>
            <li> Overpriced and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in the sensitivity of my teeth.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this brand.  Does the job for her.  :0)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sensodyne new fre years and the gel has been my favorite but it&#x27;s hard to find.  Amazon has it and at a great price!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great.  Its great for sensitive teeth and doesnt leave a bad aftertaste.  I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for many years and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It is what it is.  What can I say?  It is a good toothpaste at a good price through Subscribe and Save program.</li>
            <li> Very effective in making teeth and gums less sensitive.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist.  I didn&#x27;t  really believe it would help my sensitive teeth, but it did!  It takes a little while,and then one day you notice that you drank ice water without maneuvering it past that &amp;#34;tricky&amp;#34; tooth.  I like the gel much better than the paste, but that is just personal preference.</li>
            <li> love this tooth past. after a sensitivity issue 15 years age  this toothpast was recommended. never had the problem again.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Totally worth it</li>
            <li> fast shipping, fair price, easy transaction, my thanks!</li>
