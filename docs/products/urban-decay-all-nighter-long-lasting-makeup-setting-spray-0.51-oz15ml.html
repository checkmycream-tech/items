            <li>This is great!</li>
            <li>I got this for a wedding party I was doing, the bride&#x27;s makeup stayed on beautifully all night!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>Perfect travel size or as a way to test this excellent UD product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard really great things about this setting spray</li>
            <li>I was extremely impressed at how light this product is, and kept my makeup flawless.</li>
            <li>This is so freaking amazing!</li>
            <li>I have never had a product as good as this one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help my makeup to look good for longer than 6 or 7 hours.  </li>
            <li>and she lasted gorgeous all night</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>Great for special events or weddings.</li>
            <li>I ran all day in the humidity and all day it looked like I just did my make up. :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Makes my makeup set in and makes my face look smoother and more even.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love eyeliner</li>
            <li>This sure seems fishy to me....</li>
            <li>It makes me more shiny, &amp; I don&#x27;t feel as it my makeup stays in place.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but wanted to try it before I went out for a night of dancing.</li>
            <li>but I have not been able to help it.</li>
            <li>; review yet :)</li>
            <li>But overall it is a great product</li>
            <li>I bought it since it was such a great price</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, my makeup looks fresh by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It feels super light while on</li>
            <li>You should not spend 16+ dollars on this outrageously tiny bottle-No matter how good it works.</li>
            <li>I loved this magic spray so much that I went right out to buy the big bottle.</li>
            <li>Ive tried this one and another brand to help me with my super oily skin.</li>
            <li>Its ok doesnt work as well as I would hope but its decent.</li>
            <li>but my makeup was picture perfect the next AM and even left it on during our flight to our honeymoon destination.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight, goes on easily.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth a re-purchase though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that worth it.</li>
            <li>I work 12 hour shifts and my makeup looks just as fresh at the end of the day as it does when I apply it.</li>
            <li>This ALL Nighter Long Lasting Spray is reallly good!</li>
            <li>Sure enough there was nothing on my glove and my makeup was still on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first ordered Model in a Bottle and that didn&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li>I would love a product that actually helps makeup stick.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, and didn&#x27;t say anything and</li>
            <li>Really !</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty humid here.  </li>
            <li>I love this product by Urban Decay, once I used it I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, as it was my first time using a finishing spray, but I do not like it at all.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure Urban Decay would package there product a little better than this</li>
            <li>What I received in the mail looks like what is pictured but the bottle is super flimsy,  half full,  and the sticker label is top big for the bottle</li>
            <li>I tried it a week before my wedding when it was very humid out</li>
            <li>although bottle is very tine</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It really does set your make up.</li>
            <li>Just had to let you all know the hype is real.</li>
            <li>And, while most of the makeup still looks ok, the creases around my nose and mouth gather oil much worse than they do without the setting spray.  </li>
            <li>Have only used it a couple of times, and so far it seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this product, but I was disappointed that it was the smallest size.</li>
            <li>I only use mine for special occasions</li>
            <li>and I use the full size version daily.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, and small bottle is great if you only need a little bit for special occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Someone with a lovely black shirt gave me a hug at Thanksgiving.</li>
            <li>with that being said, I realllly recommend this product to anyone who wants a glowing, clear face.</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t disappointed it&#x27;s great !</li>
            <li>so that is where I continue to get it, but is your trying it for the first time you may want to purchase it from Amazon to ensure that you like it before you go paying $45.00 on it in a larger bottle at a retail or department store.</li>
            <li>my older sister says WOW, your skin is so clear today and glowing...</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see my makeup well foundation in place ..</li>
            <li>it really makes my makeup last longer.  </li>
            <li>but if I use a primer first then put my makeup on and then spray this product on my face and let it dry</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s hot spotlights and not much time to touch up</li>
            <li>I use moisturizer, then bare minerals makeup then spray this two or three times.  </li>
            <li>I have a MAC Pink sparkly blush and I apply it on my cheeks before spraying, after, it just brings out my whole face</li>
            <li>] I can barely stand to wear my makeup after about 3 hours.  </li>
            <li>Tonight I went ahead and ordered directly from the Urban Decay website the XL 6.0 oz bottle All-Nighter spray for $18 on sale.</li>
            <li>My oily skin wins the battle though and after a few hours of being out and about my make up comes off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this several times now and am getting the jitters of fear of this small bottle going empty when I need it most.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I find the size and price to be a little too much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Small for 11 dollars!!</li>
            <li> My skin is especially worse in the summer because of extreme humidity.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s just too expensive for not doing what&#x27;s promised.  </li>
            <li> But hey I might be wrong,  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything :(</li>
            <li> It just feels awful on my skin.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very lightweight, goes on easily. I tried it a week before my wedding when it was very humid out and my make up stayed put! I ran all day in the humidity and all day it looked like I just did my make up. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard really great things about this setting spray and I&#x27;ve used it on a number of occasions since I purchased it. Whether I&#x27;m at a dance, the beach, or in humind weather, this spray kept my makeup in place. If you use it everyday, you&#x27;ll probably run out in a matter of weeks. I only use mine for special occasions and I still have a bunch left.</li>
            <li> This is great! I must have for any foundation wearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this...&lt;br /&gt;I put on some black gloves, and rubbed them on my cheek. Sure enough there was nothing on my glove and my makeup was still on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before... I would hug people and leave a orange mark on their shirts.</li>
            <li> I first ordered Model in a Bottle and that didn&#x27;t do anything.  I then ordered this.  Same issue - it didn&#x27;t do anything.  I would love a product that actually helps makeup stick.  And it&#x27;s just too expensive for not doing what&#x27;s promised.  I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin in the way of no issues with T-zone, or too oily or too dry.  I use moisturizer, then bare minerals makeup then spray this two or three times.  It just doesn&#x27;t do what&#x27;s been advertised.  I&#x27;m moving on to the next one....</li>
            <li> I bought the smallest bottle just to test it out and I&#x27;m pleased. Makes my makeup set in and makes my face look smoother and more even.</li>
            <li> I used this once with 2sprays and went to work I work at medieval times  so there&#x27;s hot spotlights and not much time to touch up make up. I use Mac makeup but it does only last before I start looking worn I was surprised to see my makeup well foundation in place ..although bottle is very tine it did the job will order again</li>
            <li> Ive tried this one and another brand to help me with my super oily skin. My skin is especially worse in the summer because of extreme humidity. I use this and it helps keep my makeup in place for hours. My oily skin wins the battle though and after a few hours of being out and about my make up comes off. But overall it is a great product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This ALL Nighter Long Lasting Spray is reallly good! I am fifteen and I like the Kim Kardashian GLOW! After I apply all of my foundation and blush I spray at least two sprays to my face and let it dry. The first time I used it, and didn&#x27;t say anything and my older sister says WOW, your skin is so clear today and glowing...how did you do that? ALSO, it kept my makeup on the ENTIREEEE DAY!!!!!!! I have never had a product as good as this one. I got the small one, and when it runs out I will be getting the tall one. Anyways. with that being said, I realllly recommend this product to anyone who wants a glowing, clear face. I have a MAC Pink sparkly blush and I apply it on my cheeks before spraying, after, it just brings out my whole face and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help my makeup to look good for longer than 6 or 7 hours.  I use a primer, and that helps, but not quite enough, especially around my nose.  With the [[ASIN:B003JNQV7G Urban Decay All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray 4 oz]] I can barely stand to wear my makeup after about 3 hours.  It just feels awful on my skin.  And, while most of the makeup still looks ok, the creases around my nose and mouth gather oil much worse than they do without the setting spray.  Overall, I am not a fan of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Really ! Do your makeup in the AM and the only thing you need to reapply is lipstick after you eat. What a find !</li>
            <li> This is so freaking amazing! I live in the Caribbean it&#x27;s pretty humid here.  So I wanted something that could help keep my makeup where it was supposed to be... my face!  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed it&#x27;s great ! I love eyeliner now I can wear it even on the hottest days!  I can&#x27;t wait to try it on Halloween with all the makeup.  The only thing is that I find the size and price to be a little too much but it&#x27;s so worth it I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> This sure seems fishy to me.... I bought it since it was such a great price but I think I know why. What I received in the mail looks like what is pictured but the bottle is super flimsy,  half full,  and the sticker label is top big for the bottle so it sticks up on the edges. Pretty sure Urban Decay would package there product a little better than this so I don&#x27;t dare even use it to see if it works or not. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.... But hey I might be wrong,  maybe it is legit and I&#x27;m just being paranoid.  Im still not giving it a try though!</li>
            <li> I love this product by Urban Decay, once I used it I was hooked.  I&#x27;ve found that Ulta sells it so that is where I continue to get it, but is your trying it for the first time you may want to purchase it from Amazon to ensure that you like it before you go paying $45.00 on it in a larger bottle at a retail or department store.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price. You should not spend 16+ dollars on this outrageously tiny bottle-No matter how good it works. I regret my purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this for a wedding party I was doing, the bride&#x27;s makeup stayed on beautifully all night! It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin but if I use a primer first then put my makeup on and then spray this product on my face and let it dry it really makes my makeup last longer.  I will be buying a bigger bottle.  I have also tried other spays and this one mist your face and I like it.  Some others I&#x27;ve tried it&#x27;s like spraying perfume in your face and it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. It really does set your make up. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth a re-purchase though. Just use primer.</li>
            <li> Its ok doesnt work as well as I would hope but its decent. Small for 11 dollars!! I would maybe recommend it</li>
            <li> Perfect travel size or as a way to test this excellent UD product. I play roller derby and this makes my makeup last through entire bouts (and crazy afterparties). It feels super light while on and I use the full size version daily.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product, but I was disappointed that it was the smallest size. I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not reading though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, as it was my first time using a finishing spray, but I do not like it at all. It seems to leaving a shiny film, comparable to if I just sprayed hairspray on my face. It makes me more shiny, &amp; I don&#x27;t feel as it my makeup stays in place. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but maybe that&#x27;s a look some people like?</li>
            <li> I purchased the tiny travel size of this for $17 at Sephora. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but wanted to try it before I went out for a night of dancing. I&#x27;ve used this several times now and am getting the jitters of fear of this small bottle going empty when I need it most. This product definitely works. Someone with a lovely black shirt gave me a hug at Thanksgiving. My cheek brushed their shirt and I glanced to see the dreaded cream smudge of foundation on their shoulder. Nothing! Whew...relief! I&#x27;ve gone hiking several times these last few weeks, as well as and intensive 4 hour dance bootcamp and late nights out. Nothing! Another tell-tale sign this is working is after I finish talking on my iphone there is always some foundation or tinted sunscreen stuck to the shiny flat screen when my cheek rests there. Gross, I know but I have not been able to help it. Since using All-Nighter this doesn&#x27;t happen anymore. What&#x27;s more, my makeup looks fresh by the end of the day. Tonight I went ahead and ordered directly from the Urban Decay website the XL 6.0 oz bottle All-Nighter spray for $18 on sale. It&#x27;s that worth it. Amazon has it, too. Just had to let you all know the hype is real. Try the small size and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> This product make my makeup stay on even when ur out all night partying it does stay on so I like it</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything :(</li>
            <li> Have only used it a couple of times, and so far it seems to work ok.  Can&#x27;t give a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; review yet :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding to set my makeup. I was extremely impressed at how light this product is, and kept my makeup flawless. I have combination/oily skin, and was worried it would increase the oil, however it did not. I admit, I broke the sacred rule of falling asleep without taking makeup off..but my makeup was picture perfect the next AM and even left it on during our flight to our honeymoon destination.  This set my makeup for over 18 hours. Well worth the price, and small bottle is great if you only need a little bit for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, one of my attendants had tried this previously, and it does not appear to work well with mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> Your makeup will last all night. Great for special events or weddings. I used for a bride make up and she lasted gorgeous all night</li>
            <li> I loved this magic spray so much that I went right out to buy the big bottle. I think its cheaper in stores than online though. Sets my makeup and makes my face look dewy. I work 12 hour shifts and my makeup looks just as fresh at the end of the day as it does when I apply it.</li>
