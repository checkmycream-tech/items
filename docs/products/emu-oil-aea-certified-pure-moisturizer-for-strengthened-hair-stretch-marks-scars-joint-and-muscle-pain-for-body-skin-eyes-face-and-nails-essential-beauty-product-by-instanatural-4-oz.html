            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than anti-aging creams for the face.</li>
            <li>When I recieved this oil, I wasn&#x27;t really sure how I was going to use it.</li>

            <li>this will be most helpful.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found myself using it more as a moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li>I have used Emu Oil for months now, I still use Argan Oil, too but more often the Emu Oil.  </li>
            <li>Great product ,  neutral smell and dries fast .  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to have read what others said about it and tried it.</li>
            <li>So many oils sit on top and stay sticky which doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>A better design would be to have an indented top of the pump</li>
            <li>I have a number of friends now also using it for a variety of purposes and also love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been enjoying the emu oil for its healing properties and its soothing effects on my skin.</li>

            <li>So, I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect from this</li>
            <li>I love how light this is!</li>
            <li>It could be better.</li>

            <li>I really do love all InstaNatural products you get so much more in them than many higher priced beauty products</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so true!</li>
            <li>I tried all the other Emu oils on Amazon and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li>So I‚Äôm thrilled to introduce to you my ‚ÄúInstaNatural 100% Pure Emu Oil Review!‚Äù</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild as well.</li>
            <li>I received this from the seller very quickly.</li>
            <li>I asked a couple of questions and got replies very quickly.</li>
            <li>and i break out easily.  </li>
            <li>After one night I saw a markable difference in how my skin looks - also healed some blemishes and reduced redness very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a great oil and can be used for so many different things!  </li>
            <li>It is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>I would like to add, that her doctor said she might have a very mild case of eczema.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also it absorbs very quickly so you can put it on in the evening and the morning.</li>
            <li>have bought multiple bottles, this stuff is great for hair and skin :)</li>
            <li>I like the pump on the bottle for easy application.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It rubs in my skin easily without greasy feeling remaining.</li>
            <li>I actually use it most on my hair as a styling product and it&#x27;s great for cuticles.</li>
            <li>glides on easily &amp; keeps the moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li>Not oily, drys easily.</li>
            <li>It works great, universal for so many things.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have strong smell</li>
            <li>I do strongly recommend you trying emu oil.  </li>
            <li>The emu oil is natural and safe, and we have found it to be a good alternative for lessening the symptoms associated with psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with InstaNatural pure emu oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been healing my acne scars, along with keeping my face feeling healthy and moisturized for a full 24 hour period.</li>
            <li>Being I had just received it that day as a promotional rate to review and leave my honest opinion, is the reason I used it for that first.  </li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs very quickly, and has almost no odor that I can detect.</li>
            <li>Smells just fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t vouch for the fine lines yet</li>
            <li>The product didn&#x27;t do what I was hoping it would do for my hair (reduce thinning) after 6 months of use, but otherwise it is a fine product for moisturizing etc.  </li>
            <li>Too oily for fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it absorbs very quickly and leaves my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even started using the product on my hair and find my hair looks much less damaged, really impressive.</li>
            <li>Not oily, not dry,  Just balanced and happy.  </li>

            <li>SPECIAL MY FOOT</li>
            <li>I love that InstaNatural uses pure oil, so I do not have to worry about any toxins getting into his skin via any cuts or scrapes.  </li>
            <li>B00JX979CQ instanatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Ultra Premium Emu Oil]], I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about it.</li>

            <li>Is very light and absorbs super fast and won&#x27;t leave you that sticky feeling like all the others I tried.  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s not all that attractive when it&#x27;s slathered on your face, though; it&#x27;s definitely &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>but as for a natural moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it has worked wonders; my scalp and hair is no longer dry.&lt;br /&gt;My story with this amazing all NATURAL Emu oil began when I bought a shampoo from a seller which damaged my hair and broke it.</li>
            <li>The additional AMAZING benefits that surprised me was the THICKNESS; &amp;#34;MY HAIR BECAME THICKER, STRONGER, AND BEGAN TO</li>
            <li>So far this emu oil is amazing</li>
            <li>I like this emu oil, and it works great on the skin, not much on the hair.</li>
            <li>so far amazing wonder&#x27;s on my feets and legs</li>
            <li>Good moisturizing oil, especially for winter months.</li>
            <li>Love this oil, penetrates fast, no oily feel.</li>
            <li>Thanks s lot will soon be ordering couple more.</li>
            <li>I will purchase from this company again, as they have a nice collection of products in their line and those that I&#x27;ve tried so far, work well for me.</li>
            <li>I love the oil, actually my whole family do.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t try it on my hair but it does work nicely on my legs - makes the skin soft and glowing...</li>
            <li>I was in so much pain) and works infinitely better than Aloe Vera (also burned for 10+ minutes).  </li>
            <li>Secondly, so many lotions seem to really bother her skin.</li>
            <li>I loved the extra steps this company took to insure my liking of their products.</li>
            <li>I have been using Emu oil for some time, but I was looking for a more reasonable price and liked what the insta natural reviews and that it is 100% Emu oil.  </li>
            <li>Emu oil seems to be very healing and can help many skin ailments.</li>
            <li>Four ounces lasts a good while, even with daily use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that this is non-greasy and unscented.</li>
            <li>I have tried (and loved) several products from InstaNatural, so I took a chance on their ultra premium emu oil.</li>
            <li>However, below is the full email that I sent to AJ, the Founder of InstaNatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about my experience with emu oil.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s good for my skin too, I will order from the same seller again</li>
            <li>We love it and use it as much as we use the argon oil they both came together.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to think when I saw &amp;#34;Emu Oil&amp;#34; because, let&#x27;s face it -- it sounds highly suspect!</li>
            <li>This Emu oil is so good to my skin and especially to the heels of my feet.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizers my face without looking over the top oily.</li>
            <li>and I guess smells like it, not bad just wierd</li>
            <li>This oil works great on my dry skin and hair!!</li>
            <li>I noticed faster drying time less fly aways and my hair felt thicker  and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 81 year old mother after a friend of hers said it was the best thing for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>leaves your skin feeling nice and soft and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>So thrilled to receive this product as a slight discount so that I could take a chance on it and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>super fast delivery..:)</li>
            <li>The entire family is very happy, they have a beautiful playground for the children, and there are at least 43 emus (and counting) in this particular clan.</li>
            <li>Works great order it every other month</li>
            <li>and I picked this brand because of the other great reviews.</li>
            <li>I am so happy as with the winter season fast approaching,.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs quickly and didn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling too greasy.</li>
            <li>and it is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Received my purchase quickly.</li>
            <li>I received my package fairly quick</li>
            <li>I am so grateful this Emu Oil was recommended to me and that Amazon delivered it to me so quickly.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews, but I just had to write about what an awesome product for treating skin ailments this is in case it would help someone else.</li>
            <li>I bought it to use with essential oils and it blended nicely and really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s super moisturizing</li>
            <li>Came quick and on time.</li>
            <li>Even though it goes on oily, it penetrates skin quickly.</li>
            <li>It is anti inflammatory and heals wounds quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This oil has so many benefits, but the main use for me is on my hands and nails.</li>
            <li>Its not sticky, super oily like baby oil or tanning oil.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>really love how one oil can be used for so many different purposes!</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the smell fades quickly, but the effect does not.  </li>
            <li>Quick service, packed well and the product is just as advertised.</li>
            <li>She has thinner hair and a bit of eczema and both have been tremendously improved with EmuOil.</li>
            <li>quick absorb, I use it on my hand, I can continue working on my computer</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin which is a plus because my husband hates what he calls the greasy feel of lotions.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a product work so quickly and efficiently on his skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was quick and bottle was bubble wrapped and secured well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since using Emu oil, I have noticed a big difference in my skin, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for myself and this is the only product</li>
            <li>I did but it has a scent that dissipates quickly but takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>This stuff has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Packaged well and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Emu oil absorbs quickly and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li>My skin is super prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had high hopes, but I read in many of these reviews that it works for others and</li>
            <li>I found the emu oil to leave a more oily texture than my favorite argan oil, but it also seemed to moisturize a little better.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I also use it as my hair oil, which is precisely why I purchased it in the first place.</li>
            <li>Generally speaking, it is working just as well as the Rose hip seed oil has.</li>
            <li>I will be using this product and others by Instanatural for years to come, God willing, and I hope these products remain available.</li>
            <li>The price is good as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>One of the main things I liked with this product is that there isn&#x27;t much scent going on.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the oil and the personalized service.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li>This stuff is my new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new moisturizer, and saw how many people ranked this 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Very light and soothing, but not super effective in stopping the itching.</li>
            <li>But I am very impressed by the moisture and long lasting moisture at that!</li>
            <li>The push pump dispenser is a good way to get a small amount, much better than another brand that we tried.  </li>
            <li>It feels very lightweight and absorbs into your skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>If does that good on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Good product for dry skin, nails, hair, etc...</li>
            <li>But this, like all the other InstaNatural products that I&#x27;ve tried is amazing!</li>
            <li>I‚Äôve used several instaNatural products and I love them all!</li>
            <li>I am so in love with insta natural!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hello, I am Crystal and I am absolutely in love with Insta Natural Emu Oil !  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s the first thing I reach for!  </li>
            <li>I love finding all natural products that work!</li>
            <li>Works really well!!</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of strong scent so this one is ok it doesn‚Äôt have any scent.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin, and have found that most moisturizers I use just almost sit on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It really help provide great moisture on my heels where they normally dry out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fragrance free, blends easily, does not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¶i think better than others because it is not greasy and absorbs quickly leaving soft skin and hair.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive fair skin and have never had a problem with any of the insta natural products.  </li>
            <li>Great consistency, sinks in quickly, and my nails, hands and hair are starting too look better.</li>
            <li>It works amazing on aches and pains in hands, knees, back, shoulders, feet and where ever needed.</li>
            <li>This Emu Oil is completely fragrance free, which is a Huge bonus for me and my husband.  </li>
            <li>short this product is amazing and a must have.</li>
            <li>Great Product....have been using it for a few weeks and already saw results....</li>
            <li>I really did enjoy using the emu oil this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bath her in oatmeal and baking soda to calm her skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a deeply penetrating oil and the scent is nice.  </li>
            <li>Easily absorbed by face.  </li>
            <li>Easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>just under a month I used on hair to seal in moisture its great for that it left my hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not heavy on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have  been trying different products to find a moisturizer that i liked.  </li>
            <li>I love how InstaNatural products are all natural</li>
            <li>my mother, I get those thick cracked heels, no matter what kind of shoes, no matter what kind of treatment.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell for sure</li>
            <li>I have had healing success with it.</li>
            <li>but you are allergic or sensitive to most face creams</li>
            <li>Even the strongest hydro cortisone cream doesn&#x27;t help though, but I thought it was worth</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>it was so worth the money and</li>
            <li>So far, I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed and maintains softening effect throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>The Argan is a far better moisturizer for the skin.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it....</li>
            <li>Natural Emu Oil has replaced most of the products on our changing table.</li>
            <li>Was sent a complimentary bottle for being a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>Leaving it on a couple hours prior to washing &amp; it does a nice job moisturizing it.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural goes through the process to ensure that their emu oil is safe, and completely sterile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rave reviews on Amazon convinced me that this Emu Oil was worth a try</li>
            <li>All reviewers on Amazon agree that this is a useful product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received two emails from this company, simply check-ins to see how I liked my product.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying my old moisturizer again, emu oil works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have so far used it for the latter two purposes and it has worked very nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff and while it has many different uses, I have mainly used this on my daughter&#x27;s upper arm.</li>
            <li>fibromyalgia emu oil is great for my stiff, crampy muscles and joints.</li>
            <li>Feels a bit oily at first but quickly soaks into your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like an oil/cream at first, but it absorbs so quickly that it isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is also good for other purposes as well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping; Great product; Comes in dark bottle to keep in fresh.</li>
            <li>This one comes in a nicer container, but it&#x27;s not as good as some other Emu oil</li>
            <li>Clears up dryness right away.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for my right knee and</li>
            <li>I received my item right away, well packaged</li>
            <li>I started using this product particularly on my right knee</li>
            <li>I massage it into my skin right after i take a shower</li>
            <li>Anyway, it soaked right into my hands.  </li>
            <li>With all these opportunities to test our this oil, I started right away.  </li>
            <li>This product intrigued me and they sent it right away.  </li>
            <li>now I got the right one &amp; the packing</li>
            <li>It actually rubs in well, absorbs quickly just like they claim, which makes it easy to put on after I shower and my skin be clean and non oily when I put my clothing on.  </li>
            <li>The product is TOP notch, it comes in a dark brown glass bottle, you get a lot for your money , there&#x27;s a convenient dispenser top</li>
            <li>I have OK skin texture to start with, but I do have some light age spots and minor Redness.  </li>
            <li>The oil is very easy to rub into your skin and there is no gross greasy feeling once applied.</li>
            <li>Emu oil is supposed to be good for hair growth, but I recently learned that it has to be applied generously nightly, then washed the following day, repeating the process for several weeks in order to get good results.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a strong smell which is good because lots of 100% pure oils have a raw scent to them.</li>
            <li>Though, I do find I don&#x27;t really use it that often in the month I have had it, I find nothing really special about it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to reapply it after using it, it absorbs quickly &amp; just like that, smooth, soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>Her hair is super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends and family as it really feels good on dry skin.</li>
            <li>When I started using Emu Oil he was quick to notice it was a similar love affair to that of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I normal use it in the spring, fall and  summer because it is so light on my face ( replace my face cream) and body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great make up remover (then cleanse face as usual), I&#x27;ve also used it on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try because it said good for dark marks and acne.</li>
            <li>I went through my first bottle so quickly and am excited to get a new bottle.</li>
            <li>Go light and easy, especially the first time.</li>
            <li>The best benefit that I have found from using the Emu oil is that my legs aren&#x27;t as dry as normal, and I can actually shave faster and easier without nicking myself as often.  </li>
            <li>It is indeed soothing, the healing ability for inflammation, redness and other skin irritation is exceptional.</li>
            <li>First, it seems oily but its like his skin just sucked it right up within seconds</li>
            <li>This bottle is large!</li>
            <li>It gives hair a soft touch, manageable, easy to comb feel and also moisturizes the scalp.</li>
            <li>but it is dry effective at keeping skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>It really did help tremendously in my healing.</li>
            <li>It is whitish in color as it suppose to be, very oily, yet absorbs into the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Works well as a moisturizer, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t really leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>The emu oil I got was fresh, a light clear to cream color, and was labeled as being 100%</li>
            <li>I had purchased another brand at the same time, but this one is far superior.</li>
            <li>so now I&#x27;m using it on my own dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like that this product absorbs so quickly</li>
            <li>My face soaks it in so nicely, but not to the point where I feel like I&#x27;m still dry.</li>
            <li>I rubbed this oil on and my skin soaked it right in making it feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Shipped very fast, too.</li>
            <li>and I very much like them all.</li>
            <li>It is very very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase and use this product and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my face under my makeup, and it doesn&#x27;t take very much at all, I have also been trying it on my hair like some of the reviews</li>
            <li>thank you for offering a quality product and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This oil very gently nourishes your skin and hair so that it can repair itself and stay moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and does not leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, there&#x27;s a good brand from Montana Ranch that&#x27;s about twice as much</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than other brands, lasts a long time and works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally soothing on a hangnail, and makes my cuticles super easy to push back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good and is working on my thin edges which beginning to get thicker</li>
            <li>I had shingles for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li>A couple very liberal applications and the shingles were GONE!</li>
            <li>I have tried and researched many Emu products for the last seven years.  </li>
            <li>Use on face and neck...keeps skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have to say most people don&#x27;t care to follow up consistently with items that they are selling but the service here is undeniably terrific!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Argan Oil and was turned on to Emu Oil about eight months and really enjoyed my experience with it.  </li>
            <li>Although i am from Australia and there&#x27;s supossed to be heaps of Emu oil, this is my first time using Emu Oil.</li>
            <li>I used almond oil before, but Emu oil is definitely different and more moisturising but not sticky.</li>
            <li>I like this product, most creams promote skin problems, especially oily skin</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Emu Oil.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>They are willing to go above and beyond to make sure you are content with your experience of their product.  </li>
            <li>Just starting using it, I can&#x27;t wait to see more results.</li>
            <li>Funny story</li>
            <li>Better to know exactly what you are using than what comes off the shelves in the big retail stores</li>
            <li>Initially, I was so pleased with this oil.</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>I love this oil,I use it at night and morning, one pump is enough.</li>
            <li>The results were instant for her knees, she feels better.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.....</li>
            <li>I will be buying more each time I run short.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner and will report back if there is anything noteworthy.  :-)</li>
            <li>first thing in the morning and by nighttime my face would begin to itch</li>
            <li>The first time I used this oil, my skin felt immediately softer.</li>
            <li>so sometimes I use the Emu Oil first and follow with a scented lotion.</li>
            <li>and I only love the feel.</li>
            <li>Thanks Phil!</li>
            <li>They really care about their customers!</li>
            <li>and I find it refreshing at the same time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bottle</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use this emu oil.</li>
            <li>The packaging is exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li>The Pure Emu Oil is quite emollient and seems to soak right into the skin.</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying the EMU Oil</li>
            <li>so can be applied just by itself or mixed with your favorite butter (coco.</li>
            <li>My first bottle arrived leaking &amp; I emailed the seller with my concerns.</li>
            <li>sure enough, I started noticing redness under my bust.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love how it hydrates my skin after facial scrubs.</li>
            <li>When I first read that this was Emu oil</li>
            <li>After reading up about it, I learned that it can be used in so many different ways.</li>
            <li>Because I wanted to make sure that it was the Emu Oil that was making the difference, I chose two specific places to apply it.</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed, which I really like.</li>
            <li>I first used Emu oil over 5 months ago</li>
            <li>The healthy benefits of emu oil actually aid the body at all levels.</li>
            <li>find that emu oil can be effective for a wide range of applications</li>
            <li>find that emu oil can be effective for a wide range of applications</li>
            <li>I prefer to open the bottle and use a cue tip to spread the oil on my leg which allows me a better control of where the oil lands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what we ordered.  </li>
            <li>I  use this on my face and neck first thing in the morning and at bedtime.</li>
            <li>feels so silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Its more of a milky white goo that oils your skin without feeling oily to the touch once its rubbed in all the way.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to see if the Emu oil would help keep my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed on contact was how smoothly it applied and how incredibly soft it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it shines in the sun so much that i have been getting compliments on it on what i am using!</li>
            <li>I rub the oil between my forefinger, middle finger and thumb, then I spread along my eyelashes-bottom and top.</li>
            <li>Especially for my thighs :)</li>
            <li>so far.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped  fast!.</li>
            <li>‚ÄúOnly had this for one day and I love the way it feels on my skin can&#x27;t wait to&lt;br /&gt;see results .</li>
            <li>The first night I used this oil</li>
            <li>The next day, the top layer of the spot peeled off (which had happened before)</li>
            <li>but it has ended up being something I really like!</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>still love my coconut oil for lots of things, but this one is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li>It has really helped!</li>
            <li>I didn‚Äôt realize what Emu Oil was at first until I researched it a bit.</li>
            <li>and will definitely be ordering more when my supply gets low.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all I received my oil within two days.</li>
            <li>The Emu oil immediately gave it a more youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;The bags under my eyes upon contact with Emu got smaller.</li>
            <li>Lightning fast delivery!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Formula is clear, refined, free of any particles or scent.</li>
            <li>but I emailed them to make them aware because I cut the tips of my fingers &amp; had class embedded in them.  </li>
            <li>First time buyer of this product and</li>
            <li>The texture of my facial skin is a lot better then before taking it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>so the first thing I did was to look up what is an Emu.</li>
            <li>I first tried emu oil on my dog&#x27;s ears.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>One to tell me more about the product after I purchased through Amazon and one earlier today asking how the product has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>But first, I have to talk about InstaNatural customer service.</li>
            <li>I mentioned this in my response - she asked what I was interested in and after I explained, she recommended I try Emu Oil and sent me some to try.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing my hair in locs for about five years but have never been able to figure out what to put in my hair to keep it healthy, and moisturized; this product along with a few others has done wonders for me!</li>
            <li>makes it smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>He said I looked more like I was 6 months out from surgery instead of only two!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to run it under hot water before using it</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I used it for a burn on my finger from a hot pan</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this Emu Oil, I purchased another brand of Emu oil, which came in a 1oz bottle and a higher price.</li>
            <li>First time user</li>
            <li>but I will most definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li>I use this emu oil and my skin is perfectly soft and smooth and there is no irritation from the Retin-A.</li>
            <li>When I first got to try [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>(this company REALLY wants to insure customer satisfaction!)</li>
            <li>This Emu Oil is really something!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my face and it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy, but very hydrated!    </li>
            <li>Oral biologics used to treat psoriasis have many detrimental side effects to overall health.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used EMU OIL.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more from Instanatural.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I&#x27;ve used that I can apply it once and be done.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of those products that have so many uses that you wonder why would you ever buy anything else.</li>
            <li>My skin looks moisturizer and healthy, not dry with thick cream on top of it like most lotions do.  </li>
            <li>I was getting direct from New Zealand and love it.</li>
            <li>Even tho my skin is already very smooth, there are certain areas on my chest &amp; back that aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I contacted them after receiving my first order warm in the package due to hot weather.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for providing a high quality, all natural product that really does work and super quick delivery!</li>
            <li>I was happy because normally most of the oils that I have tried in my hair are somewhat thick, greasy, have a scent, and are heavy, but this oil is actually pretty light.</li>
            <li>Within minutes my skin&#x27;s natural moisture is restored instantly, morning puffiness is completely gone and it keeps your face perfectly moisturized throughout the entire day;</li>
            <li>I love oils, especially when they are in its pure form (i.e. 100% ).</li>
            <li>Alopecia was my primary reason for ordering, so I will give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>However, on your hands or other areas it is really nice.</li>
            <li>but this time it was completely flattened and the color was significantly lightened as well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it for my lips but have found other nice uses.</li>
            <li>The older scar was somewhat faded to begin with and has now really started to disappear, and the newer one, which was lumpy and bright pink, is now much smoother and lighter in color.</li>
            <li>I am a busy mother who tends to order from Amazon because it seems to make purchasing fast and hassle free.</li>
            <li>My skin texture was left rough and my pores were greatly enlarged.</li>
            <li>I have used emu oil before gotten from some Australian seller but for whatever reason this product seems to be more effective that the previous version I tried.</li>
            <li>Emu oil is supposed to have anti-inflammatory properties, which is why I am using it, and this product does work to calm the skin, particularly after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for anyone that wants a healthy looking and feeling face.</li>
            <li>I bought this on my own and this is a completely unbiased personal review.</li>
            <li>and I love it so far as far as skin regimen goes.</li>
            <li>The emu oil also makes my skin very soft and the oil absorbs quickly without a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a high quality, amazing gel-like oil that I applied to the dry patches on my shoulders (eczema) and immediately saw the inflammation disappear.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face  and skin super soft!</li>
            <li>I mean all the top brands and this is now my favorite.</li>
            <li>Maybe my case is the exception, but I did not see positive effects when using emu oil on my face.</li>
            <li>I have heard positive things before regarding emu oil</li>
            <li>After the first application, we noticed the baby&#x27;s skin was much softer.</li>
            <li>As for the oil and other products I order from InstaNatural, they have been great, following up on my satisfaction with their products and offering helpful tips for their use.</li>
            <li>This product really does exactly what it states it will do.......</li>
            <li>I purchased two bottles first time, just really want to give the product time to reflect all its benefits.</li>
            <li>I am using this on my skin at night, I really like how fast it absorbs!</li>
            <li>This product was purchased for the first time and our delivery was to our satisfaction and now my husband has been using this product and is&lt;br /&gt;seeing much improvement.</li>
            <li>WOW all the reviews I have read about this product are true.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that it comes in a dark glass bottle with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still trying to help restore my hair&#x27;s true beauty naturally.</li>
            <li>The product is oily but soaks in and leave the skin silky smooth, which is important, as I live in the hot dry southwest climate.</li>
            <li>I tried the emu oil and, it is still a little itchy, but not nearly as bad as it was; it seems to be getting better.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use it on my face along with some other favorite oils and have had numerous compliments on my complexion (I don&#x27;t wear makeup).</li>
            <li>I put more on that day and it looked even better the next day, after four days of Emu Oil on his eczema most of it was gone except the extremely bad patches but even those looked a million times better.</li>
            <li>Love this Emu oil, I am using it for dry skin on my elbows, feet and hands.</li>
            <li>It helps to heal the skin naturally and quickly.  </li>
            <li>That is going above and beyond what most normally do.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft, not oily.  </li>
            <li>The emu oil seems more healing of dry and irritated areas.</li>
            <li>Using it on cracked and dry heels and after about 2 weeks your skin will be healed and begin to look healthy.  </li>
            <li>It absorb easily and deeply, instead of floating on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li>My youngest&#x27;s eczema isn&#x27;t getting better by using the oil, but by using this oil he isn&#x27;t itchy, because his elbow&#x27;s are so dry.  </li>
            <li>He gets really dry, itchy skin under his chin and on the top of his butt, as well as his belly.</li>
            <li>and I like how It leaves my skin soft and quickly absorbs</li>
            <li>EMU oil has helped with my dry scalp, and love the pump that comes on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Nothing better for dry skin in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for stellar customer service.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my dry hair when it has too much static or frizz.  </li>
            <li>It did make my skin soft and my hair super shiny</li>
            <li>I was just given a strong prescription for Retin-A which made my face like sandpaper that was constantly peeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would work great after bathing on rough spots like feet and heels, it would absorb quickly without making a mess if you apply at bedtime.</li>
            <li>I purchased InstaNatural 100% Pure Emu Oil to use on my face.  </li>
            <li>I was unfamiliar with Emu Oil when I received this Instanatural 100% pure oil for review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It says it&#x27;s 100% pure Emu oil, but it makes me wonder.</li>
            <li>and I certainly see difference.</li>
            <li>This is 100% pure &amp; fully refined emu oil, so it is hypoallergenic, and does not contain any contaminants.</li>
            <li>The ingedients could not be simpler -- 100% pure emu oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Emu Oil product a few weeks ago and it is a great moisturizing tool for my face and hands when used daily.  </li>
            <li>It has become part of my everyday routine most mornings and every night!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my face &amp; neck after a few days, and so much more  in 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li>I asked if heat would affect the quality of the emu oil and they instantly sent me a new bottle so that I felt safe while using their product on my child.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft and conditions my split ends very well.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no smell, the oil absorbed in her skin VERY quickly and she didn&#x27;t mind using it...</li>
            <li>It feels really good on your skin, especially during the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>After deciding to take some steps in the right direction,  I added this emu oil to my new skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>next test and most important for me was finding something to help my pup&#x27;s skin and hair which had been feeling dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>A tiny amount of this product works extremely well, has no odor, and successfully treats these maladies.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product for free to review on my blog and was surprised at all the uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mainly got it for my hair trying to regrow it and it works!</li>
            <li>The EMU oil is very high quality, I use it to moisturize my hair and skin</li>
            <li>Very high quality oil.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this InstaNatural Pure Emu Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I USE THIS INSTANATURAL 100% PURE EMU OIL FOR MY WHOLE BODY.  </li>
            <li>This Pure Emu Oil from InstaNatural is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for - and this product (100% Pure Emu Oil) is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>So far so good bought another brand from a health store &amp; paid twice as much for half as much.</li>
            <li>The results thus far have not been great or outstanding but then again I have only been using the oil for a month and a half and only apply once a week.</li>
            <li>Works great on the little pains of daily life.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and although I have only used it a few days it is working great.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the last 2 weeks and can already tell a huge difference..</li>
            <li>This smooths and nourishes your skin very well.  </li>
            <li>This product has softened them so I am not picking at them as much.  </li>
            <li>I also use this as a moisturizer at night and gently rub it on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I can&#x27;t really see what it&#x27;s doing for but then again everything ain&#x27;t for everybody</li>
            <li>It might be too much for warmer months if you tend to be on the oily side already.</li>
            <li>It seems gentle and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t work very well for my skin, however it work wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a skin product that really &amp;#34;makes a difference&amp;#34;  --</li>
            <li>After continued use, we have noticed that the cradle cap has drastically improved and her skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li>Really like this oil.</li>
            <li>Within 3 days a lot of the dryness had healed and my hands became much smoother.</li>
            <li>I used it on cuticles and nails which also became much smoother and</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>oil doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.  </li>
            <li>Both of us are still very satisfied!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really really like this one.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s gentle and so moisturizing</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t moisturize as expected, but I did notice that my toe nails and cuticles looked a lot better.</li>
            <li>I even treated my hair overnight for and it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>I like emu oil vey much and thought I&#x27;d try another brand.  </li>
            <li>It does soak in, but not as fast as the seller suggests.</li>
            <li>very itchy, I&#x27;m breaking out on&lt;br</li>
            <li>InstaNatural products are well made and very affordable.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and item was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>the reason I&#x27;m writing is to let you know how much I appreciate your Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>This really moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>and so I spent more to get this.</li>
            <li>I really like the emu oil.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for.</li>
            <li>It was also wrapped very well.  </li>
            <li>This is not a greasy oil and absorbs quite well and fast.</li>
            <li>I use the oil twice daily and really enjoy the feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really getting into oils now and all you need to use is a drop.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also started using it on my hands and cuticles and can really see a difference there as well.</li>
            <li>better than I  expected.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t leave no greasy feeling or anything and absolutely no smell, which i love.</li>
            <li>talk to the emu, she signs a consent, we milk her oil glands gently, about once a week, until we fill out a bottle.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and help the skin recover.</li>
            <li>After 4 days I really noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>(you will look VERY greasy haha)</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>so I highly HIGHLY recommend them!</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling much softer and the anti-inflammatory aspect has really helped heal my dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li>it works really well for sun burn or itchy skin.</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>After, this emu oil, and, if you like, a wet pedicure or shower followed by a bit more emu on the feet.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It it very soothing on dry,cracked skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products to heal my rough, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li>I really like your Emu oil.</li>
            <li>Very helpful in easing discomfort of joints.  </li>
            <li>email, asking how I like the product line, if I have any concerns, and how much the company values itself on customer service.</li>
            <li>It was much smoother and softer.</li>

            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I was frankly surprised how well this absorbed into my skin and improved the look.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing without  being oily.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect regarding emu oil since I&#x27;ve never used it before.</li>
            <li>or you will get a bit too much at once.</li>
            <li>This is a very moisturizing oil, and it has no odor at all.</li>
            <li>I do like the pump delivery system -- very convenient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to tell you the truth--when I read that it was Emu Oil, I was really nervous to try it out.</li>
            <li>Since I have eczema I am always looking for products I can use to moisturize my skin while not irritating it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs a rarity these days to find a Founder who really does care about how their product works for a client.  </li>
            <li>And ABSOLUTELY get it from the InstaNatural company.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it did much for my hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter in law uses it to promote hair growth and it is working very well.</li>
            <li>It has bird like smell and evidence that it has contain real ingredients from Emu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really softens and clears my skin away from blotches.</li>
            <li>I got my order in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li>It worked very well on nourishing the skin, while keeping the skin irritation to a minimum without two uses.</li>
            <li>I am very please with InstaNatural&#x27;s Emu Oil.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>But on the plus side they did have fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very healing on skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>I use it after a shower, and my skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>but this bottle not so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.  -lj</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much it did nothing for me</li>
            <li>was well done again thanks....</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the near future</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 29 yr old male and my skin looks better than it did when I was 21.  </li>
            <li>Its fatty acids claim help with inflammation (acute rather than chronic inflammation).</li>
            <li>The doctor has me on a topical steroid which only kind of helps and gives me a headache.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and neck at night with sandalwood therapeutic grade essential oil and wake up so soft, I just love it.</li>
            <li>It does work a little better if you apply it right after you shower</li>
            <li>Sometimes they felt great, other times they remained very dry.  </li>
            <li>In less than a week my heels are becoming smooth, soft and the cracks are healing.  </li>
            <li>and I must say that my skin feels so soft!!!  </li>
            <li>those old spots are just about gone!!!</li>
            <li>Other then that, pleased with it and surprised it showed up a day earlier. :)</li>
            <li>A single squirt goes a long way and offers great coverage.</li>
            <li>, I also have liver spots on my right hand and since using the Emu Oil, they have almost completely faded.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that unlike coconut oil which sometimes leaves me greasy and stains or transfers to clothing and other items, this one really absorbs.</li>
            <li>Mom really likes the product and it works much better than her other lotions that contain perfumes and chemicals.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is clean and professional and it has directions for use and benefits clearly printed on its label.</li>
            <li>I will be looking into more of the other products listed.</li>
            <li>It makes other products get deeper into the skin therefore work better, faster.</li>
            <li>It seems to absorb better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have used other emu oils but like this one much better.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t bring myself to using it when there are so many other oils out there that don&#x27;t involve animal cruelty.</li>
            <li>So I googled other options, tried many</li>
            <li>I chose this product over others due to the many 5 and 4 star reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Emu Oil on my hair, scars &amp; stretch marks, all side effects due to chronic illness that wasn&#x27;t getting better</li>
            <li>but I can say I believe it was fantastic for quickly relieving the tight, burned skin.</li>
            <li>This 4-oz  bottle is a great value &amp; will last for a very long time since you only need a drop or two.</li>
            <li>During the winter when my face gets dry and flaky, this works very quickly.</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t want to be without Emu Oil and like this particular type because of the way it dispenses the oil.  </li>
            <li>This particular brand seems to be the real deal.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin feeling silky smooth, not oily, as long as too much isnt used.</li>
            <li>I rubbed this into his skin and was surprised that even though it was an oil, it absorbed quickly and left his skin feeling soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also applied to the tips of my long curly fine hair and it smoothed them too.  </li>
            <li>and plus it moisturize my dry skin and doesn‚Äôt leave any strong yucky smell.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a nice generous 4 ounce size, this will last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>InstaNatural has a very compelling version, which comes in a huge quantity that should last for a long time and what appears to be high quality oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have developed a number of skin issues and this oil is very gentle and helps with healing.  </li>
            <li>I use our Emu Oil every night to oil my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s scalp and it is very easy to apply and distribute with the pump nozzle and has a neutral smell so it works well with the other oils that I use to seal her hair nightly.</li>
            <li>The oil is pure and if you have any allergic skin conditions, emu oil is not likely to aggravate it as many cosmetics will with their preservatives and various chemicals additivies.</li>
            <li>Thanks Insta Natural!!</li>
            <li>I was left with a slight tan and that&#x27;s a miracle for my fair skin that always burns and peels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not only did the shipment arrive quickly, it also was very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>fine wrinkles, dry patches and bumps.</li>
            <li>ALL the swelling was gone, the bright red patches were now only slightly red.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use it on my face because my skin is pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li>see the TRUE benefits of this NATURAL deep penetrating non-greasy oil, you need to be consistent.</li>
            <li>see the TRUE benefits of this NATURAL deep penetrating non-greasy oil, you need to be consistent.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even describe just how good this product is, using it in only a short time made me actually stutter when trying to explain it on video review because this product needs no explanation!</li>
            <li>Also does wonders for my skin so far, fast too!</li>
            <li>This oil seems to get absorbed easily by the skin leaving your skin soft, I know longer have dark circles under my eye&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a month haven&#x27;t any results really, maybe I&#x27;ll wait a little more</li>
            <li>There was a problem with the pump bottle and they sent a new product and a gift!</li>
            <li>I got this discounted for my review and this is honestly fabulous that my hubby is using it on his dry cracked hands that he gets from work.</li>
            <li>Because of my dry skin I&#x27;ve used a lot of moisturizers and creams to maintain smooth, moist skin.</li>
            <li>My dry cracked skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been able to use less pain killers.</li>
            <li>Next morning do a quick brush through and wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, will keep it as part if my regular daily routine,</li>
            <li>This Emu Oil made a tremendous difference on my skin in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I have cut back on my use on my face and my skin is actually feeling better.</li>
            <li>And because I have a chronic pain condition that requires a topical compounded rx from the pharmacy, I also apply the emu oil over top of it for the same reason-</li>
            <li>This product was the magic bullet that finally added the extra healing power I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my legs.</li>
            <li>This is working much better for me than the much-touted and more expensive Argan Oil I have been using.  </li>
            <li>Used it recently when I burned my thumb and it quickly healed.</li>
            <li>Our older children got sunburnt and it worked on that...</li>
            <li>that was my main focus.</li>
            <li>Mostly what I discovered was that most  Emu-type products are cut with lots of other ingredients, and contain very little real Emu oil.  </li>
            <li>After years of being not so nice to my skin by using water that was too hot and exfoliating too often and  too roughly,  I now have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for those with skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company and their products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>you are a bit timid as to trying this, I highly suggest purchasing it and giving it a try of your own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found out about this product line from a close friend who highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>

            <li>I highly recommed this seller &amp; this product.</li>
            <li>I use it for my face cream now.. highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use a Derma Roller &amp; then put on the oil which I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all of their products</li>
            <li>So I ordered after watching a YouTube skin care video about it being used as a moisturizer before bedtime as well as in the AM with a moisturizer that has a high SPF.</li>
            <li>Have noticed softer skin within a week of using this product i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and this ranks high.</li>
            <li>I have been happy with a few other oils I&#x27;ve ordered from InstaNaturals</li>
            <li>I have to say that I love this product and so far every other InstaNatural product that I have tried.</li>
            <li>For example, when our youngest came home from the hospital, I was using coconut oil for nursing relief, chapped lips, dry hands, after bath baby moisturizer, dry hair, on boo boo&#x27;s for the older children, as eye make up remover, as a butter substitute for flipping pancakes and making cookies, and honestly...</li>
            <li>that it is a natural and pure oil that I&#x27;m applying to my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working it&#x27;s magic, and a little goes along way.</li>
            <li>chi  area from waxing little better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cuticles&lt;br /&gt;Rubbed a little on my Cuticles every night and woke up too softer better skin around Cuticles by the morning time.  </li>
            <li>4 stars because the oil is good, but the price (while decent for Amazon) is not great.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin and hair feel really soft and healthy, which is a big accomplishment, especially as we grow older.  </li>
            <li>This is different, when I use the 100% pure emu oil it seems thick and oily at first, but once it soaks in it feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in my skin</li>
            <li>After using this for a week the wrinkles and scars are gone, its very moist, and extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is emolient, soft odorless and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>whole composition of emu oil is very similar to our skin&#x27;s own fatty acid composition</li>
            <li>it really makes my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Tried using it on the rough surfaces of my skin and it is light weight and just smoothed the callouses.  </li>
            <li>Will give it a few more uses.  </li>
            <li>Although the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, it has a very odd / particular scent to it.</li>
            <li>Once it absorbed, I could tell there was instant relief.</li>
            <li>As soon as I tried this oil on my hands it left it moisturized like a fresh manicure feeling.</li>
            <li>I found this Emu oil useful in several ways.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother, less sensitive, just more &#x27;normal&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>So I rubbed a little bit on last night, and by this morning, my heels already looked better!  </li>
            <li>bottle is great since it has a pump feature, it makes things less messy.</li>
            <li>Before my hair was dry but now, my hair is smooth, soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>I received this on a day where his eczema was out of control, so many swollen red patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both had some troublesome dry skin on our hands that regular hand lotion never seemed to be able to eliminate.</li>
            <li>and it gets absorbed quickly) in the night for a few days and twice</li>
            <li>I experimented with the right amount, and I think I decided I actually prefer using this on my hair instead of</li>
            <li>It goes on the face smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a ridiculous oily film and that is what I can&#x27;t stand most as someone with moderately oily skin.</li>
            <li>and they all claimed emu oil to by a miracle oil for a huge number of things from joint pain to extreme moisture.</li>
            <li>My previous two other Emu oils from other companies are a lot thicker, milkier in color and more effective.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li>It has been warming up where I live and</li>
            <li>It is my new &amp;#34;natural moisturizer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and I have to say After using it I don&#x27;t think that I can live without it ....</li>
            <li>I have told all of my friends &amp; family about this product, so you can expect some new orders</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Emu oil.</li>
            <li>Now add the fact that I live in Tampa Bay, FL where the humidity is kicking all the time</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I use it over top of my facial treatment products because it literally &#x27;pushes&#x27; the product into your skin which makes it more effective (and you can use less of those expensive skin treatments!)</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something but didn&#x27;t really notice huge change in hair or skin from tho oil.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and  cured by dry scalp (dandruff).</li>
            <li>it really grew one of my relative hair,it really cure</li>
            <li>a dry oil that quickly soaks in, unlike an almond oil, for example.  </li>
            <li>And its light enough to use on your regular hair if you&#x27;re going through the transiting period.</li>
            <li>I really like that this is a gentle enough product to use on things like sunburns, bug bites, etc.  </li>
            <li>The surface is smooth again and my pores are starting to get smaller (</li>
            <li>If you have super dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have battled dry skin since I was young and have tried many different oils and lotions.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product to see what it could do for patches of dry skin (took care of them with no trouble) but in the process I also applied it to a couple of 1-2 year old surgical scars and am amazed by the results!</li>
            <li>Using this during a very dry Minnesota winter will be the true test.</li>
            <li>The oil is a very clear consistency.</li>
            <li>Included very clear expiration date.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin very soft, and dehydrated.</li>
            <li>This just disappears and leaves my skin so very soft.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good quality Emu Oil without any unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft</li>
            <li>I also have very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin looking and feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I use it for my hair and since then my hair became very soft.</li>
            <li>I used oil for my hair and it made it very soft.</li>
            <li>I Googled them but was able to find out very little about who they are as a company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin is completely clear!</li>
            <li>bottle has a small pump top.</li>
            <li>The seller was EXTREMELY customer service oriented and even sent a personal email asking how I enjoyed it, what I was using it for, etc.</li>
            <li>I have received emails from the seller several times, first giving me helpful hints about using the oil</li>
            <li>Your hair will feel so incredibly soft, and look noticeably healthier!</li>
            <li>Wow!..  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this oil - it comes in a fairly dark amber bottle, which helps to protect the oil.  </li>
            <li>With regard to my face, it doesn&#x27;t look much different except when I first wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not messy at all!</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase and I will definitely be coming back for more.</li>
            <li>, I have a small spot of psoriasis on my temple that I have treated with many types of oils and creams to no avail.</li>
            <li>, it was pretty deep.</li>
            <li>Our cats even love it in small doses...</li>
            <li>Now, when I see one developing, at nighttime I just rub a tiny bit of this oil into my cuticle area, and when I wake up the next morning, my hands are soft and smooth and the hangnail is gone.</li>
            <li>I also add it to my hair to keep moisture because I color is blonde so much!</li>
            <li>She has a large family so social issues are not involved in obtaining this oil.</li>
            <li>Come to find out, it comes from the fat of an Australian flightless bird, emus, so it has to go through a very careful process to ensure safe usage for people.</li>
            <li>This has made a huge difference in my&lt;br /&gt;very sensitive, dry, reactive skin!!!  </li>
            <li>I also like the pump bottle a little better than the dropper bottle as it is a little easier to keep everything clean.</li>
            <li>We cook for them and clean after them daily, and TLC cameras are following this emu tribe everywhere they go, including showing how the oil is obtained.</li>
            <li>Not easy absorbing, or soft oil free feeling at all.</li>
            <li>It seems to be high quality and works better than any other moisturizer that I have used to treat a some dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>has a full back tattoo, and he said it definitely kept the itching at bay.&lt;br /&gt;A+ product!</li>
            <li>It sinks into the skin quickly leaving no oily residue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s enough to moisturize my skin nicely without leaving my tub slick &amp; unsafe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very thick</li>
            <li>with emu its clear the problem and my skin very soft ..</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very soft and young...</li>
            <li>In only one week of use I am noticing a positive improvement in the redness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>So I see that as a positive aspect that this Emu oil is actually helping.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to using this product, along with coconut oil and castor oil, I can actually see new hair growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a Long, Long way so this bottle should last our family a good long while.  </li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t overly dry, but this soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>Initially when I learned about its use for a large variety of skin issues I was somewhat sceptical.</li>
            <li>is my second bottle of this pure emu oil.</li>
            <li>Terrific price for large amount.</li>
            <li>This brand costs the same as one of those (one called Pure Emu Oil for instance that comes in a plastic amber bottle sold here at Amazon)</li>
            <li>, a little more time will tell, but it definitely made my skin smoother.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t get lucky because other products Emu Oil didn&#x27;t work on my hair until I found InstaNatural&#x27;s Emu Oil.</li>
            <li>Did it clear up her eczema?</li>
            <li>My skin is clear.</li>
            <li>I wake up and they are still soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes them soft and mascara just flows on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprised it worked.</li>
            <li>I would ONLY recommend to use it at night as it gives you a VERY shiny sheen.</li>
            <li>He has notoriously sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to smells and often discontinue use of a product because I can&#x27;t take the smell</li>
            <li>I asked my daughter to rub some of this on my back and it truly has helped to decrease the pain that I was feeling and it didn&#x27;t take much time at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will be staying near by at all</li>
            <li>I just decided to try this as a pre shave oil today and WOW</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft,</li>
            <li>I naturally have a dehydration problem.  </li>
            <li>and I am already seeing a change in how fast my hair is growing back.</li>
            <li>I did not notice anything as far as pain relief.</li>
            <li>I alsoo have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t think that it would do much, so I didn&#x27;t put in the work or effort of using it.</li>
            <li>I couple this oil with some essential oils for sore muscles, and my husband and I both feel a much quicker, deeper relief.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feels soft.</li>
            <li>Has my skin feeling soft</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and stays protected all day.  </li>
            <li>Together they have made my hair naturally soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and it really does work well for me.</li>
            <li>I have combination oily/dry skin, which is also quite sensitive.</li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any decrease in the lines and wrinkles ...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combo skin</li>
            <li>It does moisturize well but doesn&#x27;t always absorb really well especially on the face.</li>
            <li>They sent me a follow up email with helpful tips and have been very conscientious, especially for a rather inexpensive item.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helped to give my skin an extra moisture boost.</li>
            <li>The product is the same as the one at the Body Piercing Shop, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I try to heal myself and my livestock naturally with natural products, but after over two months of trying everything else</li>
            <li>It leaves skin soft and eliminates dryness.</li>
            <li>it gives me a natural shine and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down(but</li>
            <li>I came across Emu Oil when reading about natural recipes for hair and body products replacements.  </li>
            <li>The company sent a personal email asking about product satisfaction and I feel appreciated.  </li>
            <li>I like the pump action and the way the oil feels when it goes on.</li>
            <li>I have quite sensitive skin and this product has caused no problems, irritation or redness or blemishes.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product.</li>
            <li>Just sooo soft and my skin drinks it up.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural Emu oil keeps my face SOFT as baby skin and&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have any sprains or swelling, apply a few drops and apply light bandage.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>If you have any sprains or swelling, apply a few drops and apply light bandage.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised with how well this worked.  </li>
            <li>Their products are 100% natural and organic.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the closest I&#x27;ve gotten to all that emu oil is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Another unexpected bonus has been my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>After several applications of the oil on my cracked hands and cuticles, I noticed that my skin was so much softer and no longer cracked.</li>
            <li>I chose to use this on my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>This product really helped reduce the red inflamed areas of my face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>, I have always had sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin silky soft.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I have NATURAL hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance, which works well for some of my friends who are sensitive to this.  </li>
            <li>Still early to say but like it so far</li>
            <li>I am using it on my legs and so far it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>I had old marks on my face from pms(tmi)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel incredibly soft without being too oily.</li>
            <li>old .</li>
            <li>Has made my daughters hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with perioral dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I also like the pump container that helps to not use too much since I only need 1 pump for my face.</li>
            <li>I dislike the idea of slathering chemicals on my body for moisturizers and prefer natural products.</li>
            <li>Congratulations to insta natural .</li>
            <li>Anti-aging rejuvenation scalp serum, OGX biotin and collagen shampoo and conditioner, and insta natural emu oil before I retire for the night.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 18 month old daughters eczema.</li>
            <li>and so far it is working great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;No irritation noted so far</li>
            <li>just change Insta &amp; add a s to the end of natural.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ll just say WOW at their response.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well this is going to work on old stretch marks</li>
            <li>I am prone to breakouts and so far (2 weeks in)</li>
            <li>The Insta Natural Emu oil was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get fooled by the &amp;#34;Best Natural Oil&amp;#34; advertisement.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.  </li>
            <li>FOR A LONG TIME NOW, BUT THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME USING IT FOR MYSELF.</li>
            <li>I bought this with the hopes that it would clear up my 7 month old daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair and skin soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged from constant relaxing and bleaching processes.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this oil, you don&#x27;t need to use much so the bottle will last a while, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing a natural oil cleanse for a while.</li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised at how beneficial it is.</li>
            <li>Ny hair is so soft, and no frizz.</li>
            <li>No messy.</li>
            <li>She always gets this upper rash on her arm and has intense itching from it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that this product can work on aches and pains, but I haven&#x27;t tried it for that yet.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are almost completely gone after about two months of consecutive use.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft now.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised upon testing this oil because I don&#x27;t notice a smell to it at all.  </li>
            <li>It is so hydrating and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I was not sure about it when I first received it, nut it has been so useful.  </li>
            <li>I am ordering a few more bottles to keep one in my bag and one at home and of course to have a back up.  </li>
            <li>I also use the Rose Water Toner in the shower to wash my hair and hair shedding as decreased and the comb just glides through my hair.</li>
            <li>Works really good on my nails not sure about hair because it&#x27;s being paired with other products!</li>
            <li>The itching subsided and with consistent use, I do not have that flaky, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>As an all natural oil it claims to be rich in fatty acids and provides moisturizing benefits to the hair and skin.</li>
            <li>Since then, it has been a consistent skin softening moisturizer with every single use.</li>
            <li>The more I use it, the less dry and wrinkly my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>It instantly relives the tightness of dry skin, and absorbs quickly- leaving no greasiness.</li>
            <li>I will soon be 50 years old and so for the past year I have been trying many different moisturizers, face creams, etc.  </li>
            <li>This fatty acid is a known enhancer for transport&lt;br /&gt;of bioactive compounds into the skin and has the ability to be absorbed quickly and penetrate deeply when applied externally.</li>
            <li>In the past few years I experienced hair loss and I tried endless number of hair supplements but nothing really worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It quickly worked to get rid of the dryness and over time, my hands have been feeling softer and definitely less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She really likes the pump on top so there is less waste.</li>
            <li>Not sure if more than what simple olive oil would do, it does help.</li>
            <li>I add a few &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; of this to my lotion after a shower and my skin stays soft overnight as well as using it full strength on my face.   </li>
            <li>I have used a different Emu oil in the past, but this one works so much better.  </li>
            <li>It made my deep wrinkles fine and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Even better, it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li>You can use this valuable oil over dry patches on your face or hands and knees, or anywhere that needs a little more tender care.</li>
            <li>When one ages, the skin gets paper thin and very easily scratched when working in the yard.  </li>
            <li>and it is obviously a high quality oil that I will continue to purchase in the future from this seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this for anyone, young or old, that want to clear up dry skin.</li>
            <li>With so many claims I was both curious and slightly sceptical.</li>
            <li>B00756HQNQ Microplane Colossal Pedicutre Rasp Brown]], and use it with the same technique as your sandpaper type file or pumice, on bone dry feet.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film behind.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft on a daily basis and is very natural;  does not clog the pores.  </li>
            <li>which was bothersome if I stood too long or walked too much.  </li>
            <li>Again, as long as too much isnt used, does not leave hair feeling oily.</li>
            <li>I saw changes immediately and within 5 days my skin was finally back to normal</li>
            <li>Not only is it fragrance free, it&#x27;s a thick oil closer to a gel, that really absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering this brand and it seems a little nicer than my previous brand and the price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I think with constant use on my arms and legs they will begin to look less dry and become more soft and supple.</li>
            <li>On the swollen hives, it didn&#x27;t really do much to make them go away, or itch less overall, but it seemed a bit soothing when first applied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the oil for a couple of weeks and only use a few drops at a time - very fast and positive results!</li>
            <li>I am going to try applying it with essential oils to my boyfriends newly reconstructed ankle and skin, and see how it helps with healing and scarring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new with my experimentation of essential oils and have been reading and studying their uses.</li>
            <li>I have continued to use this product, recently ordering a new supply.</li>
            <li>Works really well for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I don‚Äôt really care for it on dry hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has suffered from dry patches of skin her whole life.</li>
            <li>I use a bit on my skin in dry areas and it really helps with the dryness without leaving the area too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it really help with my dry winter skin all over, even my face.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face like I do with their argan oil, and it really helps with the dry</li>
            <li>My complexion in a few short days has gone from dry and weathered looking underneath and greasy on top, to  a soft, radiant glow.  </li>
            <li>really recommend it if you have problems of dry skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my baby&#x27;s eczema less blotchy and is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super dry at the moment, but by the end of the summer I&#x27;ll need to trim off the dry hair from all the time at the pool and beach.  </li>
            <li>Especially when we&#x27;re at our 2nd home in Idaho, the high-desert is very drying for my skin.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of daily application to my face, it was very noticeable that the scars from an accident last fall, faded and the area where I had stitches, the swelling was reduced.</li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts even though it&#x27;s reduced facial dryness and is an excellent base for foundation.</li>
            <li>Other Emu oil has a grade like AA or similar but I was amazed by the high number of reviewers and the positive feedback</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>While I was not sure about using it on myself because it was animal based my sister was excited to try it on her daughter who has severe cradle cap and what looks to be eczema.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have tried Emu Oil so I cannot compare to other brands.</li>
            <li>One star off for being an animal product which I don&#x27;t advocate for but had no other choice with the state of my skin and hair these days.</li>
            <li>But after rubbing it in those areas after a shower,  the next morning I noticed a considerable difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>I trust it enough to let my 14 year old daughter use it!</li>
            <li>I see major improvements in over all skin texture and color.  </li>
            <li>Most scar treatments take at least 8 weeks so we will see how it goes!</li>
            <li>no smell that I can detect, but when it goes on my skin it does react with the skin and gives off a very faint and natural smell which is pleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition to using on my hair, I have just begun experiment to see how well this Emu Oil will work on a couple of old bug bites from several months back that left the skin area much darker.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using easily available tools, and not the hours of wet or dry buffing you might have already tried, you can get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>Emu oil has made such a huge difference in my life this past year.</li>
            <li>I purchased this emu oil as a general, multipurpose oil for my family.</li>
            <li>Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li>However, it is clear from the way my eyebrows have responded, that it would totally work.</li>
            <li>Finally, I had some spider veins that were lasered and the healing process seemed to be taking so long, after rubbing this in one night the discoloration from that procedure was really reduced.</li>
            <li>and when I wake up the next morning my skin is so soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to put too much on.  </li>
            <li>but so far its coming back.</li>
            <li>Something takes a long time to penetrate my facial skin, unless I gently dab it on or barely use it.</li>
            <li>my husband uses the product on his feet nightly, his soles no longer have cracks from being bare footed.&lt;br /&gt;Again</li>
            <li>Apparently works.</li>
            <li>and my scar is barely visible now.</li>
            <li>but you can barely read it because of the label color and print.</li>
            <li>I put a drop onto my fingertips and massaged it onto the red areas at night, and within 3 days the heat rash was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased this for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have applied the Emu Oil for nearly two weeks now, and it has made a definite difference.</li>
            <li>How I use the emu oil,,,,I use this Emu oil on my daughters whole body after her bath while her body is still wet.</li>
            <li>I am 60 and constantly get compliments on how young my skin</li>
            <li>Does barely to nothing.. to your skin..</li>
            <li>At 33 years old I use naturals products like aloe Vera and coconut oil to keep my skin youthful and I am definitely adding this to my skin care routine!</li>
            <li>if by chance you don&#x27;t like it the company offers a 100 day, 100% money back policy.</li>
            <li>assisting in putting a house back together after I had to have it completely gutted.  </li>
            <li>Certainly not fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>The rash has just about completely diminished and the itching was gone almsot instantly.</li>
            <li>With my old moisturizer, if I put it around my neckline I would break out the next morning, but with this oil I can put it all over my face and neck without any breakouts.</li>
            <li>It seems thick and greasy when I first put it on my face, but after I gently rub it in, the greasiness goes away</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is another holy grail product from InstaNatural that I will highly recommend to those dealing with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone who has any type of dry skin problems.</li>
            <li>&amp; I will definitely come back because I&#x27;m seriously can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>far, the pumping mechanism of the nozzle works very well at delivering a consistent flow of the oil without getting too messy, which was an issue I&#x27;ve dealt with with other products.</li>
            <li>This has really helped my extra dry areas.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Emu oil to use on my one year old daughters sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>I normally let my hair air dry</li>
            <li>It may not feel like you are using enough to do anything, but it is easy to go overboard and create flat hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to people with dry skin!</li>
            <li>I use this in my curly natural hair to add moisture just after washing my hair and also before blow drying to flat iron.</li>
            <li>The poor guy has a bright pink belly, chin and paws all summer long and nothing I apply or give to him seems to work.</li>
            <li>The bottle warns that a little goes a long way, and it is true.  </li>
            <li>It is little oily but that goes away within few minutes and you will feel better when you wake up.</li>
            <li>At the same time our children (for various reasons) have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Emu oil is part of the current trend of using natural oils and extracts to essentially replace every chemical-laden salve, lotion, and potion.  </li>
            <li>When I applied the oil on my wet hair it definitely made my hair very shiny</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling moist not dry....</li>
            <li>It is not dry anymore</li>
            <li>It is comparable to a far more expensive one I was using.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs in my skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product, I admit I was a little bit unsure.</li>
            <li>Also love the pump dispenser, a lot less messy than the dropper!</li>
            <li>, my hair generally takes 4hours+ to dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>actually planned to write this review earlier, but I actually found a new use for this last night.</li>
            <li>The second place was my cuticles, which are generally damaged.</li>
            <li>I used it straight, as well as in combination with castor oil and some other essential oils known for skin healing properties.</li>
            <li>so I have no long term affect.</li>
            <li>I used it for muscle soreness a few times at night and it seems to really work!  </li>
            <li>Every year his skin allergies seem to get worse; they last longer and have become more severe and spread to larger areas.</li>
            <li>The oil left behind a pretty glow to my skin without feeling greasy, it made my skin look pretty.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and it gets very dry.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses it after she gives herself a chemical peel and it calms her skin down and moisturizes it very well.</li>
            <li>4 oz bottle was bigger than I expected and should last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>I had never used it before, as with other instaNatural products, they are easy to dispense and just a few drops leave your skin well moisturized and glowing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Insta Natural 100% PURE ULTRA PREMIUM EMU OIL, is non-greasy, odorless, has a thick translucent milky color (depending on the seasons)&lt;br /&gt;and when applied, it deeply penetrates the roots and conditions the hair leaving it feeling extra soft and manageable; not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have other high end oils</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>previous oil was a flip-top, this is a much easier dispenser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I happened to apply some of this Emu Oil to my hair, still allowing for it to dry naturally.....</li>
            <li>Our youngest is 7 months old and has dry patches</li>
            <li>The oil itself feels very light, it has the same consistency of almond or olive oil, not too heavy yet a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I think that you can find Emu oil for a cheaper price, but I really wanted something in a glass bottle that I could reuse for homemade skincare that included essential oils (which eventually break down plastic)</li>
            <li>I really like the pump bottle this has, easier to dole out a drop or two at a time without having to mess around with removing and replacing a cap while you have oil in your hands.</li>
            <li>The oil has a history of being used on all skin types but especially to help those with sensitive, dry and flaking skin.  </li>
            <li>I have found that the emu oil has lessened the effects of psoriasis, leaving skin much smoother and less irritated and red.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge plus for me because I hate strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>I am a middle aged mother of VERY young children  (3  under the age of 5) &amp; didn&#x27;t want to look like their grandmother.  </li>
            <li>Based on what I have read my experience may be unique - an allergic reaction of sorts - so my opinion is only that emu oil is not good for me.</li>
            <li>I am 81 years old and recovering from hives and rash that left my skin red and dry.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I used a little too much</li>
            <li>Got a little too much sun and got a sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I tend to just feel oily when I put this on no matter how or how little or how much I used.</li>
            <li>I put a small amount in my hair, and it is less dry and more manageable.</li>
            <li>First, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use if you have a cold, just simply apply a little in your nose.</li>

            <li> this will be most helpful.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found myself using it more as a moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li> I have used Emu Oil for months now, I still use Argan Oil, too but more often the Emu Oil.  </li>
            <li> Great product ,  neutral smell and dries fast .  </li>
            <li> I am pleased to have read what others said about it and tried it.</li>
            <li> So many oils sit on top and stay sticky which doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> A better design would be to have an indented top of the pump</li>
            <li> I have a number of friends now also using it for a variety of purposes and also love it.  </li>
            <li> I have been enjoying the emu oil for its healing properties and its soothing effects on my skin.</li>

            <li> So, I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect from this</li>
            <li> I love how light this is!</li>
            <li> It could be better.</li>
            <li> Like it more then chemical creams for sure.</li>

            <li> Im a true believer in this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really do love all InstaNatural products you get so much more in them than many higher priced beauty products</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so true!</li>
            <li> I tried all the other Emu oils on Amazon and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li> So I‚Äôm thrilled to introduce to you my ‚ÄúInstaNatural 100% Pure Emu Oil Review!‚Äù</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild as well.</li>
            <li> I received this from the seller very quickly.</li>
            <li> I asked a couple of questions and got replies very quickly.</li>
            <li> and i break out easily.  </li>
            <li> After one night I saw a markable difference in how my skin looks - also healed some blemishes and reduced redness very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil and can be used for so many different things!  </li>
            <li> It is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I would like to add, that her doctor said she might have a very mild case of eczema.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also it absorbs very quickly so you can put it on in the evening and the morning.</li>
            <li> have bought multiple bottles, this stuff is great for hair and skin :)</li>
            <li> I like the pump on the bottle for easy application.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It rubs in my skin easily without greasy feeling remaining.</li>
            <li> I actually use it most on my hair as a styling product and it&#x27;s great for cuticles.</li>
            <li> glides on easily &amp; keeps the moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li> Not oily, drys easily.</li>
            <li> It works great, universal for so many things.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have strong smell</li>
            <li> I do strongly recommend you trying emu oil.  </li>
            <li> The emu oil is natural and safe, and we have found it to be a good alternative for lessening the symptoms associated with psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with InstaNatural pure emu oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been healing my acne scars, along with keeping my face feeling healthy and moisturized for a full 24 hour period.</li>
            <li> Being I had just received it that day as a promotional rate to review and leave my honest opinion, is the reason I used it for that first.  </li>
            <li> It is light and absorbs very quickly, and has almost no odor that I can detect.</li>
            <li> Smells just fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for the fine lines yet</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t do what I was hoping it would do for my hair (reduce thinning) after 6 months of use, but otherwise it is a fine product for moisturizing etc.  </li>
            <li> Too oily for fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it absorbs very quickly and leaves my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even started using the product on my hair and find my hair looks much less damaged, really impressive.</li>
            <li> Not oily, not dry,  Just balanced and happy.  </li>
            <li> As advertised, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Helps my daughter with severe eczema tremendously!  </li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a good value because less is more!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and smooths away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of different things to improve my skin and my hair and many things have helped, which I&#x27;m very pleased about, but when I saw this as part of a promotion, I was eager to try it.</li>
            <li> but I keeps my hair moist and shiny love it and very fast shipment</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and packaged to protect the oil from spilling, I love the squirt bottle lid and the Emu Oil is just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for my dry hands and feet feels very nice, so far so good</li>
            <li> I did try and use it on my face a couple times and it was absorbed more quickly</li>
            <li> After the first month the seller asked me how was the product working for me, (which i thought was very nice) and i infromed them the reason why I order the product and told them it hasn&#x27;t worked so far</li>
            <li> We started applying it several times a day to his rash and got amazing results!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to promote hair growth, but never got around to using it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I am excited about the continued use.  </li>
            <li> Thus far I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time trying this brand after using another emu oil for more than a year</li>
            <li> My favorite use is an overnight skin softener, as my hands spend all day in water and are pretty chapped by days end.  </li>
            <li> This is my personal and honest opinion and I will buy again!</li>
            <li> the itch/burn/redness will be significantly improved.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this as a moisturizer at all when I first got this product to test and try and review.  </li>
            <li> Another exciting oil to try out!</li>
            <li> Their friendly staff contacted me about my opinion on the product</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to moisturize the flaking tissue around my navel piercing while it was healing.</li>
            <li> It did not clear it up, but it is definitely a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When I get excited about a product, my husband will say &amp;#34;might as well buy stock&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I also use it anytime I have aches and pains and it helps significantly.</li>

            <li> I use it on my scalp and the dry ends of my hair a couple of times a month as a conditioner with great results.</li>

            <li> (It&#x27;s not all that attractive when it&#x27;s slathered on your face, though; it&#x27;s definitely &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> but as for a natural moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li> and it has worked wonders; my scalp and hair is no longer dry.&lt;br /&gt;My story with this amazing all NATURAL Emu oil began when I bought a shampoo from a seller which damaged my hair and broke it.</li>
            <li> The additional AMAZING benefits that surprised me was the THICKNESS; &amp;#34;MY HAIR BECAME THICKER, STRONGER, AND BEGAN TO</li>
            <li> So far this emu oil is amazing</li>
            <li> I like this emu oil, and it works great on the skin, not much on the hair.</li>

            <li> Thanks s lot will soon be ordering couple more.</li>
            <li> I will purchase from this company again, as they have a nice collection of products in their line and those that I&#x27;ve tried so far, work well for me.</li>
            <li> I love the oil, actually my whole family do.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t try it on my hair but it does work nicely on my legs - makes the skin soft and glowing...</li>
            <li> I was in so much pain) and works infinitely better than Aloe Vera (also burned for 10+ minutes).  </li>
            <li> Secondly, so many lotions seem to really bother her skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the extra steps this company took to insure my liking of their products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Emu oil for some time, but I was looking for a more reasonable price and liked what the insta natural reviews and that it is 100% Emu oil.  </li>
            <li> Emu oil seems to be very healing and can help many skin ailments.</li>
            <li> Four ounces lasts a good while, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that this is non-greasy and unscented.</li>
            <li> I have tried (and loved) several products from InstaNatural, so I took a chance on their ultra premium emu oil.</li>
            <li> However, below is the full email that I sent to AJ, the Founder of InstaNatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about my experience with emu oil.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s good for my skin too, I will order from the same seller again</li>
            <li> We love it and use it as much as we use the argon oil they both came together.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to think when I saw &amp;#34;Emu Oil&amp;#34; because, let&#x27;s face it -- it sounds highly suspect!</li>
            <li> This Emu oil is so good to my skin and especially to the heels of my feet.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizers my face without looking over the top oily.</li>
            <li> and I guess smells like it, not bad just wierd</li>
            <li> This oil works great on my dry skin and hair!!</li>
            <li> I noticed faster drying time less fly aways and my hair felt thicker  and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 81 year old mother after a friend of hers said it was the best thing for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> leaves your skin feeling nice and soft and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> So thrilled to receive this product as a slight discount so that I could take a chance on it and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> super fast delivery..:)</li>
            <li> The entire family is very happy, they have a beautiful playground for the children, and there are at least 43 emus (and counting) in this particular clan.</li>
            <li> Works great order it every other month</li>
            <li> and I picked this brand because of the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> I am so happy as with the winter season fast approaching,.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs quickly and didn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling too greasy.</li>

            <li> Received my purchase quickly.</li>
            <li> I received my package fairly quick</li>
            <li> I am so grateful this Emu Oil was recommended to me and that Amazon delivered it to me so quickly.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews, but I just had to write about what an awesome product for treating skin ailments this is in case it would help someone else.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use with essential oils and it blended nicely and really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s super moisturizing</li>
            <li> Came quick and on time.</li>
            <li> Even though it goes on oily, it penetrates skin quickly.</li>
            <li> It is anti inflammatory and heals wounds quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This oil has so many benefits, but the main use for me is on my hands and nails.</li>
            <li> Its not sticky, super oily like baby oil or tanning oil.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> really love how one oil can be used for so many different purposes!</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the smell fades quickly, but the effect does not.  </li>
            <li> Quick service, packed well and the product is just as advertised.</li>
            <li> She has thinner hair and a bit of eczema and both have been tremendously improved with EmuOil.</li>
            <li> quick absorb, I use it on my hand, I can continue working on my computer</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin which is a plus because my husband hates what he calls the greasy feel of lotions.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a product work so quickly and efficiently on his skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was quick and bottle was bubble wrapped and secured well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since using Emu oil, I have noticed a big difference in my skin, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for myself and this is the only product</li>
            <li> I did but it has a scent that dissipates quickly but takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> This stuff has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Emu oil absorbs quickly and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> My skin is super prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had high hopes, but I read in many of these reviews that it works for others and</li>
            <li> I found the emu oil to leave a more oily texture than my favorite argan oil, but it also seemed to moisturize a little better.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as my hair oil, which is precisely why I purchased it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, it is working just as well as the Rose hip seed oil has.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product and others by Instanatural for years to come, God willing, and I hope these products remain available.</li>
            <li> The price is good as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One of the main things I liked with this product is that there isn&#x27;t much scent going on.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the oil and the personalized service.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new moisturizer, and saw how many people ranked this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very light and soothing, but not super effective in stopping the itching.</li>
            <li> But I am very impressed by the moisture and long lasting moisture at that!</li>
            <li> The push pump dispenser is a good way to get a small amount, much better than another brand that we tried.  </li>
            <li> It feels very lightweight and absorbs into your skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> If does that good on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good product for dry skin, nails, hair, etc...</li>
            <li> But this, like all the other InstaNatural products that I&#x27;ve tried is amazing!</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve used several instaNatural products and I love them all!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with insta natural!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hello, I am Crystal and I am absolutely in love with Insta Natural Emu Oil !  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s the first thing I reach for!  </li>
            <li> I love finding all natural products that work!</li>
            <li> Works really well!!</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of strong scent so this one is ok it doesn‚Äôt have any scent.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, and have found that most moisturizers I use just almost sit on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It really help provide great moisture on my heels where they normally dry out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fragrance free, blends easily, does not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> ‚Ä¶i think better than others because it is not greasy and absorbs quickly leaving soft skin and hair.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive fair skin and have never had a problem with any of the insta natural products.  </li>
            <li> Great consistency, sinks in quickly, and my nails, hands and hair are starting too look better.</li>
            <li> It works amazing on aches and pains in hands, knees, back, shoulders, feet and where ever needed.</li>
            <li> This Emu Oil is completely fragrance free, which is a Huge bonus for me and my husband.  </li>
            <li> short this product is amazing and a must have.</li>
            <li> Great Product....have been using it for a few weeks and already saw results....</li>
            <li> I really did enjoy using the emu oil this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bath her in oatmeal and baking soda to calm her skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a deeply penetrating oil and the scent is nice.  </li>
            <li> Easily absorbed by face.  </li>
            <li> Easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> just under a month I used on hair to seal in moisture its great for that it left my hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not heavy on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have  been trying different products to find a moisturizer that i liked.  </li>
            <li> I love how InstaNatural products are all natural</li>
            <li> my mother, I get those thick cracked heels, no matter what kind of shoes, no matter what kind of treatment.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell for sure</li>
            <li> I have had healing success with it.</li>
            <li> but you are allergic or sensitive to most face creams</li>
            <li> Even the strongest hydro cortisone cream doesn&#x27;t help though, but I thought it was worth</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> it was so worth the money and</li>
            <li> So far, I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed and maintains softening effect throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> The Argan is a far better moisturizer for the skin.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it....</li>
            <li> Natural Emu Oil has replaced most of the products on our changing table.</li>
            <li> Was sent a complimentary bottle for being a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Leaving it on a couple hours prior to washing &amp; it does a nice job moisturizing it.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural goes through the process to ensure that their emu oil is safe, and completely sterile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rave reviews on Amazon convinced me that this Emu Oil was worth a try</li>
            <li> All reviewers on Amazon agree that this is a useful product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received two emails from this company, simply check-ins to see how I liked my product.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying my old moisturizer again, emu oil works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have so far used it for the latter two purposes and it has worked very nicely.  </li>
            <li> This is great stuff and while it has many different uses, I have mainly used this on my daughter&#x27;s upper arm.</li>
            <li> fibromyalgia emu oil is great for my stiff, crampy muscles and joints.</li>
            <li> Feels a bit oily at first but quickly soaks into your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like an oil/cream at first, but it absorbs so quickly that it isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is also good for other purposes as well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping; Great product; Comes in dark bottle to keep in fresh.</li>
            <li> This one comes in a nicer container, but it&#x27;s not as good as some other Emu oil</li>
            <li> Clears up dryness right away.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for my right knee and</li>
            <li> I received my item right away, well packaged</li>
            <li> I started using this product particularly on my right knee</li>
            <li> I massage it into my skin right after i take a shower</li>
            <li> Anyway, it soaked right into my hands.  </li>
            <li> With all these opportunities to test our this oil, I started right away.  </li>
            <li> This product intrigued me and they sent it right away.  </li>
            <li> now I got the right one &amp; the packing</li>
            <li> It actually rubs in well, absorbs quickly just like they claim, which makes it easy to put on after I shower and my skin be clean and non oily when I put my clothing on.  </li>
            <li> The product is TOP notch, it comes in a dark brown glass bottle, you get a lot for your money , there&#x27;s a convenient dispenser top</li>
            <li> I have OK skin texture to start with, but I do have some light age spots and minor Redness.  </li>
            <li> The oil is very easy to rub into your skin and there is no gross greasy feeling once applied.</li>
            <li> Emu oil is supposed to be good for hair growth, but I recently learned that it has to be applied generously nightly, then washed the following day, repeating the process for several weeks in order to get good results.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a strong smell which is good because lots of 100% pure oils have a raw scent to them.</li>
            <li> Though, I do find I don&#x27;t really use it that often in the month I have had it, I find nothing really special about it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to reapply it after using it, it absorbs quickly &amp; just like that, smooth, soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> Her hair is super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends and family as it really feels good on dry skin.</li>
            <li> When I started using Emu Oil he was quick to notice it was a similar love affair to that of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I normal use it in the spring, fall and  summer because it is so light on my face ( replace my face cream) and body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great make up remover (then cleanse face as usual), I&#x27;ve also used it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try because it said good for dark marks and acne.</li>
            <li> I went through my first bottle so quickly and am excited to get a new bottle.</li>
            <li> Go light and easy, especially the first time.</li>
            <li> The best benefit that I have found from using the Emu oil is that my legs aren&#x27;t as dry as normal, and I can actually shave faster and easier without nicking myself as often.  </li>
            <li> It is indeed soothing, the healing ability for inflammation, redness and other skin irritation is exceptional.</li>
            <li> First, it seems oily but its like his skin just sucked it right up within seconds</li>
            <li> This bottle is large!</li>
            <li> It gives hair a soft touch, manageable, easy to comb feel and also moisturizes the scalp.</li>
            <li> but it is dry effective at keeping skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> It really did help tremendously in my healing.</li>
            <li> It is whitish in color as it suppose to be, very oily, yet absorbs into the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Works well as a moisturizer, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t really leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> The emu oil I got was fresh, a light clear to cream color, and was labeled as being 100%</li>
            <li> I had purchased another brand at the same time, but this one is far superior.</li>
            <li> so now I&#x27;m using it on my own dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like that this product absorbs so quickly</li>
            <li> My face soaks it in so nicely, but not to the point where I feel like I&#x27;m still dry.</li>
            <li> I rubbed this oil on and my skin soaked it right in making it feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Shipped very fast, too.</li>
            <li> and I very much like them all.</li>
            <li> It is very very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase and use this product and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my face under my makeup, and it doesn&#x27;t take very much at all, I have also been trying it on my hair like some of the reviews</li>
            <li> thank you for offering a quality product and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This oil very gently nourishes your skin and hair so that it can repair itself and stay moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and does not leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, there&#x27;s a good brand from Montana Ranch that&#x27;s about twice as much</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than other brands, lasts a long time and works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally soothing on a hangnail, and makes my cuticles super easy to push back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good and is working on my thin edges which beginning to get thicker</li>
            <li> I had shingles for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li> A couple very liberal applications and the shingles were GONE!</li>
            <li> I have tried and researched many Emu products for the last seven years.  </li>
            <li> Use on face and neck...keeps skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have to say most people don&#x27;t care to follow up consistently with items that they are selling but the service here is undeniably terrific!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Argan Oil and was turned on to Emu Oil about eight months and really enjoyed my experience with it.  </li>
            <li> Although i am from Australia and there&#x27;s supossed to be heaps of Emu oil, this is my first time using Emu Oil.</li>
            <li> I used almond oil before, but Emu oil is definitely different and more moisturising but not sticky.</li>
            <li> I like this product, most creams promote skin problems, especially oily skin</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Emu Oil.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> They are willing to go above and beyond to make sure you are content with your experience of their product.  </li>
            <li> Just starting using it, I can&#x27;t wait to see more results.</li>
            <li> Funny story</li>
            <li> Better to know exactly what you are using than what comes off the shelves in the big retail stores</li>
            <li> Initially, I was so pleased with this oil.</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> I love this oil,I use it at night and morning, one pump is enough.</li>
            <li> The results were instant for her knees, she feels better.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.....</li>
            <li> I will be buying more each time I run short.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and will report back if there is anything noteworthy.  :-)</li>
            <li> first thing in the morning and by nighttime my face would begin to itch</li>
            <li> The first time I used this oil, my skin felt immediately softer.</li>
            <li> so sometimes I use the Emu Oil first and follow with a scented lotion.</li>
            <li> and I only love the feel.</li>
            <li> Thanks Phil!</li>
            <li> They really care about their customers!</li>
            <li> and I find it refreshing at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first bottle</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use this emu oil.</li>
            <li> The packaging is exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li> The Pure Emu Oil is quite emollient and seems to soak right into the skin.</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying the EMU Oil</li>
            <li> so can be applied just by itself or mixed with your favorite butter (coco.</li>
            <li> My first bottle arrived leaking &amp; I emailed the seller with my concerns.</li>
            <li> sure enough, I started noticing redness under my bust.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love how it hydrates my skin after facial scrubs.</li>
            <li> When I first read that this was Emu oil</li>
            <li> After reading up about it, I learned that it can be used in so many different ways.</li>
            <li> Because I wanted to make sure that it was the Emu Oil that was making the difference, I chose two specific places to apply it.</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed, which I really like.</li>
            <li> I first used Emu oil over 5 months ago</li>
            <li> The healthy benefits of emu oil actually aid the body at all levels.</li>
            <li> find that emu oil can be effective for a wide range of applications</li>
            <li> find that emu oil can be effective for a wide range of applications</li>
            <li> I prefer to open the bottle and use a cue tip to spread the oil on my leg which allows me a better control of where the oil lands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what we ordered.  </li>
            <li> I  use this on my face and neck first thing in the morning and at bedtime.</li>
            <li> feels so silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Its more of a milky white goo that oils your skin without feeling oily to the touch once its rubbed in all the way.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to see if the Emu oil would help keep my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed on contact was how smoothly it applied and how incredibly soft it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> it shines in the sun so much that i have been getting compliments on it on what i am using!</li>
            <li> I rub the oil between my forefinger, middle finger and thumb, then I spread along my eyelashes-bottom and top.</li>
            <li> Especially for my thighs :)</li>
            <li> so far.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped  fast!.</li>
            <li> ‚ÄúOnly had this for one day and I love the way it feels on my skin can&#x27;t wait to&lt;br /&gt;see results .</li>
            <li> The first night I used this oil</li>
            <li> The next day, the top layer of the spot peeled off (which had happened before)</li>
            <li> but it has ended up being something I really like!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> still love my coconut oil for lots of things, but this one is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> It has really helped!</li>
            <li> I didn‚Äôt realize what Emu Oil was at first until I researched it a bit.</li>
            <li> and will definitely be ordering more when my supply gets low.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all I received my oil within two days.</li>
            <li> The Emu oil immediately gave it a more youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;The bags under my eyes upon contact with Emu got smaller.</li>
            <li> Lightning fast delivery!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Formula is clear, refined, free of any particles or scent.</li>
            <li> but I emailed them to make them aware because I cut the tips of my fingers &amp; had class embedded in them.  </li>
            <li> First time buyer of this product and</li>
            <li> The texture of my facial skin is a lot better then before taking it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> so the first thing I did was to look up what is an Emu.</li>
            <li> I first tried emu oil on my dog&#x27;s ears.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> One to tell me more about the product after I purchased through Amazon and one earlier today asking how the product has worked for me.  </li>
            <li> But first, I have to talk about InstaNatural customer service.</li>
            <li> I mentioned this in my response - she asked what I was interested in and after I explained, she recommended I try Emu Oil and sent me some to try.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing my hair in locs for about five years but have never been able to figure out what to put in my hair to keep it healthy, and moisturized; this product along with a few others has done wonders for me!</li>
            <li> makes it smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> He said I looked more like I was 6 months out from surgery instead of only two!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to run it under hot water before using it</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I used it for a burn on my finger from a hot pan</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this Emu Oil, I purchased another brand of Emu oil, which came in a 1oz bottle and a higher price.</li>
            <li> First time user</li>
            <li> but I will most definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I use this emu oil and my skin is perfectly soft and smooth and there is no irritation from the Retin-A.</li>
            <li> When I first got to try [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> (this company REALLY wants to insure customer satisfaction!)</li>
            <li> This Emu Oil is really something!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my face and it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy, but very hydrated!    </li>
            <li> Oral biologics used to treat psoriasis have many detrimental side effects to overall health.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used EMU OIL.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more from Instanatural.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I&#x27;ve used that I can apply it once and be done.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of those products that have so many uses that you wonder why would you ever buy anything else.</li>
            <li> My skin looks moisturizer and healthy, not dry with thick cream on top of it like most lotions do.  </li>
            <li> I was getting direct from New Zealand and love it.</li>
            <li> Even tho my skin is already very smooth, there are certain areas on my chest &amp; back that aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I contacted them after receiving my first order warm in the package due to hot weather.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for providing a high quality, all natural product that really does work and super quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I was happy because normally most of the oils that I have tried in my hair are somewhat thick, greasy, have a scent, and are heavy, but this oil is actually pretty light.</li>
            <li> Within minutes my skin&#x27;s natural moisture is restored instantly, morning puffiness is completely gone and it keeps your face perfectly moisturized throughout the entire day;</li>
            <li> I love oils, especially when they are in its pure form (i.e. 100% ).</li>
            <li> Alopecia was my primary reason for ordering, so I will give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> However, on your hands or other areas it is really nice.</li>
            <li> but this time it was completely flattened and the color was significantly lightened as well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it for my lips but have found other nice uses.</li>
            <li> The older scar was somewhat faded to begin with and has now really started to disappear, and the newer one, which was lumpy and bright pink, is now much smoother and lighter in color.</li>
            <li> I am a busy mother who tends to order from Amazon because it seems to make purchasing fast and hassle free.</li>
            <li> My skin texture was left rough and my pores were greatly enlarged.</li>
            <li> I have used emu oil before gotten from some Australian seller but for whatever reason this product seems to be more effective that the previous version I tried.</li>
            <li> Emu oil is supposed to have anti-inflammatory properties, which is why I am using it, and this product does work to calm the skin, particularly after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for anyone that wants a healthy looking and feeling face.</li>
            <li> I bought this on my own and this is a completely unbiased personal review.</li>
            <li> and I love it so far as far as skin regimen goes.</li>
            <li> The emu oil also makes my skin very soft and the oil absorbs quickly without a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, amazing gel-like oil that I applied to the dry patches on my shoulders (eczema) and immediately saw the inflammation disappear.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face  and skin super soft!</li>
            <li> I mean all the top brands and this is now my favorite.</li>
            <li> Maybe my case is the exception, but I did not see positive effects when using emu oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I have heard positive things before regarding emu oil</li>
            <li> After the first application, we noticed the baby&#x27;s skin was much softer.</li>
            <li> As for the oil and other products I order from InstaNatural, they have been great, following up on my satisfaction with their products and offering helpful tips for their use.</li>
            <li> This product really does exactly what it states it will do.......</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles first time, just really want to give the product time to reflect all its benefits.</li>
            <li> I am using this on my skin at night, I really like how fast it absorbs!</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for the first time and our delivery was to our satisfaction and now my husband has been using this product and is&lt;br /&gt;seeing much improvement.</li>
            <li> WOW all the reviews I have read about this product are true.  </li>
            <li> I also liked that it comes in a dark glass bottle with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still trying to help restore my hair&#x27;s true beauty naturally.</li>
            <li> The product is oily but soaks in and leave the skin silky smooth, which is important, as I live in the hot dry southwest climate.</li>
            <li> I tried the emu oil and, it is still a little itchy, but not nearly as bad as it was; it seems to be getting better.  </li>
            <li> I am able to use it on my face along with some other favorite oils and have had numerous compliments on my complexion (I don&#x27;t wear makeup).</li>
            <li> I put more on that day and it looked even better the next day, after four days of Emu Oil on his eczema most of it was gone except the extremely bad patches but even those looked a million times better.</li>
            <li> Love this Emu oil, I am using it for dry skin on my elbows, feet and hands.</li>
            <li> It helps to heal the skin naturally and quickly.  </li>
            <li> That is going above and beyond what most normally do.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft, not oily.  </li>
            <li> The emu oil seems more healing of dry and irritated areas.</li>
            <li> Using it on cracked and dry heels and after about 2 weeks your skin will be healed and begin to look healthy.  </li>
            <li> It absorb easily and deeply, instead of floating on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> My youngest&#x27;s eczema isn&#x27;t getting better by using the oil, but by using this oil he isn&#x27;t itchy, because his elbow&#x27;s are so dry.  </li>
            <li> He gets really dry, itchy skin under his chin and on the top of his butt, as well as his belly.</li>
            <li> and I like how It leaves my skin soft and quickly absorbs</li>
            <li> EMU oil has helped with my dry scalp, and love the pump that comes on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Nothing better for dry skin in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for stellar customer service.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my dry hair when it has too much static or frizz.  </li>
            <li> It did make my skin soft and my hair super shiny</li>
            <li> I was just given a strong prescription for Retin-A which made my face like sandpaper that was constantly peeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would work great after bathing on rough spots like feet and heels, it would absorb quickly without making a mess if you apply at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I purchased InstaNatural 100% Pure Emu Oil to use on my face.  </li>
            <li> I was unfamiliar with Emu Oil when I received this Instanatural 100% pure oil for review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It says it&#x27;s 100% pure Emu oil, but it makes me wonder.</li>
            <li> and I certainly see difference.</li>
            <li> This is 100% pure &amp; fully refined emu oil, so it is hypoallergenic, and does not contain any contaminants.</li>
            <li> The ingedients could not be simpler -- 100% pure emu oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Emu Oil product a few weeks ago and it is a great moisturizing tool for my face and hands when used daily.  </li>
            <li> It has become part of my everyday routine most mornings and every night!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my face &amp; neck after a few days, and so much more  in 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li> I asked if heat would affect the quality of the emu oil and they instantly sent me a new bottle so that I felt safe while using their product on my child.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin super soft and conditions my split ends very well.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no smell, the oil absorbed in her skin VERY quickly and she didn&#x27;t mind using it...</li>
            <li> It feels really good on your skin, especially during the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> After deciding to take some steps in the right direction,  I added this emu oil to my new skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> next test and most important for me was finding something to help my pup&#x27;s skin and hair which had been feeling dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> A tiny amount of this product works extremely well, has no odor, and successfully treats these maladies.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product for free to review on my blog and was surprised at all the uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mainly got it for my hair trying to regrow it and it works!</li>
            <li> The EMU oil is very high quality, I use it to moisturize my hair and skin</li>
            <li> Very high quality oil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this InstaNatural Pure Emu Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I USE THIS INSTANATURAL 100% PURE EMU OIL FOR MY WHOLE BODY.  </li>
            <li> This Pure Emu Oil from InstaNatural is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for - and this product (100% Pure Emu Oil) is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> So far so good bought another brand from a health store &amp; paid twice as much for half as much.</li>
            <li> The results thus far have not been great or outstanding but then again I have only been using the oil for a month and a half and only apply once a week.</li>
            <li> Works great on the little pains of daily life.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and although I have only used it a few days it is working great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 2 weeks and can already tell a huge difference..</li>
            <li> This smooths and nourishes your skin very well.  </li>
            <li> This product has softened them so I am not picking at them as much.  </li>
            <li> I also use this as a moisturizer at night and gently rub it on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I can&#x27;t really see what it&#x27;s doing for but then again everything ain&#x27;t for everybody</li>
            <li> It might be too much for warmer months if you tend to be on the oily side already.</li>
            <li> It seems gentle and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work very well for my skin, however it work wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a skin product that really &amp;#34;makes a difference&amp;#34;  --</li>
            <li> After continued use, we have noticed that the cradle cap has drastically improved and her skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li> Really like this oil.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days a lot of the dryness had healed and my hands became much smoother.</li>
            <li> I used it on cuticles and nails which also became much smoother and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> oil doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.  </li>
            <li> Both of us are still very satisfied!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really really like this one.  </li>

            <li> It didn&#x27;t moisturize as expected, but I did notice that my toe nails and cuticles looked a lot better.</li>
            <li> I even treated my hair overnight for and it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> I like emu oil vey much and thought I&#x27;d try another brand.  </li>

            <li> It arrived in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it has really helped them all that much, but I also tried it on arthritic joints and it does seem to help with pain and stiffness-</li>

            <li> Very moisturizing and soothing.  </li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do what it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li> but it is very oily/greasy.  </li>
            <li> My nails do look so much healthier.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing for my skin unlike the Argan oil.</li>
            <li> too much easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> are high quality!</li>
            <li> I really like the InstaNatural product line.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I was frankly surprised how well this absorbed into my skin and improved the look.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing without  being oily.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect regarding emu oil since I&#x27;ve never used it before.</li>
            <li> or you will get a bit too much at once.</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing oil, and it has no odor at all.</li>
            <li> I do like the pump delivery system -- very convenient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to tell you the truth--when I read that it was Emu Oil, I was really nervous to try it out.</li>
            <li> Since I have eczema I am always looking for products I can use to moisturize my skin while not irritating it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs a rarity these days to find a Founder who really does care about how their product works for a client.  </li>
            <li> And ABSOLUTELY get it from the InstaNatural company.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say it did much for my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law uses it to promote hair growth and it is working very well.</li>
            <li> It has bird like smell and evidence that it has contain real ingredients from Emu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really softens and clears my skin away from blotches.</li>
            <li> I got my order in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li> It worked very well on nourishing the skin, while keeping the skin irritation to a minimum without two uses.</li>
            <li> I am very please with InstaNatural&#x27;s Emu Oil.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> But on the plus side they did have fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very healing on skin irritations.  </li>
            <li> I use it after a shower, and my skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> but this bottle not so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.  -lj</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much it did nothing for me</li>
            <li> was well done again thanks....</li>
            <li> I will purchase more in the near future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 yr old male and my skin looks better than it did when I was 21.  </li>
            <li> Its fatty acids claim help with inflammation (acute rather than chronic inflammation).</li>
            <li> The doctor has me on a topical steroid which only kind of helps and gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and neck at night with sandalwood therapeutic grade essential oil and wake up so soft, I just love it.</li>
            <li> It does work a little better if you apply it right after you shower</li>
            <li> Sometimes they felt great, other times they remained very dry.  </li>
            <li> In less than a week my heels are becoming smooth, soft and the cracks are healing.  </li>
            <li> and I must say that my skin feels so soft!!!  </li>
            <li> those old spots are just about gone!!!</li>
            <li> Other then that, pleased with it and surprised it showed up a day earlier. :)</li>
            <li> A single squirt goes a long way and offers great coverage.</li>
            <li> , I also have liver spots on my right hand and since using the Emu Oil, they have almost completely faded.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that unlike coconut oil which sometimes leaves me greasy and stains or transfers to clothing and other items, this one really absorbs.</li>
            <li> Mom really likes the product and it works much better than her other lotions that contain perfumes and chemicals.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is clean and professional and it has directions for use and benefits clearly printed on its label.</li>
            <li> I will be looking into more of the other products listed.</li>
            <li> It makes other products get deeper into the skin therefore work better, faster.</li>
            <li> It seems to absorb better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have used other emu oils but like this one much better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t bring myself to using it when there are so many other oils out there that don&#x27;t involve animal cruelty.</li>
            <li> So I googled other options, tried many</li>
            <li> I chose this product over others due to the many 5 and 4 star reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Emu Oil on my hair, scars &amp; stretch marks, all side effects due to chronic illness that wasn&#x27;t getting better</li>
            <li> but I can say I believe it was fantastic for quickly relieving the tight, burned skin.</li>
            <li> This 4-oz  bottle is a great value &amp; will last for a very long time since you only need a drop or two.</li>
            <li> During the winter when my face gets dry and flaky, this works very quickly.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t want to be without Emu Oil and like this particular type because of the way it dispenses the oil.  </li>
            <li> This particular brand seems to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling silky smooth, not oily, as long as too much isnt used.</li>
            <li> I rubbed this into his skin and was surprised that even though it was an oil, it absorbed quickly and left his skin feeling soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also applied to the tips of my long curly fine hair and it smoothed them too.  </li>
            <li> and plus it moisturize my dry skin and doesn‚Äôt leave any strong yucky smell.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a nice generous 4 ounce size, this will last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> InstaNatural has a very compelling version, which comes in a huge quantity that should last for a long time and what appears to be high quality oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have developed a number of skin issues and this oil is very gentle and helps with healing.  </li>
            <li> I use our Emu Oil every night to oil my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s scalp and it is very easy to apply and distribute with the pump nozzle and has a neutral smell so it works well with the other oils that I use to seal her hair nightly.</li>
            <li> The oil is pure and if you have any allergic skin conditions, emu oil is not likely to aggravate it as many cosmetics will with their preservatives and various chemicals additivies.</li>
            <li> Thanks Insta Natural!!</li>
            <li> I was left with a slight tan and that&#x27;s a miracle for my fair skin that always burns and peels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not only did the shipment arrive quickly, it also was very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> fine wrinkles, dry patches and bumps.</li>
            <li> ALL the swelling was gone, the bright red patches were now only slightly red.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use it on my face because my skin is pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li> see the TRUE benefits of this NATURAL deep penetrating non-greasy oil, you need to be consistent.</li>
            <li> see the TRUE benefits of this NATURAL deep penetrating non-greasy oil, you need to be consistent.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even describe just how good this product is, using it in only a short time made me actually stutter when trying to explain it on video review because this product needs no explanation!</li>
            <li> Also does wonders for my skin so far, fast too!</li>
            <li> This oil seems to get absorbed easily by the skin leaving your skin soft, I know longer have dark circles under my eye&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month haven&#x27;t any results really, maybe I&#x27;ll wait a little more</li>
            <li> There was a problem with the pump bottle and they sent a new product and a gift!</li>
            <li> I got this discounted for my review and this is honestly fabulous that my hubby is using it on his dry cracked hands that he gets from work.</li>
            <li> Because of my dry skin I&#x27;ve used a lot of moisturizers and creams to maintain smooth, moist skin.</li>
            <li> My dry cracked skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been able to use less pain killers.</li>
            <li> Next morning do a quick brush through and wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love the product, will keep it as part if my regular daily routine,</li>
            <li> This Emu Oil made a tremendous difference on my skin in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have cut back on my use on my face and my skin is actually feeling better.</li>
            <li> And because I have a chronic pain condition that requires a topical compounded rx from the pharmacy, I also apply the emu oil over top of it for the same reason-</li>
            <li> This product was the magic bullet that finally added the extra healing power I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my legs.</li>
            <li> This is working much better for me than the much-touted and more expensive Argan Oil I have been using.  </li>
            <li> Used it recently when I burned my thumb and it quickly healed.</li>
            <li> Our older children got sunburnt and it worked on that...</li>
            <li> that was my main focus.</li>
            <li> Mostly what I discovered was that most  Emu-type products are cut with lots of other ingredients, and contain very little real Emu oil.  </li>
            <li> After years of being not so nice to my skin by using water that was too hot and exfoliating too often and  too roughly,  I now have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for those with skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company and their products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> , I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> you are a bit timid as to trying this, I highly suggest purchasing it and giving it a try of your own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found out about this product line from a close friend who highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company and their product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommed this seller &amp; this product.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face cream now.. highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use a Derma Roller &amp; then put on the oil which I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all of their products</li>
            <li> So I ordered after watching a YouTube skin care video about it being used as a moisturizer before bedtime as well as in the AM with a moisturizer that has a high SPF.</li>
            <li> Have noticed softer skin within a week of using this product i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and this ranks high.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with a few other oils I&#x27;ve ordered from InstaNaturals</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love this product and so far every other InstaNatural product that I have tried.</li>
            <li> For example, when our youngest came home from the hospital, I was using coconut oil for nursing relief, chapped lips, dry hands, after bath baby moisturizer, dry hair, on boo boo&#x27;s for the older children, as eye make up remover, as a butter substitute for flipping pancakes and making cookies, and honestly...</li>
            <li> that it is a natural and pure oil that I&#x27;m applying to my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working it&#x27;s magic, and a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> chi  area from waxing little better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cuticles&lt;br /&gt;Rubbed a little on my Cuticles every night and woke up too softer better skin around Cuticles by the morning time.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars because the oil is good, but the price (while decent for Amazon) is not great.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin and hair feel really soft and healthy, which is a big accomplishment, especially as we grow older.  </li>
            <li> This is different, when I use the 100% pure emu oil it seems thick and oily at first, but once it soaks in it feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> but so far I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> After using this for a week the wrinkles and scars are gone, its very moist, and extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is emolient, soft odorless and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> whole composition of emu oil is very similar to our skin&#x27;s own fatty acid composition</li>
            <li> it really makes my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Tried using it on the rough surfaces of my skin and it is light weight and just smoothed the callouses.  </li>
            <li> Will give it a few more uses.  </li>
            <li> Although the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, it has a very odd / particular scent to it.</li>
            <li> Once it absorbed, I could tell there was instant relief.</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried this oil on my hands it left it moisturized like a fresh manicure feeling.</li>
            <li> I found this Emu oil useful in several ways.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother, less sensitive, just more &#x27;normal&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> So I rubbed a little bit on last night, and by this morning, my heels already looked better!  </li>
            <li> bottle is great since it has a pump feature, it makes things less messy.</li>
            <li> Before my hair was dry but now, my hair is smooth, soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> I received this on a day where his eczema was out of control, so many swollen red patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both had some troublesome dry skin on our hands that regular hand lotion never seemed to be able to eliminate.</li>
            <li> and it gets absorbed quickly) in the night for a few days and twice</li>
            <li> I experimented with the right amount, and I think I decided I actually prefer using this on my hair instead of</li>
            <li> It goes on the face smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a ridiculous oily film and that is what I can&#x27;t stand most as someone with moderately oily skin.</li>
            <li> and they all claimed emu oil to by a miracle oil for a huge number of things from joint pain to extreme moisture.</li>
            <li> My previous two other Emu oils from other companies are a lot thicker, milkier in color and more effective.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li> It has been warming up where I live and</li>
            <li> It is my new &amp;#34;natural moisturizer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I have to say After using it I don&#x27;t think that I can live without it ....</li>
            <li> I have told all of my friends &amp; family about this product, so you can expect some new orders</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Emu oil.</li>
            <li> Now add the fact that I live in Tampa Bay, FL where the humidity is kicking all the time</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already seeing new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I use it over top of my facial treatment products because it literally &#x27;pushes&#x27; the product into your skin which makes it more effective (and you can use less of those expensive skin treatments!)</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m missing something but didn&#x27;t really notice huge change in hair or skin from tho oil.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and  cured by dry scalp (dandruff).</li>
            <li> it really grew one of my relative hair,it really cure</li>
            <li> a dry oil that quickly soaks in, unlike an almond oil, for example.  </li>
            <li> And its light enough to use on your regular hair if you&#x27;re going through the transiting period.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is a gentle enough product to use on things like sunburns, bug bites, etc.  </li>
            <li> The surface is smooth again and my pores are starting to get smaller (</li>
            <li> If you have super dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have battled dry skin since I was young and have tried many different oils and lotions.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to see what it could do for patches of dry skin (took care of them with no trouble) but in the process I also applied it to a couple of 1-2 year old surgical scars and am amazed by the results!</li>
            <li> Using this during a very dry Minnesota winter will be the true test.</li>
            <li> The oil is a very clear consistency.</li>
            <li> Included very clear expiration date.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin very soft, and dehydrated.</li>
            <li> This just disappears and leaves my skin so very soft.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good quality Emu Oil without any unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft</li>
            <li> I also have very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin looking and feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and since then my hair became very soft.</li>
            <li> I used oil for my hair and it made it very soft.</li>
            <li> I Googled them but was able to find out very little about who they are as a company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin is completely clear!</li>
            <li> bottle has a small pump top.</li>
            <li> The seller was EXTREMELY customer service oriented and even sent a personal email asking how I enjoyed it, what I was using it for, etc.</li>
            <li> I have received emails from the seller several times, first giving me helpful hints about using the oil</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel so incredibly soft, and look noticeably healthier!</li>
            <li> Wow!..  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this oil - it comes in a fairly dark amber bottle, which helps to protect the oil.  </li>
            <li> With regard to my face, it doesn&#x27;t look much different except when I first wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not messy at all!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and I will definitely be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> , I have a small spot of psoriasis on my temple that I have treated with many types of oils and creams to no avail.</li>
            <li> , it was pretty deep.</li>
            <li> Our cats even love it in small doses...</li>
            <li> Now, when I see one developing, at nighttime I just rub a tiny bit of this oil into my cuticle area, and when I wake up the next morning, my hands are soft and smooth and the hangnail is gone.</li>
            <li> I also add it to my hair to keep moisture because I color is blonde so much!</li>
            <li> She has a large family so social issues are not involved in obtaining this oil.</li>
            <li> Come to find out, it comes from the fat of an Australian flightless bird, emus, so it has to go through a very careful process to ensure safe usage for people.</li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference in my&lt;br /&gt;very sensitive, dry, reactive skin!!!  </li>
            <li> I also like the pump bottle a little better than the dropper bottle as it is a little easier to keep everything clean.</li>
            <li> We cook for them and clean after them daily, and TLC cameras are following this emu tribe everywhere they go, including showing how the oil is obtained.</li>
            <li> Not easy absorbing, or soft oil free feeling at all.</li>
            <li> It seems to be high quality and works better than any other moisturizer that I have used to treat a some dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> has a full back tattoo, and he said it definitely kept the itching at bay.&lt;br /&gt;A+ product!</li>
            <li> It sinks into the skin quickly leaving no oily residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s enough to moisturize my skin nicely without leaving my tub slick &amp; unsafe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very thick</li>
            <li> with emu its clear the problem and my skin very soft ..</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very soft and young...</li>
            <li> In only one week of use I am noticing a positive improvement in the redness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> So I see that as a positive aspect that this Emu oil is actually helping.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to using this product, along with coconut oil and castor oil, I can actually see new hair growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a Long, Long way so this bottle should last our family a good long while.  </li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t overly dry, but this soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> Initially when I learned about its use for a large variety of skin issues I was somewhat sceptical.</li>
            <li> is my second bottle of this pure emu oil.</li>
            <li> Terrific price for large amount.</li>
            <li> This brand costs the same as one of those (one called Pure Emu Oil for instance that comes in a plastic amber bottle sold here at Amazon)</li>
            <li> , a little more time will tell, but it definitely made my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get lucky because other products Emu Oil didn&#x27;t work on my hair until I found InstaNatural&#x27;s Emu Oil.</li>
            <li> Did it clear up her eczema?</li>
            <li> My skin is clear.</li>
            <li> I wake up and they are still soft.  </li>
            <li> Makes them soft and mascara just flows on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> and I was surprised it worked.</li>
            <li> I would ONLY recommend to use it at night as it gives you a VERY shiny sheen.</li>
            <li> He has notoriously sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to smells and often discontinue use of a product because I can&#x27;t take the smell</li>
            <li> I asked my daughter to rub some of this on my back and it truly has helped to decrease the pain that I was feeling and it didn&#x27;t take much time at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will be staying near by at all</li>
            <li> I just decided to try this as a pre shave oil today and WOW</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft,</li>
            <li> I naturally have a dehydration problem.  </li>
            <li> and I am already seeing a change in how fast my hair is growing back.</li>
            <li> I did not notice anything as far as pain relief.</li>
            <li> I alsoo have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t think that it would do much, so I didn&#x27;t put in the work or effort of using it.</li>
            <li> I couple this oil with some essential oils for sore muscles, and my husband and I both feel a much quicker, deeper relief.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feels soft.</li>
            <li> Has my skin feeling soft</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and stays protected all day.  </li>
            <li> Together they have made my hair naturally soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and it really does work well for me.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/dry skin, which is also quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any decrease in the lines and wrinkles ...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combo skin</li>
            <li> It does moisturize well but doesn&#x27;t always absorb really well especially on the face.</li>
            <li> They sent me a follow up email with helpful tips and have been very conscientious, especially for a rather inexpensive item.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really helped to give my skin an extra moisture boost.</li>
            <li> The product is the same as the one at the Body Piercing Shop, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I try to heal myself and my livestock naturally with natural products, but after over two months of trying everything else</li>
            <li> It leaves skin soft and eliminates dryness.</li>
            <li> it gives me a natural shine and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down(but</li>
            <li> I came across Emu Oil when reading about natural recipes for hair and body products replacements.  </li>
            <li> The company sent a personal email asking about product satisfaction and I feel appreciated.  </li>
            <li> I like the pump action and the way the oil feels when it goes on.</li>
            <li> I have quite sensitive skin and this product has caused no problems, irritation or redness or blemishes.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> Just sooo soft and my skin drinks it up.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural Emu oil keeps my face SOFT as baby skin and&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have any sprains or swelling, apply a few drops and apply light bandage.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> If you have any sprains or swelling, apply a few drops and apply light bandage.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised with how well this worked.  </li>
            <li> Their products are 100% natural and organic.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the closest I&#x27;ve gotten to all that emu oil is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Another unexpected bonus has been my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> After several applications of the oil on my cracked hands and cuticles, I noticed that my skin was so much softer and no longer cracked.</li>

            <li> This product really helped reduce the red inflamed areas of my face.</li>

            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I have NATURAL hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance, which works well for some of my friends who are sensitive to this.  </li>

            <li> I am using it on my legs and so far it seems to be helping.</li>

            <li> Congratulations to insta natural .</li>
            <li> Anti-aging rejuvenation scalp serum, OGX biotin and collagen shampoo and conditioner, and insta natural emu oil before I retire for the night.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 18 month old daughters eczema.</li>
            <li> and so far it is working great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;No irritation noted so far</li>
            <li> just change Insta &amp; add a s to the end of natural.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ll just say WOW at their response.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this is going to work on old stretch marks</li>
            <li> I am prone to breakouts and so far (2 weeks in)</li>
            <li> The Insta Natural Emu oil was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get fooled by the &amp;#34;Best Natural Oil&amp;#34; advertisement.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW.  </li>
            <li> FOR A LONG TIME NOW, BUT THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME USING IT FOR MYSELF.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the hopes that it would clear up my 7 month old daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair and skin soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged from constant relaxing and bleaching processes.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this oil, you don&#x27;t need to use much so the bottle will last a while, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing a natural oil cleanse for a while.</li>
            <li> , I was pleasantly surprised at how beneficial it is.</li>
            <li> Ny hair is so soft, and no frizz.</li>
            <li> No messy.</li>
            <li> She always gets this upper rash on her arm and has intense itching from it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that this product can work on aches and pains, but I haven&#x27;t tried it for that yet.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are almost completely gone after about two months of consecutive use.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft now.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised upon testing this oil because I don&#x27;t notice a smell to it at all.  </li>
            <li> It is so hydrating and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about it when I first received it, nut it has been so useful.  </li>
            <li> I am ordering a few more bottles to keep one in my bag and one at home and of course to have a back up.  </li>
            <li> I also use the Rose Water Toner in the shower to wash my hair and hair shedding as decreased and the comb just glides through my hair.</li>
            <li> Works really good on my nails not sure about hair because it&#x27;s being paired with other products!</li>
            <li> The itching subsided and with consistent use, I do not have that flaky, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> As an all natural oil it claims to be rich in fatty acids and provides moisturizing benefits to the hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Since then, it has been a consistent skin softening moisturizer with every single use.</li>
            <li> The more I use it, the less dry and wrinkly my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> It instantly relives the tightness of dry skin, and absorbs quickly- leaving no greasiness.</li>
            <li> I will soon be 50 years old and so for the past year I have been trying many different moisturizers, face creams, etc.  </li>
            <li> This fatty acid is a known enhancer for transport&lt;br /&gt;of bioactive compounds into the skin and has the ability to be absorbed quickly and penetrate deeply when applied externally.</li>
            <li> In the past few years I experienced hair loss and I tried endless number of hair supplements but nothing really worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It quickly worked to get rid of the dryness and over time, my hands have been feeling softer and definitely less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She really likes the pump on top so there is less waste.</li>
            <li> Not sure if more than what simple olive oil would do, it does help.</li>
            <li> I add a few &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; of this to my lotion after a shower and my skin stays soft overnight as well as using it full strength on my face.   </li>
            <li> I have used a different Emu oil in the past, but this one works so much better.  </li>
            <li> It made my deep wrinkles fine and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Even better, it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> You can use this valuable oil over dry patches on your face or hands and knees, or anywhere that needs a little more tender care.</li>
            <li> When one ages, the skin gets paper thin and very easily scratched when working in the yard.  </li>
            <li> and it is obviously a high quality oil that I will continue to purchase in the future from this seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this for anyone, young or old, that want to clear up dry skin.</li>
            <li> With so many claims I was both curious and slightly sceptical.</li>
            <li> B00756HQNQ Microplane Colossal Pedicutre Rasp Brown]], and use it with the same technique as your sandpaper type file or pumice, on bone dry feet.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film behind.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft on a daily basis and is very natural;  does not clog the pores.  </li>
            <li> which was bothersome if I stood too long or walked too much.  </li>
            <li> Again, as long as too much isnt used, does not leave hair feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I saw changes immediately and within 5 days my skin was finally back to normal</li>
            <li> Not only is it fragrance free, it&#x27;s a thick oil closer to a gel, that really absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering this brand and it seems a little nicer than my previous brand and the price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I think with constant use on my arms and legs they will begin to look less dry and become more soft and supple.</li>
            <li> On the swollen hives, it didn&#x27;t really do much to make them go away, or itch less overall, but it seemed a bit soothing when first applied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the oil for a couple of weeks and only use a few drops at a time - very fast and positive results!</li>
            <li> I am going to try applying it with essential oils to my boyfriends newly reconstructed ankle and skin, and see how it helps with healing and scarring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new with my experimentation of essential oils and have been reading and studying their uses.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this product, recently ordering a new supply.</li>
            <li> Works really well for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I don‚Äôt really care for it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has suffered from dry patches of skin her whole life.</li>
            <li> I use a bit on my skin in dry areas and it really helps with the dryness without leaving the area too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it really help with my dry winter skin all over, even my face.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face like I do with their argan oil, and it really helps with the dry</li>
            <li> My complexion in a few short days has gone from dry and weathered looking underneath and greasy on top, to  a soft, radiant glow.  </li>
            <li> really recommend it if you have problems of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my baby&#x27;s eczema less blotchy and is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super dry at the moment, but by the end of the summer I&#x27;ll need to trim off the dry hair from all the time at the pool and beach.  </li>
            <li> Especially when we&#x27;re at our 2nd home in Idaho, the high-desert is very drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of daily application to my face, it was very noticeable that the scars from an accident last fall, faded and the area where I had stitches, the swelling was reduced.</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts even though it&#x27;s reduced facial dryness and is an excellent base for foundation.</li>
            <li> Other Emu oil has a grade like AA or similar but I was amazed by the high number of reviewers and the positive feedback</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> While I was not sure about using it on myself because it was animal based my sister was excited to try it on her daughter who has severe cradle cap and what looks to be eczema.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have tried Emu Oil so I cannot compare to other brands.</li>
            <li> One star off for being an animal product which I don&#x27;t advocate for but had no other choice with the state of my skin and hair these days.</li>
            <li> But after rubbing it in those areas after a shower,  the next morning I noticed a considerable difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I trust it enough to let my 14 year old daughter use it!</li>
            <li> I see major improvements in over all skin texture and color.  </li>
            <li> Most scar treatments take at least 8 weeks so we will see how it goes!</li>
            <li> no smell that I can detect, but when it goes on my skin it does react with the skin and gives off a very faint and natural smell which is pleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition to using on my hair, I have just begun experiment to see how well this Emu Oil will work on a couple of old bug bites from several months back that left the skin area much darker.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using easily available tools, and not the hours of wet or dry buffing you might have already tried, you can get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> Emu oil has made such a huge difference in my life this past year.</li>
            <li> I purchased this emu oil as a general, multipurpose oil for my family.</li>
            <li> Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li> However, it is clear from the way my eyebrows have responded, that it would totally work.</li>
            <li> Finally, I had some spider veins that were lasered and the healing process seemed to be taking so long, after rubbing this in one night the discoloration from that procedure was really reduced.</li>
            <li> and when I wake up the next morning my skin is so soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to put too much on.  </li>
            <li> but so far its coming back.</li>
            <li> Something takes a long time to penetrate my facial skin, unless I gently dab it on or barely use it.</li>
            <li> my husband uses the product on his feet nightly, his soles no longer have cracks from being bare footed.&lt;br /&gt;Again</li>
            <li> Apparently works.</li>
            <li> and my scar is barely visible now.</li>
            <li> but you can barely read it because of the label color and print.</li>
            <li> I put a drop onto my fingertips and massaged it onto the red areas at night, and within 3 days the heat rash was completely gone.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have applied the Emu Oil for nearly two weeks now, and it has made a definite difference.</li>
            <li> How I use the emu oil,,,,I use this Emu oil on my daughters whole body after her bath while her body is still wet.</li>
            <li> I am 60 and constantly get compliments on how young my skin</li>
            <li> Does barely to nothing.. to your skin..</li>
            <li> At 33 years old I use naturals products like aloe Vera and coconut oil to keep my skin youthful and I am definitely adding this to my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> if by chance you don&#x27;t like it the company offers a 100 day, 100% money back policy.</li>
            <li> assisting in putting a house back together after I had to have it completely gutted.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> The rash has just about completely diminished and the itching was gone almsot instantly.</li>
            <li> With my old moisturizer, if I put it around my neckline I would break out the next morning, but with this oil I can put it all over my face and neck without any breakouts.</li>
            <li> It seems thick and greasy when I first put it on my face, but after I gently rub it in, the greasiness goes away</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is another holy grail product from InstaNatural that I will highly recommend to those dealing with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone who has any type of dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> &amp; I will definitely come back because I&#x27;m seriously can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> far, the pumping mechanism of the nozzle works very well at delivering a consistent flow of the oil without getting too messy, which was an issue I&#x27;ve dealt with with other products.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my extra dry areas.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Emu oil to use on my one year old daughters sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> I normally let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> It may not feel like you are using enough to do anything, but it is easy to go overboard and create flat hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to people with dry skin!</li>
            <li> I use this in my curly natural hair to add moisture just after washing my hair and also before blow drying to flat iron.</li>
            <li> The poor guy has a bright pink belly, chin and paws all summer long and nothing I apply or give to him seems to work.</li>
            <li> The bottle warns that a little goes a long way, and it is true.  </li>
            <li> It is little oily but that goes away within few minutes and you will feel better when you wake up.</li>
            <li> At the same time our children (for various reasons) have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Emu oil is part of the current trend of using natural oils and extracts to essentially replace every chemical-laden salve, lotion, and potion.  </li>
            <li> When I applied the oil on my wet hair it definitely made my hair very shiny</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling moist not dry....</li>
            <li> It is not dry anymore</li>
            <li> It is comparable to a far more expensive one I was using.</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbs in my skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product, I admit I was a little bit unsure.</li>
            <li> Also love the pump dispenser, a lot less messy than the dropper!</li>
            <li> , my hair generally takes 4hours+ to dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> actually planned to write this review earlier, but I actually found a new use for this last night.</li>
            <li> The second place was my cuticles, which are generally damaged.</li>
            <li> I used it straight, as well as in combination with castor oil and some other essential oils known for skin healing properties.</li>
            <li> so I have no long term affect.</li>
            <li> I used it for muscle soreness a few times at night and it seems to really work!  </li>
            <li> Every year his skin allergies seem to get worse; they last longer and have become more severe and spread to larger areas.</li>
            <li> The oil left behind a pretty glow to my skin without feeling greasy, it made my skin look pretty.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and it gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses it after she gives herself a chemical peel and it calms her skin down and moisturizes it very well.</li>
            <li> 4 oz bottle was bigger than I expected and should last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I had never used it before, as with other instaNatural products, they are easy to dispense and just a few drops leave your skin well moisturized and glowing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Insta Natural 100% PURE ULTRA PREMIUM EMU OIL, is non-greasy, odorless, has a thick translucent milky color (depending on the seasons)&lt;br /&gt;and when applied, it deeply penetrates the roots and conditions the hair leaving it feeling extra soft and manageable; not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have other high end oils</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> previous oil was a flip-top, this is a much easier dispenser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I happened to apply some of this Emu Oil to my hair, still allowing for it to dry naturally.....</li>
            <li> Our youngest is 7 months old and has dry patches</li>
            <li> The oil itself feels very light, it has the same consistency of almond or olive oil, not too heavy yet a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I think that you can find Emu oil for a cheaper price, but I really wanted something in a glass bottle that I could reuse for homemade skincare that included essential oils (which eventually break down plastic)</li>
            <li> I really like the pump bottle this has, easier to dole out a drop or two at a time without having to mess around with removing and replacing a cap while you have oil in your hands.</li>
            <li> The oil has a history of being used on all skin types but especially to help those with sensitive, dry and flaking skin.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the emu oil has lessened the effects of psoriasis, leaving skin much smoother and less irritated and red.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge plus for me because I hate strong fragrances.</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged mother of VERY young children  (3  under the age of 5) &amp; didn&#x27;t want to look like their grandmother.  </li>
            <li> Based on what I have read my experience may be unique - an allergic reaction of sorts - so my opinion is only that emu oil is not good for me.</li>
            <li> I am 81 years old and recovering from hives and rash that left my skin red and dry.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I used a little too much</li>
            <li> Got a little too much sun and got a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I tend to just feel oily when I put this on no matter how or how little or how much I used.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount in my hair, and it is less dry and more manageable.</li>
            <li> First, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use if you have a cold, just simply apply a little in your nose.</li>
            <li> I only use a little, but it isn&#x27;t instantly absorbed into my skin as other reviewers have said it does.  </li>
            <li> Other sources of top grade emu oil come in less expensive, but take longer to ship, and we are a now society ;)</li>
            <li> I have applied in an area where skin was inflamed and next day it looked flat and not red like the nite before.</li>
            <li> Sadly, EMU oil isn&#x27;t as popular in the states as it is in other countries.</li>
            <li> I noticed that a little goes a long way, and it was VERY hydrating to my hands.</li>
            <li> I get bruised on my arm  all the time  , due to old age.  </li>
            <li> show it keeps my hair looking extremely shiny and natural.</li>
            <li> This has some other natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I apply emu oil daily after the shower and my skin is noticeably less red and sensitive to touch.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair with dry ends and the emu oil did wonders.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not so sure how PURE this product is.</li>
            <li> Hubby has been using the InstaNatural 100% Pure Emu oil after shaving for a few weeks now and LOVES IT!  </li>
            <li> I really like the pump bottle that gives small spritzes of the oil since you don&#x27;t need a lot per application.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product gets so much attention.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, how much I like this product.  </li>
            <li> Well I haven&#x27;t use it long enough to see if it help with growth</li>
            <li> This will be my fourth bottle and plan to be a life long customer.</li>
            <li> I also use this after chemical peels and it works the same, helping to keep my skin moisturized for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell you if it helps for that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big bottle at 4 ounces and has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> This should last a long time the way I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps protect the hair from dage caused during heat treatment like flat ironing and blow-drying.</li>
            <li> I notice that the pain has slowly been decreasing and I am not wincing when I take my first steps of the day.</li>
            <li> the product tells it all and does exactly what it should after the shower i use it on my eczema and no more itch from being dry and doesn&#x27;t even look like it was there!</li>
            <li> After putting it on a few times a day with a flat cotton pad, my skin eventually peeled and the new skin seems like baby skin.</li>
            <li> Used this on my very dried out winter skin, worked very well.</li>
            <li> I only use a couple of drops in my hair after it has been washed and before I blow dry or flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product now for a few weeks and have noticed an added luster to my hair as well as an increase in new growth.</li>
            <li> I have very long blonde dyed hair</li>
            <li> I do use a ton of different oils and creams for dry skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> definitely helps with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;mainly</li>
            <li> so far I see less hair fall out</li>
            <li> Also use it on the back of my hands which are always dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to see if this would help their extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li> helped alot with my facial dry skin thank you.</li>
            <li> It made a difference for my dry patchy skin instantly.</li>
            <li> I applied it on the dry areas morning and especially at night together with Aveeno lotion.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my legs and arms when I need extra moisturizing for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair much more manageable, especially during the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough consistency and absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> This product is too greesy for me as I have sensitive skin, but I apply very little of it on any part of my body, especially my face, and only use it as neededand and it works its miracles.</li>
            <li> The first week 50% less hair in the shower and this week just a few strands.</li>
            <li> There is no difference for the quality but the other one is more expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the second brand I bought through Amazon the other brand has a very similar name</li>
            <li> Since receiving the product two weeks ago, I only have a couple of gouges left on my extremely beat hands.  </li>
            <li> During the Fall months, my skin gets very dry and itchy, especially on my hands and on my torso.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, especially on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> Living in a very dry climate such as LV,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also added it to other essentials oils I use on my skin and have noticed a difference in how soft my skin is the following day and dark spots beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> There are not many things that can even penetrate dry elbows, knuckles and feet soles that have been baked by AZ summers outdoors, but this not only absorbs in well, the skin REMAINS soft!    </li>
            <li> May, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for my son who suffers from an overactive immune system and exhibits the precursor signs of Celiac&#x27;s disease His most aggravating symptom is eczema and/or hives all over his body.</li>
            <li> I have rough cuticles and constantly picking  at them.  </li>
            <li> The night before I wash my long hair</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the oil after reading a few natural blogs that discussed the benefits of using emu oil.</li>
            <li> One pump goes a long way and covers a lot of skin area.</li>
            <li> But its oil, so I am not surprised.</li>
            <li> Works without strange sensations or any odor.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my stretched ears and stretch marks on my hips.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I read I expected it to provide some results, but I had what I can only describe as a rebound effect.</li>
            <li> My lower legs felt achy and I rubbed on the emu oil and was surprised that the pain was gone in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t lock the moisture in for long.</li>
            <li> This works on sore muscles, minor skin irritations, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it to get rid of some grey hairs I have, so I&#x27;m still in that process.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;LL WORK ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> and it has gotten rid of a long time scabby patch on my scalp.</li>
            <li> (I recently retired, but my career was mostly spent out doors).  </li>
            <li> And the oil feeling does not stay for as long as it would with something like coconut oil or cooking oil.  </li>
            <li> I live on a farm in Wisconsin and I am outside or in the barn at least 8 hours a day.</li>
            <li> The emu oil seems soothing irritated skin even better in cold, dry days.</li>
            <li> After all the money I&#x27;ve spent on dry skin lotions, I think I have finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Emu Oil for about 3 weeks now and the spot is definitely smaller, less red, and smoother.</li>
            <li> Also be careful that is completely dry before putting on white anything because the oil will permanently dye it a yellowish color.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks of using emu oil, I did noticed that the skin where applied was reasonably lighter, and the imperfections were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I mean, really?</li>
            <li> I bought it to help dry skin and a minor case of dermatitis</li>
            <li> The other company sent me an order with a broken bottle of Emu Oil &amp; I don&#x27;t believe it happened in shipping since the other bottles were fine</li>
            <li> I use it all over my body and especially tummy area as I am in third trimester of my pregnancy hoping to prevent stretch marks and possibly aid in appearance to the little ones I have already!</li>
            <li> I only recently started using Emu oil, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> ( only need some amount ( little extra on my ends)</li>
            <li> My sister has a severe knee pain and she has taken different pain killers besides other joint medication but doesn&#x27;t work with her.</li>
            <li> so obviously I cannot compare it to other treatments</li>
            <li> The only other area are the heels of my feet.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my hair and left over night every other night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing any effects any different from any other oil I&#x27;ve used (E, etc.)</li>

            <li> used the Emu Oil on my dry hands, face, and on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> My dry skin is almost gone</li>
            <li> Since I am prone to dry skin, redness, itching and sunburns</li>
            <li> I wondered how well the emu oil would work on my dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> I used it on a dry spot on my face and in a couple days, it was no longer dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I am using this product on all my dry skin areas and it is working wonders.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops can make such a big difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used several different oils for my hands this winter because it has been so harsh.  </li>
            <li> It worked to a limited degree.  </li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way, so I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Until recently, the only way to tame them was with a callus razor.</li>
            <li> Within the past week I have used Insta Natural Emu Oil.</li>
            <li> I almost don&#x27;t want to tell them the secret ;)</li>
            <li> I live in the desert where dry skin and inflammation is a common problem.  </li>
            <li> Used on my daughter who had a serious cut and it healed much faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friend that has serious skin problems and over the last month she has had started to have relief and see her skin start to clear up.</li>
            <li> and it has definitely helped my skin be less dry.</li>
            <li> This time she had an outbreak of dry eyelids which was painful and disrupted her busy life as a fulltime student and working full time.</li>
            <li> Used this on my 1 month old son after his circumcision, it healed in less then 1 week !!  </li>
            <li> This oil did wonders on my dry elbows!</li>
            <li> Recommend to my daughter for granddaughter dry skin!  </li>
            <li> During the winter we burn wood so everyone in my house has dry, itchy, rough skin.</li>
            <li> You will only need a small amount for daily use on your face.  </li>
            <li> have used it less regularly on my stomach (ancient scars) and see no change.</li>
            <li> I applied the Emu Oil to my hair when it was wet and when it was dry to test it out both ways.</li>
            <li> I see some slight improvements of my skin several days after I start applying it on my face,, My skin feels smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> but I used it on really rough dry skin that I had</li>
            <li> However ever since I started using Emu oil my acne scars have separated and became less red.</li>
            <li> I like how quickly it absorbs, it&#x27;s weird that it is an oil that doesn&#x27;t feel oily.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way; I will definitely repurchase.  </li>
            <li> For a few days I have been using it around my cuticles and it has made the skin around my nails soft, and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands, they tend to get very dry</li>
            <li> Expecially during the winter times, my skin can get very dry.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry ....</li>
            <li> MY FOOT ALWAYS VERY DRY AT WINTER.  </li>
            <li> i have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My hair is also very dry</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally very dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 yr old female interested in anti aging as well as knee problems, flare ups of tendinitis, and a bad scar on my arm.</li>
            <li> I recently switched brands to this convenient pump which saves product and mess.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess like you think it would because it&#x27;s an oil and then wash it out the next day.  </li>
            <li> I have used it on 2nd degree burns to aid in faster healing, I use it in my hair to resolve split ends and weak roots; as an aftershave lotion...for it doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin was very dry and rough.</li>
            <li> When I need a little extra moisture I apply the Emu Oil before bed</li>
            <li> a little emu oil on the left wrist and the pain was gone after about 3 applications.&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
            <li> I also use it in my hair occasionally to add a little shine.</li>
            <li> BUT of course I only put a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> Again, I only apply a little bit.</li>
            <li> I can sleep because a little oil eases pain in my neck, back, arms, legs and feet.</li>
            <li> My skin can get really dry and cracked due to all my gardening.</li>
            <li> ALOT goes a long way on your skin!!!</li>
            <li> But as bad as my knee is, I need to give it more time.  </li>
            <li> so I suggest starting with just a few drops and increasing as needed.</li>
            <li> Over time, the swelling disappeared and the numbness is minimal.  </li>
            <li> there is not much you can do.</li>
            <li> It really could be a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> I have recently begun using it on my face as advised by my aesthetician to help with uneven skin tone along with adding moisture.  </li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> My edges were thinning because during the winter, I wear lace wigs to protect my hair from the harsh weather and the combs laying against my scalp all day cause sensitivity and hair loss, this oil is growing back my edges!!!!</li>
            <li> I have also mixed a few drops into my night moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li> and I have spent a lot of money doing so.  </li>
            <li> Didnt do what I expected.., will not buy again.</li>
            <li> and I noticed difference on my skin, but not much on hair</li>
            <li> but I plan on making this a regular part of my everyday routine...</li>
            <li> Then I noticed my hands felt younger, so I stole a few drops for myself.</li>
            <li> so I was curious about how it would work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hands are prone to rough cuticles and hangnails.</li>
            <li> I put it on my feet and it has soften rough skin.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.  </li>
            <li> After using it a few weeks on my face I have notice a big difference.  </li>
            <li> Absolute Beauty secret that I&#x27;ll get rid of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I am careful about the products I accept for review.  </li>
            <li> (btw the bottle is now empty) but it does work well for nails, just not stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for a few weeks twice daily and still haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a natural mane that really thick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago for my 4 yr old son who has been going through harsh chemotherapy for 2yrs now.</li>
            <li> I tried other moisturizers but they irratated my eyes or vision and only helped a little with the flare-ups.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil is a pale whitish color, and it actually doesn&#x27;t smell like anything to me.</li>
            <li> I was badly burned and blistered on a significant part of my upper body.</li>
            <li> Actually just started using it, but based on the other reviews am hopeful that it will help with a few issues.  </li>

            <li> He has very sensitive skin and after shaving would be red, dry and generally uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my father&#x27;s dry scalp a few months ago, to help with a dry patch, and it helped to loosen and moisturize it.</li>
            <li> monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid (Omega 9) is the major fatty acid in emu oil.</li>
            <li> no positive results yet, but will use for skin dryness.</li>
            <li> works as a terrific moisturizer for the tops of my hands and keeps them from getting raw and chapped in the winter weather.</li>
            <li> less dry than two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Because it is relatively thick with a minor scent, it moisturized my skin immensely well without filler/harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> My hair broke off on the edges &amp; by using this with a little organic coconut oil and/or black castor oil day and night, my edges started to grow back within 2 weeks.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s extremely moist and soothing, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It actually stays on her skin longer than any other moisturizer and it does not weigh her clothes down or leave a smell on her clothes like other heavy ointments and moisturizers do.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> ok, then i woke up with 4 new pimples!&lt;br /&gt;Horrible Horrible product!!</li>
            <li> Crazy - right!?</li>
            <li> My nails have been dry lately, after a gel polish mishap and the emu oil totally moisturizes them beyond other moisturizers that are specifically for nails..</li>
            <li> The oil is not heavy at all , it&#x27;s surprisingly not greasy either, so</li>
            <li> I tried it for other things.  </li>
            <li> It ends up being the cureall for any skin issues in my house due to winter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other products from them</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually, I&#x27;ll try out the other uses of the emu oil.</li>
            <li> After almost a month now, I have noted other changes such as no cracking of my hands that usually happens from a lot of kitchen work and hand washing.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil with other products to enhance absorption.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using emu oil in my shampoo and in other beauty aid products</li>
            <li> It might even be helping me keep my eyebrows as they have been thinking due to medication.</li>
            <li> I use it every other night or so.</li>
            <li> , it works like any other oil...</li>
            <li> I do this about every other week because I damage my hair alot from using a 400 degree curling iron</li>
            <li> Now I use my other face oils for my body and hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I even went to a podiatrist and was told it is hereditary, other than a pumice</li>
            <li> I usually rasp, then oil, and put on white</li>
            <li> the uses seem endless.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I do not like chemicals when it comes to products I use for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Just like any other oil.</li>
            <li> every other day in my crown, hairline and ends, it BEGAN TO transform my hair within 4 weeks to the point of being</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other brands of Emu oil for the past year, simply trying to find one that lives up to all the research.</li>
            <li> I like that unlike a lot of other oils...</li>
            <li> then decided to try the oil on other areas of my body.</li>
            <li> I also have used it on my other scars to help them fade, and it seems that they are reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You use only a small amount which is helped by having a pump bottle .  </li>
            <li> I use three small pumps of this on a daily with three pumps of the Vitamin C moisturizer and it works dutifully.</li>
            <li> what, I&#x27;ve tried other stuff that u order on tv and out of books</li>
            <li> I bought it also for my thinning hair, because of other reviews, hoping that it will help.</li>
            <li> other reviewers said.  </li>
            <li> This Emu oil is unlike any other moisturizers or face products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> so the few drops that&#x27;s added goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They also have extreme customer service</li>
            <li> but like every other thing on this planet it did produce pimples on me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way, and it wasn‚Äôt sticky, or greasy.</li>
            <li> And I get dry little spots and bumps.</li>
            <li> I have been using this emu oil now for about a month on my little girl and it truly works for her dry skin.</li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful what goes onto my skin</li>
            <li> We currently use it for dry skin (cold, midwest weather!) ;  it soaks right into the skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for my extremely dry skin areas (knees, elbows, and heels) and have seen an improvement in just a few days.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and is not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> It has no smell or coloration to worry about and takes very little to go a long way.</li>
            <li> This small bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes in a dark glass bottle.</li>
            <li> My legs feel like silk again and the dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in a dark colored glass bottle to protect the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I use this product to help reduce the appearance of my birthmark (dark spot on my face) and to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li> I USED IT ON MY DARK SPOTS ON MY FACE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks to help rid the dark areas I had on my shoulders from my bra line.</li>
            <li> I have used emu oil in the past,  and it always had a strange odor to it.  </li>
            <li> purchased it because I had pulled out all my natural lashes after getting false ones.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> When used in a small quantity, hair is soft and shiny, with a thick appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he said, &#x27;perhaps in addition to clearing up the bumps, it had some kind of repellent quality to it&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My hands do feel a little itchy, but the direction did say test just a little, but a little when a long way.</li>
            <li> While it was a horrible lubricant because it kept absorbing into my skin too quickly, it did however cause the skin on my penis to heal.</li>
            <li> It also did not weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> so the product gets deeper down to the lower layers under the skin.</li>
            <li> When I get down to the bottom</li>
            <li> Emu oil was a completely foreign thing to me!</li>
            <li> Will not buy it again due to the smell!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have no more dry and flaky skin.</li>
            <li> although still not fully back to their very small size).&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I have noticed a dramatic increase in my skin and its smoothness.  </li>
            <li> but if I do wash it in the morning and use the hairdryer my hair is less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Rub on the arms and in 6 days or less the bruise is gone.</li>
            <li> The public in Arizona sees Emu Oil at Street Fairs and I have never taken the product serious or purchased any Emu prior.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle immediately and received it in less than 5 days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it as a moisturizer on my face after using Dr. Woods Liquid Black Soap.</li>
            <li> The skin just looks less irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil isn&#x27;t your typical oil feel or look.  </li>
            <li> I do look less wrinkled when I put the oil on at night.  </li>
            <li> When it gets irritated, I is slightly raised and bothers me.</li>
            <li> I am ADDING A COMMENT to my previous review because I read that this would work for a skin fungus.</li>
            <li> My skin is much less &amp;#34;crepey&amp;#34; (I am 62)&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Wrinkles seem to be softer and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> After using less than a bottle my eczema is gone permanently.  </li>
            <li> And here&#x27;s an odd fact</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy looking or feeling, in fact it leaves my face LESS greasy than when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(The lid is a black pump.</li>
            <li> and I can see a slight difference</li>
            <li> The oil seems to absorb quicker into the skin and leave less of a filmy residue.  </li>
            <li> I like the pump disbursement, but the oil slightly leaks to the bottom of the cap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although named an oil, the product has a slightly thicker consistency to it.</li>
            <li> I recently had a very tough surgery to go thru.....went back to the doctor.....</li>
            <li> I no longer feel small rough patches on her belly.</li>
            <li> With a weakened immune system and low blood cell counts, infection is not good.</li>
            <li> It has to be refined in order to get rid of bacteria and any other contaminants present in the oil, which includes pesticides, viruses, unnecessary hormones, etc.</li>
            <li> but it is a bit too heavy to use in your hair, as it weighs the hair down.  </li>
            <li> I live in the Northeast where the climate in the winter can be difficult.</li>
            <li> so you do have to be careful as to how hard to push the pump down</li>
            <li> I tried a few pumps of the oil on his slightly damp skin and let it sink in.</li>
            <li> , over half the bottom was missing.  </li>
            <li> moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a little in my hair and it smoothed it quite well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing results already, its just little hair</li>
            <li> It spilled a little in the box i got it in even though it was still sealed</li>
            <li> Even the little bumps are going away.</li>
            <li> When I use it, my roots look a little greasy, so I then add baby powder to combat the greasiness so that my hair looks presentable to be seen.</li>
            <li> I also add a little bit of the oil into my homemade conditioner.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little bit  - affordable  </li>
            <li> I did a little research and selected this oil and could not be happier.  </li>
            <li> bit might be a little TMI, but I am a frank type of person.</li>
            <li> A little goes</li>
            <li> I will purchase this emu oil again when I run out, but a little oil goes along way</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little like a miracle.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Emu Oil and was a little worried....</li>
            <li> little concoction of aloe/emu/snail gel...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a little on my legs after shaving to prevent razor burn and to help with my eczema.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Emu brands in the past but InstaNatural&#x27;s quality has surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> and I thought I seen little results over week</li>
            <li> /&gt;After doing a little research, I read about the anti-inflammatory and healing effects of Emu oil.</li>
            <li> A little pricy</li>
            <li> purchased this oil with little hope.</li>
            <li> I put it on my scalp (just a little</li>
            <li> He thought they were little gnat bites  </li>
            <li> You can pump a little bit out of the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> washed my hair and massaged a little bit of this oil into it while it was still damp.</li>
            <li> and I can see it fill in a little at a time</li>
            <li> I have a couple of scars due to past surgery, and skin discoloration for hormonal imbalances, so that was my targeted areas.</li>
            <li> After massaging it in, pain does seem lessened and joints less stiff.  </li>
            <li> Originally purchased to help with these small, painful sores I get on my scalp every now</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have some skin issues and it has woked thus far to keep us moisturizered and freer from the annoying itch of a constant rash when our skin gets too dry.</li>
            <li> but it DID INDEED DEFINITELY help her poor little hands.  </li>
            <li> when I use it on my face at night I start to break out i gave it to my husband now because a few drops he uses in his hair because he has a finer texture let&#x27;s see how it works out</li>
            <li> I haven‚Äôt had any skin trouble from using this oil.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken me out or left my hair to the point of being to oily.</li>
            <li> So, that&#x27;s a plus for those who don&#x27;t like things that are heavily scented.  </li>
            <li> So, I ordered a full bottle of Emu Oil from InstaNatural and have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Emu Oil for a few years now</li>
            <li> It has decreased redness and helped immensely with areas of &#x27;orange peel&#x27; skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He was fully healed in just a few days without making the ink fade.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> I get a few times a year.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few times.</li>
            <li> You just need a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> I wonder what my hands will look like in a few days.  </li>
            <li> use a few drops after putting my vitamin c serum on.  </li>
            <li> After a shower I Rubbed the emu oil in and after a few minutes the sting and tightness was gone.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> When I rubbed it on my nails, I can tell a difference in my cuticles after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with it, but i will not mail it back.  </li>
            <li> I started using oils on my face a few  years ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping in another few weeks it will disappear completely.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> Yeah, so I decided to save a few bucks and go with another manuf..</li>
            <li> It took a few days to see noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I started using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in my daughter&#x27;s damaged, non-growing hair already, after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> few weeks ago I started applying the emu oil to all of his affected areas and it appears to be helping.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using your Emu oil for a few weeks now, my face is healing.</li>
            <li> My hair dried in about an hour of time.  </li>
            <li> I will try to remember to followup in a few weeks with my results.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday...</li>
            <li> TO EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> However, the Emu oil saved the day and healed my hand in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I rub my hands together, don&#x27;t want to waste it, and now I noticed my nails are growing and stronger.  </li>
            <li> I was given the choice of an even more harsh chemo but doesn&#x27;t have skin side effects, but the other effects were awful.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for less than a week and am amazed at how well it works!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for my first order the package was ripped and the bottle fell and got broken</li>
            <li> My face also stays moisturized throughout the day ( I tend to have dry skin, especially in the cold harsh winters of the Midwest).</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota and use this on my face during the cold harsh winters.</li>
            <li> And, because I‚Äôm not noticing my hands as much, I can also say healing has become a lot less painful.  </li>
            <li> I had noticed a few small wrinkles so decided to try the emu oil &amp;  </li>
            <li> so I went to raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> It has healed the cracks on my poor, dry winter hands.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s less milky and thick</li>
            <li> so at least it costs less.  </li>
            <li> In very dry cold weather, I have also used emu oil on an itchy back instead of usual body lotion.</li>
            <li> I put a little on my hair too!  </li>
            <li> I also think it may be a little pore clogging at least on me.</li>
            <li> I have very little pain.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is a little thick and has a cloudy appearance.  </li>
            <li> The oil itself had very little scent to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very painful for him and the open cracks put him at high risk for infection.  </li>
            <li> Not sure.  </li>
            <li> The bumps are still there but slowly not as prominent as before,this is not a miracle cream</li>
            <li> Going to be uskng it for some small projects.</li>
            <li> Using it for a keloid scar on my chest not sure if it&#x27;s working to help reduce hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I apply small amount to my face in  morning after my vitamin C serum and then apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Instead of the usual soak followed by buff, it was the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a soak came the usual pedicure, followed by a massage with...EMU OIL.</li>
            <li> But turn out to be so thick and heavy that I started to get break out.  </li>
            <li> The product was not in its package the package box was smashed product was rolling around inside the box I was not pleased however there was no spillage of the product.</li>
            <li> I have small bald spot on my hairline because of braids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that worked for me.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out!</li>
            <li> I feel also as some healing powers to it for some small discomfort.</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s this product or one of the others that is causing me to break out</li>
            <li> I had a small rash on my hand that I tried everything to get healed up and nothing worked.¬† </li>
            <li> I usually have to dig the scab out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also placed a couple drops (no more than 1-2 squirts) into my soaking bath.</li>
            <li> No more acne.</li>
            <li> No more boils or hives or anything</li>
            <li> Over the past years I use emu oil every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the small things that matter.</li>
            <li> My hands have very thin skin because I am aging and there was actually a sore from my warn skin.</li>
            <li> Besides that, I don‚Äôt know if I have to admit I‚Äôm growing old(er) or if it‚Äôs due to a lack of thyroid, pituitary and dealing with other deterioration caused by massive amounts of radiation years ago, but my skin in the last six months or so has taken an awful turn for the worse in healing from scratches, gouges and nicks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a bit of an odor, but it&#x27;s natural smelling (not chemical) and it&#x27;s very faint.  </li>
            <li> I was a little confused.</li>
            <li> 04.17.16&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve repurchased this item at least 5 (maybe 6 if you count the purchase from their website).</li>
            <li> at least 30 days before I know my alopecia is cured.  </li>
            <li> Put it on at least 2 times a day to see results.</li>
            <li> It was greasy and a bit icky because I know how it&#x27;s made..</li>
            <li> I am using it to treat the scar on my shin, which is both ugly in appearance and sensitive to touch.</li>
            <li> After three consecutive nights of using the oil on my scalp, my shedding was reduced by at least 75% and my hair is benefitting, too.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and have been using this for a couple of weeks now.  </li>
            <li> She has been under a lot of stress lately and was losing her hair.</li>
            <li> thick hair requires quite a bit of it) and I also use it on my face and bikini area after waxing.  </li>
            <li> the pain slowly subsided&lt;br /&gt;without</li>
            <li> the pain slowly subsided&lt;br /&gt;without</li>
            <li> oil is quite thick and somewhat milky in appearance.</li>
            <li> Just to note: my hair is naturally thick.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting since the Emu oil is slightly thick and has a milky appearance.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well, but delivery was slow due to the bad weather.</li>
            <li> also used this emu oil on a small blemish and it was gone in two days!</li>
            <li> I mean it....</li>
            <li> (different brand, sorry!)</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> If people can drink milk from a cow why is using oil from an Emu weird.</li>
            <li> I use this on my natural hair with peppermint and my hair is growing like crazy!</li>
            <li> Sadly, and this may be due to the sad frazzled state of my hair, but I found this too heavy for mine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly ridiculous how well this stuff works on everything it touches</li>
            <li> I recently had a medical treatment with some very nasty medications which led to hair loss.</li>
            <li> Seriously i went to bed</li>
            <li> I would def recommend to anyone who suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li> I felt helpless and he would itch so badly, he was always breaking his skin open.</li>
            <li> I kept thinking that it was going to be gross and sticky, and smell really bad, like what I would imagine any animal oil to be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Next, I tried it on my eczema, which is painful during the winter months.</li>
            <li> After my recent Appendectomy I found myself with a painful scar.</li>
            <li> His skin has terrible chemo rashes that dry out the skin and cause it to crack open.  </li>
            <li> Last year during the polar vortex, my skin suffered terribly.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN HARDLY SEE THEM NOW!</li>
            <li> What makes matters worse is these scratches and gouges, especially on my hands, have become tremendously painful and don‚Äôt heal.  </li>
            <li> My skin just sucks it in!</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely, not greasy or smelly - noticed a difference immediately!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly removing products from my regimen until I find out which one is causing the breakout!</li>
            <li> Her skin started to form black dots that looked like it could&#x27;ve been hives or the chicken poxs.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wiry caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and spreads evenly.</li>
            <li> If you are a chesty woman, then you know what I mean!</li>
            <li> Also, it has decreased the appearance of my acne scars.</li>
            <li> My knuckles have decreased in size in just 1 week.</li>
            <li> But we all know that vaseline leaves behind a shiny appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This winter I got frostbite on my cheeks and nose that caused my face and skin to become bruised, swollen and broken.  </li>
            <li> Could not use, because bottle was broken when received.</li>
            <li> Still the shedding continued and the minute I went off the steroid, it got worse.</li>
            <li> Poor guy.</li>
            <li> It was there for over a month and got steadily worse.¬† </li>
            <li> , I have thin edges</li>
            <li> I never experienced any side effects, and I plan to continue using it on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve broken the seal and tried some</li>
            <li> One false move and my pedicure area looked like a crime scene.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I like putting a very small amount on my baby&#x27;s bottom a couple of times a day to help ward off redness and rashes and it seems to be working well!</li>
            <li> I am afraid to use this on my hair because I usually don&#x27;t like a lot of product on my hair and this can feel like</li>
            <li> had a problem with it thickening up, not sure if it went bad, and had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and does not leave a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m uncomfortable using a product when I can&#x27;t read the label.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say I don&#x27;t use it anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have  been looking for a solution for troubled combination skin on my face....</li>
            <li> The oil not only helped the Shingles outbreak, but also helped relieve the awful pain associated with Shingles.</li>
            <li> ,, sorry</li>
            <li> The weird hair that was growing from it is gone now after 5 uses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a persistant problem with this since an unfortunate hospital stay and Lotrimin (dr. recommended)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been compensated for any of this, just a woman and mom sharing my newfound secret weapon!</li>
            <li> The others are thin and don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> The entire process has also created some terrible scarring.  </li>
            <li> I had heard about the benefits of emu oil, and was quite skeptical.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of putting the oil on my brows, I was shocked to see my brows getting fuller, I mean noticeably, unmistakably fuller..</li>
            <li> It;s in very, very POOR shape</li>
            <li> It does not smell bad, it is not greasy, sticky, or very thick.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells bad,  and is just weird.  </li>
            <li> I know a lot of people are crazy about putting Coconut oil or Olive oil on their face but the skin on my face hates both of those.  </li>
            <li> I am totally crazy about the product.</li>
            <li> and my skin has cleared up substantially and is not itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been desperate to find something that would help my skin which has been going through severe skin infections and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have not given up; sometimes afraid it might be aggravating them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You might as well put the chicken skin on your face off the chicken you get at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> BUT THIS OIL I BEEN USE FOR 2 WEEKS IN COLD DAYS AND</li>
            <li> BUT TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT THE MARKS DID&#x27;NT GO ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t get frizzy while out on a cold windy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used emu oil in my Cold Process soap making.</li>
            <li> When they asked me to test this, I was hesitant after reading that it was mad from adipose tissue of a bird.</li>
            <li> You won‚Äôt be sorry!</li>
            <li> A REALLLLLY bad sunburn?  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on a bad scrape I got 3 weeks ago</li>
            <li> I took out my Emu oil and rubbed it on her painful shoulders.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this oil for massaging painful joints, hand and nail care in particular.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was shocked by what occurred.  </li>
            <li> Also, trying it on a couple of ugly varicose veins.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate giving reveiws.</li>
            <li> the punch is annoying.  </li>
            <li> It made my scalp itch very bad</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> but at that outrageous price I was determined to take what I learned and try to duplicate it at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> His chin is the worst but</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this emu oil. It&#x27;s light and odorless and goes on smoothly. My sister now orders it. Makes my skin even and line free. You also get a good amount for the price.</li>
            <li> great buy!!!!!! amazing result , great for pain and makes your skin soft.will make it a routine, will buy again. highly recommended!!!!!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural 100% Pure Emu Oil has been very effective on my feet which are really prone to dryness. This is a deeply penetrating oil and the scent is nice.  If you suffer from Athlete&#x27;s foot this is something to try.</li>
            <li> pure emu oil, absolutely love it</li>
            <li> Not sure.  Will give it a few more uses.  Using for body aches.</li>
            <li> Great product I used this product on my hair and skin. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  When I need a little extra moisture I apply the Emu Oil before bed and when I wake up the next morning my skin is so soft and moist.  Be careful not to put too much on.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for four months and I can honestly say I see no improvement in my skin I see no improvement in scarves are stretch marks my Eucerin lotion does a better job of moisturizing me. Feel as though when I use it on my face at night I start to break out i gave it to my husband now because a few drops he uses in his hair because he has a finer texture let&#x27;s see how it works out but so far I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> Very good oil, good qualiy. This product is too greesy for me as I have sensitive skin, but I apply very little of it on any part of my body, especially my face, and only use it as neededand and it works its miracles.</li>
            <li> This smooths and nourishes your skin very well.  Clears up dryness right away.  Great for any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> This oil is THE BEST.  I had shingles for the first time ever.  A couple very liberal applications and the shingles were GONE!</li>
            <li> I Love this Emu Oil, really natural and work very good.</li>
            <li> The best natural oil for face, hair, nail, and overall body and hands. You can use this valuable oil over dry patches on your face or hands and knees, or anywhere that needs a little more tender care.</li>
            <li> it really is great for the skin it helped a lot with my dry spot areas of my skin and leaves my skin with a silky feel. It is also great for hair it softens my hair which makes it easier to detangle all my knots.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face and hair I think its working .</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and any problem areas on my skin. What a great product!! I don&#x27;t imagine ever being without emu oil!</li>
            <li> Well I haven&#x27;t use it long enough to see if it help with growth but I keeps my hair moist and shiny love it and very fast shipment</li>
            <li> Works well for softening skin.</li>
            <li> WOW all the reviews I have read about this product are true.  I even did research about Emu Oil and this product is awesome.  I have rough cuticles and constantly picking  at them.  This product has softened them so I am not picking at them as much.  I also have dry skin and putting this on my arms and legs at night I wake up and they are still soft.  Feels a bit oily at first but quickly soaks into your skin.  I also use this as a moisturizer at night and gently rub it on my eyelashes.  Makes them soft and mascara just flows on my eyelashes.  The night before I wash my long hair and after I have put the emu oil on my arms and legs I rub what is left and massage  onto my scalp use another pump and apply it to the rest of my hair.  Brush it all with a boar&#x27;s hairbrush wrap it up in a sleeping cap.  Next morning do a quick brush through and wash my hair.  I also use the Rose Water Toner in the shower to wash my hair and hair shedding as decreased and the comb just glides through my hair. I normally let my hair air dry but if I do wash it in the morning and use the hairdryer my hair is less frizzy.  I think with constant use on my arms and legs they will begin to look less dry and become more soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Really nice oil, goes on smoothly. Like it on my hair. Shipped very fast, too.</li>
            <li> Honestly I can&#x27;t really see what it&#x27;s doing for but then again everything ain&#x27;t for everybody</li>
            <li> Very effective. My hair broke off on the edges &amp; by using this with a little organic coconut oil and/or black castor oil day and night, my edges started to grow back within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a lower back injury and tried this as an alternative to taking over the counter pain medicines to relieve my back pain and stiffness. After using this product for a couple of weeks when I have a flare up I am happy to say it has done the job everytime and I am no longer taking meds to relieve the pain.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve used several instaNatural products and I love them all! The quality is there and it does what it promises to do. I am not a big fan of strong scent so this one is ok it doesn‚Äôt have any scent. I have been using it for my right knee and my lower back where I have pain and it seems like its helping and plus it moisturize my dry skin and doesn‚Äôt leave any strong yucky smell. I haven‚Äôt had any skin trouble from using this oil.</li>
            <li> Love this Emu oil, I am using it for dry skin on my elbows, feet and hands. I use it for chapped lips and as moisturizer under my eyes. I use it 1 to 1 with my body lotion after a shower. It works beautifully and absorbs quickly, a great product at a reasonable price. The company is great, they follow up to be sure you are satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for body and face. I used emu oil for many years now for my body. This one I also tried for my face and I like it. I have oily skin and I was surprised it worked. Good quality and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing oil, especially for winter months. I&#x27;m not over oily in the morning after using this at night. I would ONLY recommend to use it at night as it gives you a VERY shiny sheen. It might be too much for warmer months if you tend to be on the oily side already. No offensive smell but absorbs well. When you need to kick your moisturizing up a notch, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I heard of the many benefits of using emu oil on your skin and hair on your skin and hair and had to try it.  Love the way it feels on the skin, smells good too.  I also spray it on my hair</li>
            <li> Very good product, wonderful seller and service. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> This oil works well to moisturize my face. It does not leave any residue and  blends in well. It seems gentle and did not irritate my skin. The smell is very mild as well. Overall great product and good value.</li>
            <li> Ordered a second bottle.  This oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> I got it for one purpose and when I got the information from you I tried it for other things.  I&#x27;m glad I got it.  I have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> Smooth, silky and fragrance free</li>
            <li> Love this oil, penetrates fast, no oily feel. Leaves skin feeling moist not dry....</li>
            <li> I use this for a variety of different things. It helps dry patches on my skin and my son&#x27;s. He has notoriously sensitive skin and this is one of the only things that helps. I also use this for my cuticles and sometimes in my hair. I recommend it to anyone with dry skin or hair.</li>
            <li> This is working out. Thanks s lot will soon be ordering couple more. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work very well for my skin, however it work wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I used it on all dry areas on my body.</li>
            <li> Love the product, will keep it as part if my regular daily routine,</li>
            <li> I love this oil it&#x27;s helping my hair get thicker.</li>
            <li> Best of all emu oil products!  I have been looking for a skin product that really &amp;#34;makes a difference&amp;#34;  -- and this is the one!  It&#x27;s even better than anti-aging creams for the face.</li>
            <li> I have tried and researched many Emu products for the last seven years.  InstaNatural Emu Oil is by far the most healing and effective oil I have put on my skin!  I bought this for its anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties, and after three days, it had exceeded my expectations! Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> When I recieved this oil, I wasn&#x27;t really sure how I was going to use it. I researched and found that it was good for skin conditions and hair. While I was not sure about using it on myself because it was animal based my sister was excited to try it on her daughter who has severe cradle cap and what looks to be eczema. After the first application, we noticed the baby&#x27;s skin was much softer. After continued use, we have noticed that the cradle cap has drastically improved and her skin is much clearer. I would highly recommend this for those with skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I was gifted this oil for review and my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love this Emu Oil! It works amazing on aches and pains in hands, knees, back, shoulders, feet and where ever needed. If I rub on the bottom of my feet before bed I don&#x27;t experience my restless leg syndrome. So try it, you will like it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this.  I use it daily on my face.  It ends up being the cureall for any skin issues in my house due to winter lol</li>
            <li> This is a great emu oil!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the oil after reading a few natural blogs that discussed the benefits of using emu oil. I use this oil as a facial moisturizer after completing my daily wash regimen. I noticed the healthy glow it leaves after application , not greasy. Also, it has decreased the appearance of my acne scars. The company was concerned about my satisfaction with the product and that really impressed me! Really like this oil.</li>
            <li> Great product for after-bath moisturizing.  Made my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Very nice I have never used anything like this before . I love using it on my face . I got this free for review</li>
            <li> *This product was received for free for review purposes only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! its truly an oil for everything. I use this oil in my hair, on my face and even as a cuticle oil. It hasn&#x27;t broken me out or left my hair to the point of being to oily. its just an over all great product :)</li>
            <li> Emu oil is the greatest for aiding in the healing of piercings.  I love this oil and will always use it.  It helps to heal the skin naturally and quickly.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it works very, very well!!</li>
            <li> Use on face and neck...keeps skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> i received this product for free from tomoson.com for my unbiased opinion. leaves your skin feeling nice and soft and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This is very good quality emu oil. I use it daily mixed with either moisturizer or with my foundation, then again mixed with their vitamin C serum. It is light and absorbs very quickly, and has almost no odor that I can detect. However, I will say that my dogs love when I use it, so it must taste like chicken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very impressed with the customer service from this company. I&#x27;ve bought other products from them (vitamin C  and rosehip seed oil) and their service is great. They always check to make sure you&#x27;re happy with your order and to offer other products they think you might like. I highly recommend this company and their products.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Soothes my babies skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have tried Emu Oil so I cannot compare to other brands. I do use a ton of different oils and creams for dry skin on my hands. This Emu Oil made a tremendous difference on my skin in a short amount of time. Within 3 days a lot of the dryness had healed and my hands became much smoother. I used it on cuticles and nails which also became much smoother and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a little in my hair and it smoothed it quite well. FYI I have very thick wiry caucasian hair. One of the main things I liked with this product is that there isn&#x27;t much scent going on. I am extremely sensitive to smells and often discontinue use of a product because I can&#x27;t take the smell anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service by InstaNatural is unsurpassed. I have to say most people don&#x27;t care to follow up consistently with items that they are selling but the service here is undeniably terrific! I received my item right away, well packaged and it is obviously a high quality oil that I will continue to purchase in the future from this seller. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil for irritated, reactive skin.  Has helped resolve facial skin redness and rosacea-like symptoms.  Love that I can use it anywhere on my skin and it&#x27;s gentle and non-irritating.  I really like the pump bottle that gives small spritzes of the oil since you don&#x27;t need a lot per application.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I saw the same results as before I began using this product.</li>
            <li> As advertised, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It&#x27;s a great product to have in your medicine cabinet!  A product that not only can help with your scars or help moisturize, but an oil that you can also rub on a sore back to help with sore muscles!  This truly is an astounding product.  Just this morning, I woke up with a sore back.  I asked my daughter to rub some of this on my back and it truly has helped to decrease the pain that I was feeling and it didn&#x27;t take much time at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I definitely recommend this for folks who experience a lot of achy muscles or joint pain.  This seems to be a great product to help alleviate some of those symptoms.  This will be staying near by at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.  So, that&#x27;s a plus for those who don&#x27;t like things that are heavily scented.  I&#x27;m just glad it&#x27;s not stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for review purposes.  However, the thoughts and opinions are expressed here are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Delivered on time</li>
            <li> excellent  product...great  for makeup removal</li>
            <li> I received this oil free and for review.  I was not sure about it when I first received it, nut it has been so useful.  During the Fall months, my skin gets very dry and itchy, especially on my hands and on my torso. I rubbed this oil on and my skin soaked it right in making it feel soft and smooth.  The itching subsided and with consistent use, I do not have that flaky, dry skin.  I am so happy as with the winter season fast approaching,. this will be most helpful.</li>
            <li> Great for your skin. Started using it when I read Lupita Nyongo has been using it for years. It leaves your skin very soft, and dehydrated. That&#x27;s my night cream. It&#x27;s working it&#x27;s magic, and a little goes along way. It&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Absorbs quickly and  cured by dry scalp (dandruff).</li>
            <li> Updated Review: 04.17.16&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve repurchased this item at least 5 (maybe 6 if you count the purchase from their website). It&#x27;s still doing wonders for me and for my mom. Both of us are still very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;Really fantastic oil. I initially bought it to use with jamaican castor oil for hair growth but I&#x27;ve found myself using it more as a moisturizer for my face. It leaves my face soft and smooth.I also bought some of this for my mom. She has lupus and she&#x27;s been using it to help with hair growth and to improve her skin, We&#x27;re both very satisfied. Thank you InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> Emu Oil, as advertised, has cleared my face of a an almost constant redness/rosacea from allergies, eating, being touched, etc. it hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts even though it&#x27;s reduced facial dryness and is an excellent base for foundation.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Argan Oil and was turned on to Emu Oil about eight months and really enjoyed my experience with it.  So, I ordered a full bottle of Emu Oil from InstaNatural and have not been disappointed.  It goes on smooth and is non-greasy as well.  The oil absorbs quickly into the skin and is a great moisturizer.  I noticed that my skin tone is a lot nicer since I have been using it.  I have used Emu Oil for months now, I still use Argan Oil, too but more often the Emu Oil.  Overall, my skin loves it.  I know a lot of people are crazy about putting Coconut oil or Olive oil on their face but the skin on my face hates both of those.  I would get tiny bumps all over my face that look like heat rash and had given up on oils until I tried Argan and had very good luck with it and now I am happy to add Emu oil to that list as well. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Great product ,  neutral smell and dries fast .  Really good for the hair and nail cuticles.  Softens elbows almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I just decided to try this as a pre shave oil today and WOW my face feels amazing as after razor glided so easy I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I only have been using this product for a week. My hair is AMAZING! It&#x27;s so soft, no frizz, It&#x27;s thicker. I love it! I will be buying again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am 81 years old and recovering from hives and rash that left my skin red and dry.  Daily application of Emu Oil is repairing damaged skin on my arms and legs.  I am pleased to have read what others said about it and tried it.</li>
            <li> My skin drinks this in almost instantly.  So many oils sit on top and stay sticky which doesn&#x27;t work for me.  This just disappears and leaves my skin so very soft.  Wonderful stuff,  I&#x27;m telling everyone about InstaNatural Pure Emu Oil!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to receiving this product because I have dry skin and have difficulty finding a reliable lotion.  It occasionally  worked great on my hands, but not always. Sometimes they felt great, other times they remained very dry.  I read the label, well more accurately, I tried to read the label and couldn&#x27;t.  The printed letters are white, and the background on the paper label is white.  I had someone else try to read the label and they could make out the word &amp;#34;Caution&amp;#34;, but nothing else.  I&#x27;m uncomfortable using a product when I can&#x27;t read the label. I&#x27;m sorry to say I don&#x27;t use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a small pump top. If you already have emu oil on your hands, its difficult to control the bottle when pumping more out.  A better design would be to have an indented top of the pump so your finger can get some leverage when pumping.  I would also suggest improving the label.</li>
            <li> Although i am from Australia and there&#x27;s supossed to be heaps of Emu oil, this is my first time using Emu Oil. I suffer from keratosis pilaris and my husband has eczema .  I have been using it for the last 2 weeks, after shower and before bed. and I find that it has helped a lot with my keratosis pilaris. I used almond oil before, but Emu oil is definitely different and more moisturising but not sticky. The bumps are still there but slowly not as prominent as before,this is not a miracle cream but I believe that it has helped with my condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can purchase instanatural emu oil when I return to Australia.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic in a bottle!!</li>
            <li> I have crippling arthritis and was in great pain all the time. A customer came up to me at work and told me about this product, so I ordered it and to my surprise I have very little pain. My knuckles have decreased in size in just 1 week. I am now spreading the news to everyone I know. This is the best product I have ever had in my life. You should try if you have severe joint pain. Emu oil really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my hair. I suffer from alopecia and I have read that it is good for hair. Since I have used emu oil, my hair seems fuller, shiny and healthier. I would definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> Makes my baby&#x27;s eczema less blotchy and is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it!!  I am using on my face every night.  I have a number of friends now also using it for a variety of purposes and also love it.  I am going to recieve Argan Oil as well from this company soon which I hear is great for hair so i will let you know how I like that as well!</li>
            <li> I like this product, most creams promote skin problems, especially oily skin, this is the opposite, do not hesitate to buy it back again</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Emu Oil.  I have to say it works like a charm on my dry and aging skin.  After a week of using it on my hair and my skin I have noted a big difference. I naturally have a dehydration problem.  But this Emu oil seems to be helping me to solve some of these issues. So thrilled to receive this product as a slight discount so that I could take a chance on it and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> bought it for my hair and skin and it works wonders and I have actually have hair growth will def be back for future purchases</li>
            <li> I have been using emu oil for about two weeks on my scalp and I&#x27;m seeing results already, its just little hair but so far its coming back. For a few days I have been using it around my cuticles and it has made the skin around my nails soft, and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying the emu oil for its healing properties and its soothing effects on my skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this all over my body and face to moisturize. I was using argan oil and lotion before but with the emu oil it seems I do not need anything else with it. I use it on my hands after dishes, all over after showers, on my heels and feet and on my face. When i recieved this item for my review, I had low expectations. But I am very impressed by the moisture and long lasting moisture at that! It lasts all day long! A little goes a very long way so I suggest starting with just a few drops and increasing as needed. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product I am loving the results I have had it for about two weeks and I am already seeing a change in how fast my hair is growing back. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have purchased several brands of Emu Oil and this is the lates . Product arrived on time and although I have only used it a few days it is working great.</li>
            <li> Such a Great Product !!! Going to order another Asap !!! Thank U !!!</li>
            <li> Before trying this product, I had never heard of emu oil. I knew what an emu was, but had never heard of actually using an oil derived from emu fat. So, I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use it on my face because my skin is pretty sensitive. So, instead I used it as a moisturizer for my hands. This winter, my hands have been so dry. I started using a couple drops of the emu oil whenever my hands felt really dry. The oil absorbs quickly and didn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling too greasy. It quickly worked to get rid of the dryness and over time, my hands have been feeling softer and definitely less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, I&#x27;ll try out the other uses of the emu oil. But, for now, I&#x27;m happy with how well it&#x27;s worked on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: I received a free bottle from BrandBacker for review purposes. All opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li> Honestly, I had never in my life, heard of Emu oil before. So, I was kinda leery to try it. It does not smell bad, it is not greasy, sticky, or very thick. Though, I do find I don&#x27;t really use it that often in the month I have had it, I find nothing really special about it. That&#x27;s just me though. It does help fade scars, which is what I used it for. I did not notice anything as far as pain relief. I think this is just one of those things, that I would use if it was the only thing I had, but I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy it. *complementary product received for review*</li>
            <li> it really grew one of my relative hair,it really cure my scars.this product is amazing! it a must have it!</li>
            <li> NEVER makes you break out. This stuff is amazing. I use it daily on my face and I&#x27;ve been using it on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li> Great for deep conditioning my hair!</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Purchased for someone else.  Have not heard about results.</li>
            <li> A good skin moisturizer.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I love how light this is! I use it nightly &amp; in the morning after I wash my face. The seller was EXTREMELY customer service oriented and even sent a personal email asking how I enjoyed it, what I was using it for, etc. He followed up with me &amp; even sent me the stretch mark cream (since I am a mother with some, lol) to try complimentary!  I will be looking into more of the other products listed.</li>
            <li> It could be better. Still using it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Emu Oil for a few years now and I really really like this one.  It&#x27;s great especially for the price.  I&#x27;ve paid way more and not gotten nearly as good a product as this one.  I will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> great product I use it for almost everything</li>
            <li> I have a natural mane that really thick. I alsoo have sensitive skin. Having products like this that&#x27;s gentle and so moisturizing is making my scalp regain it&#x27;s health. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;wonderful oil. We use it all over. I also use it with my essential oils</li>
            <li> Like it more then chemical creams for sure. One pump goes a long way and covers a lot of skin area. Something takes a long time to penetrate my facial skin, unless I gently dab it on or barely use it. It is gentle and effective- I use it on my face, lips, and hands.</li>
            <li> All these reviews have to be paid. Did nothing for my scar after 30 days, no hair difference either..</li>
            <li> good price and i like the pump :D</li>
            <li> Excellent products I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> Great products and way beyond great service! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> Helps my daughter with severe eczema tremendously!  I stopped using petroleum jelly once I found this emu oil.  It actually stays on her skin longer than any other moisturizer and it does not weigh her clothes down or leave a smell on her clothes like other heavy ointments and moisturizers do.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this company is phenomenal.  They are willing to go above and beyond to make sure you are content with your experience of their product.  I contacted them after receiving my first order warm in the package due to hot weather.  I asked if heat would affect the quality of the emu oil and they instantly sent me a new bottle so that I felt safe while using their product on my child.  My interactions with them have been consistently superb, thus far!  This will be my fourth bottle and plan to be a life long customer.</li>
            <li> Great product and follow up!</li>
            <li> Love this oil.saw  a you tube video that raves about hair growth.I use it on my itchy ears (metal allergies).will be trying it on my hair (thinning sides )..</li>
            <li> Just starting using it, I can&#x27;t wait to see more results.</li>
            <li> Love it on face, hair and body!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil about a week now and overall I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m happy with it. Last year during the polar vortex, my skin suffered terribly. I resorted to using vaseline on my face. But we all know that vaseline leaves behind a shiny appearance. By time I got to work, the shininess would be gone. With the emu oil, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the shine at all. It quickly absorbs in my skin and a little goes a long way. I also used some on my extremely dry heels. It didn&#x27;t moisturize as expected, but I did notice that my toe nails and cuticles looked a lot better. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this.</li>
            <li> This product works great to moisturize the hair! It gives hair a soft touch, manageable, easy to comb feel and also moisturizes the scalp. It has healthy ingredients. I even treated my hair overnight for and it absorbs really well. The results are great!</li>
            <li> I like emu oil vey much and thought I&#x27;d try another brand.  This one has a spray application which I find messier to use.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with your emu oil. This has made a huge difference in my&lt;br /&gt;very sensitive, dry, reactive skin!!!  You have&lt;br /&gt;a wonderful product! I will continue to use and purchase your product as&lt;br /&gt;long as I can. I&#x27;ve been so happy with it that I&#x27;ve highly recommended it&lt;br /&gt;to several others.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I originally bought this to promote hair growth, but never got around to using it for that purpose. I actually didn&#x27;t think that it would do much, so I didn&#x27;t put in the work or effort of using it. Funny story though, I ran out of lubricant to master-bate with so I grabbed the only thing I had... emu oil. While it was a horrible lubricant because it kept absorbing into my skin too quickly, it did however cause the skin on my penis to heal. It was dry, wrinkled, damaged, and scarred. After using this for a week the wrinkles and scars are gone, its very moist, and extremely sensitive. Will be using this on my face and hair now. Im a true believer in this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it! Going to be uskng it for some small projects. Better to know exactly what you are using than what comes off the shelves in the big retail stores</li>
            <li> I purchased this emu oil for dry, itchy skin.  It worked to a limited degree.  It does soak in, but not as fast as the seller suggests. It soaks in within about three hours and until then, its a bit oily.  But its oil, so I am not surprised. It has not yet relieved the dry skin, but it helps a bit.  The smell is almost neutral, which is also a plus.  This brand appears to be a good value, both quality and price.</li>
            <li> using the oil for lines around my mouth and corner of eyes...working!</li>
            <li> I purchased this emu oil as a general, multipurpose oil for my family. During winter, when we are all indoors and the heat is cranked- we all suffer dry skin. At the same time our children (for various reasons) have extremely sensitive skin. Initially, I was so pleased with this oil. It instantly relives the tightness of dry skin, and absorbs quickly- leaving no greasiness. I have been able to use it on my children without any of the usual skin irritations of past products. After almost a month now, I have noted other changes such as no cracking of my hands that usually happens from a lot of kitchen work and hand washing. I am able to use it on my face along with some other favorite oils and have had numerous compliments on my complexion (I don&#x27;t wear makeup). I couple this oil with some essential oils for sore muscles, and my husband and I both feel a much quicker, deeper relief. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t discover this oil sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service, contact, follow-up and delivery/ packaging have been exemplary. My experience with this oil and company has been cohesively wonderful.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.  I swear I look younger the next day when I put it on at night.  (It&#x27;s not all that attractive when it&#x27;s slathered on your face, though; it&#x27;s definitely &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t what I expected&lt;br /&gt;Is very itchy, I&#x27;m breaking out on&lt;br /&gt;My face, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this&lt;br /&gt;Product to anyone!! Would like to be&lt;br /&gt;Reimbursement on my account!!</li>
            <li> I get bruised on my arm  all the time  , due to old age.  This oil works.  Rub on the arms and in 6 days or less the bruise is gone.</li>
            <li> Compared to another Emu Oil product, this one is a nice light application. I do not use it daily however when I do it feels great... not too oily and/or greasy.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without breaking my face out. I mix it with a few drops of geranium and frankincense and it works great!</li>
            <li> I used the emu oil kin some body butter I made and am very pleased with results.  Great product.</li>
            <li> definitely helps with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;mainly purchased it because I had pulled out all my natural lashes after getting false ones.&lt;br /&gt;my lashes were back to their regular state within a month</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Great topical for skin and muscle/joint pain. Great customer service with this company and convenient applicator spray. Will refill orders with this company.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality Emu Oil without any unpleasant odor.  InstaNatural products are well made and very affordable.  Customer service is awesome.  Delivery was fast and item was well packaged.  I have used this oil with other products to enhance absorption. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent product - really does everything it says from your hair to your toes as well as scrapes, cuts amd handy to have for those times cooking burns!  It does soak in quickly and does not stain clothing!  I&#x27;ll never be without it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even believe it.  Works without strange sensations or any odor.  I just can&#x27;t understand it</li>
            <li> I love this product. Will buy again. I use it on hair and body.</li>
            <li> Many of us at the Health Club use Emu Oil and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> Someone referred me to this product - it is amazing!  I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks around eyes, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; and can wear under makeup.  I can tell a difference in my skin!  I use it on my hands, they tend to get very dry and they look YOUNGER, nice bonus!!</li>
            <li> Great product for your face, nails &amp; hair in my opinion what I use it mostly for. I like it for the hair because it promotes hair health and growth and that is what I&#x27;ve trying this product out for strictly hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have  been looking for a solution for troubled combination skin on my face....fine wrinkles, dry patches and bumps. Read an article about emu oil and decided to give it a go. This product is amazing. I saw significant improvement within a week and am very happy with results one month into my treatment. Great customer service and product. Good follow up on satisfaction with results.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed by face.  Very useful in winter.</li>
            <li> Nice oil for skin.  Not greasy.  Easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I purchased my second bottle recently.  I had used an over the counter cream with 7% emu oil after reading about the oil&#x27;s benefits, to treat/relieve arthritic pain in my knees. After researching it further, I decided to buy 100% emu oil.  I started using this product particularly on my right knee which had some swelling and soreness to the touch.  I also had numbness in that leg from the knee up which was bothersome if I stood too long or walked too much.  Over time, the swelling disappeared and the numbness is minimal.  I also used it at night along with a joint pain rub that I had been using before.  Somehow it all works.  I can only assume the oil is a big factor in my pain relief.  I am now also taking emu oil capsules to see if it maximizes my results.  As for the oil and other products I order from InstaNatural, they have been great, following up on my satisfaction with their products and offering helpful tips for their use.</li>
            <li> so far so good I been using the oil for just under a month I used on hair to seal in moisture its great for that it left my hair shiny and soft ( only need some amount ( little extra on my ends) I use on my face in morning and at night its a great moisturizer. I had a scratch across my back ( from bra rubbing) I use the emu oil in area and it heal up in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Changes the skin texture on your face when applied...I use it at night on face and hands. A little goes a long way.  In my opinion it is an awesome moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This has changed my face.  It has decreased redness and helped immensely with areas of &#x27;orange peel&#x27; skin.  My face is smoother, less sensitive, just more &#x27;normal&#x27;.  Crazy - right!?</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia and thought It should work as a body rub for pain.It does.Im on the guaifenasin protocol for fibro. No plant oils on skin. No mint. This us the only thing I have found that won&#x27;t block the guai. So for me I put on cuticles. My feet. My hair ends. Under my eyes.2nd bottle.  UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; I am a patient of Dr. Paul St. Amand in Marina Del Ray, Ca.&lt;br /&gt;He wrote the book for Fibromyalgia and the treatment protocol. In the protocol we can&#x27;t use any oils on our skin, with the exception of 100% Emu Oil. I have found your product perfect for the protocol. I use it for daily muscle pain, nails, my heals, also for my hair as a conditioner. I use this every night also for scars and pigment problems on my face, with excellent results. I  have ordered 4 bottles from Amazon Prime since April 2015. My sister and I were on a Trip and she was in severe back pain. I took out my Emu oil and rubbed it on her painful shoulders. Did that for 2 days and she said that is a miracle in a bottle! We both agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this is a very important product. The public in Arizona sees Emu Oil at Street Fairs and I have never taken the product serious or purchased any Emu prior.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my 4th bottle since April.&lt;br /&gt;Now my husband uses the product on his feet nightly, his soles no longer have cracks from being bare footed.&lt;br /&gt;Again the reason I&#x27;m writing is to let you know how much I appreciate your Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/23/15&lt;br /&gt;Now I am totally crazy about the product. My hair is so shiny and gorgeous strangers, how beautiful my hair is. When my hair is almost dry I put it on the end I have very long blonde dyed hair show it keeps my hair looking extremely shiny and natural. For my sore shoulders and my neck I use the emu oil to rub in and it still it can&#x27;t be beat for pain relief. My nails my nails and my cuticles are now the way they&#x27;re supposed to be</li>
            <li> This really moisturizes my skin. Smells just fine.</li>
            <li> great product!&lt;br /&gt;really works , would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This oil seems to get absorbed easily by the skin leaving your skin soft, I know longer have dark circles under my eye&#x27;s. I love the results.</li>
            <li> Great product, works quickly. I&#x27;ve used this product for a chemical burn and it&#x27;s healed as if it never happened</li>
            <li> This product works wonder on my dry skin.  Love it.  Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like it... some difference is there</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I will buy more when I&#x27;ve used all of this. It works really well! You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I Love love love it. I will purchase more in the near future</li>
            <li> BEST FIND EVER!!!! The CURE ALL for skin damage! Also for your pets!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about one month. My skin was very dry and rough. My skin is changing. It is not dry anymore and it is feeling nice and smooth. I&#x27;m happy I started using InstaNatural 100% Emu Oil.</li>
            <li> Just started using this Emu oil and I must say that my skin feels so soft!!!  I can&#x27;t vouch for the fine lines yet, I will have to use it longer and then comment again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I use it for my stretched ears and stretch marks on my hips. It makes a difference for both and moisturizes well. I need to repurchase right away! But this product does last</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for eleven days so far so good.  I will take at least 30 days before I know my alopecia is cured.  I am excited about the continued use.  I would like to see this product in a larger quantity.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Use it on my surgery scars to keep them moisturized!  I like how quickly it absorbs, it&#x27;s weird that it is an oil that doesn&#x27;t feel oily.  Does wonders on my frown lines.  I use it as a skin serum on my face at night.  Never makes me break out. Best value for the price as far as emu oil goes.  Also love the pump dispenser, a lot less messy than the dropper!</li>
            <li> Wonderful for hot spots and abrasions on my doggies!  Very soothing.</li>
            <li> I think that you can find Emu oil for a cheaper price, but I really wanted something in a glass bottle that I could reuse for homemade skincare that included essential oils (which eventually break down plastic) and so I spent more to get this. I love the bottle, the dispenser is perfect and doesn&#x27;t pump out too much. I am going to try applying it with essential oils to my boyfriends newly reconstructed ankle and skin, and see how it helps with healing and scarring. Great value for the price if you reuse the bottle like I am.</li>
            <li> I love this oil,I use it at night and morning, one pump is enough. Makes my face feels soft. I use this oil for everything. Love it.</li>
            <li> This Emu Oil was a great choice for my mom&#x27;s skin after radiation treatments. It has helped her skin to heal wonderfully and I am glad we found this product for her. It is also good for other purposes as well.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite product ever! You have to get some and I need to get more. It makes other products get deeper into the skin therefore work better, faster. Blemishes are healing faster, it&#x27;s improving the skin under my eyes. I&#x27;ve bought emu oil before and wasn&#x27;t too impressed. InstaNatural is now my skin care brand, if I can just get them to make mineral makeup now.</li>
            <li> OK, nothing earth shaking.</li>
            <li> My sister has a severe knee pain and she has taken different pain killers besides other joint medication but doesn&#x27;t work with her. I have read about this Oil and Decided to buy one. The results were instant for her knees, she feels better. My self has use it as overnight hair mask and its wonderful keeps my hair soft even after shampoo.</li>
            <li> great product I just had surgery and I&#x27;m using it on my scars it is very mild and effective I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Has my skin feeling soft</li>
            <li> I use Emu oil for muscle pain &amp; aches! And it has been helping me too easy the pain! I will definitely order more.....</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the Emu oil.  I have used it on some bruises after vein surgery and it has helped with pain and inflammation.  I am using it on my face as well as a moisturizer and it is not greasy and absorbs quickly. Great product.</li>
            <li> Was going to buy something else but read the reviews on Emu Oil and decided to try it.  It is great.  My skin is soft and stays protected all day.  It goes into the skin totally so no greasy feel to it.  You can use it at morning or night.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It spilled a little in the box i got it in even though it was still sealed but i used it last night after showering on my skin and it felt great.</li>
            <li> I used this on my boyfriends tattoo, to help the healing process and it was AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;He was fully healed in just a few days without making the ink fade.&lt;br /&gt;He has a full back tattoo, and he said it definitely kept the itching at bay.&lt;br /&gt;A+ product!</li>
            <li> I have not seen the results I am looking for yet but I still continue to use it faithfully twice a day. I will give it another week or tell before I make any judgement on this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the emu oil.  I have used it on my hair also.  It makes your skin and hair feel really soft and healthy, which is a big accomplishment, especially as we grow older.  I am very impressed with the oil as well as the seller.  I have received emails from the seller several times, first giving me helpful hints about using the oil and since then, to get my opinion about the oil.  He has taken his time to make sure I am pleased with his product.  That is going above and beyond what most normally do.  I am very impressed and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well, but delivery was slow due to the bad weather.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful.  It goes instantly into your skin!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice product at a great price.  Customer service is good too.</li>
            <li> I am not finding an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using emu oil in my shampoo and in other beauty aid products I make.it leave my hair feeling healthy and looking healthy. Thanks for. Great product. I would definitely revmend emu oil.</li>
            <li> i like this product. it made my hair thicker and i only been using it for a week now.</li>
            <li> Received my purchase quickly. It was also wrapped very well.  Too early to tell if I&#x27;ll have great results.  I&#x27;ll update my review later.  Thus far I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I tried several Emu oils but this is it!  Is very light and absorbs super fast and won&#x27;t leave you that sticky feeling like all the others I tried.  Very good, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my hair, did not know what to expect  but 2 weeks later  I&#x27;m happy to say  I have hair in an area that was bald for years. I just took a chance  and I&#x27;m happy about the results.  I received my package fairly quick and I would buy this 100% Emu oil from this company again.</li>
            <li> One bottle was leaking when I received it. They refunded my money for that bottle. Bought it for my sons dry skin but it didn&#x27;t work for his problem.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil for multi purpose use.  I have been using it on my face and it works great!</li>
            <li> Was a bit cautious because I had never heard of this oil until somebody told me. Apparently works. I use it for my hair and have noticeable improvement. Customer support is pretty good as well. Will post an update if anything changes. :)</li>
            <li> I mixed this oil with argon oil. Together they have made my hair naturally soft. I will be buying more each time I run short. It An awesome oil and does not require much to keep my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> use emu oil for everyone in the house. great stuff</li>
            <li> Actually just started using it, but based on the other reviews am hopeful that it will help with a few issues.  Arrived in a timely manner and will report back if there is anything noteworthy.  :-)</li>
            <li> Maybe my case is the exception, but I did not see positive effects when using emu oil on my face. I bought it to help dry skin and a minor case of dermatitis I get a few times a year. Based on the reviews I read I expected it to provide some results, but I had what I can only describe as a rebound effect. For instance, I used the emu oil in the morning and at night and my face would look and feel &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; for a while, but first thing in the morning and by nighttime my face would begin to itch and I saw an increase in flaky, irritated skin in the problem areas. I also noticed that I started to have flare-ups around my goatee and eyebrows that had been dormant. I quit using it and went back to using vasoline twice a day and my skin has cleared up substantially and is not itching like crazy. Based on what I have read my experience may be unique - an allergic reaction of sorts - so my opinion is only that emu oil is not good for me.</li>
            <li> My husband recently contracted Shingles and a friend of mine suggested using Emu oil on the outbreak. I ordered a bottle immediately and received it in less than 5 days.  We started applying it several times a day to his rash and got amazing results! The oil not only helped the Shingles outbreak, but also helped relieve the awful pain associated with Shingles.</li>
            <li> Makes my face  and skin super soft! I love this stuff! I am currently using all the Instanaturals products. Almost every ingredient is organic. I love this company!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first about using EMU oil! I mean, really? Oil from an Emu? But this, like all the other InstaNatural products that I&#x27;ve tried is amazing! I have very dry skin, especially on my legs and arms. And I get dry little spots and bumps. The first time I used this oil, my skin felt immediately softer. The more I use it, the less dry and wrinkly my skin looks and feels. Even the little bumps are going away. This is not a greasy oil and absorbs quite well and fast. And you don&#x27;t need a lot. I use 2 pumps on each leg and massage it in well. One pump for my arms and torso. My skin just sucks it in! No scent that I can speak of so sometimes I use the Emu Oil first and follow with a scented lotion. I&#x27;ve now been using this about 2 weeks and I&#x27;m sold. After all the money I&#x27;ve spent on dry skin lotions, I think I have finally found something that works. Using this during a very dry Minnesota winter will be the true test. I think we&#x27;ll score!  3/1/16 - ETA: LOVE this oil!! I&#x27;m on my second bottle and it really does work well for me. Absorbs so well, Perfect for using right out of the shower when skin can really absorb it.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my niece that has eczema. My sister in law always uses Emu Oil for her. This is a beautiful bottle!</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil based on a friends recommendation for scar massage after surgery. I use the oil twice daily and really enjoy the feel. It&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly. This small bottle goes a long way. I would recommend this product and plan to reorder as needed.</li>
            <li> very satisfied, instanatural went out the way to make sure i was satisfied. 10 stars</li>
            <li> To soon to review with actual benefits, but it is a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Used on my hair and it made it softer.. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I received this from the seller very quickly. It pumps out nicely. It does not smell. I bought it to help with my thinning hairline, after doing research. I use it at night, rub it in, then apply the copper peptide serum I use--(Truth in Aging). I was told by the creator of the serum that this will help it penetrate better. It has only been ten days, so it is too soon to say if it is helping. However, it does seem like I have some baby hairs again on my left temple! When I use it, my roots look a little greasy, so I then add baby powder to combat the greasiness so that my hair looks presentable to be seen.</li>
            <li> This is a really good moisturizer. It has a not so great smell but it is dry effective at keeping skin hydrated. It might even be helping me keep my eyebrows as they have been thinking due to medication. I will definitely repurchase. One star off for being an animal product which I don&#x27;t advocate for but had no other choice with the state of my skin and hair these days.</li>
            <li> I used this oil following completion of breast cancer radiation treatment. I was badly burned and blistered on a significant part of my upper body. It really did help tremendously in my healing. I&#x27;ve never been burned like this before so obviously I cannot compare it to other treatments but I can say I believe it was fantastic for quickly relieving the tight, burned skin. After putting it on a few times a day with a flat cotton pad, my skin eventually peeled and the new skin seems like baby skin. I am so grateful this Emu Oil was recommended to me and that Amazon delivered it to me so quickly. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/dry skin, which is also quite sensitive. The Emu oil helped moisturizer my dry patches without any redness or stinging.</li>
            <li> Got this in record time, sealed and everything. Using it for a keloid scar on my chest not sure if it&#x27;s working to help reduce hyperpigmentation but as for a natural moisturizer is amazing. My skin fells like silk. Truly hope it makes a difference on my scar</li>
            <li> Used this on my very dried out winter skin, worked very well. During the winter we burn wood so everyone in my house has dry, itchy, rough skin. This was perfect for it. I will now be using it on my children instead of lotion!</li>
            <li> oil is OK have not seen any benefit.</li>
            <li> It only takes 1 drop.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I loved the product. It made my skin feel smooth and silky. This product works just as well as the dremu oil that was three times the cost.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my face cream and am very satisfied. It seems to absorb better than other brands I have tried. Very satisfied and will re-order when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really getting into oils now and all you need to use is a drop. A little goes a long way. I also add a little bit of the oil into my homemade conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 2 weeks and so far I really like it. I&#x27;m using it as a moisturizer on my face after using Dr. Woods Liquid Black Soap. Together they are working wonders for my face. It&#x27;s very soft but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any decrease in the lines and wrinkles ... but then Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day and neither were my lines and wrinkles! This is a good company in which to deal and they seem to care about their customers. I asked a couple of questions and got replies very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combo skin and i break out easily.  I was using another emu oil and constantly broke out using it so I decided to switch to instanatural and I have not had any breakouts since using this emu oil, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great order it every other month</li>
            <li> My skin drinks this stuff , it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this oil for her shoulders and back and it works wonders on my hands when I rub it on her back.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not heavy on my scalp. It&#x27;s only been a week since using it and I only love the feel. I have not seen any results. I more feel like my hair just will never grow but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li> lost 2/3 a bottle leaving in hotel at nieces graduation.  Everyone in party had been using it .  Good stuff. Reordered</li>
            <li> Excellent product leaves your skin very soft with a healthy glow..</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been desperate to find something that would help my skin which has been going through severe skin infections and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I tried this out and my skin started healing nicely. Because it is relatively thick with a minor scent, it moisturized my skin immensely well without filler/harmful ingredients. I also use this after chemical peels and it works the same, helping to keep my skin moisturized for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next test and most important for me was finding something to help my pup&#x27;s skin and hair which had been feeling dry and brittle. I tried a few pumps of the oil on his slightly damp skin and let it sink in. The scent remained for a while but after 2 days, his coat was shiny and silky and there was no scent. I&#x27;ve done this a 2 more times and since then I don&#x27;t have to do it anymore. His coat is silky smooth after a bath without adding anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another holy grail product from InstaNatural that I will highly recommend to those dealing with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like EMU oil and this is a good brand. I have purchased a couple of bottles. It does moisturize well but doesn&#x27;t always absorb really well especially on the face. Maybe I used a little too much but it I don&#x27;t think so. I also think it may be a little pore clogging at least on me. I have cut back on my use on my face and my skin is actually feeling better.</li>
            <li> The BEST skin oil ever! Perfection!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something  that will  help my skin! Thanks to Amazon  - I have found  it now! I just wish it was a little bit  - affordable  meaning  a bigger amount  in the bottle!</li>
            <li> Great product- instantly absorbed!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with InstaNatural pure emu oil. I had never used it before, as with other instaNatural products, they are easy to dispense and just a few drops leave your skin well moisturized and glowing!</li>
            <li> This is a great quality oil that has so many uses.  At the present time my husband is using it for massaging his amputation scar.  I&#x27;ve been using it for my dry winter skin.  Good to have on hand.</li>
            <li> This does make your hair greasy. You do have to wash it out. Afterwards it will feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Love it will order more!!!</li>
            <li> Really awesome texture: silky and not greasy and readily absorbed. And the pump dispenser bottle is great for getting just the right amount and it also allows you to use every precious drop! It&#x27;s my first time trying this brand after using another emu oil for more than a year and I&#x27;m really glad I ordered it. In fact, I&#x27;m ordering a 2nd bottle to take to a friend. Emu oil has made such a huge difference in my life this past year. I use it over top of my facial treatment products because it literally &#x27;pushes&#x27; the product into your skin which makes it more effective (and you can use less of those expensive skin treatments!) And because I have a chronic pain condition that requires a topical compounded rx from the pharmacy, I also apply the emu oil over top of it for the same reason- it makes my rx work better.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. Customer Service at InstaNatural has been exceptional as well: super friendly, quick on-time delivery and great follow-thru! Thanks Phil!</li>
            <li> The EMU oil is very high quality, I use it to moisturize my hair and skin and I can feel the difference it makes. It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, the pumping mechanism of the nozzle works very well at delivering a consistent flow of the oil without getting too messy, which was an issue I&#x27;ve dealt with with other products. The seller offered exceptional service and followed up with me to reassure I was completely satisfied. Overall great product and great service!</li>
            <li> Great product! We use it for nourishing the skin and diluting essential oils. I have been particularly impressed by the company&#x27;s customer service. They sent me a follow up email with helpful tips and have been very conscientious, especially for a rather inexpensive item. They really care about their customers!</li>
            <li> I purchased several products from InstaNaturals and I very much like them all. This is my favorite, along with the Rosehip oil and Vitamin C serum. I use it every other night or so. It is very very moisturizing and I find it refreshing at the same time. My face feels great after the application. I&#x27;m still on my first bottle but I think this will also (in addition to their Vitamin C serum) become a staple in my skin care collection.I will purchase from this company again, as they have a nice collection of products in their line and those that I&#x27;ve tried so far, work well for me. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for about a week now and can already tell a difference in my skin. I have been happy with a few other oils I&#x27;ve ordered from InstaNaturals so I decided to go with them again for this one. It arrived on time and in good condition. I&#x27;ve been using this oil by adding a drop or two to my serum at night and it&#x27;s really helped to give my skin an extra moisture boost. I&#x27;ve also started using it on my hands and cuticles and can really see a difference there as well. I even have combination oily skin, but this oil soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. I would definitely order again and will recommend this oil to anyone looking to add moisture to their routine.</li>
            <li> Very nice meets expectations.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this on her recent ear cartilage piercings. The product is the same as the one at the Body Piercing Shop, but much cheaper. She really likes the pump on top so there is less waste. Product came quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face after a shower. It feels wonderful. I put a small amount in my hair, and it is less dry and more manageable. It has no odor. It does not make my eyes burn, like anything else I use does.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Has changed my skin for good and is helping with stretch marks I have too. I am hooked!</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews, but I just had to write about what an awesome product for treating skin ailments this is in case it would help someone else. I live on a farm in Wisconsin and I am outside or in the barn at least 8 hours a day. This winter I got frostbite on my cheeks and nose that caused my face and skin to become bruised, swollen and broken.  I try to heal myself and my livestock naturally with natural products, but after over two months of trying everything else I knew of, I found some info on emu oil and decided to give this a try. Nothing that I was using was helping to totally heal the damaged skin until I started to use this emu oil.  I used it straight, as well as in combination with castor oil and some other essential oils known for skin healing properties. This product was the magic bullet that finally added the extra healing power I was looking for. I saw changes immediately and within 5 days my skin was finally back to normal and I don&#x27;t look like I fell on my face anymore!  Great to use as a carrier oil with essential oils to rub on achy joints too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say that the seller is fabulous. The package arrived quickly and in good shape.  There is correspondence from them from the time the order is placed, inquiring that all is good, as well as sending tips on uses for the oil. I realize that this is probably all computer generated but it is still nice.I would recommend the seller and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have bought this twice and will continue to purchase it; it is that good.  I grew up on an Emu farm and we harvested our own oils, this is as pure as the oil we harvested and refined.  It lasts for quite awhile, depending on what you use it for.....I use it for tons of things.  I have used it on 2nd degree burns to aid in faster healing, I use it in my hair to resolve split ends and weak roots; as an aftershave lotion...for it doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.  My favorite use is an overnight skin softener, as my hands spend all day in water and are pretty chapped by days end.  It also makes a great chap stick and rash cream.  It has no smell or coloration to worry about and takes very little to go a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use this emu oil. better than I  expected. I&#x27;ll keep trying,</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product. After one night I saw a markable difference in how my skin looks - also healed some blemishes and reduced redness very quickly. Used on my daughter who had a serious cut and it healed much faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 2 weeks and can already tell a huge difference..I love this oil</li>
            <li> I received this through Uberz.com at a great price.  This is a Silky smooth oil that penetrates into the skin. This oil is great as a daily moisturizer for body and hands. It leaves skin soft and eliminates dryness. Loving it!</li>
            <li> I use this Emu oil for my fry skin. I massage it into my skin right after i take a shower and it doesn&#x27;t leave no greasy feeling or anything and absolutely no smell, which i love. I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about three weeks now and i cant honestly feel a difference in my skin. I don&#x27;t have no more dry and flaky skin. Thank you for the opportunity to review this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!! Works really well for dry skin. Also helps my father with his neoropothy pain in his hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Good quality. I have purchased a few times. It is comparable to a far more expensive one I was using.</li>
            <li> Seemed to help with dry skin and bags under the eyes. Not sure if more than what simple olive oil would do, it does help.</li>
            <li> Love the way it moisturiZes</li>
            <li> I love the oil, actually my whole family do. I have to hide the bottle from them. I will be ordering two more bottles.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Seller emailed with instructions of use etc I had questions and they were answered.</li>
            <li> I have  been trying different products to find a moisturizer that i liked.  Emu oil is at the top of my list because it works great on my face and also has pain relief qualities for my body.  Also works on burns, cuts, bug bites, etc.  Love that it is multi purposed..  I was very impressed with this product have have told my family and friends about it.</li>
            <li> I use this in my curly natural hair to add moisture just after washing my hair and also before blow drying to flat iron. It&#x27;s not too thick and does not leave a bad smell. The packaging is exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li> Excellent Emu Oil. Bought from this seller several times.  It is whitish in color as it suppose to be, very oily, yet absorbs into the skin fairly quickly. I use it for sore neck/shoulders muscle pain and I don&#x27;t know how it happens, but the aches and pain disappear. I also get itchy palms in the afternoons, and one drop into the palms and the itching is gone. I use it before bedtime on face and scalp, my facial skin is supple and bouncy (I need to lose some weight.) and my scalp is healthy. Only 3 drops for the aching muscles, and one drop for the face and scalp. Amazing results. My only question is, &amp;#34;How do they get the oil from the emu?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the answer is simple, like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;We talk to the emu, she signs a consent, we milk her oil glands gently, about once a week, until we fill out a bottle. The emu lives in our vast gardens and receives massage and pedicure once a month . She has a large family so social issues are not involved in obtaining this oil. The entire family is very happy, they have a beautiful playground for the children, and there are at least 43 emus (and counting) in this particular clan. We cook for them and clean after them daily, and TLC cameras are following this emu tribe everywhere they go, including showing how the oil is obtained. It&#x27;s all perfectly kosher, and everyone benefits.&amp;#34; If anything, buy it for the emu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband says they cook the emu, remove the fat, sell it to people, and eat it. No wonder he has no friends.</li>
            <li> Was really surprised at how good this product is.  Just ordered another bottle!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and will recommend it to others</li>
            <li> This stuff is an amazing moisturizer while on accutane! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought it to use with essential oils and it blended nicely and really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> so far I see less hair fall out</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love this product and so far every other InstaNatural product that I have tried. This oil is light and absorbs quickly. It has become part of my everyday routine most mornings and every night!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing! This stuff is my new favorite moisturizer. It&#x27;s been healing my acne scars, along with keeping my face feeling healthy and moisturized for a full 24 hour period. Definitely recommend for anyone that wants a healthy looking and feeling face.</li>
            <li> The Pure Emu Oil is quite emollient and seems to soak right into the skin. It keeps my skin soft on a daily basis and is very natural;  does not clog the pores.  Really love this stuff!  The customer service of InstaNatural is fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying the EMU Oil but I must say I am extremely pleased with the results for hair and skin. It is emolient, soft odorless and very moisturizing. I have been even using it for my under eyes. I like that it comes in a dark glass bottle. I was inspired by Cate Blanchett&#x27;s interview and I was very happy to end up liking it objectively. It will be a staple item for me and great customer service to reach out to me and ask if I liked the product. I bought this on my own and this is a completely unbiased personal review.</li>
            <li> Could not say that it did anything .,, sorry</li>
            <li> I tried this on my hair. It has no smell which is ok, but I prefer a scent to things I put in my hair. I didn&#x27;t feel as though it did anything for my hair except make it greasy. :/ The oil didn&#x27;t seem to penetrate my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this for dry patches on face chi  area from waxing little better</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My coworker&#x27;s wife recommend emu oil for my son who has been tortured for eczema for more than 4 years. Glad to find this product. It absorbs fast and help the skin recover. I also buy another brand so that I can compare which one works better. There is no difference for the quality but the other one is more expensive. I have bought two bottles and used all of them.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this Emu Oil. I used it after foot surgery and my scar is barely visible now. Also use it on the back of my hands which are always dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my extra dry areas. My knees, ankles, feet, elbows and hands soak this in like water. After 4 days I really noticed the difference. I will continue to use, but in the short term, I am impressed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and use it for everything. I put it on my face for moisturizing, my hair tips for split ends, my scalp for hair growth. Wonderful stuff with no odor and absorbs super fast. This is my personal and honest opinion and I will buy again! My boyfriend even likes it for scalp massages. Very high quality oil.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than other brands, lasts a long time and works great!</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t do what I was hoping it would do for my hair (reduce thinning) after 6 months of use, but otherwise it is a fine product for moisturizing etc.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t try it on my hair but it does work nicely on my legs - makes the skin soft and glowing...i can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s super moisturizing, it works like any other oil...it doesn&#x27;t have strong smell so can be applied just by itself or mixed with your favorite butter (coco. coconut or shea)fo</li>
            <li> It works great! I love this oil and will continue to use this product. Came quick and on time.</li>
            <li> Sadly, EMU oil isn&#x27;t as popular in the states as it is in other countries. I hope more people hear about it because it does wonders for my hair! I absolutely love using it as an &amp;#34;oil-mask&amp;#34;. I leave it in my hair overnight or during a day when I&#x27;m not going out (you will look VERY greasy haha) and then I just shampoo my hair thoroughly. Your hair will feel so incredibly soft, and look noticeably healthier! I do this about every other week because I damage my hair alot from using a 400 degree curling iron haha. I only recommend this one by InstaNatural because it is refined, therefore, it has been processed and cleaned. I love how InstaNatural products are all natural so I highly HIGHLY recommend them!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve tried variety of face oils and this is the best so far.  It absorbs very well. No breakouts. It&#x27;s thick enough consistency and absorbs very well. But do try to use it at night. The sun might burn your face if you use it during the day(it is oil after all ...).  Now I use my other face oils for my body and hair.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft, not oily.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my skin.  Even though it goes on oily, it penetrates skin quickly. I also use on scalp...it helps relieve the dry winter itch.</li>
            <li> I use you oil every morning on my face and neck, it appears that the wrinkles fade away, I love you oil,&lt;br /&gt;burn my finger and used the oil on my finger it stopped the burning and no blistering.</li>
            <li> Good price for the pure oil.  Already seeing great improvements in my dry skin and sore joints.  Keep it up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of Emu Oil for use in moisturizing skin and hair. I&#x27;m grateful to have found this product now! Not only is it fragrance free, it&#x27;s a thick oil closer to a gel, that really absorbs into your skin. I&#x27;ve been using for my extremely dry skin areas (knees, elbows, and heels) and have seen an improvement in just a few days. It leaves my skin feeling much softer and the anti-inflammatory aspect has really helped heal my dehydrated skin. A little truly does go a long way with this product. You just need a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> I use Instanatural&#x27;s emu oil after the hyaluronic acid serum or the C serum.  It keeps my skin moisturized. I love that it is natural and it has many great benefits. It is anti inflammatory and heals wounds quickly. I dab it on paper cuts and zits to prevent scaring.  I use it around the eyes and it does not cause irritation. I also use it on my eye brows to promote hair growth.  It is a great moisturizer and at this price I can afford to use it all over my entire body.</li>
            <li> My first bottle arrived leaking &amp; I emailed the seller with my concerns. The seller did a wonderful job replacing it, very quickly!! It is a great product &amp; I would recommend it : )</li>
            <li> emu oil came as an add-on to something else that I purchased. I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to do with it. Turns out that it is an excellent moisturizer. Who knew?</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Emu Oil product a few weeks ago and it is a great moisturizing tool for my face and hands when used daily.  I apply small amount to my face in  morning after my vitamin C serum and then apply my makeup.  You will only need a small amount for daily use on your face.  At night I am more generous when applying.  The Emu Oil is a great product to have on hand.  I used it for muscle soreness a few times at night and it seems to really work!  I will continue to purchase and use this product and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This InstaNatural Emu oil has a lot of uses so its really handy to have on hand and in your medicine chest. it works really well for sun burn or itchy skin. you can use it as an intensive moisturizer anytime you want your skin to feel comfortable.I FOUND OUT IT WORKS REALLY WELL ON CRACKED HEALS ON THE FEET!. With so many uses and it being so natural its a great product to keep handy especially this summer when skin irritations can be a problem .&lt;br /&gt;The company sent me a free sample in order to do this review but my opinions are my own . I really do love all InstaNatural products you get so much more in them than many higher priced beauty products</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it in my hair when i do a twist out style it gives me a natural shine and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down(but thick hair requires quite a bit of it) and I also use it on my face and bikini area after waxing.  It&#x27;s so light and long lasting.  ALOT goes a long way on your skin!!! I just ordered my 2nd bottle</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to help with eczema that breaks out on my eyelids. I tried other moisturizers but they irratated my eyes or vision and only helped a little with the flare-ups. This product does not irratate my eyes or interfere with my vision PLUS it actually has helped keep flare-ups from happening. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I use for my face now and I love it. (I did start a vitamin D regiment along with using this oil and I believe the combo have been my personal answer to managing my eczema) It also has soothed my chapped lips better than lip balms.</li>
            <li> Great oil, use it on my face and it looks beautiful the next day! Even gets rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> In all likelihood, you are going about your treatment all wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like my mother, I get those thick cracked heels, no matter what kind of shoes, no matter what kind of treatment. I even went to a podiatrist and was told it is hereditary, other than a pumice there is not much you can do. Until recently, the only way to tame them was with a callus razor. One false move and my pedicure area looked like a crime scene.&lt;br /&gt;Then I splurged on an upscale, indecently priced pedicure. Instead of the usual soak followed by buff, it was the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My completely dry feet were rasped, buffed, and THEN soaked. After a soak came the usual pedicure, followed by a massage with...EMU OIL. Best pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had (and I&#x27;ve had many!) but at that outrageous price I was determined to take what I learned and try to duplicate it at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using easily available tools, and not the hours of wet or dry buffing you might have already tried, you can get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Take something like the [[ASIN:B00756HQNQ Microplane Colossal Pedicutre Rasp Brown]], and use it with the same technique as your sandpaper type file or pumice, on bone dry feet. Go light and easy, especially the first time. After, this emu oil, and, if you like, a wet pedicure or shower followed by a bit more emu on the feet. I usually rasp, then oil, and put on white socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous oil was a flip-top, this is a much easier dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review purposes</li>
            <li> it has been just ok , it was not as good as it has been described</li>
            <li> I love emu oil, and this is the perfect product! It works very well. Put it on at least 2 times a day to see results.</li>
            <li> I like how the ingredients are listed out but you can barely read it because of the label color and print.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell for sure but I love the feel of my skin and like rubbing excess into my hair to make it shine!</li>
            <li> Wow!..  Great product!  I&#x27;m seeing changes to thinning hairline.</li>
            <li> It seems like good oil. I have had healing success with it. It it very soothing on dry,cracked skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin more shining and reduces the dryness problem.</li>
            <li> The best emu oil that I have purchase and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt; I would know because I tried another brand on Amazon because it was selling for a good price and it was 8 oz.  But turn out to be so thick and heavy that I started to get break out.  This 100% emu oil by Instanatural is very light and soaked into my skin without leaving it  greasy or oily.  I normal use it in the spring, fall and  summer because it is so light on my face ( replace my face cream) and body.</li>
            <li> I like putting a very small amount on my baby&#x27;s bottom a couple of times a day to help ward off redness and rashes and it seems to be working well! Been using it for years with my nephew too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping; Great product; Comes in dark bottle to keep in fresh. This is a great oil and can be used for so many different things!  We currently use it for dry skin (cold, midwest weather!) ;  it soaks right into the skin...doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy.  I am looking forward to discovering all of its great uses.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff &amp;#60;3 hair, nails, feminine use &amp;#60;3 and exceptional customer service &amp;#60;3 highly highly recommend</li>
            <li> So far so good!!!! I am making my own hair products and your oil is apart of my recipe, and I&#x27;m loving the way my hair feels after using it! I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a facial moisturizer but you are allergic or sensitive to most face creams (ie. it causes your face to burn or rash) then this is for you. During the winter when my face gets dry and flaky, this works very quickly. Just apply before going to bed!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, amazing gel-like oil that I applied to the dry patches on my shoulders (eczema) and immediately saw the inflammation disappear.  It has no fragrance and absorbs instantly.  I came across Emu Oil when reading about natural recipes for hair and body products replacements.  I did a little research and selected this oil and could not be happier.  The company sent a personal email asking about product satisfaction and I feel appreciated.  I am a happy customer and can&#x27;t wait to try this product out on my hair, scalp and face, as well.  It really could be a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> I have used other emu oils but like this one much better. I like the pump action and the way the oil feels when it goes on. I live in Minnesota and use this on my face during the cold harsh winters. It keeps my face from drying out and my completion looks much better. I have struggled with acne for years and the anti inflammatory properties of emu oil help keep my face acne free as well as moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on my face before a moisturizer. It seems to hold moisture in my skin better than the rose hip oil I had been using. It absorbs quickly. In very dry cold weather, I have also used emu oil on an itchy back instead of usual body lotion. The emu oil seems more healing of dry and irritated areas. I have quite sensitive skin and this product has caused no problems, irritation or redness or blemishes. It is easy on the skin. There is no odor either.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this InstaNatural Pure Emu Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first heard about this product, I admit I was a little bit unsure. Emu oil was a completely foreign thing to me! I researched it, and found a lot of people who raved about how well it worked for their skin and hair. This kinda gave me a peace of mind in trying it. I am so glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bit might be a little TMI, but I am a frank type of person. I am a bigger busted woman, and during the warmer months, I tend to get a bit of a heat rash under my bust where my bra sits on my skin. If you are a chesty woman, then you know what I mean! It has been warming up where I live and sure enough, I started noticing redness under my bust. I put a drop onto my fingertips and massaged it onto the red areas at night, and within 3 days the heat rash was completely gone. I have also been using this on my scalp, elbows, legs, feet... you name it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is great since it has a pump feature, it makes things less messy. The oil is very easy to rub into your skin and there is no gross greasy feeling once applied. Also there is no smell at all! Your skin will love this emu oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a bit timid as to trying this, I highly suggest purchasing it and giving it a try of your own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I just used in on my hands because I am always washing my hands and I have neglected to use lotion like I should.  Anyway, it soaked right into my hands.  It softened the wrinkles I have on my hands in seconds.  I wonder what my hands will look like in a few days.  My hands do feel a little itchy, but the direction did say test just a little, but a little when a long way. I just rubbed the top of my hands together.  The only other area are the heels of my feet.  I think the result will be great.  The itchy just stopped.  REMEMBER, SOFTENED IS THE KEY WORD.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased to help with these small, painful sores I get on my scalp every now and then BUT then I started using this stuff daily as a face moisturizer post shower/face wash and honestly I&#x27;m speechless with the results.  Within minutes my skin&#x27;s natural moisture is restored instantly, morning puffiness is completely gone and it keeps your face perfectly moisturized throughout the entire day; probably longer.  I&#x27;m a 29 yr old male and my skin looks better than it did when I was 21.  Moreover, do you have a sun burn?  A REALLLLLY bad sunburn?  Slather this stuff on (actually a little goes a long way) and within 10-15 minutes your skin will thank you and the itch/burn/redness will be significantly improved.  Zero burn when applied (I couldn&#x27;t move for over 10 minutes when I sprayed myself with the burn spray bc I was in so much pain) and works infinitely better than Aloe Vera (also burned for 10+ minutes).  It&#x27;s honestly ridiculous how well this stuff works on everything it touches and I just ordered a 2nd bottle b/c the uses seem endless.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I will definitly recommend</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is exactly as advertised. So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased InstaNatural 100% Pure Emu Oil to use on my face.  I am 63.  I have rosacea.  I love this product!  In only one week of use I am noticing a positive improvement in the redness of my skin.  However, the biggest surprise is how wonderfully Emu oil t is working on my cracked heels.  I&#x27;ve tried many products to heal my rough, cracked heels.  Nothing has helped.  In less than a week my heels are becoming smooth, soft and the cracks are healing.  I am impressed.  The oil has almost no odor.  It sinks into the skin quickly leaving no oily residue.</li>
            <li> It was greasy and a bit icky because I know how it&#x27;s made.. but you cant beat the moisture!</li>
            <li> I got this discounted for my review and this is honestly fabulous that my hubby is using it on his dry cracked hands that he gets from work. It does not leave your hands or face oily suprisingly. Just sooo soft and my skin drinks it up. I have other high end oils so was weary about this but you HAVE to try it!!!!</li>
            <li> This oil smells great and is a large amount- a little bit goes a long way, so I think it will last a long time. Works great!</li>
            <li> Although the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, it has a very odd / particular scent to it. And beneficial or not, I hate to think that this stuff is from a poor bird. Can&#x27;t bring myself to using it when there are so many other oils out there that don&#x27;t involve animal cruelty.</li>
            <li> I really like your Emu oil. I wish I had known about its marvelous benefits to my skin a long time ago. I use it in the morning and evening on my face and neck after washing with your Emu soap. I now have my two daughters using it.  My son-in-law experiences Psoriasis and I recommended the soap to him as it is healing and has no added fragrance. I have recommended your product to many of my friends and acquaintances. It is my new &amp;#34;natural moisturizer&amp;#34;. I use it on my scalp and the dry ends of my hair a couple of times a month as a conditioner with great results.</li>
            <li> This oil is simply a bless !</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. I use on my hair</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, and have found that most moisturizers I use just almost sit on top of my skin.  This is different, when I use the 100% pure emu oil it seems thick and oily at first, but once it soaks in it feels amazing.  My skin looks moisturizer and healthy, not dry with thick cream on top of it like most lotions do.  I have noticed more of a glow to my skin since using it.  I am very happy with the emu oil and feel good about using a natural oil instead of chemically processed lotion, I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I have not yet begun to see the growing effects of this product on my hair as I have just started using it. However, I like the lightness of the oil and it has a very pleasant smell. I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazingly working on an area of my skin that I did order it for. Whereas I had used Rx creams and OTC antibiotics. So, it&#x27;s only been two weeks. I love how it hydrates my skin after facial scrubs. Alopecia was my primary reason for ordering, so I will give it a little more time. Excellent product to have on hand!</li>
            <li> We purchased this as a recommend for scar healing. We haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell you if it helps for that but I recently had a vascectomy and it was amazing for helping to heal my incesions! We are using it for diaper rashes as well, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it makes my hair and skin feel so good! Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Emu Oil before, but being such a fan of  InstaNatural I tried this oil. Well, another fabulous product!!! This oil has so many benefits, but the main use for me is on my hands and nails.I am going to start using for muscle and joint pain as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this emu oil for several weeks. I use it mainly on my legs. I have extremely dry skin, which is also sun damaged. This oil is amazing. First, a little goes a long way. I use it only on the front of my legs. You wouldn&#x27;t believe the difference. My legs feel like silk again and the dark spots are fading. Thank you InstaNatural!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how amazing this oil is!!!  Everyone got a bottle for Christmas...will continue through 2016 buying this product from this seller...both are fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> Use it regularly; see zero improvement but I have not given up; sometimes afraid it might be aggravating them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same experience when I tried rose hip oil and also with coconut oil; so it may just be too soon with fresh scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it less regularly on my stomach (ancient scars) and see no change.</li>
            <li> We love this Emu Oil.  Using it on cracked and dry heels and after about 2 weeks your skin will be healed and begin to look healthy.  On my cuticles it helps prevent hang nails.  I have recently begun using it on my face as advised by my aesthetician to help with uneven skin tone along with adding moisture.  So far I have noticed a dramatic increase in my skin and its smoothness.  This Emu Oil is completely fragrance free, which is a Huge bonus for me and my husband.  A little goes a Long, Long way so this bottle should last our family a good long while.  You should try it, I think you will be amazed at the many ways you will be able to use it.</li>
            <li> Very helpful in easing discomfort of joints.  I use it all of the time.  I really wouldn&#x27;t want to be without Emu Oil and like this particular type because of the way it dispenses the oil.  It has helped me a lot by easing my arthritis.</li>
            <li> Works well as a moisturizer, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t really leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> The product was not in its package the package box was smashed product was rolling around inside the box I was not pleased however there was no spillage of the product.</li>
            <li> When I first read that this was Emu oil I was a little confused. I never heard of Emu oil at all or what it was used for. After reading up about it, I learned that it can be used in so many different ways. I mainly purchased this for my dry skin. Expecially during the winter times, my skin can get very dry. Applying some Emu oil after I get off the shower allows my skin to feel nice the rest of the day. I would purchase again for my family to use whenever we have dry skin</li>
            <li> Could not use, because bottle was broken when received.</li>
            <li> The best night moisturizer ever.</li>
            <li> Because of my dry skin I&#x27;ve used a lot of moisturizers and creams to maintain smooth, moist skin. Some of these have worked better than others. I was unfamiliar with Emu Oil when I received this Instanatural 100% pure oil for review. Because I wanted to make sure that it was the Emu Oil that was making the difference, I chose two specific places to apply it. The skin around my achilles tendons is about the driest skin on my body. I have applied the Emu Oil for nearly two weeks now, and it has made a definite difference. Although the skin is still in the process of recovery, this is the smoothest it&#x27;s been in years. The second place was my cuticles, which are generally damaged.I&#x27;ve applied the Emu Oil to the cuticles, and even those that are most damaged are regenerating quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue using it. It&#x27;s extremely moist and soothing, and a little goes a long way. It applies nicely, works its way into the skin quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Nice quality oil. Not over refined and no foul odor. Using for skin and hair and works well</li>
            <li> I purchased this Emu oil to use on my one year old daughters sensitive dry skin. I found out about this product line from a close friend who highly recommended it. Firstly, I do not like chemicals when it comes to products I use for my daughter. Secondly, so many lotions seem to really bother her skin. How I use the emu oil,,,,I use this Emu oil on my daughters whole body after her bath while her body is still wet. I also use it to help prevent diaper rash. I have been using this emu oil now for about a month on my little girl and it truly works for her dry skin. I no longer feel small rough patches on her belly. I would like to add, that her doctor said she might have a very mild case of eczema. I also have very very sensitive skin. I  use the Emu oil sometimes on my own skin,,, face, and body. I only use it on my face once it a while but when I do, I do not get any breakouts. I will purchase this emu oil again when I run out, but a little oil goes along way so I will not need to buy another bottle for a while. I would like to add that the company truly is a five star company. I am a busy mother who tends to order from Amazon because it seems to make purchasing fast and hassle free. Two weeks after I purchased my two products from this company, I received a &amp;#34;THANK YOU&amp;#34; email, asking how I like the product line, if I have any concerns, and how much the company values itself on customer service. I loved the extra steps this company took to insure my liking of their products. Customer service is a five star, and the product emu oil, five star.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  No issues at all with seller.</li>
            <li> A light oil but I am not seeing any results for hair and skin after 2 1/2 months</li>
            <li> Just like any other oil.</li>
            <li> I love the Emu oil on my skin.  It is quickly absorbed, which I really like.</li>
            <li> This brand of Emu oil is very light, but very moisturizing.  Have had some chronic reddened areas on lower legs from edema, and almost gone.  Also has helped a strained muscle in upper arm.  The price is good as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I find this product to be free of scent and light weight so it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders, have to use as directed.</li>
            <li> I first used Emu oil over 5 months ago and I LOVE this remarkable, 100% Pure all Natural Oil. Living in a very dry climate such as LV,&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil to moisturize my crown and seal my ends and it has worked wonders; my scalp and hair is no longer dry.&lt;br /&gt;My story with this amazing all NATURAL Emu oil began when I bought a shampoo from a seller which damaged my hair and broke it. Using&lt;br /&gt;this amazing Emu oil every other day in my crown, hairline and ends, it BEGAN TO transform my hair within 4 weeks to the point of being&lt;br /&gt;noticeable. The additional AMAZING benefits that surprised me was the THICKNESS; &amp;#34;MY HAIR BECAME THICKER, STRONGER, AND BEGAN TO GROW&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I must add that I also take supplements.&lt;br /&gt;Insta Natural 100% PURE ULTRA PREMIUM EMU OIL, is non-greasy, odorless, has a thick translucent milky color (depending on the seasons)&lt;br /&gt;and when applied, it deeply penetrates the roots and conditions the hair leaving it feeling extra soft and manageable; not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emu oil has wonderful skin care benefits. It can be used as a moisturizer and as a skin nourishing treatment, and I LOVE using InstaNatural&lt;br /&gt;100% PURE ULTRA PREMIUM Emu oil on my face and body before bedtime after I shower. I LOVE the way it absorbs into the skin without leaving&lt;br /&gt;any greasy effects!&lt;br /&gt;The monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid (Omega 9) is the major fatty acid in emu oil. This fatty acid is a known enhancer for transport&lt;br /&gt;of bioactive compounds into the skin and has the ability to be absorbed quickly and penetrate deeply when applied externally. I mixes a few&lt;br /&gt;drops with my daily body lotion and it keeps my skin moisturized until night-time. Insta Natural Emu oil keeps my face SOFT as baby skin and&lt;br /&gt;plump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole composition of emu oil is very similar to our skin&#x27;s own fatty acid composition and I LOVE that. The purity of Emu oil is great for&lt;br /&gt;treating fine lines and wrinkles as well. The healthy benefits of emu oil actually aid the body at all levels. For these reason and more you&lt;br /&gt;will find that emu oil can be effective for a wide range of applications such as.&lt;br /&gt;* Anti-Aging Effect&lt;br /&gt;* Stretch Marks &amp; Scars&lt;br /&gt;* Cuts &amp; Scrapes&lt;br /&gt;* Hair Care&lt;br /&gt;* Itching and inflammation&lt;br /&gt;* If you have any sprains or swelling, apply a few drops and apply light bandage.&lt;br /&gt;Once I got bitten by a Scorpion and the Emu Oil saved me the stress as I immediately rubbed it into the sting and the pain slowly subsided&lt;br /&gt;without any swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see the TRUE benefits of this NATURAL deep penetrating non-greasy oil, you need to be consistent. I&#x27;ve used it over 4 months straight&lt;br /&gt;without switching oils or lotions!

            <li> Great product. Not too greasy. Smell is very light.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of oil of emu oil. Initially when I learned about its use for a large variety of skin issues I was somewhat sceptical. Its fatty acids claim help with inflammation (acute rather than chronic inflammation). It supposed to help a variety of skin issues from cuts and and nicks to reducing scarring and help with athlete&#x27;s foot. With so many claims I was both curious and slightly sceptical. After using it for a while I do like it. I am using it to treat the scar on my shin, which is both ugly in appearance and sensitive to touch. I apply emu oil daily after the shower and my skin is noticeably less red and sensitive to touch. I think it looks better, although I can&#x27;t say it became invisible. The skin just looks less irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emu oil is quite thick and somewhat milky in appearance. It is not greasy. After applying it with my figures I did not feel like I needed to wash my hands. The oil is totally unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil comes in a 4 oz bottle with a spray applicator. I prefer to open the bottle and use a cue tip to spread the oil on my leg which allows me a better control of where the oil lands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This emu oil provided by Insta Natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> a dry oil that quickly soaks in, unlike an almond oil, for example.  The spout provides a nice amount.</li>
            <li> Works well... I used it on my scalp and nails.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great for moisturizing and does not clog pores. Also it absorbs very quickly so you can put it on in the evening and the morning.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I use it for my skin. Even tho my skin is already very smooth, there are certain areas on my chest &amp; back that aren&#x27;t. Probably because of the excessive use of hot water. But after rubbing it in those areas after a shower,  the next morning I noticed a considerable difference in my skin! It was much smoother and softer. I could probably go without using it daily, but why would I? My only wish is that there were larger sized bottles.  I&#x27;m about to order my third one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my feet, stretch marks and C-section scar, on my nails, etc. This is a very multi-functional product. It absorb easily and deeply, instead of floating on the surface of my skin. Love how hydrated my skin feels. Any kind of oil is a must-have at my thirties. Thank you Instanatural!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using on dry spots I get on my fair skin; seems to be helping! Very happy so far!</li>
            <li> This item was delivered on time, and it healing agents is amazing.</li>
            <li> Use on my knees and my face and hand s terrific product</li>
            <li> The oil is great for healing scars. My son had cracked skin around his earlobe for months. It&#x27;s starting to heal and seal the scar. I used on a sore as well and it started to heal within days. I love it as a moisturizer for my face as well!  I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair after I washed it..it was the best flat iron turn out. She said &amp;#34;my hair feels like silk&amp;#34; I am happy I purchased two bottles on pure faith alone!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we ordered.  It arrived in a very timely manner.  The push pump dispenser is a good way to get a small amount, much better than another brand that we tried.  The oil is good and works for both my husband and I.  We will order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I  use this on my face and neck first thing in the morning and at bedtime. I have been using Emu oil for years. I am 60 and constantly get compliments on how young my skin looks!Emu oil is awesome for my skin! I recently switched brands to this convenient pump which saves product and mess.The quality of this product is immeasureable!I will continue to use this great and reasonable product!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I only recently started using Emu oil, but a little goes a long way. I use this twice a day (morning and night) mixed with my AmLactin lotion and my skin feels so silky smooth and soft. I also use this on both my hairline and my hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily. Just to note: my hair is naturally thick. Now, it is a bit pricey, so that is why I mix it with another product to get maximum spread, so hopefully it will last for a while. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised with how well this worked.  I didn&#x27;t think it would help my child&#x27;s eczema or my dry cracking feet, but it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wasn&#x27;t sure about this as a moisturizer at all when I first got this product to test and try and review.  The oil isn&#x27;t your typical oil feel or look.  Its more of a milky white goo that oils your skin without feeling oily to the touch once its rubbed in all the way.  My youngest child and husband have eczema and I wanted to see if this would help their extra dry skin.  I get really dry skin in the summer time so I wanted to see if the Emu oil would help keep my skin soft and smooth.  My hair isn&#x27;t super dry at the moment, but by the end of the summer I&#x27;ll need to trim off the dry hair from all the time at the pool and beach.  With all these opportunities to test our this oil, I started right away.  My youngest&#x27;s eczema isn&#x27;t getting better by using the oil, but by using this oil he isn&#x27;t itchy, because his elbow&#x27;s are so dry.  So I see that as a positive aspect that this Emu oil is actually helping.  My husband didn&#x27;t like the feel of the oil on his skin so he only used it once.  However I have been using this on my arms (especially my elbows), and on my legs (especially my feet and knees)  I love the way it feels on my skin.  Its not sticky, super oily like baby oil or tanning oil.  It actually rubs in well, absorbs quickly just like they claim, which makes it easy to put on after I shower and my skin be clean and non oily when I put my clothing on.  Because the weather is really nice now, its great to walk around with a little bit of a shine to my legs, making it look like I was just at the beach or out in the sun, which of course is a nice perk.  The best benefit that I have found from using the Emu oil is that my legs aren&#x27;t as dry as normal, and I can actually shave faster and easier without nicking myself as often.  A huge perk since we go to the pool a lot!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is nice yo use as a moisturizer but it is a bit too heavy to use in your hair, as it weighs the hair down.  However, on your hands or other areas it is really nice. It does leave an oil like residue but it did not break me out or irritate my skin. Another exciting oil to try out!</li>
            <li> Item as described.  Shipped quickly.  A little goes a long way.  I use it on my face after my Vit. C serum.  I put it on my hair sometimes.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with insta natural! Their products are 100% natural and organic. Goodbye to lotions, face creams, cleansers, hair products. This emu oil has so many uses! My skin has never felt so soft. My skin feels wonderful! Good for your hair, nails and much more. AJ at insta natural is the BEST!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it always leaves my skin smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a problem with it thickening up, not sure if it went bad, and had to throw it away. I couldn&#x27;t get a replacement as it was out of date.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for my first order the package was ripped and the bottle fell and got broken befor I even get to use it!!!! It was not sealed well...so I bought another one to try I write a review about and I have to say After using it I don&#x27;t think that I can live without it ....its magic. Must have forever</li>
            <li> Made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other brands of Emu oil for the past year, simply trying to find one that lives up to all the research. This one is by far the closest I&#x27;ve gotten to all that emu oil is supposed to do. The first thing I noticed on contact was how smoothly it applied and how incredibly soft it made my skin feel. Since then, it has been a consistent skin softening moisturizer with every single use. No matter where you use it, on your face, hands, elbows or heels etc.. there is a remarkable transforming difference..it really makes my skin incredibly soft. I also noticed that it&#x27;s really good for my nails and cuticles. My nails have been dry lately, after a gel polish mishap and the emu oil totally moisturizes them beyond other moisturizers that are specifically for nails..I was totally impressed with that. Another unexpected bonus has been my eyebrows. Although I keep them nicely arched by waxing or more recently, threading, I&#x27;ve noticed that they have been thinning. After 2 weeks of putting the oil on my brows, I was shocked to see my brows getting fuller, I mean noticeably, unmistakably fuller.. which I totally didn&#x27;t expect. Emu oil is supposed to be good for hair growth, but I recently learned that it has to be applied generously nightly, then washed the following day, repeating the process for several weeks in order to get good results. I can&#x27;t follow that protocol so I won&#x27;t ever get those results. However, it is clear from the way my eyebrows have responded, that it would totally work. Someone else can try the tedious hair growth protocol and let me know:-) This particular brand seems to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> I hate giving reveiws. I did not like the Emu Oil. As a matter of fact I don&#x27;t like using any oils on my skin. I gave the product several attempts but I could continue to use it. I have gone back to using the Shea butter ad I like the way it treats my skin.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my sons eczema! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I like that unlike a lot of other oils...it doesn&#x27;t appear so oily. Everybody is always asking me what I put on my skin...I almost don&#x27;t want to tell them the secret ;)</li>
            <li> helped alot with my facial dry skin thank you.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this oil - it comes in a fairly dark amber bottle, which helps to protect the oil.  The emu oil I got was fresh, a light clear to cream color, and was labeled as being 100% pure.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an aboriginal treatment for inflammation, so I was using it some on the constant hives that I get.  I can&#x27;t say that it has really helped them all that much, but I also tried it on arthritic joints and it does seem to help with pain and stiffness- both my husband and I agree on that.  On the swollen hives, it didn&#x27;t really do much to make them go away, or itch less overall, but it seemed a bit soothing when first applied.  Even the strongest hydro cortisone cream doesn&#x27;t help though, but I thought it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and it&#x27;s absorbs readily.  It&#x27;s like an oil/cream at first, but it absorbs so quickly that it isn&#x27;t greasy.  It leaves skin feeling smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I have found it to be especially helpful on our knees and ankles when they hurt with arthritis.  After massaging it in, pain does seem lessened and joints less stiff.  It&#x27;s really quite nice as a massaging oil for that purpose.  It doesn&#x27;t take much either- Just a couple of squirts per joint massaged.&lt;br /&gt;I also love to use it on my cuticles.  It&#x27;s totally soothing on a hangnail, and makes my cuticles super easy to push back.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a bit of an odor, but it&#x27;s natural smelling (not chemical) and it&#x27;s very faint.  I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this oil for massaging painful joints, hand and nail care in particular.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with 1 bottle to sample for unbiased review.  I am not affiliated with this company, nor was I paid for this review.</li>
            <li> Used this on my 1 month old son after his circumcision, it healed in less then 1 week !!  I also pour some drops in his bath water makes his skin extra smooth ..</li>
            <li> My lower legs felt achy and I rubbed on the emu oil and was surprised that the pain was gone in a few minutes. I even brought the emu oil on my trip to Osaka, Japan where I am now. It will relieve the pain in my feet and knees from all the shopping.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I use it on my skin ( face and body), it really makes my skin feel soft. It seems to help me with my acne as well. Highly recommended. I&#x27;m gonna buy a second bottle.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR WHEN YOU ARE STRETCHING YOUR EARS!</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I put a couple of drops in my face and body moisturizers and my skin loves it.  I also rub it on a recent hip surgery scar.  I put a little on my hair too!  A little goes a very long way; I will definitely repurchase.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use this on my skin after using the oil cleansing method in the evening.  Leaves my skin very soft and moisturized.  Does not cause breakouts either.</li>
            <li> I have been using Emu oil for some time, but I was looking for a more reasonable price and liked what the insta natural reviews and that it is 100% Emu oil.  The shipping was very fast and packaged to protect the oil from spilling, I love the squirt bottle lid and the Emu Oil is just what I wanted.  I will be ordering again when my 2 bottle are gone,  I even have my husband using it on his sore knee.&lt;br /&gt;I really helps me with a pain I have in my foot I put it on every morning before I put my shoes on.  I also use this on my face under my makeup, and it doesn&#x27;t take very much at all, I have also been trying it on my hair like some of the reviews said and I can tell a difference in the ends of my permed and colored hair.  thank you for offering a quality product and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> returned it. arrived open. did not reorder.</li>
            <li> Works well on really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Wow. This is a great product.  I live in the desert and it gets very dry.  I use this on my hands, a touch on my hair ends and even for my kids unruly hair.  It smells OK and seems to work well.  When my bottle runs out, I will buy a second!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it morning and night mixed with my essential oils and it really helps with the blemishes on my face.  On the bottle it says a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s so true!</li>
            <li> I suffer of eczema, and this oil it&#x27;s awesome, my skin feels moisturized using this oil more than another oil that i&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My sons and husband use it for dry skin and after shaving. It is better than any shaving cream or conditioner out there.</li>
            <li> Worth Trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using my husband&#x27;s acct. Anyway this oil is helping my problem skin that has been for months. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle as both I and my husband use it. I am very happy with the result. It is indeed soothing, the healing ability for inflammation, redness and other skin irritation is exceptional. Just purchase 4 bottles! I will continue using this specially when the winter come. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wanted for hair growth,  made it very greasy. no positive results yet, but will use for skin dryness.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even describe just how good this product is, using it in only a short time made me actually stutter when trying to explain it on video review because this product needs no explanation! it does everything on its own no smell, no oily residue the product tells it all and does exactly what it should after the shower i use it on my eczema and no more itch from being dry and doesn&#x27;t even look like it was there! You should see my hair! it shines in the sun so much that i have been getting compliments on it on what i am using!</li>
            <li> First off I have to say all of the insta naturals products are amazing! I purchased the emu oil last week and I will list what I have used the product on so far.&lt;br /&gt;Hair&lt;br /&gt;Amazing  can&#x27;t say enough about how this product has transformed my hair in a week.  I put it on my hair and left over night every other night.  I woke up washed the emu oil out.  I noticed faster drying time less fly aways and my hair felt thicker  and silky smooth.  I have fine thin hair with dry ends and the emu oil did wonders.  My hair is shiny fuller and silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Cuticles&lt;br /&gt;Rubbed a little on my Cuticles every night and woke up too softer better skin around Cuticles by the morning time.  Amazing! I have tried every cuticle oil and balm on the market nothing did the job like this emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;Left wrist pain&lt;br /&gt;Rubbed a little emu oil on the left wrist and the pain was gone after about 3 applications.&lt;br /&gt;Dry feet&lt;br /&gt;Rubbed the emu oil on my feet every night put socks on.  Every morning would wake up to softer feet.  With continued  use I know my feet Will soon be very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Face&lt;br /&gt;I use a few drops after putting my vitamin c serum on.  I noticed my face feels softer and more hydrated.  Emu oil makes the vitamin c serum sink deeper into the layers of the skin so I am hoping with continued use I will see more benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this emu oil on a small blemish and it was gone in two days! This emu oil also worked great on chapped lips. Emu oil for sunburn yup that worked too.  Got a little too much sun and got a sunburn.  After a shower I Rubbed the emu oil in and after a few minutes the sting and tightness was gone. In the morning  the sunburn was literally gone!!!! I was left with a slight tan and that&#x27;s a miracle for my fair skin that always burns and peels.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive fair skin and have never had a problem with any of the insta natural products.  I did buy all of the products I use with my own money this is not a paid review.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to try this oil on various things and report back. So far this emu oil is amazing it was so worth the money and the 4oz is a generous amount.  I also like the pump  style bottle.  You often find emu oil in a dropper bottle,  I feel that having to open the bottle every time you use the product let&#x27;s oxygen in and over time that can harm the product,  with the pump style container you never have to open the bottle. .&lt;br /&gt;In short this product is amazing and a must have. I am ordering a few more bottles to keep one in my bag and one at home and of course to have a back up.  Order it you won&#x27;t regret .</li>
            <li> It was what I expected. Very fast shipping</li>
            <li> My skin can get really dry and cracked due to all my gardening. Lotion just doesn&#x27;t heal my cracked skin. I decided to try Emu oil. It wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting since the Emu oil is slightly thick and has a milky appearance. But, it doesn&#x27;t has an odor. This is a huge plus for me because I hate strong fragrances. And, it absorbs really fast and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily. After several applications of the oil on my cracked hands and cuticles, I noticed that my skin was so much softer and no longer cracked. I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then decided to try the oil on other areas of my body. I decided to try it on my stretch marks. The emu oil helped my stretch marks to heal. They looked fainter and not as aggravated as they used to look. I also have used it on my other scars to help them fade, and it seems that they are reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I want to grow out my hair, I want to keep my hair healthy. Plus, I want my hair to grow faster. I followed the advice on the Amazon page on how to apply it to my hair. I feel like my hair is softer, shinier, and healthier. I don&#x27;t know if it has boosted my hair growth yet because it is too soon to tell. But, I am impressed with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love how one oil can be used for so many different purposes! I really like this oil and I strongly recommend using it if you want your skin and hair to look radiant!</li>
            <li> This product really does exactly what it states it will do.......it  does all of the good things for your face ......hair....etc. but my pleasant surprise was I applied some oil on a muscle pain and it went away....like ZAP!!!!  Really!!!  You really should try this product...I mean it....TRY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it was bigger cuz I thought the info on the product was 14oz. Other then that, pleased with it and surprised it showed up a day earlier. :)</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product gets so much attention. It did absolutely nothing to my skin/hair.</li>
            <li> Emu oil seems to be very healing and can help many skin ailments. Pure product and great price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little like a miracle. I have had hair shedding for a year now. The doctor has me on a topical steroid which only kind of helps and gives me a headache. Still the shedding continued and the minute I went off the steroid, it got worse. I read about Emu Oil and I picked this brand because of the other great reviews. I was so pleased with the results! After three consecutive nights of using the oil on my scalp, my shedding was reduced by at least 75% and my hair is benefitting, too. I started using this on my face after I apply vitamin C serum and my skin looks great. Finally, I had some spider veins that were lasered and the healing process seemed to be taking so long, after rubbing this in one night the discoloration from that procedure was really reduced. I love this product and have already ordered a follow up bottle. I will always have some of this in my house.  *have bought multiple bottles, this stuff is great for hair and skin :)</li>
            <li> It is very good for my skin &amp; hair... For longer time I have skin problem .. My skin is very dry ....with emu its clear the problem and my skin very soft .. Also very nice for hair</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and soothing.  No odor.  A little goes a long way.  I have already bought a second bottle!</li>
            <li> ‚ÄúGoes on smooth, takes no time to soak in skin. I use it on my scar and around my eyes. Great product!‚Äù</li>
            <li> Loved the sale price, loved the quantity and the type of dispenser. Very pleased with this item!</li>
            <li> The package came on time and was neat and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product now for a few weeks and have noticed an added luster to my hair as well as an increase in new growth. I also added it to other essentials oils I use on my skin and have noticed a difference in how soft my skin is the following day and dark spots beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> I use emu oil for joint pain and psoriatic arthritis.Instanatural oil is one of the very best for this.better than pain killers.:)       i compared  your emu oil to    one that i have been using for about 10 years, and your oil is better,works faster on joint pain.  5+ stars</li>
            <li> Great product ...a multi purpose wonderüòä</li>
            <li> Love it! Product is great. I am using it for blemishes and some acne scarring and I am very happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li> Great Product....have been using it for a few weeks and already saw results....my edges are already growing back.</li>
            <li> Been using Emu Oil for my eyelashes for about three months now. I rub the oil between my forefinger, middle finger and thumb, then I spread along my eyelashes-bottom and top. I am so excited to see great growth! Before Emu, My eyelashes were very sparse. They just wouldn&#x27;t grow. I&#x27;m not saying they are luxurious now, but I can Definitly see a difference.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells bad,  and is just weird.  Despite that,  I used it for awhile and see no difference with anything.  Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It really softened my hair. I like that it doesn&#x27;t smell. Very fast delivery. I&#x27;m very happy that I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Too oily for fine hair.</li>
            <li> My forearms are definitely benefiting from this emu oil.  When one ages, the skin gets paper thin and very easily scratched when working in the yard.  This doesn&#x27;t happen anymore....skin is tougher.</li>
            <li> Now for the emu oil. When they asked me to test this, I was hesitant after reading that it was mad from adipose tissue of a bird. That grossed me out. I had never heard of it but asked my Facebook friends and they all claimed emu oil to by a miracle oil for a huge number of things from joint pain to extreme moisture. I chose to use this on my 2 year old. He gets really dry, itchy skin under his chin and on the top of his butt, as well as his belly. Lotions have not been working and the doctor has not issued him with a skin disorder. I felt helpless and he would itch so badly, he was always breaking his skin open. This stuff worked wonders for him! First, it seems oily but its like his skin just sucked it right up within seconds and you couldn‚Äôt tell I had put an oil on him. Once it absorbed, I could tell there was instant relief. He has stopped scratching so much and his skin is improving. I‚Äôm so thankful to have been introduced to this product. It came in a nice 4 fl oz container with a pump. I gave this one 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Did not help my wife&#x27;s eczema one bit.</li>
            <li> Emu oil is part of the current trend of using natural oils and extracts to essentially replace every chemical-laden salve, lotion, and potion.  InstaNatural has a very compelling version, which comes in a huge quantity that should last for a long time and what appears to be high quality oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emu oils has a cloudy appearance and needs to be shaken prior to each use, but does not require refrigeration.  It can be used for many things, including as an anti-inflammatory salve, moisturizer, and hair conditioner.  I have so far used it for the latter two purposes and it has worked very nicely.  The fragrance is light and a bit like cooking oil.  Blow drying my hair makes my bathroom smell delicious!  Thankfully, the smell fades quickly, but the effect does not.  The bottle warns that a little goes a long way, and it is true.  It may not feel like you are using enough to do anything, but it is easy to go overboard and create flat hair.  When used in a small quantity, hair is soft and shiny, with a thick appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emu oil is worth trying, and this form seems like a good value.  I don&#x27;t see any reason to spend a lot of money for a tiny bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to InstaNatural for the review sample.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice I love it and will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I love the emu oil I love InstaNatural products! It leaves my skin smooth and I love using on my nails it feels stronger, and I love the bootle.</li>
            <li> Quick service, packed well and the product is just as advertised. I used Emu oil years ago with good success. It really does seem to work well with some kinds of pain and inflammation.</li>
            <li> My skin is changed. It is my miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> This product really helped reduce the red inflamed areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer at night. My skin feels soft when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Matched description perfectly and works great, Thank You!</li>
            <li> Good for hair :)&lt;br /&gt;Still don&#x27;t know if my skin likes it</li>
            <li> The moment I put this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and skin I instantly felt a difference. She has thinner hair and a bit of eczema and both have been tremendously improved with EmuOil. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin and hair. This adds the moisture I need and helps with swore muscles, which is a huge plus</li>
            <li> This Emu Oil is so awesome.  I like the fact that my skin is more radiant and smoothed. Especially for my thighs :)</li>
            <li> Love it!! A perfect moisturizer. I use it for my hair skin and nails. Amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Addresses dry patches of skin, but does not leave skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to help heal recent scars and to prevent my nails from falling off from chemo.  I love it.  I use it on face, nails, head, etc.  I highly recommend this company and their product.</li>
            <li> I have been used this for a couple of weeks.  It is much better than lotion.&lt;br /&gt;very quick absorb, I use it on my hand, I can continue working on my computer&lt;br /&gt;or cooking, unlike lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. So soothing and healing on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new moisturizer, and saw how many people ranked this 5 stars. So - I wondered - what is &amp;#34;emu&amp;#34; oil ?&lt;br /&gt;Little did I realize it was not a synthetic product...........it is actually the fat of a slaughtered bird (Emu) that looks like an ostrich.&lt;br /&gt;Great balls of fire!  I don&#x27;t want any part of that.  Google extraction of emu oil, or - where does emu oil come from? You might as well put the chicken skin on your face off the chicken you get at the grocery store. Yuck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing any effects any different from any other oil I&#x27;ve used (E, etc.) But as oils go, it&#x27;s nice. Light scent. Not greasy feeling. It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels on my skin, I have always had sensitive skin so thought I would try this.. I am  trying to get away from using so many prescription drugs for my excema.. seems to be working good so far.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped  fast!.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product to my face,hair and legs and I couldn&#x27;t believe on the results my face doesn&#x27;t look dry anymore my hair feel soft,and shiny, my legs so shiny and tan looking,,.also recommend this to otheres.‚Äã</li>
            <li> ‚ÄúOnly had this for one day and I love the way it feels on my skin can&#x27;t wait to&lt;br /&gt;see results . I&#x27;ve already decided to use this for the rest of my life and I&lt;br /&gt;wish I had found it sooner‚Äù</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. We bought it after hearing from a friend that it was good for sore muscles. I got bit buy some bug and just grabbed it and put it on to see if it might help. Within 30 seconds the itching stopped. Awesome!!</li>
            <li> I did some research and heard that emu oil works well on re-growing hair. I have small bald spot on my hairline because of braids. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;m starting to notice some fuzz. Yayyy!! And its light enough to use on your regular hair if you&#x27;re going through the transiting period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many over the counter moisturizer they are no comparison to this. It&#x27;s a must, you will not just see the difference but feel it in the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer...Goes on easily and absorbs quickly..</li>
            <li> I am African American and I use this oil for my eczema and it soothes the itching and also softens the area on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the emu oil. I use it on my arms, legs, feet abd hands.  I bought for pain relief but luckily have been pain free at the moment.  It makes my skin silky soft.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and was very pleased.  Not only did the shipment arrive quickly, it also was very well packaged.  I really like the emu oil.  You use only a small amount which is helped by having a pump bottle .  It absorbs quickly into the skin which is a plus because my husband hates what he calls the greasy feel of lotions.  I have developed a number of skin issues and this oil is very gentle and helps with healing.  It also feels wonderful on my face.  I would definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> My wife is gorgeous and she attributes this stuff.  If she gives it credit and looks like she does at 43 then I have to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The product is truly excellent. Both my son and I are using it. My son has second degree burns on his face and chest and the results have been great!</li>
            <li> I have had a very unsightly spot on my forearm for months.  The first night I used this oil I rubbed it into that spot.  The next day, the top layer of the spot peeled off (which had happened before) but this time it was completely flattened and the color was significantly lightened as well.  The weird hair that was growing from it is gone now after 5 uses.  With regard to my face, it doesn&#x27;t look much different except when I first wake up in the morning.  I do look less wrinkled when I put the oil on at night.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with regular creams.  So far, I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love using this Emu Oil on my skin. I received a bottle of this to review and I like how It leaves my skin soft and quickly absorbs so it&#x27;s not greasy. I had never heard of Emu Oil and was a little worried.... but it has ended up being something I really like! It helped minimize a spot on my leg that that gets red and irritated. When it gets irritated, I is slightly raised and bothers me. With repeated use, the oil made the redness go away and the irritation vanished.&lt;br /&gt;It works as a terrific moisturizer for the tops of my hands and keeps them from getting raw and chapped in the winter weather. Same goes for my feet.. It really help provide great moisture on my heels where they normally dry out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a good value because less is more! A single squirt goes a long way and offers great coverage. Four ounces lasts a good while, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do what it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  Helps with skin issues.  Am on my second bottle</li>
            <li> This is by far the best emu oil for the price! I will not go back to any other products. The seller is amazing as well. I highly recommed this seller &amp; this product.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends..</li>
            <li> I love the oil! It makes my skin super soft and conditions my split ends very well.</li>
            <li> Just received 3rd order (5th bottle) of the Emu Oil.  It is a clean odorless soothing and effective oil for all parts of the body---even face and scalp.  Quickly absorbed and maintains softening effect throughout the day.  I have given bottles to wife and daughters for their use. Will order regularly.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! Especially when we&#x27;re at our 2nd home in Idaho, the high-desert is very drying for my skin. I add a few &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; of this to my lotion after a shower and my skin stays soft overnight as well as using it full strength on my face.   I am ADDING A COMMENT to my previous review because I read that this would work for a skin fungus. I&#x27;ve had a persistant problem with this since an unfortunate hospital stay and Lotrimin (dr. recommended) didn&#x27;t work, this did work quickly and well!! I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a convert! I&#x27;ve held back on my review for a few weeks while I really tested this oil out. I keep finding that in all the places where I would have used coconut oil exclusively, this oil is exceeding my expectations. I love that unlike coconut oil which sometimes leaves me greasy and stains or transfers to clothing and other items, this one really absorbs. And that&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s marvelous at: absorption. Therefore, it&#x27;s the ultimate carrier oil. When I want to know something is penetrating, I pair it with emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love my coconut oil for lots of things, but this one is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize my facial skin but it is very oily/greasy.  I only use a little, but it isn&#x27;t instantly absorbed into my skin as other reviewers have said it does.  Even after I wipe it with a tissue it leaves an oil film on my skin.  I&#x27;ve used it more at night when and the oil film soaks in over night.  I bought it to use on my scalp to stop my hair falling out but haven&#x27;t tried it yet on my scalp.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this oil again.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever come across</li>
            <li> Products works wonders on stretch marks!!</li>
            <li> The oil comes in a 4 fl oz/120 ml glass bottle with a pump. The oil is a very clear consistency. It does not have a scent to it. You can use it for your face, skin, hair, and nails. I tried 3 out of 4. The only way I didn‚Äôt use the oil was on my face. I do have very sensitive skin and so I always get so nervous putting oils on my face. But it could have been the most magical thing for my face, so maybe I will give it a try‚Ä¶. It feels very lightweight and absorbs into your skin very quickly. It makes your skin feel so soft. When I rubbed it on my nails, I can tell a difference in my cuticles after a few days of using it. My nails do look so much healthier. My favorite place to rub the oil into my skin was on my elbows. I always suffer from dry elbows. This oil did wonders on my dry elbows! I applied the Emu Oil to my hair when it was wet and when it was dry to test it out both ways. I have to admit I don‚Äôt really care for it on dry hair. You can definitely tell I had the oil in my hair. It made my hair look greasy, but you would get that if you put any oil in your dry hair. When I applied the oil on my wet hair it definitely made my hair very shiny and it didn‚Äôt make my hair greasy at all. It also did not weight my hair down. I really did enjoy using the emu oil this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to review, but this is my unbiased honest opinion.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this oil after hearing about all of the benefits of emu oil and I wanted to try it for myself before I wrote a review. I am using it as my face moisturizer and my skin simply glows, radiates! The oil is not heavy at all , it&#x27;s surprisingly not greasy either, so it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily, eliminates any blemishes as well ! I also use it as my hair oil, which is precisely why I purchased it in the first place. I have NATURAL hair and I can&#x27;t tell you how beneficial this oil has been to my hair and scalp! My edges were thinning because during the winter, I wear lace wigs to protect my hair from the harsh weather and the combs laying against my scalp all day cause sensitivity and hair loss, this oil is growing back my edges!!!! Thankfully I don&#x27;t suffer from chronic pain so I haven&#x27;t used it as a muscle pain reliever but I&#x27;ve heard from others that it&#x27;s great for that as well! The product is TOP notch, it comes in a dark brown glass bottle, you get a lot for your money , there&#x27;s a convenient dispenser top so it&#x27;s not messy at all! I trust it enough to let my 14 year old daughter use it! Customer service is unreal! They are there to answe all of your questions, even offering a money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the product. Their friendly staff contacted me about my opinion on the product and I just had to be honest and share my thoughts on it. If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying it, jump over and TRY IT! It&#x27;s great for skin, you don&#x27;t need a separate under eye cream, good for those with sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t have a ton of chemicals / ingredients in it, just a great quality product! I haven&#x27;t been compensated for any of this, just a woman and mom sharing my newfound secret weapon! Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> I have used a different Emu oil in the past, but this one works so much better.  I noticed a difference in my face &amp; neck after a few days, and so much more  in 2 weeks!  Wrinkles beware!!  I have told all of my friends &amp; family about this product, so you can expect some new orders soon.&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance, which works well for some of my friends who are sensitive to this.  I plan to use this forever! Thank you for a great product at a very reasonable price.  Your customer service is tops too.</li>
            <li> Great product....highly recommend</li>
            <li> Use this twice a day...little concoction of aloe/emu/snail gel... Beautiful! Face, neck, chest, hands... I love my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased as a stretch mark preventive, but saw no changes after a month so I went to raw shea butter. However, I started using it on my face and hair, and have seen great results!</li>
            <li> coudlnt get over the smell.. threw it away.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eczema. I&#x27;ve been using a little on my legs after shaving to prevent razor burn and to help with my eczema. I&#x27;ve found it absorbs very quickly and leaves my legs smooth. It has really helped! Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I am not happy with it, but i will not mail it back.  It;s in very, very POOR shape</li>
            <li> Love this. Came in excellent condition!! Great price. Smells so great!!!!</li>
            <li> Still early to say but like it so far</li>
            <li> I use Emu Oil on my face and hair and love it. I have tried other Emu brands in the past but InstaNatural&#x27;s quality has surpassed my expectations. This is my second purchase and I will definitely be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> My daughter has suffered from dry patches of skin her whole life. This time she had an outbreak of dry eyelids which was painful and disrupted her busy life as a fulltime student and working full time. Upon the advice of another we tried the emu oil and her condition cleared up in a very short time and now she uses it as a preventative in the event of another break out. Thank you for providing a high quality, all natural product that really does work and super quick delivery!</li>
            <li> This stuff is killer.. love love love this brand of Emu.. I had purchased another brand at the same time, but this one is far superior. I use it for my face cream now.. highly recommended</li>
            <li> Love this for my Hair and Face.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, how much I like this product.  Bought it to combat the dryness on my hands.  I did not see a big difference, so I have moved on to something else.  I am using it on my legs and so far it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> iam still putting it on the hairline since i&#x27;ve been reading it promotes hair growth or thickening. haven&#x27;t seen anything yet maybe i have to wait more time. I have applied in an area where skin was inflamed and next day it looked flat and not red like the nite before. Iam gonna continue to use it til the last drop.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing for my skin unlike the Argan oil. I tend to just feel oily when I put this on no matter how or how little or how much I used. The Argan is a far better moisturizer for the skin. It does work a little better if you apply it right after you shower but it doesn&#x27;t lock the moisture in for long. I am afraid to use this on my hair because I usually don&#x27;t like a lot of product on my hair and this can feel like too much easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using it with a light moisturizer. I use three small pumps of this on a daily with three pumps of the Vitamin C moisturizer and it works dutifully. Neither of which as stand a lone product for my body seems to impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> This is working much better for me than the much-touted and more expensive Argan Oil I have been using.  My skin is much less &amp;#34;crepey&amp;#34; (I am 62)&lt;br /&gt;and less dry than two weeks ago.  It has evened out in tone, and wrinkles have improved DRAMATICALLY.  I wish I had taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pic so I could show you.</li>
            <li> Emu oil is great for various skin disorders.  This works on sore muscles, minor skin irritations, etc.  I love InstaNatural brand and all of their products are high quality!</li>
            <li> Very good and is working on my thin edges which beginning to get thicker</li>
            <li> Its definitely  a keeper! Bought it for one thing and in process had bump my leg and had a bruise, applied not knowing if it would work!! Bruise disappear in 3days! Recommend to my daughter for granddaughter dry skin!  She bought also,both are loving it</li>
            <li> UPDATE!!!!!!2&lt;br /&gt;This is my second bottle of this pure emu oil. It&#x27;s so great I had to buy again. It works wonders for acne and marks on face. My husband swears by it. We tried another brand and it didn&#x27;t stand up to this one. I love it for my ends In my hair. Honey and bias....&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of emu oil until now. I wanted to try because it said good for dark marks and acne. I had old marks on my face from pms(tmi) I know. But I tell u what, I&#x27;ve tried other stuff that u order on tv and out of books and I thought I seen little results over week but I know for a fact I used this every day since I got it and those old spots are just about gone!!! I didn&#x27;t think it was possible. I got my hubby using it now. THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I started using oils on my face a few  years ago and it has changed my skin for the better in so many ways. I didn‚Äôt realize what Emu Oil was at first until I researched it a bit. It is actually from the emu animal! Apparently it has some incredible healing properties and is fantastic for skin, hair and nails. It has healed the cracks on my poor, dry winter hands. I have also mixed a few drops into my night moisturizer for my face. It makes my skin feel incredibly soft without being too oily. This 4-oz  bottle is a great value &amp; will last for a very long time since you only need a drop or two.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I really like the InstaNatural product line. Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li> love this product is simply amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the Emu Oil. I have had two issues that I was hoping it would help with.&lt;br /&gt;One, I have a small spot of psoriasis on my temple that I have treated with many types of oils and creams to no avail. I have been using the Emu Oil for about 3 weeks now and the spot is definitely smaller, less red, and smoother. I&#x27;m hoping in another few weeks it will disappear completely.&lt;br /&gt;Two, I also have liver spots on my right hand and since using the Emu Oil, they have almost completely faded.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the oil and will definitely be ordering more when my supply gets low.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling silky smooth, not oily, as long as too much isnt used. I bought it also for my thinning hair, because of other reviews, hoping that it will help. Again, as long as too much isnt used, does not leave hair feeling oily. One pump is plenty for either application, for me.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well, I like the way it makes my skin and hair feel. Will probably keep buying simply because it&#x27;s a great face moisterizer.</li>
            <li> Yeah, so I decided to save a few bucks and go with another manuf.. Mistake. Instanat. is the best.. The others are thin and don&#x27;t work! Instanat. on my hair does wonders!! Take my advice. Also does wonders for my skin so far, fast too! Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS INSTANATURAL 100% PURE EMU OIL FOR MY WHOLE BODY.  SPECIAL MY FOOT SO DRY.  MY FOOT ALWAYS VERY DRY AT WINTER.  BUT THIS OIL I BEEN USE FOR 2 WEEKS IN COLD DAYS AND MY FOOT FEEL GREAT.  THANKS!&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil.  So many uses.  Doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other reviewers said.  The pump works great it&#x27;s in a dark colored glass bottle to protect the ingredients.  Great packaging, no leakage.</li>
            <li> Yes; I would love to have another bottle. Thank you</li>
            <li> First of all I received my oil within two days. A lot of people have no clue on what Emu oil is our what it can do for your skin, hair nails. Emu oil is great for fine lines and wrinkles,  inflammatory properties , hypoallergenic, arthritis, stretch marks, scars, cuts &amp; scrapes, burns and  eczema. Those are some of the things I use them for. And the best thing the brand Instanatural is great they will tell u how to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago for my 4 yr old son who has been going through harsh chemotherapy for 2yrs now. His skin has terrible chemo rashes that dry out the skin and cause it to crack open.  It&#x27;s very painful for him and the open cracks put him at high risk for infection.  With a weakened immune system and low blood cell counts, infection is not good. I was given the choice of an even more harsh chemo but doesn&#x27;t have skin side effects, but the other effects were awful.  So I googled other options, tried many, none worked.  I found this brand of emu oil and have tried it for the last couple weeks....the results have been incredible!!!  His oncologist was astonished at how well it was working.  Ordering more now :)!!!  Like anything, allow it time to work.  It took a few days to see noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Emu oil for my hair to help thicken it up. I&#x27;m not sure that worked for me. maybe I need to give it more time.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it on my skin and it is amazing!. I am 65 yrs. old . The Emu oil immediately gave it a more youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;The bags under my eyes upon contact with Emu got smaller. I started using it everyday. I plan on purchasing another bottle. Is there anyway I can get a discount coupon, because I plan on using it for the rest of my life!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Very Satisfied, Mary Lovett</li>
            <li> EMU oil has helped with my dry scalp, and love the pump that comes on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and have been using this for a couple of weeks now.  Twice Daily, face, neck, hands, elbows, feet.  I have OK skin texture to start with, but I do have some light age spots and minor Redness.  Some wrinkles especially around the mouth area.  I see major improvements in over all skin texture and color.  Wrinkles seem to be softer and less noticeable.  My skin is like silk!  I swear it eases my tendinitis pain in elbows. So I&#x27;m hooked and will continue using it forever!  I have tons of The department store creams.  I mean all the top brands and this is now my favorite.</li>
            <li> feels good on the skin, but if you put on your hair, your hair would get really greasy.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this because it came from an emu and there was that gross factor but I&#x27;m glad I did because it&#x27;s a great product. I can see a difference in my daughter&#x27;s damaged, non-growing hair already, after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Lovely product. Has made my daughters hair soft and shiny. I applied it immediately after a bath and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff really locks in moisture after shaving, and doesn&#x27;t feel gross and heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Emu oil. I&#x27;ve been using this as a body moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily, and it has essentially no smell whatsoever. It&#x27;s a hit--I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! It is deeply hydrating and leaves my skin feeling renewed. It isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out! I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I like Emu Oil and has been using it for many years. I was getting direct from New Zealand and love it. I use it for everything from dry skin to treat sore muscles and stretch marks. This Pure Emu Oil from InstaNatural is much cheaper. I like the consistency of this oil. It absorbs so quickly with no greasy residue. I massage it on my knees for joint flexibility, use on my dry arms. Weekly massage on my scalp and hair. It leaves my hair shinny and velvety. Washes out nicely. I also put it on my face after I do peels and it helps to keep my skin moist and hydrated. All in all I love this Emu Oil.</li>
            <li> Great service n I&#x27;m already loving the oilüòò I absolutely love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase. I use the emu oil on my face as a moisturizer. I have sensitive skin with perioral dermatitis. It works well on my skin because it doesn&#x27;t have extra ingredients. I also like the pump container that helps to not use too much since I only need 1 pump for my face.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have read a lot about emu oil but have never tried it.  The oil has a history of being used on all skin types but especially to help those with sensitive, dry and flaking skin.  It is supposed to have anti-inflammatory effects as well to help with aching joints and muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning when I wake up my feet really ache.  I feel like my arches are dropping. Since I received the sample I apply it to my feet and ankles before bed and I think it&#x27;s working!  I notice that the pain has slowly been decreasing and I am not wincing when I take my first steps of the day.The emu oil also makes my skin very soft and the oil absorbs quickly without a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been having problems with one of my dogs.  Every year his skin allergies seem to get worse; they last longer and have become more severe and spread to larger areas. The poor guy has a bright pink belly, chin and paws all summer long and nothing I apply or give to him seems to work. He&#x27;d run and hide under the bed when he&#x27;d see me reach for the spray the vet prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I started applying the emu oil to all of his affected areas and it appears to be helping.  His chin is the worst but one of the best improvements is that I don&#x27;t have to chase him all over the house to apply it. I think because it doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell or synthetic ingredients he isn&#x27;t scared of it and he must like that it provides him some relief.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that this is non-greasy and unscented. I originally bought this to moisturize the flaking tissue around my navel piercing while it was healing. I still use it every day, after my sea salt soaks.  I&#x27;ve also used this for my cuticles after removing nail polish. Mmm, bird oil.</li>
            <li> I have to say.....InstaNatural&#x27;s Emu Oil......is the BEST!!! I&#x27;ve been searching for best Emu Oil for my hair but I didn&#x27;t get lucky because other products Emu Oil didn&#x27;t work on my hair until I found InstaNatural&#x27;s Emu Oil. Before my hair was dry but now, my hair is smooth, soft &amp; shiny. It&#x27;s amazing feeling. Excellent moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t have to reapply it after using it, it absorbs quickly &amp; just like that, smooth, soft &amp; shiny. This Product is the next big thing &amp; I will definitely come back because I&#x27;m seriously can&#x27;t live without it. I will be forever customer to InstaNatural. Fast shipping &amp; amazing service 8o) You make my day,Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Nice, light oil that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends and family as it really feels good on dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality product! It makes my skin feel great &amp; it&#x27;s not greasy!</li>
            <li> Works great..... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> skin is soft... feels great</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil for my mother. This oil works great on sore muscle and helps relieving from joint pain. I thought of using this oil on my pregnancy stretch marks but read somewhere that it should not be used during pregnancy so I will use this after delivery and nursing.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. It made a difference for my dry patchy skin instantly. I&#x27;ll will order again</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  Before purchasing this product  I have tried every lotion in the market and I have spent a lot of money doing so.  I suffered from eczema for more than a year and nothing worked until I purchased emu oil.  This stuff works wonder.  I applied it on the dry areas morning and especially at night together with Aveeno lotion.  After using less than a bottle my eczema is gone permanently.  I would highly recommend this for anyone who has any type of dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b6a9f453e8519f3515ce3baecf61ba2d]] This oil very gently nourishes your skin and hair so that it can repair itself and stay moisturized.  It&#x27;s very gentle and does not leave a residue.  Takes about 5 minutes, on me, to fully absorb.  My skin drinks it all up and I always find that to be a good sign.  No discernible smell.  The pump gives you excellent control over how much oil is dispensed.  The oil itself is a little thick and has a cloudy appearance.  Goes on easily and smooths away quickly.  I really like that this is a gentle enough product to use on things like sunburns, bug bites, etc.  It promotes healing by nourishing so there are a ton of possible applications.  I&#x27;ve had good results with this product and can recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the Emu Oil. It is great for burns. Used it recently when I burned my thumb and it quickly healed. Fabulous for cuts also.</li>
            <li> it does seem to help my dry-looking &amp;#34;grandma&amp;#34; hands.  nothing else has.  i can see some improvement so i will probably buy&lt;br /&gt;another bottle.  i am waiting until someone ELSE notices!</li>
            <li> works great on dry, chapped skin.  Also helpful for my sheltie&#x27;s coat and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> This made my skin itchy after I applied it.</li>
            <li> This has helped with softening, smoothing of my skin and hair. Good quality as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. I use it on my hands, feet, everywhere. Great product.....</li>
            <li> I had purchased your product after having a laser peel on my face. After the initial healing, my face was left red and irritated with a constant chapped feeling. My skin texture was left rough and my pores were greatly enlarged. I have always had very nice skin, so this was really distressing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing a little research, I read about the anti-inflammatory and healing effects of Emu oil. I chose this product over others due to the many 5 and 4 star reviews on Amazon. I also liked that it comes in a dark glass bottle with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using your Emu oil for a few weeks now, my face is healing. It is no longer red with a chapped feeling. The surface is smooth again and my pores are starting to get smaller (although still not fully back to their very small size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on these results, I have decided to make your Emu oil my only facial moisturizer moving forward. I dislike the idea of slathering chemicals on my body for moisturizers and prefer natural products. Today, I have also put some in my hair for a conditioning treatment and will wash it out in the morning. I am looking forward to seeing the results.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase. It seems to be high quality and works better than any other moisturizer that I have used to treat a some dry skin on my face. After receiving the oil, I also received a cordial follow up email to confirm that I was happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Emu oil is softening my skin in an amazing way. I&#x27;m loving it. Congratulations to insta natural .</li>
            <li> Great product! Lightning fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly as advertised</li>
            <li> Quick delivery supper moisturizer love it just started using it.</li>
            <li> Really great product, and super refined. I have been using it to get rid of some grey hairs I have, so I&#x27;m still in that process. It&#x27;s great to use if you have a cold, just simply apply a little in your nose. I&#x27;ve also used this product as a cuticle conditioner and it works FANTASTIC for that! I have been learning about a lot of the benefits of Emu Oil and am happy I got the opportunity to try it for myself. Shipping is extremely fast, and as always, the company has the best communication and service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formula is clear, refined, free of any particles or scent. Very great quality!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!!  I can&#x27;t get over how this product makes my hair look so healthy, truly looks like its improved/enhanced my hair color.  And here&#x27;s an odd fact, my hair generally takes 4hours+ to dry naturally.  Well, I happened to apply some of this Emu Oil to my hair, still allowing for it to dry naturally.....I was shocked by what occurred.  My hair dried in about an hour of time.  Now add the fact that I live in Tampa Bay, FL where the humidity is kicking all the time and you can understand my shock.  In addition to using on my hair, I have just begun experiment to see how well this Emu Oil will work on a couple of old bug bites from several months back that left the skin area much darker.  Also, trying it on a couple of ugly varicose veins.  These 2 situations will no doubt take good time for any kind of improvement to occur if any.  I will try to remember to followup in a few weeks with my results.</li>
            <li> I use this product to help reduce the appearance of my birthmark (dark spot on my face) and to moisturize my face. This product did what it says it will do. It reduced the darkness of my birthmark! I also use it in my hair occasionally to add a little shine. I love this all in one product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product - I use for hair re-growth, dry skin reliever, as a leave -on moisturizer for my hair....., this oil is a great all around product. I recently had a medical treatment with some very nasty medications which led to hair loss. Thanks to using this product, along with coconut oil and castor oil, I can actually see new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the oil and the personalized service.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it after she gives herself a chemical peel and it calms her skin down and moisturizes it very well. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I tried to do some research before I bought this product.  Mostly what I discovered was that most  Emu-type products are cut with lots of other ingredients, and contain very little real Emu oil.  You get what you pay for - and this product (100% Pure Emu Oil) is the real deal.  I live in the desert where dry skin and inflammation is a common problem.  A tiny amount of this product works extremely well, has no odor, and successfully treats these maladies.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the oil.. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference for my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Didnt do what I expected.., will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for years and nothing works as good or even comes close as this three combinations. Anti-aging rejuvenation scalp serum, OGX biotin and collagen shampoo and conditioner, and insta natural emu oil before I retire for the night. If you try this treatment you will love the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have chronic eczema on my hands from over-washing. This definitely gives me relief from itchiness and cracked skin. I use this with Bee Magic and my eczema is almost non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also fantastic as a hair and skin moisturizer. I use it at night after washing my face to keep it light.</li>
            <li> I use our Emu Oil every night to oil my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s scalp and it is very easy to apply and distribute with the pump nozzle and has a neutral smell so it works well with the other oils that I use to seal her hair nightly. It is very thick and spreads evenly. I can tell that it is of the highest quality. I went through my first bottle so quickly and am excited to get a new bottle. I love my Instanatural Emu Oil and their EXCELLENT Customer Service!</li>
            <li> I got this Emu Oil for my granddaughter who is 11 and has severely dry  and red hands due to eczema.  Over the summer and being in and out of pool water I had her put this on her hands every night before going to bed.  Did it clear up her eczema? No... I am not claiming any miracle cures but it DID INDEED DEFINITELY help her poor little hands.  There is absolutely no smell, the oil absorbed in her skin VERY quickly and she didn&#x27;t mind using it...</li>
            <li> Very good product..i love it</li>
            <li> One of the best oils I have ever used for dry skin</li>
            <li> Great consistency, sinks in quickly, and my nails, hands and hair are starting too look better. Terrific price for large amount.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks! I&#x27;m using it on a bad scrape I got 3 weeks ago that would have probably left a scar, it was pretty deep. It&#x27;s almost gone now.</li>
            <li> Works great on the little pains of daily life.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 18 month old daughters eczema. After taking time to read all the great reviews I was hooked. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not so sure how PURE this product is. When I applied this emu oil to her skin she broke out! Her skin started to form black dots that looked like it could&#x27;ve been hives or the chicken poxs. I discontinued the use of this product after 3 days&lt;br /&gt;And I bath her in oatmeal and baking soda to calm her skin. The hives are gone but the scars are still there. Since then I&#x27;ve only use ivory shea butter on her skin. Hopefully that helps with the scarring. Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> THE EMU OIL DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO. I USED IT ON MY DARK SPOTS ON MY FACE AND THEY ARE FADING.MY SKIN IS MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> The oil is great. It&#x27;s has done great on my skin for the dryness. I have been applying this all over my skin including using this at night  over my moisturizer for extra hydration on my face. I will need to keep using to see even better results I think. I feel also as some healing powers to it for some small discomfort. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Awesome products!!! I bought it a second time!! super fast delivery..:)</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the Emu Oil and the quick turn around time in which I received the product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I like this emu oil, and it works great on the skin, not much on the hair. I tried for morethan couple of month and I noticed difference on my skin, but not much on hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month ( twice weekly) in my hair and i have also added some to my regular lotion and so far it is working great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels healthier and has a nice shine. I don&#x27;t use a lot, a little goes a long way. I use a bit on my skin in dry areas and it really helps with the dryness without leaving the area too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No irritation noted so far and i suffer from excema so i will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product... I use it everyday...Makes my skin feel very soft and young... I have only been using it for a short amount of time...but I plan on making this a regular part of my everyday routine...</li>
            <li> Love this product &amp; all the others I purchased.  This is the second brand I bought through Amazon the other brand has a very similar name just change Insta &amp; add a s to the end of natural.  You get twice the amount for the same product &amp; price plus they have excellent customer service which says a lot about a company.  They contacted me with an email &amp; I wrote back what I use all their products for &amp; I&#x27;ll just say WOW at their response.  The other company sent me an order with a broken bottle of Emu Oil &amp; I don&#x27;t believe it happened in shipping since the other bottles were fine, over half the bottom was missing.  Amazon refunded my money but I emailed them to make them aware because I cut the tips of my fingers &amp; had class embedded in them.  Their response was kind of an oh well so I wasn&#x27;t very happy with that.  InstaNatural was on sale so I bought through them &amp; am so happy I did.  I have been using the Emu Oil on my hair, scars &amp; stretch marks, all side effects due to chronic illness that wasn&#x27;t getting better &amp; I was finally diagnosed with Lyme Disease 7 months ago which has been messing with everything.  I have more damage from the side affects from medications after almost 24yrs than anything else.  I don&#x27;t know how well this is going to work on old stretch marks but it does seem to be helping but I&#x27;m not expecting a miracle.  I use a Derma Roller &amp; then put on the oil which I highly recommend so the product gets deeper down to the lower layers under the skin. InstaNaturals has a customer for life in me.  I highly recommend all of their products but I love the Emu oil for my hair, I put it in and sleep with it and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess like you think it would because it&#x27;s an oil and then wash it out the next day.  My eyelashes and eyebrows were falling out because I was overdosed on one of my medications so I have even been putting it on those areas to help with the hair growth.  Just great products at a great price and as I mentioned customer service is really big with me and they have just excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> This Emu oil seems more oily then what I&#x27;ve used before. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate as quickly or deeply as what I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;It says it&#x27;s 100% pure Emu oil, but it makes me wonder.</li>
            <li> We use it for just about everything... Our cats even love it in small doses... seems to be working.. healing oil?cure all?? Not sure but it does seem to be helping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great!!!</li>
            <li> First time buyer of this product and it is quickly becoming my favorite oil I own! it really help with my dry winter skin all over, even my face. I am prone to breakouts and so far (2 weeks in) my skin is completely clear! I will be buying this product again</li>
            <li> this is wonderful thing. it works really great for skin and hair. not at all sticky. absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my face, absorbs nicely.  But tried it in my hair and scalp, remained too stringing and greasy in my hair.</li>
            <li> The Insta Natural Emu oil was sent to me for review purposes. As soon as I tried this oil on my hands it left it moisturized like a fresh manicure feeling. The great thing about the packaging design is that it has a dispenser for easy pouring and amount of product taken out. I also put a bit on my hands and ran it through my hair and it tamed my flyaways as well. This product is good because it&#x27;s multipurpose for hair, hands and nails and skin.</li>
            <li> Works really good on my nails not sure about hair because it&#x27;s being paired with other products! Not sure if it&#x27;s this product or one of the others that is causing me to break out but I will find out! I&#x27;m slowly removing products from my regimen until I find out which one is causing the breakout! Will write another review once I get to the bottom of it!</li>
            <li> Does barely to nothing.. to your skin..&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get fooled by the &amp;#34;Best Natural Oil&amp;#34; advertisement.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!!! I use on my face and hair</li>
            <li> A little pricy but it is worth it....</li>
            <li> i have very dry skin and this emu oil is awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> Fragrance free, blends easily, does not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it on my hair after a shampoo.. I do like the built in pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> Good for hair and face!</li>
            <li> My husband has eczema and I am always looking for products to soothe his skin and help his swollen red patches. Poor guy. I thought, hey it can&#x27;t hurt to try this to. All I can say is WOW.  I received this on a day where his eczema was out of control, so many swollen red patches of dry skin. I rubbed this into his skin and was surprised that even though it was an oil, it absorbed quickly and left his skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt; I honestly didn&#x27;t have any expectations for this, I just thought hey another oil to help relieve his symptoms isn&#x27;t going to hurt anything.  24 hours later I took another look at his skin and I was amazed. ALL the swelling was gone, the bright red patches were now only slightly red. I&#x27;ve never seen a product work so quickly and efficiently on his skin. I put more on that day and it looked even better the next day, after four days of Emu Oil on his eczema most of it was gone except the extremely bad patches but even those looked a million times better. This is going to have to be a main staple in my house to keep my husband happy and help relieve his suffering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE KNOWN PEOPLE THAT USED THE EMU OIL FOR A LONG TIME NOW, BUT THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME USING IT FOR MYSELF. I STARTED GAINING WEIGHT AND MY THIGHS GOT REALLY TINY STRETCH MARKS ON THEM AND MY ARMS AS WELL. SO I USED COCOA BUTTER TO START WITH AND SEE IF IT HELPED THEM FADE AWAY, BUT TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT THE MARKS DID&#x27;NT GO ANYWHERE. I USE THE EMU OIL ON THEM FOR A WEEK AND NOTICE A BIG DIFFERENCE! I USED IT TWICE A DAY IN THE MORNING AND AT NIGHT THAT WAY IT&#x27;LL WORK ALL DAY LONG. I RUBBED THE OIL IN SO IT WOULDN&#x27;T LEAVE MY CLOTHES AND BED STAINED WITH IT. IF YOU USE HOW YOURE SUPPOSE TO EVERYDAY IT WILL WORK GREAT!!! MY MARKS ARE SO LIGHT YOU CAN HARDLY SEE THEM NOW! THIS WAS A DISCOUNTED PROBLEM USED FOR REVIEW PURPOSES!</li>
            <li> Use this on my face at night before bed and leave in, I rinse off in morning during shower.  The texture of my facial skin is a lot better then before taking it.  I was frankly surprised how well this absorbed into my skin and improved the look.</li>
            <li> Works great for not only your face but for your body also. A little goes a long way. Works great to control frizz in your hair also.</li>
            <li> Nothing better for dry skin in my opinion. My hands have very thin skin because I am aging and there was actually a sore from my warn skin. However, the Emu oil saved the day and healed my hand in just a few days.I use it every evening at bedtime to promote the healing. The oil is pure and if you have any allergic skin conditions, emu oil is not likely to aggravate it as many cosmetics will with their preservatives and various chemicals additivies.</li>
            <li> Been using this daily ! I love it! My skin is not so oily ! LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best oils you can use for your skin. It moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;the skin better than anything I have tried. It also helps heal and is&lt;br /&gt;great for massaging. Some family members and friends tried it and&lt;br /&gt;they thought is was fantastic. I just wish it had a plastic stopper that&lt;br /&gt;would pour drops instead of a spray. When I get down to the bottom&lt;br /&gt;I end up spilling some when I try to spray it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would do all it said it would &amp; I am very happy with the product.  I am a middle aged mother of VERY young children  (3  under the age of 5) &amp; didn&#x27;t want to look like their grandmother.  I had noticed a few small wrinkles so decided to try the emu oil &amp;  it has been great!</li>
            <li> I have used Emu oil for years.  I love this product and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the hopes that it would clear up my 7 month old daughter&#x27;s eczema. It did not clear it up, but it is definitely a great moisturizer. I like to use it on my face and nails as well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this Emu oil.  It is very moisturizing without  being oily.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I get excited about a product, my husband will say &amp;#34;might as well buy stock&amp;#34;. For example, when our youngest came home from the hospital, I was using coconut oil for nursing relief, chapped lips, dry hands, after bath baby moisturizer, dry hair, on boo boo&#x27;s for the older children, as eye make up remover, as a butter substitute for flipping pancakes and making cookies, and honestly...the only thing I couldn&#x27;t do with it was the gargling trick to detoxify but that&#x27;s another story. When I started using Emu Oil he was quick to notice it was a similar love affair to that of coconut oil. And can you guess what he said? Yup...&amp;#34;might as well buy stock&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello, I am Crystal and I am absolutely in love with Insta Natural Emu Oil !  Our youngest is 7 months old and has dry patches so I began using the Emu Oil after his bath. It worked so well I started using it with every diaper change. Then I noticed my hands felt younger, so I stole a few drops for myself. I ran out of leave in conditioner for my hair, so I used it for that too...and a drop on my finger worked great on my lips as a quick mid-day hydration treatment. Our older children got sunburnt and it worked on that...I can&#x27;t say enough about the variety of uses! (and for you cloth diapering mama&#x27;s it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect our diapers either)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insta Natural Emu Oil has replaced most of the products on our changing table. I no longer need baby lotion, diaper cream, and chapstick, now I just have one bottle of the wonderfully smooth and delightfully unscented Emu Oil! Thanks Insta Natural!!</li>
            <li> Deeply moisturizing!  The product is oily but soaks in and leave the skin silky smooth, which is important, as I live in the hot dry southwest climate.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It should state on the bottle to apply once, let it sink in. Then apply a second time to drive it in deeper. I found this works for me so much better.  I love this company and all its products.  The older I get, the better I am getting!!</li>
            <li> I love it!¬† I had a small rash on my hand that I tried everything to get healed up and nothing worked.¬† It was there for over a month and got steadily worse.¬† I decided to try the Emu oil on it and no exaggeration within 3 days it was almost gone and within 5 days of use 1 x a day it was totally gone.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer with no smell!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Received timely. I like the pump on the bottle for easy application.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes a wonderful addition to my existing regimen.</li>
            <li> If you have super dry skin. I would recommend getting this to use. I have been using this on my feet with a pair of socks. I am loving the softer feeling on my soles. You could do this one regularly but I would suggest this during harsher winter time. I am also using this on my cuticles. They are cracking and bleeding. This is helping them heal. Should you have dry and brittle hair think about this on the roots. Not on the scalp unless that is flakier. When the summer time gets her or I have a sunburn I will grab this to try on it. If does that good on dry skin. Then I bet it would do wonders over a burn. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!</li>
            <li> In the past few years I experienced hair loss and I tried endless number of hair supplements but nothing really worked.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this oil with little hope. I put it on my scalp (just a little and it gets absorbed quickly) in the night for a few days and twice at week I coupled it with castor oil. The first week 50% less hair in the shower and this week just a few strands. Impressive. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for my dry hands and feet feels very nice, so far so good it does not leave my skin oily</li>
            <li> It made my scalp itch very bad I used it for two weeks , but could not use it any longer</li>
            <li> I used this on my father&#x27;s dry scalp a few months ago, to help with a dry patch, and it helped to loosen and moisturize it. I use it on my legs and arms when I need extra moisturizing for dry skin. I also use it on my face like I do with their argan oil, and it really helps with the dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given free product in order to facilitate my review, and the opinions expressed are my own!</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely, not greasy or smelly - noticed a difference immediately!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!! So I ordered after watching a YouTube skin care video about it being used as a moisturizer before bedtime as well as in the AM with a moisturizer that has a high SPF. It is now my go to oil for ANYTHING! I use it for my nighttime and daytime skin care routine, I use it for dry skin during the day in place of greasy, heavier oils. I plan to use it in my homemade soaps during my next batch. I use it on my youngest eczema skin spots. Did I mention no smell!? You know how you put on a purfume but don&#x27;t want the lotion to clash? Well, this emu oil is only smellable by putting your nose to the bottle. It rubs in my skin easily without greasy feeling remaining. I was always scared off by the price of emu oil, but as I just started making my family&#x27;s soap, I&#x27;m learning that these good oils are really worth the price! I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li> Soaks in and is very light.</li>
            <li> Love this on face and hair.</li>
            <li> This oil works great on my dry skin and hair!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair and skin soft. It moisturizes and absorbs quickly! At 33 years old I use naturals products like aloe Vera and coconut oil to keep my skin youthful and I am definitely adding this to my skin care routine! Everyone compliments me on my complexion.</li>
            <li> Love it great for massaging my TMJ and helps relieve pain.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friend that has serious skin problems and over the last month she has had started to have relief and see her skin start to clear up. A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> May, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for my son who suffers from an overactive immune system and exhibits the precursor signs of Celiac&#x27;s disease His most aggravating symptom is eczema and/or hives all over his body. I have tried every product and medicine you can imagine since he was born 12 years ago. I had heard that emu oil may help.&lt;br /&gt;Well, all I can say is that it is miraculous. We tried it when we received it on Thursday, and he experienced immediate relief from the itching along with reduced redness and swelling. By the next morning, the sores (from the scratching) were healing. It is a Mother&#x27;s Day gift to see my son feel so much better.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the rest of the household is using it. My fiancee tried it on a spot of poison ivy - it relieved the itching.  I put it on my curly hair and the frizz is controlled!  Plus, my hair is shiny and the curls are prettier. I also put it on my face as a moisturizer - hoping to reduce wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really is amazing. The Aborigines know what they are doing.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING! Great customer service. Great Product. Ordered twice.  The product works well. I&#x27;ve used it for my hair and for a scar. Was sent a complimentary bottle for being a repeat customer. I will for sure order again!</li>
            <li> I like the oil, it makes my face very smooth, however I have not received any hair growth and I can&#x27;t say that it faded acne scars, a little more time will tell, but it definitely made my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> This 100% Emu Oil feels great on my skin. I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect regarding emu oil since I&#x27;ve never used it before. I was offered a sample to try by the manufacturer and agreed to try it out and give my fair and honest opinion after I used it. I have heard positive things before regarding emu oil so I was curious about how it would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really like the pump bottle this has, easier to dole out a drop or two at a time without having to mess around with removing and replacing a cap while you have oil in your hands. It&#x27;s not very thick so you do have to be careful as to how hard to push the pump down or you will get a bit too much at once. The bottle is a nice generous 4 ounce size, this will last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The oil itself feels very light, it has the same consistency of almond or olive oil, not too heavy yet a little goes a long way and it absorbs very nicely. It leaves my skin looking and feeling very soft. The oil left behind a pretty glow to my skin without feeling greasy, it made my skin look pretty. :) I will also try adding a bit to the ends of my hair before my next shampoo to see if there is any noticeable different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would work great after bathing on rough spots like feet and heels, it would absorb quickly without making a mess if you apply at bedtime. Very nice oil, and if by chance you don&#x27;t like it the company offers a 100 day, 100% money back policy.</li>
            <li> Great oil. And service was great. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I will soon be 50 years old and so for the past year I have been trying many different moisturizers, face creams, etc.  This one has them all beat!  I have been using this for less than a week and am amazed at how well it works!  It seems thick and greasy when I first put it on my face, but after I gently rub it in, the greasiness goes away and my face looks and feels fantastic!  I have always had, and still do have greasy skin. I am still, at age 49, getting acne.  This Emu oil is unlike any other moisturizers or face products I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy looking or feeling, in fact it leaves my face LESS greasy than when I don&#x27;t use it.  My complexion in a few short days has gone from dry and weathered looking underneath and greasy on top, to  a soft, radiant glow.  I have not been paid to try this product and although I buy all the time on Amazon, I have never left a review before now.  I absolutely love this oil!</li>
            <li> love it with my dry feet and everything it said  it would do great product ready to reorder soon</li>
            <li> I have tried (and loved) several products from InstaNatural, so I took a chance on their ultra premium emu oil. I use this on my nails. My hands are prone to rough cuticles and hangnails. Now, when I see one developing, at nighttime I just rub a tiny bit of this oil into my cuticle area, and when I wake up the next morning, my hands are soft and smooth and the hangnail is gone. This is a very moisturizing oil, and it has no odor at all. It&#x27;s a big bottle at 4 ounces and has lasted me a long time. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my skin!  My skin isn&#x27;t overly dry, but this soaks right in.  I am using in on my &amp;#34;sun spots&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s too soon to see if it&#x27;s making a difference. I do like the pump delivery system -- very convenient.</li>
            <li> I LOVE USING THIS AS A MOISTURIZER BEFORE BED AND BEFORE MAKEUP A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY, I&#x27;VE RE-ORDERED THIS TWICE ALREADY. VERY VERY PLEASED.</li>
            <li> I love oils, especially when they are in its pure form (i.e. 100% ). I have used argan oil, jojba oil, olive oil and even rosehip among others but never tried Emu oil. I was given the opportunity to try out Emu Oil from Instanatural so the first thing I did was to look up what is an Emu. As an all natural oil it claims to be rich in fatty acids and provides moisturizing benefits to the hair and skin.I used it as my leave in treatment. My hair is very damaged from constant relaxing and bleaching processes. I am still trying to help restore my hair&#x27;s true beauty naturally. The results thus far have not been great or outstanding but then again I have only been using the oil for a month and a half and only apply once a week. I only use a couple of drops in my hair after it has been washed and before I blow dry or flat iron. You could tell that the hair has been coated therefore is protected and there is added shine. I am going to continue to use this oil and reap the benefits along the way. I have not noticed a strong smell which is good because lots of 100% pure oils have a raw scent to them. The texture is creamy but light so the few drops that&#x27;s added goes a long way. Would love to see hair &amp; skin products start adding this oil to their ingredients.</li>
            <li> I first tried emu oil on my dog&#x27;s ears.  They were covered in tiny scabs for months.  I rubbed the oil in every chance I got and within days, all of the scabs were gone!  I told the vet about it and he said, &#x27;perhaps in addition to clearing up the bumps, it had some kind of repellent quality to it&#x27;. He thought they were little gnat bites  I also had an itch inside my ear and a couple of different doctors had no idea what to do about it. One was an E.N.T. and he suggested olive oil; that didn&#x27;t work.  I suffered with the itch for years!  I tried the emu oil and, it is still a little itchy, but not nearly as bad as it was; it seems to be getting better.  I put it on my hands and face and they feel wonderfully smooth.  I&#x27;ve also tried emu shampoo and conditioner (different brand, sorry!) and it has gotten rid of a long time scabby patch on my scalp. I&#x27;m now hoping it will thicken my hair.  There seem to be so many uses for emu oil - it&#x27;s the first thing I reach for!  The price on InstaNatural is the best I have found, and they are very attentive to their customers.  I have suggested it to many of my friends.  Thank you, InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> Great product! Would order again. Does what it says. I&#x27;ve been using it for skin rashes and overall skin health.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both had some troublesome dry skin on our hands that regular hand lotion never seemed to be able to eliminate. Once we started using this Emu oil, we had immediate results. We are very happy with this product and can definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is terrific oil&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to use on my dog and it cleared up his problem so now I&#x27;m using it on my own dry skin.  Very effective and odorless</li>
            <li> So far so good. My daughter and I have some skin issues and it has woked thus far to keep us moisturizered and freer from the annoying itch of a constant rash when our skin gets too dry. It goes on the face smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a ridiculous oily film and that is what I can&#x27;t stand most as someone with moderately oily skin. No breakouts either and I have had acne for years. Definitely will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I see some slight improvements of my skin several days after I start applying it on my face,, My skin feels smoother and brighter. It doesn&#x27;t make your face greasy either.</li>
            <li> I  can tell a big difference in my skin after using the emu oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent product I have fibromyalgia emu oil is great for my stiff, crampy muscles and joints.</li>
            <li> I tried all the other Emu oils on Amazon and this one is the best. I use it on my face and neck at night with sandalwood therapeutic grade essential oil and wake up so soft, I just love it. What an amazing product for acne! It also works well as an anti inflammatory for puffy eyes and sore muscles. It makes a great addition for my tallow balm products as well.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of this to try out in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed however, are solely my own, and in no way influenced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick and bottle was bubble wrapped and secured well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to tell you the truth--when I read that it was Emu Oil, I was really nervous to try it out. I kept thinking about chickens and their fat. I kept thinking that it was going to be gross and sticky, and smell really bad, like what I would imagine any animal oil to be.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is a pale whitish color, and it actually doesn&#x27;t smell like anything to me. You can pump a little bit out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;(The lid is a black pump. It doesn&#x27;t pour right out, which is good. You don&#x27;t want to spill it. You also don&#x27;t need to use much.)&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair and massaged a little bit of this oil into it while it was still damp. I let it air dry. I was happy because normally most of the oils that I have tried in my hair are somewhat thick, greasy, have a scent, and are heavy, but this oil is actually pretty light. My hair feels soft and not greasy at all. BUT of course I only put a little bit at a time. It makes my curls feel a bit feathery- which I like. (No that is not meant to be a pun.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using this oil on my elbows because they tend to dry out a lot and it has definitely helped my skin be less dry. Again, I only apply a little bit. One pump or two in my hand and I rub it in my palms and apply to my elbows and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the product and yes I recommend for hair and skin. I have yet to see if it will work on stretch marks. It might since it does help moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li> Good product. Works just as well as one that I purchased for twice the price.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for over two weeks now and I can see a slight difference, I have thin edges and I can see it fill in a little at a time</li>
            <li> I like this emu oil. It is great at moisturizing dry skin. Since I have eczema I am always looking for products I can use to moisturize my skin while not irritating it. This works for me to moisturize my skin without making it feel greasy. I also tried it in my hair. It left my scalp feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> Great product - great Company. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good product for dry skin, nails, hair, etc... I actually use it most on my hair as a styling product and it&#x27;s great for cuticles.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: compensation for this review was in the form of the Emu Oil via Brandbacker &amp; InstaNatural, but opinions are all mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Emu Oil on my dry hands, face, and on the ends of my hair. It didn&#x27;t have a smell, which was nice. I noticed that a little goes a long way, and it was VERY hydrating to my hands. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but I am happy to have it in my beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice,I used it after a peel and got good results. It also works well on my and my dogs eczema spots. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Honestly  i feel like some of these 5 star reviews are fake.&lt;br /&gt;Skin: no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Face:Acne!! Seriously i went to bed ok, then i woke up with 4 new pimples!&lt;br /&gt;Horrible Horrible product!!</li>
            <li> Instantly smoothes skin and moisturizes, however, I&#x27;ve only used it for 2-3 weeks so I will update you when I see more results. I use it all over my body and especially tummy area as I am in third trimester of my pregnancy hoping to prevent stretch marks and possibly aid in appearance to the little ones I have already! Here&#x27;s hoping!</li>
            <li> Since using Emu oil, I have noticed a big difference in my skin, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for myself and this is the only product&lt;br /&gt;I use and will continue to use for many years to come!.</li>
            <li> So far so good bought another brand from a health store &amp; paid twice as much for half as much. Plus this one has a pump despenser.</li>
            <li> I have used it in my hair and skin. It has absolutely no odor which is great! It instantly absorbs in and moisturizes, will leave an oil finish if not rubbed in. I put it on my feet and it has soften rough skin. I purchased two bottles first time, just really want to give the product time to reflect all its benefits. If people can drink milk from a cow why is using oil from an Emu weird.</li>
            <li> The company&#x27;s founder has sent me two emails in the last two weeks.  One to tell me more about the product after I purchased through Amazon and one earlier today asking how the product has worked for me.  He wanted to make sure I was 100% satisfied.  In short, I am!  However, below is the full email that I sent to AJ, the Founder of InstaNatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi AJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for your emails.  It‚Äôs a rarity these days to find a Founder who really does care about how their product works for a client.  The Emu Oil is working!  It hasn‚Äôt been an ‚Äúovernight magical miracle cure-all‚Äù, but it has helped the healing process go considerably easier, faster and better since I received it two weeks ago.  It‚Äôs also been a great quick moisturizer on my legs and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I‚Äôm assisting in putting a house back together after I had to have it completely gutted.  So I‚Äôm around building materials and an overexposed house all the time.  Besides that, I don‚Äôt know if I have to admit I‚Äôm growing old(er) or if it‚Äôs due to a lack of thyroid, pituitary and dealing with other deterioration caused by massive amounts of radiation years ago, but my skin in the last six months or so has taken an awful turn for the worse in healing from scratches, gouges and nicks.  What makes matters worse is these scratches and gouges, especially on my hands, have become tremendously painful and don‚Äôt heal.  They just kind of sit there and bore deeper into my thinning skin.  I usually have to dig the scab out so it can finally heal correctly.  The entire process has also created some terrible scarring.  The Emu Oil is helping my hands heal.  Since receiving the product two weeks ago, I only have a couple of gouges left on my extremely beat hands.  And, because I‚Äôm not noticing my hands as much, I can also say healing has become a lot less painful.  All in all, two thumbs up and five stars in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You, AJ!!!!  Sometimes we forget to mention the well-deserved praises of people and/or a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Care!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susanne</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome!!  I have been using Lancomme for the most part, but like this much better and it&#x27;s cheaper to boot.  Double bonus!</li>
            <li> I may need to order this product in a Quart size!!!  But first, I have to talk about InstaNatural customer service. This company knows the value of customer service. Talk about going the mile to ensure their customer is satisfied - they do. I was SO impressed and very appreciative of their attention. My experience began with the purchase of their Rosehip Seed Oil (thru Amazon.). I&#x27;m new with my experimentation of essential oils and have been reading and studying their uses. I&#x27;m 63 yr old female interested in anti aging as well as knee problems, flare ups of tendinitis, and a bad scar on my arm. When I received the rosehip oil, the company followed up with an email asking how I liked it. I did but it has a scent that dissipates quickly but takes some getting used to. I mentioned this in my response - she asked what I was interested in and after I explained, she recommended I try Emu Oil and sent me some to try. She never asked that I send review - she just wanted me to be satisfied with their products.  So - I&#x27;ve now used the Emu Oil for about 2 weeks - and I LOVE it. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and neck and I certainly see difference. I&#x27;ve always used pricey skin care products - so what a surprise to see effectiveness of emu oil. I&#x27;ve read testimonials about using emu oil for other problem areas, such as joint pain and have been trying it on my knee. Haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference - but some. But as bad as my knee is, I need to give it more time.  I do strongly recommend you trying emu oil.  I can see and feel the difference it makes on my face and neck. And ABSOLUTELY get it from the InstaNatural company. I don&#x27;t believe you will be disappointed.  UPDATE 5/1/15 I have continued to use this product, recently ordering a new supply. I love this oil. I use it on my face. I started using Frankincense around my eyes and there is visible difference in wrinkles. The emu oil has numerous uses. This seller is fantastic as well. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have battled dry skin since I was young and have tried many different oils and lotions. This Emu oil is the best I&#x27;ve used. My dry skin is almost gone and my skin is smooth like it should be. I also used the oil on the skin around a pressure sore and it rehydrated the skin. The company has great follow up after you purchase their product. Their customer service is A+! I&#x27;d recommend this oil, you don&#x27;t need to use much so the bottle will last a while, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I love finding all natural products that work! So I‚Äôm thrilled to introduce to you my ‚ÄúInstaNatural 100% Pure Emu Oil Review!‚Äù This product can be used all over the body for multiple purposes. With Emu Oil you can not only nourish your skin, but without all those added chemicals or preservatives. Since I am prone to dry skin, redness, itching and sunburns this is the perfect remedy to soothe all of the above. Or even when after a good work out and your muscles are supper sore, Emu Oil can help make you feel relaxed.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product for free to review on my blog and was surprised at all the uses. I haven&#x27;t used it on my face or hair yet but I used it on really rough dry skin that I had and it helped heal it within a couple days. And as it says on the bottle, a little does go a long way. You really only need a couple of drops.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. I bought this for some thinning edges and I can see a difference already it my edges. It&#x27;s not too greasy &amp; it gets the job done.  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing another bottle once I run out of this one. Thanks so much for stellar customer service.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  It goes on easily and is so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works as expected.  Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  After using it a few weeks on my face I have notice a big difference.  I also use it on my hair before blow drying.  You only need 2 drops.  After I put it on my face I rub my hands together, don&#x27;t want to waste it, and now I noticed my nails are growing and stronger.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about my experience with emu oil.</li>
            <li> I found this Emu oil useful in several ways. I purchased it for my lips but have found other nice uses. It&#x27;s a great make up remover (then cleanse face as usual), I&#x27;ve also used it on my scalp. Leaving it on a couple hours prior to washing &amp; it does a nice job moisturizing it. I&#x27;ve also placed a couple drops (no more than 1-2 squirts) into my soaking bath. It&#x27;s enough to moisturize my skin nicely without leaving my tub slick &amp; unsafe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad the product was suggested to me and I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product. It&#x27;s great &amp; their customer service is unsurpassed!</li>
            <li> It was an ok oil. I used it for my hair and eye area. I can&#x27;t really say it did much for my hair. But I did like how my skin took to the oil. It did not irritate my eyes. My skin adsorbed the oil nicely. It made my deep wrinkles fine and less noticeable. The oil itself had very little scent to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered emu oil before this is a good brand although I don&#x27;t like the bottle. It&#x27;s glass so don&#x27;t drop it and the punch is annoying.  Also be careful that is completely dry before putting on white anything because the oil will permanently dye it a yellowish color.</li>
            <li> I like this... glides on easily &amp; keeps the moisture in my skin. Not oily, drys easily.</li>
            <li> Very good oil, I use it for my hair frontline and I&#x27;ve seen improvement, it&#x27;s good for my skin too, I will order from the same seller again</li>
            <li> I recently purchased emu oil for my acne. I&#x27;ve been doing a natural oil cleanse for a while. I use this for moister and a wash with a cucumber toner. Because all my acne is clumped together and really red on my cheeks that was my main focus. However ever since I started using Emu oil my acne scars have separated and became less red. My face hasn&#x27;t been as oily even after I apply makeup which was really important for me. I also didn&#x27;t have a worse before better reaction which was an awesome thing for me. This bottle is large! It will last you a while. I also add it to my hair to keep moisture because I color is blonde so much! They also have extreme customer service so I recommend the company. :)</li>
            <li> I have been wearing my hair in locs for about five years but have never been able to figure out what to put in my hair to keep it healthy, and moisturized; this product along with a few others has done wonders for me!</li>
            <li> Great product for my skin. makes it smooth and soft.  My daughter in law uses it to promote hair growth and it is working very well.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
            <li> It is really a great product, I started to see difference start from day 2. It is little oily but that goes away within few minutes and you will feel better when you wake up. It does not have fancy smell so please do not exept great fragnance which we have from commercial face creams. It has bird like smell and evidence that it has contain real ingredients from Emu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recomand this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Shailesh</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my skin. Love  the  smell .</li>
            <li> After two weeks of daily application to my face, it was very noticeable that the scars from an accident last fall, faded and the area where I had stitches, the swelling was reduced. The other great thing is the tiny fine wrinkles &amp; crows feet by my eyes significantly lessened!!! I am more than satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Did not see any benefits in hair or skin. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something but didn&#x27;t really notice huge change in hair or skin from tho oil.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with Emu oil products already, and I can testify that this product is wonderful. It is amazing for burns, rashes, etc.</li>
            <li> Since I wanted to truly review this product, I decided to try this product on my skin and my hair.  I loved the feel of it on my skin, and there was no doubt about it that it made my skin feel much softer and more moisturized.  I never experienced any side effects, and I plan to continue using it on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this product on my hair.  I am currently reviewing another product that does not condition my hair.  I decided to use this product as a leave-in conditioner, and i couldn‚Äôt be happier.  I would caution you‚Äìa little does go a long way.  This can cause your hair to look quite oily.  I experimented with the right amount, and I think I decided I actually prefer using this on my hair instead of a traditional conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually planned to write this review earlier, but I actually found a new use for this last night. I wondered how well the emu oil would work on my dry, cracked heels.  So I rubbed a little bit on last night, and by this morning, my heels already looked better!  And tonight, they even seem more moisturized!  I think I may have found a product to help the cracked skin on my feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to check this product out at the link below!  You won‚Äôt be sorry!</li>
            <li> I see improvement in my hair thickness.  Areas that were thinning has not improved yet to my liking; however, I am still using the product will let you know more in 3 months.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I recently had a very tough surgery to go thru.....went back to the doctor.....and he was IMPRESSED with my scarring.  He said I looked more like I was 6 months out from surgery instead of only two!!!!!!  It&#x27;s helped me build my self confidence back.  I&#x27;ve got one more surgery to go and I&#x27;m going to make DARN sure I have plenty of this on hand to use for the next one!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised for me. Not easy absorbing, or soft oil free feeling at all. Certainly not fast absorbing. But, the company followed up with me, asked me how I liked it. When I told them they answered immediately and issued a refund. You can&#x27;t beat that kind of service these days!</li>
            <li> This is such a great moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and it really softens and clears my skin away from blotches. I would def recommend to anyone who suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. I love it, I use it in my soaps and creams.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear. No more acne. No more boils or hives or anything else.e My dry cracked skin is smooth. Even my son noticed after only 2 days use. I can sleep because a little oil eases pain in my neck, back, arms, legs and feet. I have been able to use less pain killers. The product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Absolute Beauty secret that I&#x27;ll get rid of. It has worked for myself as well as my family.</li>
            <li> We love it and use it as much as we use the argon oil they both came together.  Both of the oils are wonderful for hair and skin, makes my tattoos shine!  Thank you for the great price on this awesome product!</li>
            <li> Very good product. I use it for my hair and since then my hair became very soft.</li>
            <li> I got my order in a very timely fashion. I ordered it because I read it was helpful in hair regrowth. It works! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks and I&#x27;m already seeing new hair growth. The folks from the company that make the product are super friendly too!</li>
            <li> This is 100% pure &amp; fully refined emu oil, so it is hypoallergenic, and does not contain any contaminants. It has to be refined in order to get rid of bacteria and any other contaminants present in the oil, which includes pesticides, viruses, unnecessary hormones, etc. InstaNatural goes through the process to ensure that their emu oil is safe, and completely sterile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I was unaware of emu oil prior to trying out this product. Come to find out, it comes from the fat of an Australian flightless bird, emus, so it has to go through a very careful process to ensure safe usage for people. It is a hypoallergenic oil, as well as anti-inflammatory. It deeply moisturizing without being greasy, and does not clog pores. It is soothing, and accelerates healing for numerous issues, such as skin irritations, joint pain, and sore muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a multipurpose moisturizer, so I wanted to try it out for all that it is listed for, however after trying it out on my skin and nails, I was pleasantly surprised at how beneficial it is. I have a couple of scars due to past surgery, and skin discoloration for hormonal imbalances, so that was my targeted areas. Within a few weeks of using emu oil, I did noticed that the skin where applied was reasonably lighter, and the imperfections were less noticeable. Next, I tried it on my eczema, which is painful during the winter months. It worked very well on nourishing the skin, while keeping the skin irritation to a minimum without two uses. A little goes a very long way, and it wasn‚Äôt sticky, or greasy. It does absorb within seconds of application, and it is truly an exceptional oil.</li>
            <li> Great product. I would definitely purchase another.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very moisturized and smooth. Highly recommend if you have dry sensitive skin. Great product!</li>
            <li> Big fan of Emu oil. This has some other natural ingredients. Also, it&#x27;s not solid at room temperature so you don&#x27;t have to run it under hot water before using it</li>
            <li> This EMU oil is great.</li>
            <li> Have noticed softer skin within a week of using this product i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops can make such a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I used it for a burn on my finger from a hot pan and it helped the pain along with it didn&#x27;t blister up like I thought it would. Being I had just received it that day as a promotional rate to review and leave my honest opinion, is the reason I used it for that first.  Tried using it on the rough surfaces of my skin and it is light weight and just smoothed the callouses.  Also applied to the tips of my long curly fine hair and it smoothed them too.  They didn&#x27;t get frizzy while out on a cold windy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like that it is a natural and pure oil that I&#x27;m applying to my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Ny hair is so soft, and no frizz. Does so much more than thay even say...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy i got this product for free to test out and review..I did my homework on this product and I really love it and I&#x27;m an huge fan of instanatural products anyway I own several and all of them are awesome. I got this 100 pure Emu oil to help maintain my healty and beautiful skin. Emu oil is great for my skin it leaves it skilly to the touch and moisturise.</li>
            <li> great hydrating oil for face, hair and body.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d waited for the reviewers to answer my question.  It doesn&#x27;t post the &amp;#34;Grade&amp;#34; on it.  Other Emu oil has a grade like AA or similar but I was amazed by the high number of reviewers and the positive feedback so I switched brands before finding out this one doesn&#x27;t say what grade it is.  My previous two other Emu oils from other companies are a lot thicker, milkier in color and more effective.  This brand costs the same as one of those (one called Pure Emu Oil for instance that comes in a plastic amber bottle sold here at Amazon) but it&#x27;s less milky and thick which is supposedly a sign of the good stuff.  This one comes in a nicer container, but it&#x27;s not as good as some other Emu oil and I&#x27;m really disappointed.  On the other hand, there&#x27;s a good brand from Montana Ranch that&#x27;s about twice as much so at least it costs less.  Still, I wish I could return it but I&#x27;ve broken the seal and tried some so obviously that&#x27;s not an option.</li>
            <li> Like the glass bottle design with dispenser. Included very clear expiration date. No messy. No odor. Use for my hair.</li>
            <li> not for healing burns</li>
            <li> I was able to regrow a stubborn bald spot easily with the product.  I seem to be working good for me thus far.</li>
            <li> It works great, universal for so many things.</li>
            <li> I noticed this product when I was searching for argon oil, and ended up getting both argon oil and emu oil from this brand. I have tried argon oil from different vendors on Amazon, and like them all for moisturizing my face without causing breakouts. The emu oil seems soothing irritated skin even better in cold, dry days.</li>
            <li> Love Emu Oil. I have been using it for faster hair growth and will continue to do so. Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  Helps with superficial/suface pain.</li>
            <li> Nice light weight oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs and arms as moisturizer.  I also use it on my dry hair when it has too much static or frizz.  It also has a nice smell to it.  I would recommend this to someone looking for a multipurpose oil.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  use it on my hands, nails, hair.  Helps with my arthritis in my thumb joint as well.  i WON&#x27;T be without it.  My daughter uses it for her shoulder and her nails.  My son uses it for his shoulder as well.</li>
            <li> The smell grossed me out oh and the fact that it comes from emu fat basically and I guess smells like it, not bad just wierd and I might be into if they added some sort of fragrance. It did make my skin soft and my hair super shiny but I&#x27;ll stick with argan oil.</li>
            <li> Smells so great and makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer‚Ä¶i think better than others because it is not greasy and absorbs quickly leaving soft skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Hubby has been using the InstaNatural 100% Pure Emu oil after shaving for a few weeks now and LOVES IT!  And I can honestly say that I do, too!  He has very sensitive skin and after shaving would be red, dry and generally uncomfortable.  Now with the Emu Oil from InstaNatural, his skin is healthy and feels great, too!  I love that InstaNatural uses pure oil, so I do not have to worry about any toxins getting into his skin via any cuts or scrapes.  He has also noticed that some of his acne scars on his face are starting to fade and he attributes that to the Emu Oil!</li>
            <li> For those of us who try to save money with home facials and peels emu oil is a staple. Over the past years I use emu oil every day. This is my first time ordering this brand and it seems a little nicer than my previous brand and the price is fantastic.  The oil seems to absorb quicker into the skin and leave less of a filmy residue.  Will definitely purchase from this company again</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results on my stretch marks, as this was my initial reason for ordering it. I will update my if/when the results show. It isn&#x27;t oily, it works good on hair as far as growth, so that is a great benefit.</li>
            <li> I am very please with InstaNatural&#x27;s Emu Oil.  I am really satisfied with the price and the size of the bottle.  Before purchasing this Emu Oil, I purchased another brand of Emu oil, which came in a 1oz bottle and a higher price. I will continue to purchase this brand of Emu Oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it with my unity copper peptide product. Will purchase this again</li>
            <li> I am careful about the products I accept for review.  The rave reviews on Amazon convinced me that this Emu Oil was worth a try and I am happy I accepted the InstaNatural Emu Oil.  It works just as advertised.  I have used this product for three weeks after showering and before going to bed on my face, neck, hair, and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I needed only two squirts of the product from the dispenser to do the job required.  The oil goes on smoothly and evenly and feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I just squirted one shot of the oil on a white card and then smelled the oil -- no smell that I can detect, but when it goes on my skin it does react with the skin and gives off a very faint and natural smell which is pleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The color of the oil is almost as white as the card where I placed it, that is, off white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. My bottle has four fluid ounces.  This should last a long time the way I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The ingedients could not be simpler -- 100% pure emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Emu oil is supposed to have anti-inflammatory properties, which is why I am using it, and this product does work to calm the skin, particularly after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. InstaNatural is the distributor of this product.  I Googled them but was able to find out very little about who they are as a company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: InstaNatural Emu Oil works well for me as an anti-inflammatory and I will continue to use this product every day.  All reviewers on Amazon agree that this is a useful product.  When I see that kind of unanimous support, almost invariably the product is a good one.</li>
            <li> Works great on my and my 9-year old eczema.  Found that mixing it with Arganonics Argan cream works even better</li>
            <li> This is great stuff and while it has many different uses, I have mainly used this on my daughter&#x27;s upper arm. She always gets this upper rash on her arm and has intense itching from it. This stuff has helped tremendously. The rash has just about completely diminished and the itching was gone almsot instantly. She&#x27;s very pleased with it and so am I.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve only received this product three days ago and I can say that&#x27;s I&#x27;m amazed and impressed with the quality of this oil! In just the short amount of time I have used it, my sons eczema has diminished substantially. What a miracle product! I highly recommended this for anyone, young or old, that want to clear up dry skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to think when I saw &amp;#34;Emu Oil&amp;#34; because, let&#x27;s face it -- it sounds highly suspect! But I&#x27;m happy to report that no matter what it sounds like, it works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of different things to improve my skin and my hair and many things have helped, which I&#x27;m very pleased about, but when I saw this as part of a promotion, I was eager to try it. This oil is also one of the nicest items I&#x27;ve sampled. It absorbs quickly and makes my hair look amazing and my skin feel great. Even better, it only takes a small amount. The packaging is clean and professional and it has directions for use and benefits clearly printed on its label. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it made my skin feel. Also, the customer service is amazing. I&#x27;ve received two emails from this company, simply check-ins to see how I liked my product. It&#x27;s the small things that matter.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month haven&#x27;t any results really, maybe I&#x27;ll wait a little more</li>
            <li> good product easy absorb</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!! not only because is one of the best oil with multi properties, also because it works and has a very good display format.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it if you have problems of dry skin. The price is fair and the customer service the best. They are doing follow up and answer any question immediately. Love, love, love, it !!!</li>
            <li> First time user and I love it so far as far as skin regimen goes. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks to help rid the dark areas I had on my shoulders from my bra line. Also using for belly to treat stretch marks. Too soon to tell on the stretch marks but I will most definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product for her hair. She uses is regularly as a pretreatment before she washes her hair. It helps protect the hair from dage caused during heat treatment like flat ironing and blow-drying. Her hair is super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter to use on her stretch marks.  She loves using it because it feels so good on her skin.  Packaged well and shipped quickly.  I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to see what it could do for patches of dry skin (took care of them with no trouble) but in the process I also applied it to a couple of 1-2 year old surgical scars and am amazed by the results! The older scar was somewhat faded to begin with and has now really started to disappear, and the newer one, which was lumpy and bright pink, is now much smoother and lighter in color. I&#x27;ve only been using the oil for a couple of weeks and only use a few drops at a time - very fast and positive results!</li>
            <li> After using this product, i didn&#x27;t see any difference with my hair or joint pain.</li>
            <li> The Emu oil is awesome.  I use it to help keep my moisture sealed in my hair and massage my scalp with. It is wonderful</li>
            <li> I used this in my hair and on my face. It is a thicker oil. Consistency isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me though. Hair was shiny, face glowing and shiny. Better than Argan oil thats for sure!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I like this Emul oil, the consistency is very nice and absorbs great!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love emu oil! It is a great facial moisturizer and also has anti aging properties! I also use it anytime I have aches and pains and it helps significantly. This is a great quality product and I recommend it to anyone who wants an all natural pain reliever!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! And so does my niece as it helps with her eczema. Its reduces the visibility of scars too ....very happy</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I use it on my hair, skin and cuticles. Great product</li>
            <li> I use this on my natural hair with peppermint and my hair is growing like crazy! I love this brand.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The product is light..not oily , no smell and although I have only been using it for a short period of time, I will purchase again. The owner of the company sent me an email regarding my purchase of this product and it&#x27;s many uses---WOW great move. To me this shows concern for me and his confidence in the product. Winning move, in my opinion.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought Emu oil for my mom. She has been under a lot of stress lately and was losing her hair. She uses it the night before she washes her hair and leaves it in. I have bought it for her twice and bought one for my aunt and son as well. It really works. My moms hair is growing in thicker and the hair loss is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> very pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve tried others and this ranks high. I like the pump.</li>
            <li> Much better than description! A little goes a long way and is not greasy or heavy. I like the pump disbursement, but the oil slightly leaks to the bottom of the cap. Recommended to me for Eczema flare up and minimizing scars. Very light and soothing, but not super effective in stopping the itching.</li>
            <li> My wife says this oil is very good.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for about 2 months for stretch marks. After the first month the seller asked me how was the product working for me, (which i thought was very nice) and i infromed them the reason why I order the product and told them it hasn&#x27;t worked so far, they told to to give it another month. Its been 2 months now and I still haven&#x27;t notice any changes (btw the bottle is now empty) but it does work well for nails, just not stretch marks. But on the plus side they did have fast delivery. I just wished it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil. Does not seem to be cut, but it does stay liquid in my house which I keep around 60-65 most the time. 4 stars because the oil is good, but the price (while decent for Amazon) is not great. Other sources of top grade emu oil come in less expensive, but take longer to ship, and we are a now society ;)</li>
            <li> Love this on my hair . Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and smell. Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this again and again. I was just given a strong prescription for Retin-A which made my face like sandpaper that was constantly peeling. No more! I use this emu oil and my skin is perfectly soft and smooth and there is no irritation from the Retin-A. My husband has course wavy hair and he is loving it in his hair instead of &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; made from chemicals and plastics. I also like the packaging a lot.</li>
            <li> I am using this on my skin at night, I really like how fast it absorbs!</li>
            <li> When I first got to try [[ASIN:B00JX979CQ instanatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Ultra Premium Emu Oil]], I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about it. I have been using their [[ASIN:B00IP42FBA Rose Hip Seed Oil]] on my shoulders as an anti-inflammatory to control acne, so I decided to try their emu oil in place of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although named an oil, the product has a slightly thicker consistency to it. I like that it has a thicker consistency, giving me ample time to spread the product around and ensure I don&#x27;t miss any spots. Generally speaking, it is working just as well as the Rose hip seed oil has. I&#x27;ve even started using the product on my hair and find my hair looks much less damaged, really impressive. I was surprised to find that this product can work on aches and pains, but I haven&#x27;t tried it for that yet. I&#x27;ve tried so many products on my acne and can&#x27;t believe how quick this cleared it right up. I really like that this product absorbs so quickly so I can get on and start my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided for Review and Evaluation]</li>
            <li> This product and Instanatural in general are great!  I ordered the eye gel sometime back and received a prompt e-mail from the company&#x27;s founder guaranteeing my satisfaction and offering me prompt assistance if any questions should arise.  The eye gel works fantastically so I wrote a nice review on Amazon.com.    A couple of orders and e-mails later (this company REALLY wants to insure customer satisfaction!) Instanatural made the offer that if I wanted to try another one of their products, they would send it to me gratis.    This product intrigued me and they sent it right away.  This Emu Oil is really something!  I&#x27;ve lived most of my life in the AZ sun (I recently retired, but my career was mostly spent out doors).  There are not many things that can even penetrate dry elbows, knuckles and feet soles that have been baked by AZ summers outdoors, but this not only absorbs in well, the skin REMAINS soft!    I&#x27;ve used it on my face and it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy, but very hydrated!    My hair is also very dry and I&#x27;ve used oil and glycerin on it for years.  Sadly, and this may be due to the sad frazzled state of my hair, but I found this too heavy for mine.  I&#x27;d had high hopes, but I read in many of these reviews that it works for others and that&#x27;s great.    All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this company and its products.  I will be using this product and others by Instanatural for years to come, God willing, and I hope these products remain available.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 81 year old mother after a friend of hers said it was the best thing for dry skin.  Mom really likes the product and it works much better than her other lotions that contain perfumes and chemicals.  Also, the customer service was GREAT!  There was a problem with the pump bottle and they sent a new product and a gift!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I use it for arthritic pain in my knees twice a day.  Works better with continuous and consistent use.</li>
            <li> I have used several different oils for my hands this winter because it has been so harsh.  I found the emu oil to leave a more oily texture than my favorite argan oil, but it also seemed to moisturize a little better.  And the oil feeling does not stay for as long as it would with something like coconut oil or cooking oil.  I also like the pump bottle a little better than the dropper bottle as it is a little easier to keep everything clean.</li>
            <li> This Emu oil is so good to my skin and especially to the heels of my feet. It leaves the skin feeling like velvet.</li>
            <li> I use emu oil on my joints for pain relief.  It&#x27;s also very healing on skin irritations.  Currently, I&#x27;m trying it on my scalp for hair re-growth.  Will re-review when I have results on the hair growth in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are almost completely gone after about two months of consecutive use.  I use this oil for everything I love it.</li>
            <li> I have found that the emu oil has lessened the effects of psoriasis, leaving skin much smoother and less irritated and red.  Scaling of skin and itchiness caused by psoriasis have also improved.  Oral biologics used to treat psoriasis have many detrimental side effects to overall health. The emu oil is natural and safe, and we have found it to be a good alternative for lessening the symptoms associated with psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used EMU OIL.  A friend recommended it to me to help soften skin.  I have used it on my face and have noticed a smoothness to the texture of my skin.  My face also stays moisturized throughout the day ( I tend to have dry skin, especially in the cold harsh winters of the Midwest). This product works great as a day moisturizer under make-up and a night time moisturizer.  I have also used it on the heels and bottom of my feet after I have exfoliated them.  I have noted that my feet/heels are softer and easier to exfoliate.  This product has no odor.  A little drop goes a long way so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my healing tattoo and it worked wonders! It didn&#x27;t ooze, itch, or get flaky like most tattoos do in the healing process. A+</li>
            <li> Will not buy it again due to the smell!</li>
            <li> After my recent Appendectomy I found myself with a painful scar. My doctor recommended Emu oil to soften it. Within the past week I have used Insta Natural Emu Oil. My scar has become softer but no change in the color. I have also used it on my nails and on my knee that I had surgery on years ago. Being only a week I cannot say if my nails will be any healthier but it did seem to help the pain in my knee.&lt;br /&gt;When applied to skin it seems to produce a warming sensation. The Emu oil has the consistency and texture of cuticle oil with a white hue. When applied to my nails and hands it would leave an oily sheen to the skin for about 20 minutes. I did try and use it on my face a couple times and it was absorbed more quickly but like every other thing on this planet it did produce pimples on me.&lt;br /&gt;I have thought of adding some of the Emu Oil to my conditioner or my hand lotion. It seems like it would mix in well.&lt;br /&gt;The 4 oz bottle was bigger than I expected and should last a pretty long time. Most scar treatments take at least 8 weeks so we will see how it goes!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this company. I love this emu oil..my complexion looks so much better after 2 weeks of use. I also use it on my nail beds/cuticles and my nails look better too. I also purchased the argan oil hair mask and love that also. The company sends you information about their product and how to use it properly. They even sent me some rose water free. I will definitely be purchasing more from Instanatural.</li>
            <li> This is nice, light oil.  It feels really good on your skin, especially during the dry winter months.  I use it after a shower, and my skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> really liked it will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I ever got my hands on. I&#x27;ve mainly got it for my hair trying to regrow it and it works! It&#x27;s been one month and I already see the results. My hair feels awesome and the oil absorbs fast and no greasy after usage :)&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my hands as well and sometimes add a bit to my lotion.&lt;br /&gt;All I could say is that I LOVE this product! Worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li> I had heard about the benefits of emu oil, and was quite skeptical. I tend to stay away from animal products, but after alot of research I decided to give this a shot. What I found out, is that I love this oil. My skin is softer, smoother and more even. I have oily skin so I have to be very careful what goes onto my skin so I don&#x27;t break out. Emu oil absorbs quickly and does not clog my pores. With my old moisturizer, if I put it around my neckline I would break out the next morning, but with this oil I can put it all over my face and neck without any breakouts. I won&#x27;t be buying my old moisturizer again, emu oil works better and is cheaper. I am glad to recieve this product to review. It is woring great on my fine lines</li>
            <li> Emu oil itself is great but this bottle not so much. The product build up makes the dispenser pump ineffective</li>
            <li> Working very well to help tired burning skin due to cancer treatments.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  It makes my hair much more manageable, especially during the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> Receive in a timely manner product is being used on my scalp along with castor oil it absorbs real good have alopecia seems to be working will update later. Also felt like a pimple was trying to come and I rubbed a dab of emu oil on the area and the pain stop and pimple never surfaced.</li>
            <li> My skin is super prone to breakouts.  I was nervous to try emu oil because, well, it&#x27;s oil!  But I use it after I apply my benzyl peroxide treatment (I let the treatment dry 5 min before applying the emu oil) and it makes my skin so dewy and beautiful.  Not oily, not dry,  Just balanced and happy.  At night I mix it in with my vitamin c serum and pat it on.  My skin looks awesome when I wake up.  So glad I gave this a shot!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I have been using it for about 1 week and it disappears on my skin and does not leave an oily residue.  Thanks.  -lj</li>
            <li> I used oil for my hair and it made it very soft. You can use it for skin as well, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I have arthritis of my back and it helps greatly with the pain. I can definitely tell if I miss using it!</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin soft and smooth loving it so far amazing wonder&#x27;s on my feets and legs</li>
            <li> Great price and great shipping, delivered as expected, and the product does what does, it&#x27;s Emu Oil man, that&#x27;s a prehistoric bird that has not evolved, what more needs to be said.</li>
            <li> I use this oil daily. My skin is so soft now. My feet look so much better. Purchase this emu oil you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing!! Excited to use it for all things listed!!</li>
            <li> I used emu oil in my Cold Process soap making. It worked beautifully. Shipped quickly. Excellent product. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Awsome Face moisterizer I got it for my hair but my skin Lover it far better !!</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for the first time and our delivery was to our satisfaction and now my husband has been using this product and is&lt;br /&gt;seeing much improvement.</li>
            <li> After years of being not so nice to my skin by using water that was too hot and exfoliating too often and  too roughly,  I now have very dry skin.  After deciding to take some steps in the right direction,  I added this emu oil to my new skin care regimen. I am happy to say that using this oil on damp skin has helped the texture and tone of my skin immensely.  I have used emu oil in the past,  and it always had a strange odor to it.  I was pleasantly surprised upon testing this oil because I don&#x27;t notice a smell to it at all.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product works well.</li>
            <li> I used it on a dry spot on my face and in a couple days, it was no longer dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It is so hydrating and makes my skin so soft. So far I have only used it on my face and it is the best moisturizer I have ever used. My skin is naturally very dry. I have to apply lotion over and over because my face just soaks it all up. I even tried coconut oil and my face still soaks it up. This is the first product that I&#x27;ve used that I can apply it once and be done. It really moisturizers my face without looking over the top oily. My face soaks it in so nicely, but not to the point where I feel like I&#x27;m still dry. It works wonderfully under make up because it gets rid of dry patches and makes everything glide on smoothly. This is my 100% honest opinion. I highly recommend this product to people with dry skin!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he really likes it. He tends to get eczema and this has been helping to keep his skin smooth and moisturized. I might also try it on my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for a few weeks twice daily and still haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin. I will not be purchasing this oil again</li>
            <li> I live in the Northeast where the climate in the winter can be difficult. I am using this product on all my dry skin areas and it is working wonders. I have used emu oil before gotten from some Australian seller but for whatever reason this product seems to be more effective that the previous version I tried. It is absorbed quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film behind. Works really well!!</li>
            <li> Thank u so much I love it skin is soft &amp; beautiful edges is coming around I had emu oil from a different brand before &amp; I put it in the trash that&#x27;s how much it did nothing for me now I got the right one &amp; the packing was well done again thanks....</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of those products that have so many uses that you wonder why would you ever buy anything else. My favorite use of this oil is for my rosacea. I put one drop in my hands and rub together and apply to my cheeks and it seems to be helping to \\&quot;calm\\&quot; the redness. I have just started using this so I have no long term affect. My husband used this on his dry elbows and did the trick beautifully designed just a couple drops. We are sold!</li>
