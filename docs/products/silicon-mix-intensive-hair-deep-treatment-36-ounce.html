            <li>Is amazing.</li>
            <li>I used the Deluxe Softwood Dryer and did mini twists.</li>
            <li>I find it binds split ends on my own hair as well.  </li>
            <li>Affordable but effective.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the bamboo kind</li>
            <li>This product works wonders on its own</li>
            <li>It is awesome, really is.</li>
            <li>this has a very strong smell that can be overpowering.</li>
            <li>but i love to mix the Silicon Mix with the Ceramides Kanechom conditioner ( my favorite one!)</li>

            <li>This smells like a very strong perfume, but honestly I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Although the smell is very strong, I was able to get used to it.  </li>
            <li>i have a very light blond hair i bleach twice...</li>
            <li>Although we are a family our hair texture varies,however we all benefited from this product,the smoothness ,no frizz easy to detangle after a shampoo is amazing.</li>

            <li>Plus , we all should use a clarifying product from time to time because many products do coat</li>
            <li>some people are just fickle and can not be pleased.</li>

            <li>So glad I learned of this product.</li>
            <li>I love it ...</li>
            <li>This product works like magic.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love, this product.</li>
            <li>To be honest, this product didn&#x27;t do all the wonderful things that other ppl say.</li>
            <li>Silicon Mix does exactly what it says it would, my hair never felt so good.</li>
            <li>I got this conditioner months ago after watching a youtube video in which a young lady went on and on about how beautiful her hair always looked after using this treatment.</li>
            <li>Good Product, this really works!</li>
            <li>I love strong scents but not this type.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell and leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>The only thing was the scent was very strong and stays on the hair.the shipping process was great.</li>
            <li>This is an extremly good treatmet for dry hair and also smells good, but you will want to use it 1 or 2 times a week otherwise the hair can get greasy.</li>
            <li>Just when you thought your hair was perfect it shows you it could look a little better.</li>
            <li>Too strong and cause me headache.</li>
            <li>I have strong sensitivites to frangrance.</li>
            <li>I strongly believe that this product will help my hair.</li>
            <li>but you still get the same beautiful result.</li>
            <li>The best conditioner for black hair yet.  </li>
            <li>They shipped super fast!!!!</li>
            <li>Now, my hair is so long, looks healthy and I love it!!</li>
            <li>I went on a sulfate free and no silicone products for a while.</li>
            <li>but I am on the search for a sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>then again I havnt used a sulfate free shampoo since I started using this product,</li>
            <li>It is even great just to do a day of conditioner only.</li>
            <li>great for deep hydrating mask...</li>
            <li>This treatment leaves your hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such great service.</li>
            <li>but now im a light honey</li>
            <li>A great deep conditioner for weave!</li>
            <li>This deep treatment is a great product.</li>
            <li>later i am happy bye</li>
            <li>I love my Dominican products but I am not crazy about this one.  </li>
            <li>it works well, leaves hair silky, shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It was so soft and I loved the smell.</li>
            <li>I really like the intensive hair deep conditioner best.</li>
            <li>It works really good on my natural 4 c hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and smell good.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong but it is not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if it had a tropical scent, fruity scent, vanilla and lavender, almond/vanilla or clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It always enhances my curls and makes my hair super easy to manage.</li>
            <li>everything its ok thank you very much</li>
            <li>The scent is nice but can be strong if you are scent sensitive.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money (which is not even a lot!).</li>
            <li>Never have problems with hair being squeaky clean or mushy.</li>
            <li>It is great on color treated and dry hair.</li>
            <li>A little pricy but very good.  </li>
            <li>Super rich and creamy consistency.  </li>
            <li>my absolute favorite conditioner, nothing else makes my hair softer.</li>
            <li>works best if you leave for at least 5 minutes, pref 10..strong fragrant smell</li>
            <li>It did a good job at deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li>It is so surprising that I can wash my hair 3 to 4 weeks later and you will smell this conditioner while letting the water run over the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps hair hydrated and full of sheen.</li>
            <li>And it makes my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Full recommend to use this treatment for your hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is much softer and more manageable than before.</li>
            <li>By all means not a bad product.</li>
            <li>the company would take out the insane perfume smell, they would have a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morroccan oil stuff is good (more $$$) and it has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>This mixed along with Kanechom Argan Oil Hair Treatment Cream is the BEST deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I use it to quickly moisturize my son&#x27;s hair but it also works on hair weaves and extentions.</li>
            <li>so it was super damaged to the point where it would break off.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it has a very strong perfumey smell that is super strong while its in your hair.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before!&lt;br /&gt;Amazed!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is VERY FINE, soft, and stubborn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I can&#x27;t live more without it.</li>
            <li>The strong smell irriated my eyes too much.</li>
            <li>I thought this was too strong, but after I apply it and put my hair in a bun, I can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.  </li>
            <li>It did exactly what I brought it to do!</li>
            <li>Its creamy, leaves my hair soft; it has a distinct smell that is not unpleasant just refreshing.</li>
            <li>My hair did look better but was never that soft or silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments about how soft and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give 4 stars is because this product alone doesn&#x27;t give me the spectacular results as the mixture.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints so far :-)</li>
            <li>since i discovered i rarely use anything else</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth your time and money.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is very nice and it left her hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>it made the hair super silky soft and bouncy and although the smell is strong..</li>
            <li>Gives my hair the right amount of condition..</li>
            <li>Tried for years to find the right product for my Mediterranean hair</li>
            <li>Love it left your hair very smooth and soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like making my own hair mask does exactly the same exact thing.</li>
            <li>this product makes hair soft, and most of all smells good after a few days of exercising.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft , deep conditioned &amp; smelling good</li>
            <li>super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with how fast you all replaced my broken jar of Silicon, Just received it a couple of days ago, when I reported the damaged jar.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair, easy to detangle and feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>hair was really soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and it helped my hair very fast.</li>
            <li>but overall this item is one of the best conditioners you can buy for African American hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to take the jar out and squeeze what had leaked out back into the jar.</li>
            <li>AND THE HAIR STEAMER FOR MORE DEEP PENETRATIVE CONDITIONING (which I know works from when I got done to my hair done at a salon tent when I was deployed to ABU DABI, UAE in 2004- LOVEDED</li>
            <li>AND THE HAIR STEAMER FOR MORE DEEP PENETRATIVE CONDITIONING (which I know works from when I got done to my hair done at a salon tent when I was deployed to ABU DABI, UAE in 2004- LOVEDED IT).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of different kinds of Kanechom conditioners and it doesn&#x27;t matter which one I mix with the Silicon Mix, the results are outstanding.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using it, but if anything changes I will update this review.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and always use it in my hair to help it grow but the last time I tried to purchase it</li>
            <li>I first purchased a 36oz one and for my surprise after 3 weeks</li>
            <li>It smell like cheap stinky old lady perfume.  </li>
            <li>but I researched them and found this website that shows that most of the ingredients in Silicon Mix are actually helpful for the hair at &gt;&gt;</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>And I also love the smell that lingers days after using this and get several compliments on how my hair looks and smells.</li>
            <li>The Silicon product to me is more like a daily conditioner.  </li>
            <li>As with most things , I cannot find it in local stores...</li>
            <li>Did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a deep conditioner to make your hair feel silky, healthy and shiny...</li>
            <li>I was skeptical before using this product, but it was excellent on my hair.  </li>
            <li>when the weather was very humid, my hair was getting right away frizzy.</li>
            <li>This product mixed with a KANECHOM conditioner is great , it seals in the moisture and protein from the conditioner in your hair , your hair is now ready for heat styling , straightening comb or flat iron , your hair will be soft , smooth and straight .</li>
            <li>Ever wonder why your hair feels so good after getting a deep conditioning treatment at your local Dominican salon?</li>
            <li>It smells really good n when mixed by equal parts with Kanechom butter</li>
            <li>So I really didn&#x27;t like this at first.</li>
            <li>At first, I was planning on taking it with me to Brazil and give it to my sister as a gift since she loves it so much</li>
            <li>my hair super soft n feather -like.</li>
            <li>This product rejuvenates my hair, kills the lackluster, and gives me back strong, shiny,</li>
            <li>Does not weigh it down and great for regular use</li>
            <li>xtra large size....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about certain &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; ingredients then stay away from this one</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I was so amazed at how much VOLUME my hair appeared to have (I DON&#x27;T WEAR WEAVE ANYMORE</li>
            <li>i happen to kinda like the smell, but it may be too much for some.</li>
            <li>It really softens her hair.   </li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I really hope I can find a job soon</li>
            <li>My hair use to be very frizzle and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>However, it did make my hair very silky</li>
            <li>jus dont use to much..</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this.</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>when you feel its needed but OJON really works.  </li>
            <li>It cames really fast.</li>
            <li>Also, fast delivery...</li>
            <li>Really conditions it.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and manageable!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually very sensitive to scents and at first</li>
            <li>I can say I was so excited about it, but when I used it different story.</li>
            <li>I put more than I should have and within a couple of minutes I had a headache due to the odor.</li>
            <li>Even when my hair was dry, the strong smell would make my eyes water.</li>
            <li>but in the shower its really strong, mellows out once you dry your hair.</li>
            <li>Really want to rate accurately but can&#x27;t because the product arrived with the lid open with dried product around the top of the jar.  </li>
            <li>The jar is huge, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>, I usually only need one full spoonful of each product and my hair is throughly saturated.</li>
            <li>But after useing this product, wow, wow ,wow as in soft soooo soft, shinny and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>i love it because it not only makes my hair soft, the small is very clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My hair needs all the help it can get, and with this product I don&#x27;t have to pay high salon prices anymore.</li>
            <li>Fast forward a few years later where now I work, and found this gigantic tub for such a great price (than what it is in stores).</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>BUT is you are sensitive to smell eeek!!</li>
            <li>My hair was left feeling super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>the only bad thing was that the product spilled out when it arrived to Colombia, it would be great if the company could use a better seal to avoid this, bec.ause</li>
            <li>It mends you split ends and makes the hair real soft.</li>
            <li>I use it like conditioner, everyday, to use more like a treatment.</li>
            <li>The most curl definition I&#x27;ve ever had after my hair dried</li>
            <li>My daughter started loosing her hair right away after using this only once.</li>
            <li>I live this product</li>
            <li>It makes the hair like brand new.</li>
            <li>but this made it sooo easy to blow dry straight and flat iron.</li>
            <li>Make my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>When I used these for the first time (minus the hair steamer, which I KNOW will deeply penetrate better than a regular hair dryer)</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and no longer breaks off.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft with EVERY use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the hefty price  because it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I left it on overnight.  </li>
            <li>It leaves hair really soft</li>
            <li>My hair is always so soft and the shine is out of this world.</li>
            <li>IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SOFT AND SHINY.</li>
            <li>I even tried it on my 3 year old princess</li>
            <li>am now back on here to order the Silicon Mix Bambu Nutritive Hair Treatment line with the hair gloss and also the Intense Straightening w/ Almond and Wheat Protein &amp; Silicone Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Leave in Styling Heat Protection Creme for my princess just so that we could have variety....</li>
            <li>My hair is sooo soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair feeling soft and manageable</li>
            <li>I bought this, along with the Silicon Mix leave-in to use on my young daughter.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft, shiny, it improved my hair a lot since I started to use it 1 year ago.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m almost surprised I ran out</li>
            <li>I did some blonde highlights that really burned my hair.</li>
            <li>I was very ashamed to go outside.</li>
            <li>the natural curl pattern is visible to the point that I wish I could use this product as a leave-in for styling.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is an old tub or something, so I threw it away.</li>
            <li>The perfume is beyond intense and it last for days.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It does leave her hair soft.</li>
            <li>so I use to frequent the Dominican shops...</li>
            <li>It works well on natural, relaxed or virgin extensions.</li>
            <li>I also dilute this product with lots of water and spray on my natural hair as a leave in...</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It is so goog, let my hair so soft and shine.</li>
            <li>It felt really soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair absolutely soft and manageable</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so soft and like the salon at home.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair was completely silky after using.</li>
            <li>A miracle product, controls my frizz and makes my hair shiny and incredibly soft</li>
            <li>She sat pretty and let me detangle, blow dry and then braid her hair without a hitch!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am of mixed decent, my hair texture is natural, 3 a,b,c.</li>
            <li>straight from flat ironing</li>
            <li>I will not be repurchasing in the future mainly do to the smell.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue but it helps detanged my hair much quicker and makes the curls really pretty.  </li>
            <li>I also tried it on my natural hair and it left it so shiny and bouncy and of course soft.</li>
            <li>I noticed a major difference when I used it with the kanechom.</li>
            <li>I have said so long to my dry dead hair and hello to soft and healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I used it many years ago when I was in high school, but my mother deemed it expensive and stopped purchasing it.</li>
            <li>FYI, I currently have 3C/4A natural hair.</li>
            <li>I flat iron my hair a lot and this conditioner makes it soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I mixed this with the kanechom goat milk conditioner and used it as a deep conditioner for my natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s such a large container I will probably combine it with some other conditioner and use it, but I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>so this product did magic.it left my hair straight and less knots.</li>
            <li>It is no longer dry and lifeless...but instead long tresses of spun GOLD , shiny and soft like a bunny!</li>

            <li> To be honest, this product didn&#x27;t do all the wonderful things that other ppl say.</li>
            <li> Silicon Mix does exactly what it says it would, my hair never felt so good.</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner months ago after watching a youtube video in which a young lady went on and on about how beautiful her hair always looked after using this treatment.</li>
            <li> Good Product, this really works!</li>
            <li> I love strong scents but not this type.  </li>
            <li> It has a great smell and leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> The only thing was the scent was very strong and stays on the hair.the shipping process was great.</li>
            <li> This is an extremly good treatmet for dry hair and also smells good, but you will want to use it 1 or 2 times a week otherwise the hair can get greasy.</li>
            <li> Just when you thought your hair was perfect it shows you it could look a little better.</li>
            <li> Too strong and cause me headache.</li>
            <li> I have strong sensitivites to frangrance.</li>
            <li> I strongly believe that this product will help my hair.</li>
            <li> but you still get the same beautiful result.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner for black hair yet.  </li>
            <li> They shipped super fast!!!!</li>
            <li> Now, my hair is so long, looks healthy and I love it!!</li>
            <li> I went on a sulfate free and no silicone products for a while.</li>
            <li> but I am on the search for a sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li> then again I havnt used a sulfate free shampoo since I started using this product,</li>
            <li> It is even great just to do a day of conditioner only.</li>
            <li> great for deep hydrating mask...</li>
            <li> This treatment leaves your hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such great service.</li>
            <li> but now im a light honey</li>
            <li> A great deep conditioner for weave!</li>
            <li> This deep treatment is a great product.</li>
            <li> later i am happy bye</li>
            <li> I love my Dominican products but I am not crazy about this one.  </li>
            <li> it works well, leaves hair silky, shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It was so soft and I loved the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like the intensive hair deep conditioner best.</li>
            <li> It works really good on my natural 4 c hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and smell good.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong but it is not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> It would have been better if it had a tropical scent, fruity scent, vanilla and lavender, almond/vanilla or clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It always enhances my curls and makes my hair super easy to manage.</li>
            <li> everything its ok thank you very much</li>
            <li> The scent is nice but can be strong if you are scent sensitive.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money (which is not even a lot!).</li>
            <li> Never have problems with hair being squeaky clean or mushy.</li>
            <li> It is great on color treated and dry hair.</li>
            <li> A little pricy but very good.  </li>
            <li> Super rich and creamy consistency.  </li>
            <li> my absolute favorite conditioner, nothing else makes my hair softer.</li>
            <li> works best if you leave for at least 5 minutes, pref 10..strong fragrant smell</li>
            <li> It did a good job at deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li> It is so surprising that I can wash my hair 3 to 4 weeks later and you will smell this conditioner while letting the water run over the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps hair hydrated and full of sheen.</li>
            <li> And it makes my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Full recommend to use this treatment for your hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is much softer and more manageable than before.</li>
            <li> By all means not a bad product.</li>
            <li> the company would take out the insane perfume smell, they would have a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morroccan oil stuff is good (more $$$) and it has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> This mixed along with Kanechom Argan Oil Hair Treatment Cream is the BEST deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use it to quickly moisturize my son&#x27;s hair but it also works on hair weaves and extentions.</li>
            <li> so it was super damaged to the point where it would break off.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it has a very strong perfumey smell that is super strong while its in your hair.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before!&lt;br /&gt;Amazed!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY FINE, soft, and stubborn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I can&#x27;t live more without it.</li>
            <li> The strong smell irriated my eyes too much.</li>
            <li> I thought this was too strong, but after I apply it and put my hair in a bun, I can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.  </li>
            <li> It did exactly what I brought it to do!</li>
            <li> Its creamy, leaves my hair soft; it has a distinct smell that is not unpleasant just refreshing.</li>
            <li> My hair did look better but was never that soft or silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received many compliments about how soft and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give 4 stars is because this product alone doesn&#x27;t give me the spectacular results as the mixture.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints so far :-)</li>
            <li> since i discovered i rarely use anything else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth your time and money.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is very nice and it left her hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> it made the hair super silky soft and bouncy and although the smell is strong..</li>
            <li> Gives my hair the right amount of condition..</li>
            <li> Tried for years to find the right product for my Mediterranean hair</li>
            <li> Love it left your hair very smooth and soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like making my own hair mask does exactly the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> this product makes hair soft, and most of all smells good after a few days of exercising.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft , deep conditioned &amp; smelling good</li>
            <li> super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with how fast you all replaced my broken jar of Silicon, Just received it a couple of days ago, when I reported the damaged jar.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair, easy to detangle and feel soft.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> hair was really soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and it helped my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> but overall this item is one of the best conditioners you can buy for African American hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to take the jar out and squeeze what had leaked out back into the jar.</li>
            <li> AND THE HAIR STEAMER FOR MORE DEEP PENETRATIVE CONDITIONING (which I know works from when I got done to my hair done at a salon tent when I was deployed to ABU DABI, UAE in 2004- LOVEDED</li>
            <li> AND THE HAIR STEAMER FOR MORE DEEP PENETRATIVE CONDITIONING (which I know works from when I got done to my hair done at a salon tent when I was deployed to ABU DABI, UAE in 2004- LOVEDED IT).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of different kinds of Kanechom conditioners and it doesn&#x27;t matter which one I mix with the Silicon Mix, the results are outstanding.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using it, but if anything changes I will update this review.</li>
            <li> thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and always use it in my hair to help it grow but the last time I tried to purchase it</li>
            <li> I first purchased a 36oz one and for my surprise after 3 weeks</li>
            <li> It smell like cheap stinky old lady perfume.  </li>
            <li> but I researched them and found this website that shows that most of the ingredients in Silicon Mix are actually helpful for the hair at &gt;&gt;</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> And I also love the smell that lingers days after using this and get several compliments on how my hair looks and smells.</li>
            <li> The Silicon product to me is more like a daily conditioner.  </li>
            <li> As with most things , I cannot find it in local stores...</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a deep conditioner to make your hair feel silky, healthy and shiny...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical before using this product, but it was excellent on my hair.  </li>
            <li> when the weather was very humid, my hair was getting right away frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product mixed with a KANECHOM conditioner is great , it seals in the moisture and protein from the conditioner in your hair , your hair is now ready for heat styling , straightening comb or flat iron , your hair will be soft , smooth and straight .</li>
            <li> Ever wonder why your hair feels so good after getting a deep conditioning treatment at your local Dominican salon?</li>
            <li> It smells really good n when mixed by equal parts with Kanechom butter</li>
            <li> So I really didn&#x27;t like this at first.</li>
            <li> At first, I was planning on taking it with me to Brazil and give it to my sister as a gift since she loves it so much</li>
            <li> my hair super soft n feather -like.</li>
            <li> This product rejuvenates my hair, kills the lackluster, and gives me back strong, shiny,</li>
            <li> Does not weigh it down and great for regular use</li>
            <li> xtra large size....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about certain &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; ingredients then stay away from this one</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I was so amazed at how much VOLUME my hair appeared to have (I DON&#x27;T WEAR WEAVE ANYMORE</li>
            <li> i happen to kinda like the smell, but it may be too much for some.</li>
            <li> It really softens her hair.   </li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> I really hope I can find a job soon</li>
            <li> My hair use to be very frizzle and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> However, it did make my hair very silky</li>
            <li> jus dont use to much..</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this.</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> when you feel its needed but OJON really works.  </li>
            <li> It cames really fast.</li>
            <li> Also, fast delivery...</li>
            <li> Really conditions it.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft and manageable!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually very sensitive to scents and at first</li>
            <li> I can say I was so excited about it, but when I used it different story.</li>
            <li> I put more than I should have and within a couple of minutes I had a headache due to the odor.</li>
            <li> Even when my hair was dry, the strong smell would make my eyes water.</li>
            <li> but in the shower its really strong, mellows out once you dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Really want to rate accurately but can&#x27;t because the product arrived with the lid open with dried product around the top of the jar.  </li>
            <li> The jar is huge, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> , I usually only need one full spoonful of each product and my hair is throughly saturated.</li>
            <li> But after useing this product, wow, wow ,wow as in soft soooo soft, shinny and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> i love it because it not only makes my hair soft, the small is very clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair needs all the help it can get, and with this product I don&#x27;t have to pay high salon prices anymore.</li>
            <li> Fast forward a few years later where now I work, and found this gigantic tub for such a great price (than what it is in stores).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> BUT is you are sensitive to smell eeek!!</li>
            <li> My hair was left feeling super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> the only bad thing was that the product spilled out when it arrived to Colombia, it would be great if the company could use a better seal to avoid this, bec.ause</li>
            <li> It mends you split ends and makes the hair real soft.</li>
            <li> I use it like conditioner, everyday, to use more like a treatment.</li>
            <li> The most curl definition I&#x27;ve ever had after my hair dried</li>
            <li> My daughter started loosing her hair right away after using this only once.</li>
            <li> I live this product</li>
            <li> It makes the hair like brand new.</li>
            <li> but this made it sooo easy to blow dry straight and flat iron.</li>
            <li> Make my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> When I used these for the first time (minus the hair steamer, which I KNOW will deeply penetrate better than a regular hair dryer)</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and no longer breaks off.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft with EVERY use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the hefty price  because it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I left it on overnight.  </li>
            <li> It leaves hair really soft</li>
            <li> My hair is always so soft and the shine is out of this world.</li>
            <li> IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SOFT AND SHINY.</li>
            <li> I even tried it on my 3 year old princess</li>
            <li> am now back on here to order the Silicon Mix Bambu Nutritive Hair Treatment line with the hair gloss and also the Intense Straightening w/ Almond and Wheat Protein &amp; Silicone Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Leave in Styling Heat Protection Creme for my princess just so that we could have variety....</li>
            <li> My hair is sooo soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair feeling soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I bought this, along with the Silicon Mix leave-in to use on my young daughter.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft, shiny, it improved my hair a lot since I started to use it 1 year ago.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m almost surprised I ran out</li>
            <li> I did some blonde highlights that really burned my hair.</li>
            <li> I was very ashamed to go outside.</li>
            <li> the natural curl pattern is visible to the point that I wish I could use this product as a leave-in for styling.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is an old tub or something, so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> The perfume is beyond intense and it last for days.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It does leave her hair soft.</li>
            <li> so I use to frequent the Dominican shops...</li>
            <li> It works well on natural, relaxed or virgin extensions.</li>
            <li> I also dilute this product with lots of water and spray on my natural hair as a leave in...</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It is so goog, let my hair so soft and shine.</li>
            <li> It felt really soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair absolutely soft and manageable</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft and like the salon at home.  </li>
            <li> My natural hair was completely silky after using.</li>
            <li> A miracle product, controls my frizz and makes my hair shiny and incredibly soft</li>
            <li> She sat pretty and let me detangle, blow dry and then braid her hair without a hitch!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am of mixed decent, my hair texture is natural, 3 a,b,c.</li>
            <li> straight from flat ironing</li>
            <li> I will not be repurchasing in the future mainly do to the smell.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue but it helps detanged my hair much quicker and makes the curls really pretty.  </li>
            <li> I also tried it on my natural hair and it left it so shiny and bouncy and of course soft.</li>
            <li> I noticed a major difference when I used it with the kanechom.</li>
            <li> I have said so long to my dry dead hair and hello to soft and healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I used it many years ago when I was in high school, but my mother deemed it expensive and stopped purchasing it.</li>
            <li> FYI, I currently have 3C/4A natural hair.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair a lot and this conditioner makes it soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with the kanechom goat milk conditioner and used it as a deep conditioner for my natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s such a large container I will probably combine it with some other conditioner and use it, but I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> so this product did magic.it left my hair straight and less knots.</li>
            <li> It is no longer dry and lifeless...but instead long tresses of spun GOLD , shiny and soft like a bunny!</li>
            <li> I currently I started my long hair journey, so deep conditioner treatments is a must</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have been highlighting my hair for more then 10 years now and lately it has been very dried</li>
            <li> This is a large container and should last at least 6 months since I don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
            <li> i use this mixed with a little VCO to deep condition &amp; it leaves my hair soft &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> The 36 oz. container will last you a long time.  </li>
            <li> The product last for a LONG time also!</li>
            <li> ONLY WHEN WET.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 4 month old curly weave that was dried out, tangled and burnt</li>
            <li> I already do deep treatments on my hair, so this product does not really do much for me.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care about that...as long as my hair loves it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy long straight hair I often cut becuz</li>
            <li> Today my new jar came, I really thought I was going to be just out of money, but you proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> and I am going to be buying the entire line in due time.......</li>
            <li> and I am going to be buying the entire line in due time.......</li>
            <li> Cannot figure it out, very strange to me.</li>
            <li> if it will help me with my dry hair, but I will keep using it and see.</li>
            <li> Every time i washed my hair it would be frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> Afterwards i step out of the shower blow dry from 3 to 5 minutes and rinse.</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c curly hair that gets dry.</li>
            <li> It felt dry like straw</li>
            <li> I will never live with out this product.</li>
            <li> To say the least I have used it several times and it is a pure waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was surprised because usually products don&#x27;t work after just one use.  </li>
            <li> The lid had come loose and it spilled into the bag.</li>
            <li> I usually apply as a deep condition, prepoo and regular conditioner treatment.</li>
            <li> The perfume is OVERPOWERING and it is seriously crazy strong</li>
            <li> My hair is usually very dry, and not manageable</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling a little oily.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune on my hair</li>
            <li> I this straight and thin hair</li>
            <li> I have never colored my hair in any way , but the weather can be harsh on it , as can medical issues</li>
            <li> Its looks small but a little goes a long way and last a long time since you don&#x27;t use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I have mixed girl hair since I am half dutch/irish and black.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I like the smell too, ohhh a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it left my hair hard and dry.</li>
            <li> I have recommended to other people  </li>
            <li> Im naturally a dark brown</li>
            <li> I ended up paying the same price but got a 32oz instead of a 36oz and got it way too late...</li>
            <li> I have thick, kinky, curly hair, that i recently bleached for an \\&quot;Ombre\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> the smell still gets me in a sour mood.</li>
            <li> Not at all greasy or weighed down after the product is rinsed out.</li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put this on my hair dry</li>
            <li> I find the 16 oz and some of the previous 32 oz jars to be slightly diluted sometimes.</li>
            <li> no shine just life less.</li>
            <li> but I expected the fragrances we usually get from these products.</li>
            <li> And a little goes along way</li>
            <li> Keratin was applied onto my hair and it was a little damaged.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> it gets heavy</li>
            <li> It does leave your hair scented after it is rinsed out, but not strongly scented.</li>
            <li> have  thin ,  hard to curl blonde hair</li>
            <li> and Im not sure</li>
            <li> and she loves her hair too, which is beautifully thick and hard to comb without making her cry.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would give me the detangling and slip since I have been experiencing tangled hair lately.</li>
            <li> One lady sent me a couple negative reviews she found of them complaining about buildup on hair.</li>
            <li> I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, THE SHAMPOO, AND THE LEAVE IN CONDITION, which I am so mad I forgot to put in my cart</li>

            <li> So, this may or may not work for you, but I will stick to what I usually use!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m the mean while I&#x27;ll give this one five stars</li>
            <li> daughter has curly hair that is very thick and hard to manage while washing (even with a relaxer done 2x a year).</li>
            <li> and it is not a good perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the Professional Salon Hair Steamer with Rolling Floor Stand Base from this site as well</li>
            <li> When I started my hair was &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; and weak.</li>
            <li> Ive never experienced sth likt this before.</li>
            <li> , although it is thin there is a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> Highly disappointed and kinda feel bad because my rating is purely based on packaging.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I don&#x27;t even THINK about using a curling wand or curling iron to bump or curl my hair.</li>

            <li> ill never use anything else!</li>
            <li> it does have a bad smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells bad</li>
            <li> I even use it on my girls hair and wash day is no longer a bad day.</li>

            <li> this has been the best conditioner I have ever tried and believe me when I say ive tried them all,. I have spent a fortune on my hair and I cant believe this has been the best thing for my hair. I went on a sulfate free and no silicone products for a while. My hair did look better but was never that soft or silky. I flat iron my hair a lot and this conditioner makes it soft and silky. I have used it 4 times. 3 times mixed in with the Kanechom and once just by itself. I noticed a major difference when I used it with the kanechom. I will never be without this. I have replaced all of my conditioners for this. I started using a sulfate shampoo though because im scared of buildup from silicones but I am on the search for a sulfate free shampoo I can use 3 times a day that will remove the buildup. Not that I have noticed any buildup whatsoever but then again I havnt used a sulfate free shampoo since I started using this product,</li>
            <li> It leaves hair really soft but I don&#x27;t really like the smell. I only used it about two times and Im not sure if it will help me with my dry hair, but I will keep using it and see.</li>
            <li> this product makes hair soft, and most of all smells good after a few days of exercising. It is even great just to do a day of conditioner only.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft , deep conditioned &amp; smelling good</li>
            <li> The best treatment I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is always so soft and the shine is out of this world. The product last for a LONG time also! Definitely worth the money (which is not even a lot!). Already bought a bigger pot.</li>
            <li> Great results!!! Mixed with Kanechom brazilian hair treatment. I used the Deluxe Softwood Dryer and did mini twists. I&#x27;ve received many compliments about how soft and shiny my hair looks. 4 stars because of smell</li>
            <li> I find the 16 oz and some of the previous 32 oz jars to be slightly diluted sometimes. The 64 oz is the best but overall this item is one of the best conditioners you can buy for African American hair.</li>
            <li> xtra large size....very good...i love this conditioner...i have a very light blond hair i bleach twice...so this help a lot....</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase...super fast delivery.  Love this product, I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This is an oldie but goodie, and I&#x27;m SO glad I decided to revisit the Silicon Mix and Kenechom combo for conditioning my hair. Ever wonder why your hair feels so good after getting a deep conditioning treatment at your local Dominican salon? One or both of these products are likely in the mix! FYI, I currently have 3C/4A natural hair. I also used this when I was relaxed and it worked great!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN AWESOME HAIR CONDITIONER.  I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE SEARCHING FOR A DOMINICAN PRODUCT.  IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SOFT AND SHINY.</li>
            <li> Great as a conditioning treatment/in-shower detangler. I bought it to mix with Kanechom as a conditioning treatment but it is just great on its own. Shower mat is a good idea as silicon can get slippery. Thank goodness they packed this inside a bag... The lid had come loose and it spilled into the bag. I was able to take the jar out and squeeze what had leaked out back into the jar.</li>
            <li> Works. Make my hair very soft. But I can not handle the smell. Too strong and cause me headache.</li>
            <li> Okay so that was two words, but I hope you&#x27;ve gotten my drift. I bought this product last week with the Silicon Mix Shampoo Hidratante 36oz [Health and Beauty], the Brazilian Hair Treatment Goat&#x27;s Milk (Leite De Cabra, Leche De Cabra) Mask by Kanechom and requested shipping to be next day air... It GOT HERE ON TIME!!! YESSSSS Honey! I also bought the Professional Salon Hair Steamer with Rolling Floor Stand Base from this site as well but I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it. I plan to wash my hair with this product for the second time tonight and I will be using my hair steamer with it. The shampoo and then condition mix with the Kanechom product was just as I had decribed.... OUTSTANDINGLY AMAZING!!!! My hair is VERY FINE, soft, and stubborn. It&#x27;s curly ONLY WHEN WET. It is cooperative when I straighten it ONLY when it is NOT humid outside. Otherwise, I would have to put two or three products in to keep the curl pattern in it, but the frizz and puff make me miserable. Needless to say, I don&#x27;t even THINK about using a curling wand or curling iron to bump or curl my hair. the moment I walk away from my vanity, the curls DROOOOOOOP, honey!!!!&lt;br /&gt;SOOOOOOO- enter these wonderful products.... When I used these for the first time (minus the hair steamer, which I KNOW will deeply penetrate better than a regular hair dryer) I was so amazed at how much VOLUME my hair appeared to have (I DON&#x27;T WEAR WEAVE ANYMORE SINCE TRYING THEM BROKE OFF MY HAIR). My hair was bouncy, flowy, and shiny as all heaven, honey!!! I am so not your pre-madonna! I love to get up and go- so-to-speak. I love love love how this stuff makes my hair feel. I even tried it on my 3 year old princess and she loves her hair too, which is beautifully thick and hard to comb without making her cry. She sat pretty and let me detangle, blow dry and then braid her hair without a hitch!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am now back on here to order the Silicon Mix Bambu Nutritive Hair Treatment line with the hair gloss and also the Intense Straightening w/ Almond and Wheat Protein &amp; Silicone Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Leave in Styling Heat Protection Creme for my princess just so that we could have variety.... LOL Truthfully I just love them all and I am going to be buying the entire line in due time....... I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, THE SHAMPOO, AND THE LEAVE IN CONDITION, which I am so mad I forgot to put in my cart (LOL) AND THE HAIR STEAMER FOR MORE DEEP PENETRATIVE CONDITIONING (which I know works from when I got done to my hair done at a salon tent when I was deployed to ABU DABI, UAE in 2004- LOVEDED IT).Intense Straightening w/ Almond and Wheat Protein &amp; Silicone Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Leave in Styling Heat Protection Creme for my princess just so that we could have variety.... LOL Truthfully I just love them all and I am going to be buying the entire line in due time.......

            <li> I use this with the Kanechom conditioner to restore shine &amp; softness to my hair &amp; extensions, works amazingly well!  This is my 2nd tub and I&#x27;ll keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> To be honest, this product didn&#x27;t do all the wonderful things that other ppl say. So I really didn&#x27;t like this at first. I also had the Kanechom and used it alone and my hair didn&#x27;t like either of these products by themselves. So being the recovering product junkie that I am, I started mixing these two together just to get rid of them and BOOM!!! I created a miracle potion that has me literally swinging my hair back and forth! I have a couple of different kinds of Kanechom conditioners and it doesn&#x27;t matter which one I mix with the Silicon Mix, the results are outstanding. I will repurchase again. The only reason I give 4 stars is because this product alone doesn&#x27;t give me the spectacular results as the mixture.</li>
            <li> This mixed along with Kanechom Argan Oil Hair Treatment Cream is the BEST deep conditioner. My hair is sooo soft, and shiny. I have thick, kinky, curly hair, that i recently bleached for an \\&quot;Ombre\\&quot; look. My hair is usually very dry, and not manageable but this made it sooo easy to blow dry straight and flat iron. My hair feels like silk. I have never gotten these results without going to the salon. I highly recommend. This was my first time using it, but if anything changes I will update this review. Try it, its inexpensive, and for the price they give you A LOT.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 4 month old curly weave that was dried out, tangled and burnt straight from flat ironing. I let is sit for 12 hours and the curls came all the way back! it made the hair super silky soft and bouncy and although the smell is strong.. it does not stink and I kept getting compliments on how good my hair smelled for a week after wearing it. I also tried it on my natural hair and it left it so shiny and bouncy and of course soft. I have no complaints so far :-)</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair feeling soft and manageable</li>
            <li> this has a very strong smell that can be overpowering. i happen to kinda like the smell, but it may be too much for some. i use this mixed with a little VCO to deep condition &amp; it leaves my hair soft &amp; moisturized. i&#x27;m glad i don&#x27;t have to hunt all over town for it. thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> I mixed this with ceramidas and it left my hair hard and dry. So, this may or may not work for you, but I will stick to what I usually use!</li>
            <li> Used this on my weave an it brought it back to life!! It was so soft and I loved the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have been highlighting my hair for more then 10 years now and lately it has been very dried ab[nd this product did a miracle!!! Seriously, I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before!&lt;br /&gt;Amazed!!!</li>
            <li> great for deep hydrating mask... it does have a bad smell but i can deal with it. I does a great job and leaves my hair smooth and shining.</li>
            <li> I have been using the silicon mix products for years.  I was initially turned on to this by my hair stylist who is from the Dominican Republic.  This treatment leaves your hair smooth and silky. Love it!</li>
            <li> My girl started using this product and it has been really great the fragrance is very nice and it left her hair soft and shiny the only bad thing was that the product spilled out when it arrived to Colombia, it would be great if the company could use a better seal to avoid this, bec.ause it is a shame that any of the product get lost</li>
            <li> I bought this, along with the Silicon Mix leave-in to use on my young daughter.  This product is great. It really softens her hair.   I shampoo her, then use this with a plastic cap on her head for longer than the recommended time (about 15 minutes).  I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft. It brings hair back to life. I would recommend it. I let it sit for about 2 hours</li>
            <li> love this product. I would use it on my hair extensions whey they were getting a bit unruley. This tamed them.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS CONDTIONER WORKS WELL WITH KANECHOM CONDITIONERS!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with how fast you all replaced my broken jar of Silicon, Just received it a couple of days ago, when I reported the damaged jar. Today my new jar came, I really thought I was going to be just out of money, but you proved me wrong. Thank you for such great service. Now next time I can comment on the product Lol!!!</li>
            <li> Im naturally a dark brown but now im a light honey blonde. Every time i washed my hair it would be frizzy and dry. I use this religiously. I just wash my hair apply this generously and put a processing cap on. Afterwards i step out of the shower blow dry from 3 to 5 minutes and rinse. My hair feels so much better with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft, shiny, it improved my hair a lot since I started to use it 1 year ago. My hair grows faster as well! Is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have said so long to my dry dead hair and hello to soft and healthy hair. This product works great on my hair I mix it with the Kanechom Goat&#x27;s Milk and it really works. My hair needs all the help it can get, and with this product I don&#x27;t have to pay high salon prices anymore. I am saving money and looking great who could ask for more</li>
            <li> its the best treatment ever for your hair. Ive never experienced sth likt this before. my hair keeps growing healthly</li>
            <li> OMG, this is the best product that has made my hair so unbelievably soft. I plan on purchasing a couple more items from the vendor. Very fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money this does nothing for yoour hair. No softness</li>
            <li> Love it!! The fact alone that it is a great product, I&#x27;d easily pay $20 for it but 36oz? LOVE IT!! It lasted me a good while, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m almost surprised I ran out lol. I&#x27;m definitely going to try the shampoo next. I really hope I can find a job soon cause my list of products I need to restock on and want to try is just getting longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for so many years and I love it. When I started my hair was &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; and weak. I did some blonde highlights that really burned my hair. I was very ashamed to go outside. I started using this product and it helped my hair very fast. I use it as a regular conditioner and when I want a deeper treatment, I leave it around an hour. My hair use to be very frizzle and when the weather was very humid, my hair was getting right away frizzy. This is not happening anymore. Also, my hair used to take forever to grow. Now, my hair is so long, looks healthy and I love it!! I will never change this conditioner.  I have recommended to other people  and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> Really want to rate accurately but can&#x27;t because the product arrived with the lid open with dried product around the top of the jar.  Can&#x27;t be sure if the product was tainted.  Highly disappointed and kinda feel bad because my rating is purely based on packaging.</li>
            <li> The 36 oz. container will last you a long time.  I already see a difference in my hair after a week&#x27;s use.  My hair looks and feels softer.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I heard that it was a good product and wanted to try it.It mends you split ends and makes the hair real soft.</li>
            <li> One of the best deep conditioners I have come across. This will now be a staple of mine. It made my hair feel amazing! The only drawback is that it has a very strong perfumey smell that is super strong while its in your hair. It does leave your hair scented after it is rinsed out, but not strongly scented. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on this product and I agree with those who gave the highest rating. This is an excellent conditioner for my type hair (3b to 4C). the natural curl pattern is visible to the point that I wish I could use this product as a leave-in for styling. Its creamy, leaves my hair soft; it has a distinct smell that is not unpleasant just refreshing. I use it by itself or mix with Kanechom. Both products can be reviewed on utube.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell so good, but hydratate a lot. I use it like conditioner, everyday, to use more like a treatment. For mask, I bought another one.&lt;br /&gt;However, I can&#x27;t live more without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good to hydrate the hair, however doesn&#x27;t smell very good. The smell is nothing that would stop you from using it but I expected the fragrances we usually get from these products.</li>
            <li> I bought this to revitalize some hairpieces.  I find it binds split ends on my own hair as well.  This is a large container and should last at least 6 months since I don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
            <li> Not working as it has when I purchased from the store. Cannot figure it out, very strange to me. Maybe it is an old tub or something, so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> A great deep conditioner for weave!</li>
            <li> This product works!  The best conditioner for black hair yet.  A little pricy but very good.  Love the smell.  My hair is very soft and no longer breaks off.  Been using it for three years now.  I have given it to friends as gifts.  Everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> I currently I started my long hair journey, so deep conditioner treatments is a must once a week for me. I saw this product being bragged about on youtube, and thought I have nothing to lose and bought it. I can say I was so excited about it, but when I used it different story. I put more than I should have and within a couple of minutes I had a headache due to the odor. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s not a bad product just the odor that wasn&#x27;t pleasant for me. I already do deep treatments on my hair, so this product does not really do much for me. It&#x27;s almost like making my own hair mask does exactly the same exact thing. Once I finish it I will not buy this product again. By all means not a bad product. My hair just had the the same effects with my treatments. Leaving it smooth, shiny, manageable, and smelling good.</li>
            <li> This deep treatment is a great product. It smells wonderful and leaves your hair feeling soft and moisturized. It&#x27;s worth the hefty price  because it lasts for a long time. USE IT.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft with EVERY use. Affordable but effective. If you&#x27;re worried about certain &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; ingredients then stay away from this one but I don&#x27;t care about that...as long as my hair loves it.</li>
            <li> I have strong sensitivites to frangrance. The strong smell irriated my eyes too much. Even when my hair was dry, the strong smell would make my eyes water. However, it did make my hair very silky and my mom kept saying how good it smelled on me.</li>
            <li> everything its ok thank you very much, i love it i will recommend see you later i am happy bye</li>
            <li> my absolute favorite conditioner, nothing else makes my hair softer. works best if you leave for at least 5 minutes, pref 10..strong fragrant smell i happen to love it, but in the shower its really strong, mellows out once you dry your hair. since i discovered i rarely use anything else</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!!! They shipped super fast!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and always use it in my hair to help it grow but the last time I tried to purchase it I had some problems. At first, I was planning on taking it with me to Brazil and give it to my sister as a gift since she loves it so much but the product didn&#x27;t arrive on time, which was a shame. After 2 weeks with no updates on the product I decided to contact them to find out what was going on and after talking to them I still decided to go ahead with my order so they shipped me another one. I first purchased a 36oz one and for my surprise after 3 weeks I got it delivered but when I opened the box it didn&#x27;t have a 36oz one but two 16oz. I ended up paying the same price but got a 32oz instead of a 36oz and got it way too late... I was very unhappy with the way they handled the situation</li>
            <li> love this stuff!!! I dont rinse this out, just leave it in. I dont use a lot. Smells nice. Gives my hair the right amount of condition.. I have mixed hair. The jar is huge, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Loved it I shared it with my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I love my Dominican products but I am not crazy about this one.  It did a good job at deep conditioning.  It left my hair feeling a little oily.  The perfume is beyond intense and it last for days.  It smell like cheap stinky old lady perfume.  I will not be repurchasing in the future mainly do to the smell.  I love strong scents but not this type.  It would have been better if it had a tropical scent, fruity scent, vanilla and lavender, almond/vanilla or clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> makes my hair easy to brush and detangle, leaves it feeling great and smells great! ive got my best friend and niece hooked on it. ill never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about Avanti brand hair conditioners years ago.  This product makes my hair, easy to detangle and feel soft.  I am now going to be buying the 60 ounce size.  I am of mixed decent, my hair texture is natural, 3 a,b,c.</li>
            <li> Best hair treatment ever</li>
            <li> Love it I&#x27;m going to try the bamboo kind also but I&#x27;m the mean while I&#x27;ll give this one five stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Can I used the sill icon mix with the kanechom avocado deep conditions mask,can someone tell me please?</li>
            <li> Great product. I got in time like they said!&lt;br /&gt;I use one time a week and 3 weeks later I can notice de difference!</li>
            <li> It smells really good n when mixed by equal parts with Kanechom butter it works like magic! I have thick, frizzy long straight hair I often cut becuz it gets heavy but this made my hair super soft n feather -like. It also made my highlights stand out. I left on my hair 45 mins for deep treatment n the results where like those you get after paying $100 dollars at a salon. My 1st time and I Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this to rejuvenate my hair pieces. It works great on quality hair. Was shipped timely and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, left my hair feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.. jus dont use to much.. a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have 4a type hair and it is the only conditioner I would ever buy a 60 oz tub of... Some people worry about the ingredients but I researched them and found this website that shows that most of the ingredients in Silicon Mix are actually helpful for the hair at &gt;&gt; [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put this on my hair dry and it&#x27;s great for detangling or overnight. Never have problems with hair being squeaky clean or mushy. It always enhances my curls and makes my hair super easy to manage.</li>
            <li> My son,daughter and I all use this product.Although we are a family our hair texture varies,however we all benefited from this product,the smoothness ,no frizz easy to detangle after a shampoo is amazing. We use it alone as a conditioner and for deeper conditioning we use it with Kanechom Manteiga De Karite Butter</li>
            <li> This smells like a very strong perfume, but honestly I love the smell. I mixed this with the kanechom goat milk conditioner and used it as a deep conditioner for my natural 4c hair. I received this product today and since Fridays is my wash day I got to use it today. The most curl definition I&#x27;ve ever had after my hair dried and it&#x27;s so moisturized. I&#x27;ll be keeping this in my regimen for sure</li>
            <li> Great conditioner!  The scent is nice but can be strong if you are scent sensitive. My hair was left feeling super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I use it to quickly moisturize my son&#x27;s hair but it also works on hair weaves and extentions. Super rich and creamy consistency.  Hair feels soft and easy to manage.  Not at all greasy or weighed down after the product is rinsed out.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome conditioner, when used in conjunction with the Kanechom shea butter conditioner.  I would definitely purchase it again. Good buy for the money and fabulous hair results.</li>
            <li> My daughter started loosing her hair right away after using this only once. Might be ok for fake hair.</li>
            <li> OMG this stuff is like hair crack. I have used this on some human hair Malaysian curly hair I purchased for a cowash before I installed the hair and this stuff made the hair look so beautiful, manageable and silky, the longer you leave it on the better the results, I&#x27;ve used this on extensions, my hair and on my patient I take care of hair which are all different textures but you still get the same beautiful result. I recommend this to anybody who has hair period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for years. I&#x27;m natural now and it&#x27;s the best thing ever. I usually apply as a deep condition, prepoo and regular conditioner treatment.</li>
            <li> I really like the intensive hair deep conditioner best. I had some hair damage from heat styling and blow drying. This product was great for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best! You can see it working on your hair. It makes your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I brought it to do! Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the Kanechom Leche conditioner. I too saw the Youtube reveiw and purchased based on her suggestion. My hair is in the middle of my back and I relax my hair every 10 weeks. I needed something that would give me the detangling and slip since I have been experiencing tangled hair lately. This did not give me that.  I still had to take my time in combing out my hair. I really like the smell of this. It is so surprising that I can wash my hair 3 to 4 weeks later and you will smell this conditioner while letting the water run over the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has curly hair that is very thick and hard to manage while washing (even with a relaxer done 2x a year). Her hair likes this conditioner but she still has to take the time to comb out her hair. It does leave her hair soft. I probably will not purchase this again because I did not see the slip and detangle as others have experienced. I am from NYC so I use to frequent the Dominican shops...they had the rinses that they would pump and pour out on your hair and the comb would just glide through...this is the stuff that I need...and now the search continues...</li>
            <li> An incredible product with a delicious smell. My hair loves it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  It does wonders on weave. Keeps hair hydrated and full of sheen. Just when you thought your hair was perfect it shows you it could look a little better. I&#x27;ll never use another product again.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS PRODUCT. I used it many years ago when I was in high school, but my mother deemed it expensive and stopped purchasing it. Fast forward a few years later where now I work, and found this gigantic tub for such a great price (than what it is in stores). I didn&#x27;t think twice, I bought it immediately. The smell is so refreshing and delicious. After a wash, I ask my boyfriend to smell my hair various times throughout the day/ night. My hair has years of being dyed, bleached, chopped up, and burnt all into weird hairstyles. This product rejuvenates my hair, kills the lackluster, and gives me back strong, shiny, *great smelling* hair. I LOVEEE THIS PRODUCT. LOVE IT. I will buy it forever and ever!</li>
            <li> This product smells GREAT!! It works well on natural, relaxed or virgin extensions. I also dilute this product with lots of water and spray on my natural hair as a leave in... it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue but it helps detanged my hair much quicker and makes the curls really pretty.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff!! Works best with it&#x27;s Shampoo. I use it after bleaching my hair and Extensions. Leaves hair silky soft and manageable. The scent is a bit strong but it is not a bad smell. In a way, i am reminded of the smell of roses 2 days after using this product, so it has a floral scent to me. I use nothing else since i tried this formula. Good good stuff!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I used before and is very nice you can find it  in amazon.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff ! I have chemically treated textured hair and this stuff works wonders everytime. I also use this on a variety of clients  and they are always amazed with the results. And I also love the smell that lingers days after using this and get several compliments on how my hair looks and smells. This product works wonders on its own but i love to mix the Silicon Mix with the Ceramides Kanechom conditioner ( my favorite one!) and those two mixed together OMG!!!!!!!! And a little goes along way, I usually only need one full spoonful of each product and my hair is throughly saturated. I&#x27;m a conditioner junkie and nothing else I&#x27;ve every tried makes my hair look, smell, or feel like Silicon Mix.</li>
            <li> Pros:  it works well, leaves hair silky, shiny and smooth.  Very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The perfume is OVERPOWERING and it is seriously crazy strong and it is not a good perfume smell.  The smell will still be with you 3 days later.  The smell just kills me.  I tried using this conditioner a couple of times and I just cant stand the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I had to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if the company would take out the insane perfume smell, they would have a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morroccan oil stuff is good (more $$$) and it has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have seen great results from using this conditioner.  This is my second time ordering this online.</li>
            <li> Silicon Mix does exactly what it says it would, my hair never felt so good. I get loads of compliments when i use this treatment and it lasts for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the good reviews but this just did not do the job for me.  I this straight and thin hair but I would not consider this a Intensive Hair Deep Treatment.  A good product that is Intesive is by OJON restorative hair treatment plus, now this deep treatment you do either once a week or when you feel its needed but OJON really works.  It comes in a 3.4 size for about $33.  Its looks small but a little goes a long way and last a long time since you don&#x27;t use it every day.  The Silicon product to me is more like a daily conditioner.  Again, this is just my opinion based on my results.</li>
            <li> I recomend this product, I really love it. It is so goog, let my hair so soft and shine. l</li>
            <li> It cames really fast. I coud not believe. I live this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over six months and I totally LOVE it as it leaves my hair silky, shiny and smelling great... Extremely happy customer!!!</li>
            <li> I mix this with kanachome another Brazilian conditioner. It has a great smell and leaves your hair very soft. It is a deep moisturising conditioner. Great for use after a protein treatment.</li>
            <li> Although the smell is very strong, I was able to get used to it.  I&#x27;m usually very sensitive to scents and at first I thought this was too strong, but after I apply it and put my hair in a bun, I can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.  I have bleached Asian hair so it was super damaged to the point where it would break off.  I was introduced to this product by a beauty guru from Youtube who said this was the only thing that helped her hair grow.  The first time I used it, I left it on overnight.  When I washed it off, I noticed my hair was sooo much better! It felt really soft and silky.  I was surprised because usually products don&#x27;t work after just one use.  I&#x27;ve been using it once a week for about a month now.  All my friends have been commenting that my hair looks and feels a lot better!</li>
            <li> This product was perfect to my hair, I love it !!! Keratin was applied onto my hair and it was a little damaged. I strongly believe that this product will help my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and recommend it highly. It is great on color treated and dry hair. I have yet to find another product that comes close to it. Also, fast delivery...</li>
            <li> As one knows , to switch products from time to time is best for your hair.  As with most things , I cannot find it in local stores...so I order online.  The product is great , smells wonderful and does wonders for your hair!  I have been giving samples of this out to friends so they could try it and ALL love it.  One lady sent me a couple negative reviews she found of them complaining about buildup on hair. Well , I say you cannot please EVERYONE! Plus , we all should use a clarifying product from time to time because many products do coat hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have  thin ,  hard to curl blonde hair , although it is thin there is a lot of it.  I have never colored my hair in any way , but the weather can be harsh on it , as can medical issues BUT with the aid of biotin supplements, wearing clip in extensions  and using THIS product line I have once again breathed life back into my hair. It is no longer dry and lifeless...but instead long tresses of spun GOLD , shiny and soft like a bunny! SO ,do not believe the naysayers....some people are just fickle and can not be pleased.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, it brought life back to my hair and it also smells amazing. I would definitely, recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner months ago after watching a youtube video in which a young lady went on and on about how beautiful her hair always looked after using this treatment. She claimed that her hairdresser mixed Silicon Mix with (Kanechom) Brazilian Hair Treatment Goat&#x27;s Milk and applied it to her hair for 30 minutes w/heat. To say the least I have used it several times and it is a pure waste of money. My hair WASN&#x27;T manageable, moisturized or anything. Since it&#x27;s such a large container I will probably combine it with some other conditioner and use it, but I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an extremly good treatmet for dry hair and also smells good, but you will want to use it 1 or 2 times a week otherwise the hair can get greasy.</li>
            <li> I did think the product was great. BUT is you are sensitive to smell eeek!! It stinks! Like cheap soap! I only use it on weekends when I know I won&#x27;t be leaving anywhere and the smell still gets me in a sour mood.</li>
            <li> Love it left your hair very smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair so this product did magic.it left my hair straight and less knots. The only thing was the scent was very strong and stays on the hair.the shipping process was great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells bad and I do not feel any.  helpful result on my hair. Do not use it at all</li>
            <li> i love it because it not only makes my hair soft, the small is very clean. If you have problems with tangled hair, this will do the trick. I have mixed girl hair since I am half dutch/irish and black. And it makes my hair nice and soft. Don&#x27;t use it every time you wash your hair though. It can build up. Do it every two or three washes &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> i love it is a very good condition make you hair so soft and the smell is very good i recomend it</li>
            <li> Tried for years to find the right product for my Mediterranean hair this is the best product ever!! I love it also bought the leave in  conditioner it&#x27;s great</li>
