    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>For an inexpensive hair oil, I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li>This is very good hair polish for frizzy edges and flyaways.</li>
            <li>I was deliberating on the spray version or this one, and I&#x27;m happy with my choice.</li>
            <li>Great smell.</li>
            <li>Great product for value.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Very nice oil.  </li>
            <li>Dove Oil Care Hair Therapy has a very light, pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Gives a nice shine to hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>loved it and will be ordering some more. :-)</li>
            <li>Love this oil, my hair</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>and this is even better.</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It is certainly better than nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My sister really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Dove does not make my hair look or feel greasy, but rather, smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Great product leaves hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Even hairdresser commented my hair was soft and looked very nice.</li>
            <li>I love this nutrient rich hair product.  </li>
            <li>This gets my tangles out and leaves my hair frizz free.</li>
            <li>compared with Tigi Serum or L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;als Kerastase Oleo - Relax (recommend in the orange bottle) or L&#x27;or D&#x27;Afrique Shine Spray... or Bumble &amp; Bumble Smooth... or Sarah Hershberger Wave Finishing Creme.</li>
            <li>One bottle lasts for several months, so it is a good deal.</li>
            <li>It will make your hair very manageable and I love its smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good basic conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps, but I do have to combine it with a more expensive product for perfect results July/August.</li>
            <li>But I like this product, worth the buy.</li>
            <li>First, this is a STEAL.</li>
            <li>I follow instruction to put it on wet yet hair, and my fingers so easy go through the tangled hair, just like a melted butter!</li>
            <li>It works as well as products that cost 3X as much.</li>
            <li>I have a bob, and I use this liberally - 3 pumps on wet hair, and maybe even 2-3 pumps more midway through drying.</li>
            <li>Much better than expected.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to really improve my wavy hair in its summer frizz and tangles that much...</li>
            <li>I wish it were available locally</li>
            <li>I am thankfull that it is cheap and available through Amazon, it is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great price and it will last me awhile because I only need half of a dime sized amount.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair with a slight wave that gets dry, and I&#x27;m so pleased to find this product after hearing some good reviews on youtube.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li>I use Dove Nourishing Oil Care Hair Therapy after shampooing, and it makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight enough that it tames frizz without weighing hair down.</li>

            <li> The truly natural hair serums are just plain oil which is not good for my fine hair unless I use at night as a treatment .</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really works</li>
            <li> Never leaves hair feeling greasy or flat.  </li>
            <li> and I never look greasy or flat!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sad but this little thing has saved my hair from completely collapsing, it makes it easy to style</li>
            <li> After I applied this, it made my hair look and feel dry.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is damp and dry.</li>
            <li> I use it after washing and conditioning and also on dry hair if needed.</li>
            <li> It can also be applied between shampoos to dry areas.</li>
            <li> : It works for smoothing out and nourishing dry, aging, color-treated hair!</li>
            <li> At $4, slather this stuff on WET hair, blow it dry, and your hair will gleam.</li>
            <li> but since that&#x27;s even harder to order, I use this after the shower, on weekends and when I&#x27;m just pulling my hair up.</li>
            <li> I use much less of it than I use of Moroccan oil to treat my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> : A small one, but I don&#x27;t find as a standalone product that it totally combats summer-humidity-type-frizz.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my neck break out like other oils.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, unlike some other leave in hair oils I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, slowly build it up at the ends!</li>
            <li> It works miracles on my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I still prefer an expensive brand</li>
            <li> Disappointed stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li> hate the oil hair products - tried it but will not buy ever again</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> hate the oil hair products - tried it but will not buy ever again</li>
            <li> I bought this because it got a low score on the &amp;#34;skin deep&amp;#34; website which rates the toxicity of personal care products and cosmetics. It scored a 3 out of a possible 10. The truly natural hair serums are just plain oil which is not good for my fine hair unless I use at night as a treatment . This I can use during the day on the ends and I never look greasy or flat! I definitely recommend this stuff! It&#x27;s also a great price and it will last me awhile because I only need half of a dime sized amount.</li>
            <li> This is very good hair polish for frizzy edges and flyaways.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, my hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel smoother, and look shinier. But doesn&#x27;t do the job when I&#x27;m curling my hair. But I like this product, worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my hair. It left my hair still frenzy. After I applied this, it made my hair look and feel dry. I was very disappointed in this product. I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my hair texture or shine after using this.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil.  Gives a nice shine to hair.  Even hairdresser commented my hair was soft and looked very nice.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It works miracles on my thin hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a life saver, my hair (from coloring and bleaching and coloring back again) has become SO damage it&#x27;s sad but this little thing has saved my hair from completely collapsing, it makes it easy to style and it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it and will be ordering some more. :-)</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with a slight wave that gets dry, and I&#x27;m so pleased to find this product after hearing some good reviews on youtube. It smells decent (a little floral, definitely not overpowering) and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, unlike some other leave in hair oils I&#x27;ve tried! I&#x27;ve also had some more expensive leave in products like from B&amp;B and this is even better. I was deliberating on the spray version or this one, and I&#x27;m happy with my choice. Would definitely repurchase. A little goes a long way, slowly build it up at the ends!</li>
            <li> First, this is a STEAL. It works as well as products that cost 3X as much. It may be that this works just as well as pricier brands, but I always used those sparingly. At $4, slather this stuff on WET hair, blow it dry, and your hair will gleam. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: A small one, but I don&#x27;t find as a standalone product that it totally combats summer-humidity-type-frizz. It helps, but I do have to combine it with a more expensive product for perfect results July/August. It is certainly better than nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It works for smoothing out and nourishing dry, aging, color-treated hair! My hair is getting drier and coarser-feeling as I approach 40. I have a bob, and I use this liberally - 3 pumps on wet hair, and maybe even 2-3 pumps more midway through drying. It will NOT make your hair greasy - but I try to keep it off my roots.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great smell. Disappointed stores don&#x27;t carry it. I use it when my hair is damp and dry.</li>
            <li> This gets my tangles out and leaves my hair frizz free. I am thankfull that it is cheap and available through Amazon, it is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Keeps its promise. Delivers shine and movement. Does not leave hair greasy even when applied generously. Great product for value. Will keep using.</li>
            <li> Much better than expected.  Never leaves hair feeling greasy or flat.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Dove Oil Care Hair Therapy has a very light, pleasant fragrance.  I use much less of it than I use of Moroccan oil to treat my dry hair.  Dove does not make my hair look or feel greasy, but rather, smooth and healthy.  I would recommend it.  One bottle lasts for several months, so it is a good deal.</li>
            <li> It will make your hair very manageable and I love its smell. Don&#x27;t buy the bigger size one, it&#x27;s a totally different product, the water &amp; oil separate.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really works</li>
            <li> A sample in a magazine suckered me into ordering this... it doesn&#x27;t seem to really improve my wavy hair in its summer frizz and tangles that much... compared with Tigi Serum or L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;als Kerastase Oleo - Relax (recommend in the orange bottle) or L&#x27;or D&#x27;Afrique Shine Spray... or Bumble &amp; Bumble Smooth... or Sarah Hershberger Wave Finishing Creme.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves hair feeling soft and frizz-free.  I use it after washing and conditioning and also on dry hair if needed.</li>
            <li> Great product leaves hair very soft and smooth. My sister really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive hair oil, I&#x27;m very happy with this. It&#x27;s light weight enough that it tames frizz without weighing hair down. I still prefer an expensive brand but since that&#x27;s even harder to order, I use this after the shower, on weekends and when I&#x27;m just pulling my hair up. It&#x27;s a good basic conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that this an add on item in Amazon so I have to wait until I&#x27;ve got a qualifying order. I wish it were available locally but everyplace that claims to carry it, in fact does not. I just buy 2-3 at a time now.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Tames and nourishes  hair without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Over time, my hair has become drier. I use Dove Nourishing Oil Care Hair Therapy after shampooing, and it makes my hair feel soft and silky. It can also be applied between shampoos to dry areas.</li>
            <li> I follow instruction to put it on wet yet hair, and my fingers so easy go through the tangled hair, just like a melted butter! I have no grease, no weight, but silky feeling of my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> Nice and it doesn&#x27;t make my neck break out like other oils.</li>
            <li> I love this nutrient rich hair product.  I would have given 5 stars but the pump gets stuck occasionally. I got compliments from others.</li>
            <li> Wonder... Brings hair to life</li>
            <li> Makes my frizzies disappear!</li>
