    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best value that I could find for a lotion with SPF that was not going to be overly scented.</li>
            <li>awesome product...</li>
            <li>shipment great!</li>
            <li>The best thing I can say about this moisturizer is that my woman loves the smell.  </li>

            <li>right?).&lt;br /&gt;This fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Not the best after shave solution, though, as it will sting a bit.</li>
            <li>best because:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>recommendation is to buy both the L&#x27;Oreal and Neutrogena lotions so you can compare them and decide which works best for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely excellent to relief the burning pain and sensation.</li>

            <li>Good after shaving lotion!</li>
            <li>But it applies beautifully so you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re wearing a sunscreen - great to use with street clothes on days when you&#x27;ll in the sun for a couple hours</li>

            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>I started buying it for him seven or eight years ago because it wasn&#x27;t obnoxious scent-wise and was a great value.</li>

            <li>This is actually good for your skin without the sting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not &#x27;botanically based&#x27; like the Arbonne lotion, but it still seems to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>The scent is understated in a good way.  </li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>

            <li>Its good for all seasons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good mix of lotion and sun protection.</li>
            <li>I bought the fist pack of two this spring and now ordered another pack while the price is good.</li>
            <li>The product provides good moisturizing while giving some sunscreen protection.  </li>
            <li>It has a good scent, too.</li>
            <li>Feels good and doesn&#x27;t irritate or clog pores.</li>

            <li>Nice product and nice size for traveling!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use many skin products but this is great after a shave.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing element is well balanced and gives my skin a healthy look and feels great.</li>
            <li>any case, I decided I needed to grow up and start taking care of my skin a bit better and this stuff has been great.  </li>
            <li>I have not found many moisturizers with sunscreen that don&#x27;t clog my pores so this was great</li>
            <li>Works great, too, keeping the sun off his face and hoping to lessen or prevent any more skin cancer problems.</li>
            <li>This product applies nicely with good rub-in.  </li>
            <li>A good, inexpensive and effective product that I plan to keep using.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>SPF 20, great smelling, but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>This takes away any razor burns, soaks in easily, and leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>This face lotion makes my shave so much more pleasant.</li>
            <li>I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice that it has a bit of sunblock effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light!&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Wish it had more of matte finish.but iits good</li>
            <li>Use it every day on my own face.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin stay nice.</li>
            <li>It does the job and comes at a nice price.</li>
            <li>The 20 SPF additive is a nice protective factor.</li>
            <li>it goes on nicely, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sunscreen film at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it has SPF.</li>
            <li>I like how this smells nice and doubles as an aftershave of sorts.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always nice to have some SPF.</li>
            <li>It is smooth,  moisturizing and also has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong though.</li>
            <li>very easy to apply as it&#x27;s quite fluid;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was fine and smelled good</li>
            <li>So far it has been the best face moisturizing lotion for men that he has tried, and with the plus of sun protection.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, thinking he&#x27;d be more apt to remember to put on sunscreen every day.</li>
            <li>So, this product is suitable for him.</li>
            <li>Best face lotion for my sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Smells clean and gives good protection</li>
            <li>Pretty great product.</li>
            <li>It does not cause irritation, and his skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li>Good sunblocker, absorbs quickly too</li>
            <li>triple protection and a great smell............feels truly rich and blends in quickly....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an Arbonne system user for going on four years, but decided to try and find something a bit more affordable.  </li>
            <li>Evidently I&#x27;m ok there as I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  </li>
            <li>It works okay as a form of sun protection</li>
            <li>Great stuff, keeps my mug soft and smooth after a good shave.</li>
            <li>It feels much more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer to me.</li>
            <li>This is really more a con about the package design rather than the product it contains, but there aren&#x27;t many practical ways around this from a manufacturer standpoint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly light and non-greasy, which is nice.     </li>
            <li>I use it every day and it makes my face feel better after shaving.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully you will have better luck.</li>
            <li>and I really love the product.</li>
            <li>The white creamy taste of this face cream is of some of the best quality food I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>Love that there is no greasy feeling on my face after use.</li>
            <li>However, it works better than most sunscreens alone.</li>
            <li>I love using this lotion because it answers two needs in one product.  </li>
            <li>Even the emergency 99-cent body lotion that I bought from walgreens does a better job in terms of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It lasts well and feels refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many face lotions but never tried this one.  </li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>It appeared that my forehead wrinkles looked better after using this product.</li>
            <li>I love the SPF protection and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li>This is a much better price and more conveniently packages with two tubes making up one order.</li>
            <li>Made me realize I better take better care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It , is the better product for men after shave and protect skin</li>
            <li>And, I agree with their claim that your skin also just looks healthier with a better tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I can ask for and more.</li>
            <li>Love the cream..</li>
            <li>love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I can say that this is the most non greasy lotion I have ever come across.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have always been satisfied with the effectiveness for the price.</li>
            <li>The price is a lot better if you order it from Amazon, rather than buying it retail.</li>
            <li>I use a more hydrating formula in the winter.</li>
            <li>The ladies love the scent.</li>
            <li>My face looks more healthier and skin has a better texture.</li>
            <li>otherwise, just ok.</li>
            <li>But still satisfied nonetheless</li>
            <li>We have it on Amazon&#x27;s auto-ship program which makes it even more affordable.</li>
            <li>We LOVE Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>We bought another Neutrogena product for the face - not &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; - and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this product, and I love that it also has an SPF to protect your face from the sun, but I don&#x27;t like how it smells at all.</li>
            <li>After too many years of sun damage and dermatologists burns, I started using this as face cream and SPF each day.  </li>
            <li>I have used this face protect for many year</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li>My face has felt and looked a lot better since I started using it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a neat product :)</li>
            <li>Love that fact that it has SPF built in for added protection.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel and smell</li>
            <li>Nice feature that it has a significant sun screen.</li>
            <li>It is a very light lotion, and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>its pretty good....</li>
            <li>I first bought this for him a couple years ago from Walmart and he loved it.</li>
            <li>If you have razor burn, it will cause further irritation, and not feel very good when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Very moist and not greasy-feels good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of it since it&#x27;s not greasy and applies easily, without smelling girly or</li>
            <li>which is what I prefer, easy to apply and not overly oily or sticky.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy.</li>
            <li>so far this is the best product from the reasonably priced ones that I&#x27;ve tried (price range of $15-$30, I find it impractical to spend loads of money on a moisturiser).</li>
            <li>does it state that there is a strong scent with this product</li>
            <li>Not too strong of a scent.</li>
            <li>The odor on this one was so strong and so lady-like, I could not use it.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is way too strong</li>
            <li>Good value and also highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but unscented would be much better.</li>
            <li>The lotion/suncreen itself is fine.</li>
            <li>After doing a lot of research this product was usually recommended as the best or top 3 of every so called expert that I researched.  </li>
            <li>Using this as an aftershave is fine.</li>
            <li>The best deal I got though was buy one get one half off.</li>
            <li>it is just fine.</li>
            <li>Great facial moisturizer for men.  </li>
            <li>I just talked to Neutrogena customer service and they confirmed that there is no UVA protection in this product (no PA ranking).</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is light and my wife says the scent is manly when she gets close.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he likes how the lotion is smooth, not sticky.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on quite as smoothly as aftershaves without sunscreen.</li>
            <li>; If what you&#x27;re looking for is a quality product to protect your skin from UV this is a fantastic lotion, if you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizing lotion you might want to look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>It is light and non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li>on.light absorbs well light scent.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like anything is on your face, and, just as importantly,  </li>
            <li>He loves it and his feedback is: it&#x27;s smooth and light.</li>
            <li>It gets immediately absorbed by the skin for a refreshing feel.</li>
            <li>He uses it daily and says it goes on great</li>
            <li>Now my skin is smooth and bumb and irritation free.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent and feel of the lotion on my face.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the summer primarily because of the sun protection.</li>
            <li>It is light.  </li>
            <li>works great, SPF is low but it is great for daily use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free and dries non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>This strikes the perfect balance in that it soothes razor irritated skin (I have a heavy beard)</li>
            <li>So far, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Firstly, This lotion is very light and, as the description states, non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Its fragrance is very gentle and refreshing  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel super smooth, and it still has the light, temporary burn of aftershave.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this product and since then my complexion has significantly improved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly and disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has a great masculine smell and is very soothing.</li>
            <li>It far exceeded my expectations and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>it goes on clean, it isn&#x27;t greasy and you can wear it to the office or out on the trails.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great and leaves no trace or greasiness, just keeps your face from being all dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I used other men&#x27;s products before and this is great because not greasy feeling, light and soothes razor burn.</li>
            <li>but ugh I&#x27;m so damn itchy right now!</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice as well, more like a fresh, clean scent rather than a fragrance, and is not very potent so it will not interfere with aftershave or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works great, protects me from the sun, absolutely no grease whatsoever...</li>
            <li>Good product that I use daily.  </li>
            <li>sending the item with its true identification description would have probably made things easier.</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle, so I think it&#x27;s a quality product at a fair price.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice, masculine smell to it, and doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen or perfume at all.</li>
            <li>Actually I did not use it, and my boyfriend says it is good.</li>
            <li>Its not bad at all, to me, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong in its cologne odor.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I stopped shaving a while back but kept using it because of how light and effective it was</li>
            <li>If you prefer fragrance-free or mildly scented products, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Mild smell.</li>
            <li>Luckily I know someone who doesn&#x27;t mind the smell though.</li>
            <li>I really liked this moisturizer until I realized that it doesn&#x27;t offer broad spectrum SPF</li>
            <li>Like the other individual stated, this does in fact have a strong scent and if you want to smell good, you might prefer your own cologne, not in the form of a face lotion.</li>
            <li>This Neutrogena face lotion is pretty good, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is a great for everyday sun protection particularly if you need to protect the top of your head as I do.  </li>
            <li>While it smells nice, it leaves my face feeling very dry and easily cracked.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent at all, which is fine.  </li>
            <li>in regards to this specific product, I did think it applies very light and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very well into the skin and leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for everyday use.</li>
            <li>This is MUCH better than splashing on an alcohol product that stings and dries your skin making you look old and haggard.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I should have paid more attention, but nonetheless, considering the price, I expected more.  </li>
            <li>but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend burts bees moisturizer because it makes your skin feel soft and healthy as ever.</li>
            <li>Make you feel younger and has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>Keeps face moisten and feeling fresh all day plus it acts as a sun block.</li>
            <li>Outstanding, high quality and soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li>and it is absorbed very quickly into the skin so that the skin is moisturized, but not slick or greasy.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>We now have guidelines in place to determine if we have the right lotion.</li>
            <li>I apply it right right after shaving to prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li>This lotion soothes dry skin but does not make your face feel oily like most face lotions!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all fine and dandy until you flip the bottle over only to read the fine print on the reverse side where it is revealed that (emphasis mine):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thinner lotion, which I prefer, spreads easily and smells good - meaning men will like it or at least not mind it.</li>
            <li>SPF little low for summers but a perfect after shave lotion and winter protection.</li>
            <li>packing is nice and simple and to top it all, it lasts quite long</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;4. very reasonable priced&lt;br /&gt;5. and of course, keeps my face moisturised together with sun protection</li>
            <li>it helps my face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i was after.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Its definitely pricier than just about anything out there, but its saved me many a sunburn and helps prevent ingrowns after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have consistently used this product for years, mostly after shaving but on my entire face.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>They should say UVA UVB wide spectrum in order to be effective.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it is quickly absorbed and leaves no shine or residue.  </li>
            <li>Not so sure about moisturizer, I use a different lotion at night.</li>
            <li>I actually like it more than the AofS lotions I used to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>love that each bottle is only 1.5 ounces so you can travel with it without checking in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40+ years old and have had recurring occasional mild acne most of my life.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch of different brands, specifically those for men, but none have been better than this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how effective this inexpensive lotion is both as I hike in sunlight and just as facial skin treat at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Really, how many men would actually apply sunscreen to face after shaving if this product did not contain sunscreen?</li>
            <li>The good quality creams use the more expensive zinc oxide or titanium dioxide which doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin as Oxybenzone does.</li>
            <li>The scent is so light that you can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs easily and actually moisturizes the skin!</li>
            <li>As a guy, I didn&#x27;t want a facial moisturizer that smelled like strong perfume or sun screen, and this product fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that strong so that it&#x27;s the only thing you smell all day.</li>
            <li>I also like it because it provide a certain level of sun protection.</li>
            <li>Although, its lack of &amp;#34;defining&amp;#34; scent is certainly preferable to adding a scent that makes it unusable for some people.  </li>
            <li>The first time I put in on, she immediately asked what I was wearing, with a big smile, and well that ended up making it worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Great product that moisturized newly shaves face skin without burning or getting too thick.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your face look like a vampire&#x27;s pale face, but it does help your shave look slightly better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product but not exceptional and does not, for me, represent good value for money, in it&#x27;s small size.</li>
            <li>This is a nice alternative to more expensive lotions.</li>
            <li>This is what a MAN really needs after a shave.</li>
            <li>I was really looking to stay in the SPF 8-15 range.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Very neutral when it comes to fragrance</li>
            <li>Then I read that if you put moisturizer on your face, your face won&#x27;t need to produce as much oil.</li>
            <li>My husband used to get a lot of bumps not so much now.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t much of a lotion guy, but when my father repeatedly had to have skin cancer areas looked at, I found this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and this really helps.</li>
            <li>So I am guy, and I really don&#x27;t care about lotions and potions.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Triple Protect Face Lotion for Men gently moisturizes my face after my shave.</li>
            <li>I have always used Neutrogena products because their primary focus is the overall health of one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a novice at this whole sunscreen/block stuff.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this product so much that he orders it in bulk.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is a bit much for my liking.</li>
            <li>Too much fragrance in this product.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>This, however, works very well.  </li>
            <li>as a bonus, the price is really for for 2 of them</li>
            <li>hubby really likes the scent.</li>
            <li>This product goes on very well.  </li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant, but subtle smell.</li>
            <li>Despite the high spf, it goes on easy even with facial hair and it not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>(And of course there&#x27;s other products out there that offer much more without the oxy-whatever.)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>decent product and reasonable</li>
            <li>I use this as part of my daily regimen, goes on nice and clear and provides the necessary SPF to protect the face from aging.</li>
            <li>but if you have light dry skin this should do the trick</li>
            <li>Particularly one that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling after use.  </li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is expensive but light and effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s face lotion, and its decently priced.  </li>
            <li>available in a single pack:</li>
            <li>Perhaps it will function better to prevent damage, but I&#x27;ve been using it more as a sunscreen and on days I feel a little dried out, which isn&#x27;t very often.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend a try if you are looking for an aftershave.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this face lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It has a little more fragrance than I like.  </li>
            <li>Goes on a little greasy but this is one of my favorite lotions for being outdoors.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally I&#x27;ll accidentally pick up this product at the store when attempting to purchase the following product: &amp;#34;Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Oil Free Moisture, SPF 30, 1.7 Ounce&amp;#34; (a five star product by the way) because the packaging is very similar and easy to confuse if you&#x27;re not paying attention.</li>
            <li>The other nice thing, from my completely unexpected and unbiased opinion, is it really made my skin nicer and younger looking.  </li>
            <li>so my razor provides a very close shave while stripping my face of its natural oils.</li>
            <li>nearly everything I tried felt very greasy and didn&#x27;t absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I normally buy this lotion from rite aid, target or whichever store is having a sale.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s fine lotion.</li>
            <li>So most products left me trying to balance breakouts with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I still apply sunscreen if I&#x27;m outside for long periods, but this is nice for daily protection.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado Springs and spend a lot of time outdoors - the SPF helps.</li>
            <li>New item and delivered on time.  </li>
            <li>but I live in LA and is sort of mandatory to protect your skin.</li>
            <li>Disappointing in that this lotion really does a great job in the after-shave uses that it is touted for.</li>
            <li>Also has a nice subtle scent to compliment.</li>
            <li>Price: Very reasonable price especially for 2 bottles in one&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, the first time i tried it, my girlfriend gave me a hug and immediately pulled back and said \\&quot;What are you wearing?</li>
            <li>Not cheap but worth the money (unlike many other lotions)</li>
            <li>Smells like a light cologne instead of typically flowery smelling lotion.  </li>
            <li>As with most, if not all, Neutrogena products, it beats similar brands hands down.  </li>
            <li>The lotion has kept my face smooth, especially during the winter when the heat tends to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Typically clearly labeled on the box and or product.  </li>
            <li>Hydrates skin for the whole(!)</li>
            <li>It is much easier on my face than any of the regular aftershaves I have used.  </li>
            <li>Any skin irritation I may encounter after shaving is completely relieved with this product.</li>
            <li>The SPF really works well, living in Florida is solid proof.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it still caused issues.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me looking like a young Mickey Rorke...</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and looking natural.</li>
            <li>This product really relieved my irritated and red skin from shaving.</li>
            <li>I really the multi applications of this lotion, especially the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My face is sensitive to shaving and this lotion helps.  </li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t a complete turn off for me after reading about the concerns, but what the heck why take the chance.</li>
            <li>Also has a masculine smell</li>
            <li>I look young for my age,</li>
            <li>It goes on well, has no oily residue, soothes the skin and makes it soft.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>This product works well on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It must be the fragrance because I did not apply the lotion near my eyes.</li>
            <li>However, this one I like even more because it costs a little less and seems to smell a little better.</li>
            <li>tolerance for greasy lotions is very low, which is why my hands are pretty dry, and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Not sure how to rate this.. Was finally able to start using this today and as I put it on, I began to build red patches on my face!  </li>
            <li>Broad Spectrum offers both UVA &amp; UVB protection...</li>
            <li>However, the smell is masculine and only going to be noticed if someone is very close, such as a hug.</li>
            <li>; grey tube without much decor.  </li>
            <li>it brought me back to normal.</li>
            <li>When I looked it up through Amazon, I found the same lotion in a two pack for what I normally pay for one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically you should be looking for a sunscreen that&#x27;s BROAD SPECTRUM.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets dried out and flaky in certain areas of my face after a certain amount of shaving, washing, daily life, etc.  </li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t know, maybe make a second iteration, like how head and shoulders now has an old spice scented</li>
            <li>My old tube says only uva/uvb</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT SKIN CANCER OR EARLY SKIN</li>
            <li>Not oily and barely any smell.  </li>
            <li>With daily use my skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, but way to expensive.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of facial moisturisers as my face gets so dry from the toners I use for my really oily face.</li>
            <li>The trade-off to this is that it doesn&#x27;t spread very well in comparison to other \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot; lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and the bottle is very small.</li>
            <li>As an avid Art of Shaving user, I spent years using their facial creams as my default daily facial lotion.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face feeling clean due to less oil residue.</li>
            <li>Other reviews have complained about the lotion&#x27;s fragrance, and while there is a noticeable scent I don&#x27;t think it is as overwhelming as others have claimed.</li>
            <li>Also, I am surprised how long one application lasts for me.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not an excuse for being an ignorant old wrinkly man</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that the amount you receive is worth the price tag.  </li>
            <li>Never really put the spf to the test, but I live in Phoenix and haven&#x27;t gotten burned so that&#x27;s something.</li>
            <li>Aside from applying it in these areas, I also use it when my razor is starting to get dull and causes irritation, which this soothes quickly.</li>
            <li>A little early to tell, but so far it seems as advertised.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Best value that I could find for a lotion with SPF that was not going to be overly scented.</li>

            <li> Fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Not the best after shave solution, though, as it will sting a bit.</li>
            <li> best because:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> recommendation is to buy both the L&#x27;Oreal and Neutrogena lotions so you can compare them and decide which works best for you.</li>

            <li> Good after shaving lotion!</li>
            <li> But it applies beautifully so you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re wearing a sunscreen - great to use with street clothes on days when you&#x27;ll in the sun for a couple hours</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s probably not &#x27;botanically based&#x27; like the Arbonne lotion, but it still seems to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> The scent is understated in a good way.  </li>

            <li> I bought the fist pack of two this spring and now ordered another pack while the price is good.</li>
            <li> The product provides good moisturizing while giving some sunscreen protection.  </li>
            <li> It has a good scent, too.</li>
            <li> Feels good and doesn&#x27;t irritate or clog pores.</li>
            <li> does a fair job in keeping my face hydrated.</li>
            <li> Does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion/sunscreen to keep in your bag for emergencies</li>
            <li> Smells good and is not greasy...</li>
            <li> Its a good lotion that protects from sun while not letting an oily feel.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s all good too.  </li>
            <li> Good to go.</li>
            <li> Fiance says it smells really good</li>
            <li> It also works as a good after shave.</li>
            <li> Good product for its price.</li>
            <li> (I have fair skin)</li>
            <li> Nice product and nice size for traveling!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use many skin products but this is great after a shave.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing element is well balanced and gives my skin a healthy look and feels great.</li>
            <li> any case, I decided I needed to grow up and start taking care of my skin a bit better and this stuff has been great.  </li>
            <li> I have not found many moisturizers with sunscreen that don&#x27;t clog my pores so this was great</li>
            <li> Works great, too, keeping the sun off his face and hoping to lessen or prevent any more skin cancer problems.</li>
            <li> This product applies nicely with good rub-in.  </li>
            <li> A good, inexpensive and effective product that I plan to keep using.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> SPF 20, great smelling, but not too strong.  </li>
            <li> This takes away any razor burns, soaks in easily, and leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> This face lotion makes my shave so much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees and liked it.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice that it has a bit of sunblock effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light!&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Wish it had more of matte finish.but iits good</li>
            <li> Use it every day on my own face.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin stay nice.</li>
            <li> It does the job and comes at a nice price.</li>
            <li> The 20 SPF additive is a nice protective factor.</li>
            <li> it goes on nicely, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sunscreen film at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it has SPF.</li>
            <li> I like how this smells nice and doubles as an aftershave of sorts.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always nice to have some SPF.</li>
            <li> It is smooth,  moisturizing and also has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong though.</li>
            <li> very easy to apply as it&#x27;s quite fluid;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was fine and smelled good</li>
            <li> So far it has been the best face moisturizing lotion for men that he has tried, and with the plus of sun protection.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, thinking he&#x27;d be more apt to remember to put on sunscreen every day.</li>
            <li> So, this product is suitable for him.</li>
            <li> Best face lotion for my sensitive face.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Smells clean and gives good protection</li>
            <li> Pretty great product.</li>
            <li> It does not cause irritation, and his skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> Good sunblocker, absorbs quickly too</li>
            <li> triple protection and a great smell............feels truly rich and blends in quickly....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an Arbonne system user for going on four years, but decided to try and find something a bit more affordable.  </li>
            <li> Evidently I&#x27;m ok there as I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  </li>
            <li> It works okay as a form of sun protection</li>
            <li> Great stuff, keeps my mug soft and smooth after a good shave.</li>
            <li> It feels much more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer to me.</li>
            <li> This is really more a con about the package design rather than the product it contains, but there aren&#x27;t many practical ways around this from a manufacturer standpoint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly light and non-greasy, which is nice.     </li>
            <li> I use it every day and it makes my face feel better after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully you will have better luck.</li>
            <li> and I really love the product.</li>
            <li> The white creamy taste of this face cream is of some of the best quality food I have ever found.  </li>
            <li> Love that there is no greasy feeling on my face after use.</li>
            <li> However, it works better than most sunscreens alone.</li>
            <li> I love using this lotion because it answers two needs in one product.  </li>
            <li> Even the emergency 99-cent body lotion that I bought from walgreens does a better job in terms of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It lasts well and feels refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many face lotions but never tried this one.  </li>
            <li> I really love it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> It appeared that my forehead wrinkles looked better after using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the SPF protection and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li> This is a much better price and more conveniently packages with two tubes making up one order.</li>
            <li> Made me realize I better take better care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> It , is the better product for men after shave and protect skin</li>
            <li> And, I agree with their claim that your skin also just looks healthier with a better tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I can ask for and more.</li>
            <li> Love the cream..</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I can say that this is the most non greasy lotion I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have always been satisfied with the effectiveness for the price.</li>
            <li> The price is a lot better if you order it from Amazon, rather than buying it retail.</li>
            <li> I use a more hydrating formula in the winter.</li>
            <li> The ladies love the scent.</li>
            <li> My face looks more healthier and skin has a better texture.</li>
            <li> otherwise, just ok.</li>
            <li> But still satisfied nonetheless</li>
            <li> We have it on Amazon&#x27;s auto-ship program which makes it even more affordable.</li>
            <li> We LOVE Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> We bought another Neutrogena product for the face - not &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; - and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this product, and I love that it also has an SPF to protect your face from the sun, but I don&#x27;t like how it smells at all.</li>
            <li> After too many years of sun damage and dermatologists burns, I started using this as face cream and SPF each day.  </li>
            <li> I have used this face protect for many year</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> My face has felt and looked a lot better since I started using it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a neat product :)</li>
            <li> Love that fact that it has SPF built in for added protection.  </li>
            <li> Love the feel and smell</li>
            <li> Nice feature that it has a significant sun screen.</li>
            <li> It is a very light lotion, and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> its pretty good....</li>
            <li> I first bought this for him a couple years ago from Walmart and he loved it.</li>
            <li> If you have razor burn, it will cause further irritation, and not feel very good when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Very moist and not greasy-feels good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of it since it&#x27;s not greasy and applies easily, without smelling girly or</li>
            <li> which is what I prefer, easy to apply and not overly oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> Easy peasy.</li>
            <li> so far this is the best product from the reasonably priced ones that I&#x27;ve tried (price range of $15-$30, I find it impractical to spend loads of money on a moisturiser).</li>
            <li> does it state that there is a strong scent with this product</li>
            <li> Not too strong of a scent.</li>
            <li> The odor on this one was so strong and so lady-like, I could not use it.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is way too strong</li>
            <li> Good value and also highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but unscented would be much better.</li>
            <li> The lotion/suncreen itself is fine.</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of research this product was usually recommended as the best or top 3 of every so called expert that I researched.  </li>
            <li> Using this as an aftershave is fine.</li>
            <li> The best deal I got though was buy one get one half off.</li>
            <li> it is just fine.</li>
            <li> Great facial moisturizer for men.  </li>
            <li> I just talked to Neutrogena customer service and they confirmed that there is no UVA protection in this product (no PA ranking).</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is light and my wife says the scent is manly when she gets close.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes how the lotion is smooth, not sticky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on quite as smoothly as aftershaves without sunscreen.</li>
            <li> ; If what you&#x27;re looking for is a quality product to protect your skin from UV this is a fantastic lotion, if you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizing lotion you might want to look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> It is light and non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li> on.light absorbs well light scent.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like anything is on your face, and, just as importantly,  </li>
            <li> He loves it and his feedback is: it&#x27;s smooth and light.</li>
            <li> It gets immediately absorbed by the skin for a refreshing feel.</li>
            <li> He uses it daily and says it goes on great</li>
            <li> Now my skin is smooth and bumb and irritation free.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent and feel of the lotion on my face.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the summer primarily because of the sun protection.</li>
            <li> It is light.  </li>
            <li> works great, SPF is low but it is great for daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free and dries non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> This strikes the perfect balance in that it soothes razor irritated skin (I have a heavy beard)</li>
            <li> So far, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Firstly, This lotion is very light and, as the description states, non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Its fragrance is very gentle and refreshing  </li>
            <li> Makes my face feel super smooth, and it still has the light, temporary burn of aftershave.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this product and since then my complexion has significantly improved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on smoothly and disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has a great masculine smell and is very soothing.</li>
            <li> It far exceeded my expectations and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> it goes on clean, it isn&#x27;t greasy and you can wear it to the office or out on the trails.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great and leaves no trace or greasiness, just keeps your face from being all dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I used other men&#x27;s products before and this is great because not greasy feeling, light and soothes razor burn.</li>
            <li> but ugh I&#x27;m so damn itchy right now!</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice as well, more like a fresh, clean scent rather than a fragrance, and is not very potent so it will not interfere with aftershave or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works great, protects me from the sun, absolutely no grease whatsoever...</li>
            <li> Good product that I use daily.  </li>
            <li> sending the item with its true identification description would have probably made things easier.</li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle, so I think it&#x27;s a quality product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice, masculine smell to it, and doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen or perfume at all.</li>
            <li> Actually I did not use it, and my boyfriend says it is good.</li>
            <li> Its not bad at all, to me, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong in its cologne odor.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I stopped shaving a while back but kept using it because of how light and effective it was</li>
            <li> If you prefer fragrance-free or mildly scented products, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Mild smell.</li>
            <li> Luckily I know someone who doesn&#x27;t mind the smell though.</li>
            <li> I really liked this moisturizer until I realized that it doesn&#x27;t offer broad spectrum SPF</li>
            <li> Like the other individual stated, this does in fact have a strong scent and if you want to smell good, you might prefer your own cologne, not in the form of a face lotion.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena face lotion is pretty good, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is a great for everyday sun protection particularly if you need to protect the top of your head as I do.  </li>
            <li> While it smells nice, it leaves my face feeling very dry and easily cracked.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent at all, which is fine.  </li>
            <li> in regards to this specific product, I did think it applies very light and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very well into the skin and leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This is MUCH better than splashing on an alcohol product that stings and dries your skin making you look old and haggard.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I should have paid more attention, but nonetheless, considering the price, I expected more.  </li>
            <li> but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend burts bees moisturizer because it makes your skin feel soft and healthy as ever.</li>
            <li> Make you feel younger and has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> Keeps face moisten and feeling fresh all day plus it acts as a sun block.</li>
            <li> Outstanding, high quality and soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li> and it is absorbed very quickly into the skin so that the skin is moisturized, but not slick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> We now have guidelines in place to determine if we have the right lotion.</li>
            <li> I apply it right right after shaving to prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li> This lotion soothes dry skin but does not make your face feel oily like most face lotions!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all fine and dandy until you flip the bottle over only to read the fine print on the reverse side where it is revealed that (emphasis mine):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thinner lotion, which I prefer, spreads easily and smells good - meaning men will like it or at least not mind it.</li>
            <li> SPF little low for summers but a perfect after shave lotion and winter protection.</li>
            <li> packing is nice and simple and to top it all, it lasts quite long</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;4. very reasonable priced&lt;br /&gt;5. and of course, keeps my face moisturised together with sun protection</li>
            <li> it helps my face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i was after.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Its definitely pricier than just about anything out there, but its saved me many a sunburn and helps prevent ingrowns after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have consistently used this product for years, mostly after shaving but on my entire face.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> They should say UVA UVB wide spectrum in order to be effective.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it is quickly absorbed and leaves no shine or residue.  </li>
            <li> Not so sure about moisturizer, I use a different lotion at night.</li>
            <li> I actually like it more than the AofS lotions I used to use&lt;br</li>
            <li> love that each bottle is only 1.5 ounces so you can travel with it without checking in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40+ years old and have had recurring occasional mild acne most of my life.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch of different brands, specifically those for men, but none have been better than this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how effective this inexpensive lotion is both as I hike in sunlight and just as facial skin treat at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Really, how many men would actually apply sunscreen to face after shaving if this product did not contain sunscreen?</li>
            <li> The good quality creams use the more expensive zinc oxide or titanium dioxide which doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin as Oxybenzone does.</li>
            <li> The scent is so light that you can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs easily and actually moisturizes the skin!</li>
            <li> As a guy, I didn&#x27;t want a facial moisturizer that smelled like strong perfume or sun screen, and this product fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that strong so that it&#x27;s the only thing you smell all day.</li>
            <li> I also like it because it provide a certain level of sun protection.</li>
            <li> Although, its lack of &amp;#34;defining&amp;#34; scent is certainly preferable to adding a scent that makes it unusable for some people.  </li>
            <li> The first time I put in on, she immediately asked what I was wearing, with a big smile, and well that ended up making it worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Great product that moisturized newly shaves face skin without burning or getting too thick.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your face look like a vampire&#x27;s pale face, but it does help your shave look slightly better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but not exceptional and does not, for me, represent good value for money, in it&#x27;s small size.</li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative to more expensive lotions.</li>
            <li> This is what a MAN really needs after a shave.</li>
            <li> I was really looking to stay in the SPF 8-15 range.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Very neutral when it comes to fragrance</li>
            <li> Then I read that if you put moisturizer on your face, your face won&#x27;t need to produce as much oil.</li>
            <li> My husband used to get a lot of bumps not so much now.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t much of a lotion guy, but when my father repeatedly had to have skin cancer areas looked at, I found this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and this really helps.</li>
            <li> So I am guy, and I really don&#x27;t care about lotions and potions.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Triple Protect Face Lotion for Men gently moisturizes my face after my shave.</li>
            <li> I have always used Neutrogena products because their primary focus is the overall health of one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice at this whole sunscreen/block stuff.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this product so much that he orders it in bulk.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is a bit much for my liking.</li>
            <li> Too much fragrance in this product.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> This, however, works very well.  </li>
            <li> as a bonus, the price is really for for 2 of them</li>
            <li> hubby really likes the scent.</li>
            <li> This product goes on very well.  </li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant, but subtle smell.</li>
            <li> Despite the high spf, it goes on easy even with facial hair and it not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> (And of course there&#x27;s other products out there that offer much more without the oxy-whatever.)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> decent product and reasonable</li>
            <li> I use this as part of my daily regimen, goes on nice and clear and provides the necessary SPF to protect the face from aging.</li>
            <li> but if you have light dry skin this should do the trick</li>
            <li> Particularly one that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling after use.  </li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is expensive but light and effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s face lotion, and its decently priced.  </li>
            <li> available in a single pack:</li>
            <li> Perhaps it will function better to prevent damage, but I&#x27;ve been using it more as a sunscreen and on days I feel a little dried out, which isn&#x27;t very often.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend a try if you are looking for an aftershave.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this face lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It has a little more fragrance than I like.  </li>
            <li> Goes on a little greasy but this is one of my favorite lotions for being outdoors.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ll accidentally pick up this product at the store when attempting to purchase the following product: &amp;#34;Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Oil Free Moisture, SPF 30, 1.7 Ounce&amp;#34; (a five star product by the way) because the packaging is very similar and easy to confuse if you&#x27;re not paying attention.</li>
            <li> The other nice thing, from my completely unexpected and unbiased opinion, is it really made my skin nicer and younger looking.  </li>
            <li> so my razor provides a very close shave while stripping my face of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> nearly everything I tried felt very greasy and didn&#x27;t absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I normally buy this lotion from rite aid, target or whichever store is having a sale.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s fine lotion.</li>
            <li> So most products left me trying to balance breakouts with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I still apply sunscreen if I&#x27;m outside for long periods, but this is nice for daily protection.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado Springs and spend a lot of time outdoors - the SPF helps.</li>
            <li> New item and delivered on time.  </li>
            <li> but I live in LA and is sort of mandatory to protect your skin.</li>
            <li> Disappointing in that this lotion really does a great job in the after-shave uses that it is touted for.</li>
            <li> Also has a nice subtle scent to compliment.</li>
            <li> Price: Very reasonable price especially for 2 bottles in one&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, the first time i tried it, my girlfriend gave me a hug and immediately pulled back and said \\&quot;What are you wearing?</li>
            <li> Not cheap but worth the money (unlike many other lotions)</li>
            <li> Smells like a light cologne instead of typically flowery smelling lotion.  </li>
            <li> As with most, if not all, Neutrogena products, it beats similar brands hands down.  </li>
            <li> The lotion has kept my face smooth, especially during the winter when the heat tends to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Typically clearly labeled on the box and or product.  </li>
            <li> Hydrates skin for the whole(!)</li>
            <li> It is much easier on my face than any of the regular aftershaves I have used.  </li>
            <li> Any skin irritation I may encounter after shaving is completely relieved with this product.</li>
            <li> The SPF really works well, living in Florida is solid proof.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it still caused issues.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me looking like a young Mickey Rorke...</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and looking natural.</li>
            <li> This product really relieved my irritated and red skin from shaving.</li>
            <li> I really the multi applications of this lotion, especially the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My face is sensitive to shaving and this lotion helps.  </li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t a complete turn off for me after reading about the concerns, but what the heck why take the chance.</li>
            <li> Also has a masculine smell</li>
            <li> I look young for my age,</li>
            <li> It goes on well, has no oily residue, soothes the skin and makes it soft.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This product works well on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It must be the fragrance because I did not apply the lotion near my eyes.</li>
            <li> However, this one I like even more because it costs a little less and seems to smell a little better.</li>
            <li> tolerance for greasy lotions is very low, which is why my hands are pretty dry, and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate this.. Was finally able to start using this today and as I put it on, I began to build red patches on my face!  </li>
            <li> Broad Spectrum offers both UVA &amp; UVB protection...</li>
            <li> However, the smell is masculine and only going to be noticed if someone is very close, such as a hug.</li>
            <li> ; grey tube without much decor.  </li>
            <li> it brought me back to normal.</li>
            <li> When I looked it up through Amazon, I found the same lotion in a two pack for what I normally pay for one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically you should be looking for a sunscreen that&#x27;s BROAD SPECTRUM.  </li>
            <li> My skin gets dried out and flaky in certain areas of my face after a certain amount of shaving, washing, daily life, etc.  </li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t know, maybe make a second iteration, like how head and shoulders now has an old spice scented</li>
            <li> My old tube says only uva/uvb</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT SKIN CANCER OR EARLY SKIN</li>
            <li> Not oily and barely any smell.  </li>
            <li> With daily use my skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, but way to expensive.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of facial moisturisers as my face gets so dry from the toners I use for my really oily face.</li>
            <li> The trade-off to this is that it doesn&#x27;t spread very well in comparison to other \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot; lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and the bottle is very small.</li>
            <li> As an avid Art of Shaving user, I spent years using their facial creams as my default daily facial lotion.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face feeling clean due to less oil residue.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have complained about the lotion&#x27;s fragrance, and while there is a noticeable scent I don&#x27;t think it is as overwhelming as others have claimed.</li>
            <li> Also, I am surprised how long one application lasts for me.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not an excuse for being an ignorant old wrinkly man</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that the amount you receive is worth the price tag.  </li>
            <li> Never really put the spf to the test, but I live in Phoenix and haven&#x27;t gotten burned so that&#x27;s something.</li>
            <li> Aside from applying it in these areas, I also use it when my razor is starting to get dull and causes irritation, which this soothes quickly.</li>
            <li> A little early to tell, but so far it seems as advertised.</li>
            <li> So, i was looking to get a reasonably priced lotion that was not strong smelling and had SPF.</li>
            <li> The skin on my nose and on each side is abnormally dry, requiring daily use of a lotion else it will turn red and flake off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff daily for a long time...</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer dry and the SPF 20 is enough to keep the UV rays to a minimum.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my face skin moisturize throughout the day (especially in the morning after shaving and washing my face i would get dry skin).  </li>
            <li> I use it every single day to do my entire face and the two bottles have lasted me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it although he has tried other brand names and more expensive products.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;- Small, compact, flat packaging wastes little space and easily fits in backpack / toiletry bag etc.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Triple Protect&amp;#34; lotion has an inordinate amount of very strong fragrance that I personally find pretty disgusting.</li>
            <li> The cystic acne that I&#x27;ve developed in the past was actually caused by diary products.</li>
            <li> Long time user of this stuff (10 years?).</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a combo aftershave/SPF product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few months, so far I believe it is the lotion I am looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I tend to turn pink if left in the sun for 5 minutes so</li>
            <li> About 20 seconds, if that long, after application you can&#x27;t even tell it has been applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wear this at the beach, but for daily use.. no thanks.</li>
            <li> The fact that this lotion contains sunscreen demonstrates their focus on long term skin health.</li>
            <li> This product also stings a little bit, perhaps due to the high alcohol content.</li>
            <li> I do see my skin less dry (especially around the nose area) and it has actually gotten rid of my acne a bit ;o</li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s very fluid, a little amount goes a long way - I think one bottle will last me 3 months of once a day</li>
            <li> and it does contain SPF, but all other claims are a bit unclear such as &#x27;reducing the signs of aging&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> For dry skin, this isn&#x27;t the solution.</li>
            <li> I have a dry face</li>
            <li> so I always tried to keep my face dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I use this every morning to protect against the sun and prevent dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and it has both helped with dry skin and helped with sun protection with the SPF 20 protection.</li>
            <li> Was having dry patches around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> If you have severe dry skin I would not recommend this</li>
            <li> Self proclaiming to guard the skin via soothing razor irritation, healing dry skin, and helping to fight the signs of aging with its SPF 20 sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li> and I do not have dry skin all day.</li>
            <li> My skin gets dry after the shower.  </li>
            <li> Removes razor burn and keeps my skin from getting dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I have really dark facial hair, and it looks like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow even after I shave.</li>
            <li> Pretty thin and didn&#x27;t feel like it lasted</li>
            <li> Although it claims not to sting, I have noticed a -very slight- stinging sensation for a few seconds when applied to a very dry or very irritated area.</li>
            <li> Quite simply, this one let us down.  </li>
            <li> This lotion slightly masks my shadow with it&#x27;s white tint.</li>
            <li> I like the little bit of extra SPF protection.</li>
            <li> It is a little thick and doesnt seem to cover much, but it provides protection though the workday.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell, bad, but doesn&#x27;t smell appealing.</li>
            <li> Well not really the cure, but</li>
            <li> I must have aged a year for every month.</li>
            <li> I can put this on before starting a round of golf and not get burnt without having to reapply.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena has been in the news over it&#x27;s alleged sun screens and their lack of effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> Really solid everyday men&#x27;s skin care product.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Remember a little bit will go a long way, so this small 1.7oz tube will last longer than you think.</li>
            <li> I think that was due to</li>
            <li> clog pores like other sunscreen would</li>
            <li> What other reason do you need for buying it?</li>
            <li> favorite face lotion for men is: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like some other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Because the water is heavily treated with chlorine, it leaves your face dry.</li>
            <li> This is not the strongest moisturizer, nor is it a serious broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is a very small, much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> So I spent a little time doing some research and combined</li>
            <li> You do not want to use this as a lotion because it doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough (at least not for me).    </li>
            <li> and it claims at least to have the proper sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the scent.  </li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;ll keep the cap/top point down and swing my arm around using circumferential force to coax the last few drops out.</li>
            <li> Also note that it helps a lot if you store the package standing up with the cap down, rather than lying on its side.</li>
            <li> decades down the road.  </li>
            <li> No funny or fruity smell!</li>
            <li> One is over 50 and the other just 13!</li>
            <li> I use this lotion twice a day in the morning and evening usually before going to bed and my face is feeling dry.</li>
            <li> No more dry, flakey skin.  </li>
            <li> I started using this the past month because my face had started feeling overly dry and</li>
            <li> It makes my face less oily.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight aroma</li>
            <li> Typical &amp;#34;guy&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jack Black for a while</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent that is not overpowering, my girlfriend even enjoys it</li>
            <li> The first thing I need to mention is the disappointment in the size.  </li>
            <li> lotion does smell pretty Brut, so if you want to smell manly, but are afraid that putting on face lotion will distract from that, then I recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels just a little sticky going on.</li>
            <li> For some the price may seem a little steep because you do not get a lot of lotion</li>
            <li> It also helps you look like your shave is a little closer.</li>
            <li> It moistures well and have just a little essence.</li>
            <li> However because of the sun protection my face feels a little oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> burn from blowing it so much when I had a cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> This heavily dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this 2x/day for a few years now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lite and not oily, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My chin was peeling and felt so raw.</li>
            <li> that with a little common knowledge I already have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked like an alien and didn&#x27;t want to leave the house.</li>
            <li> I usually use another Neutrogena lotion that has no scent</li>
            <li> Kinda weird actually because I never thought these &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; potions did anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All you need is a small bead on your finger and then can spread it around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the market this as a men&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> but it is pricey even for 2 small 1.7oz tubes.</li>
            <li> However, it has a very heavy cologne scent that is bothersome.</li>
            <li> This face lotion from neutrogena sooths and moisturizes so hard.</li>
            <li> So it is hard for me to rate.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Been using this every day for at least a year or two now.</li>
            <li> This is just what the doctor ordered (seriously, my doctor said I should get this</li>
            <li> My boyfriend will be deploying soon and is training in very cold temps, he needed something to keep his face soft and protected...</li>
            <li> When lotion runs low (&amp;#60;10% remaining) it can be somewhat annoying to extract the remaining supply.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, you need to use a lot a lot to do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Loves the subtle smell too!</li>
            <li> Disappointed that when you read the back of the bottle it says that it doesn&#x27;t protect you from skin cancer or skin ageing, it merely stops sunburn.</li>
            <li> Aside from arriving even too late for the crazy snow to be an excuse, we opened it up and it smelled terrible.  </li>
            <li> You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> It does have a faint scent.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong here.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in the end, its an expensive product that underwhelms in the skin protection department.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it works.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting AgeFighter, but unfortunately, this arrived, and it is nothing like Age Fighter.</li>
            <li> but it was expensive and didn&#x27;t offer UV</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m just crazy though.</li>
            <li> &quot; part means it stinks like cologne.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it&#x27;s not labeled as scented.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/  not</li>
            <li> annoying, the tube doesn&#x27;t stand up.</li>
            <li> , I dont hate it or like it.  </li>
            <li> and I wish I would have discovered it years ago; along with the fact that diary can be very bad for skin.</li>
            <li> It was the worst week of my life.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use many skin products but this is great after a shave. My skin feels moisturized without any greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Feels great and helps the skin with a sunscreen.  The scent is so light that you can barely smell it.  It absorbs quickly and is not greasy. This is MUCH better than splashing on an alcohol product that stings and dries your skin making you look old and haggard.  This is actually good for your skin without the sting.  This is what a MAN really needs after a shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an Arbonne system user for going on four years, but decided to try and find something a bit more affordable.  This Neutrogena face lotion is pretty good, especially for the price.  It&#x27;s probably not &#x27;botanically based&#x27; like the Arbonne lotion, but it still seems to do a good job.  Two things that caused me to drop a star: 1. It&#x27;s feels just a little sticky going on. 2. It has a little more fragrance than I like.  One feature that could go either way is the sunscreen.  I was really looking to stay in the SPF 8-15 range.  I&#x27;m not a skin expert but Arbonne always taught us that anything over SPF 8 could cause problems.  I think that was due to some people have allergies to the sunscreen.  Evidently I&#x27;m ok there as I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  If you work outside a lot, definitely get this and use it. It should save your skin.</li>
            <li> First off, Neutrogena put such a small (1.7 oz) product in an overly sized box. Anyone else notice this? However I only purchase the pack of 1, not 2 so this might be why.    For dry skin, this isn&#x27;t the solution. It works okay as a form of sun protection but it stops there. You do not want to use this as a lotion because it doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough (at least not for me).    Like the other individual stated, this does in fact have a strong scent and if you want to smell good, you might prefer your own cologne, not in the form of a face lotion. Also, when applied to the face, it just feels like the alcohol content overpowers the moisturizing content.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used lotion with skepticism because I&#x27;ve suffered all my life with acne. i&#x27;ve thought that lotion could be the cause of acne. I&#x27;m now 41 and finally have discovered that lotion is the cure not the cause. Well not really the cure, but it helps my face feel smooth and soft. The cystic acne that I&#x27;ve developed in the past was actually caused by diary products. I wish I had discovered this fact sooner. This lotion helps with overcoming scarring from acne. It makes my face less oily. It keeps my face feeling clean due to less oil residue. I&#x27;m really happy that I discovered with product and I wish I would have discovered it years ago; along with the fact that diary can be very bad for skin.</li>
            <li> Very moist and not greasy-feels good</li>
            <li> Long time user of this stuff (10 years?). I&#x27;ve been a fan of it since it&#x27;s not greasy and applies easily, without smelling girly or like I just spilled a bottle of cologne. It also gives a matte finish, so it doesn&#x27;t look like I have cream all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a fan of the SPF 20, something a lot of after-shave lotions don&#x27;t have. I still apply sunscreen if I&#x27;m outside for long periods, but this is nice for daily protection.</li>
            <li> Good product that I use daily.  Not greasy and has SPF 20 to help with sun exposure. Keeps face moist in winter months.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong though.</li>
            <li> The scent is understated in a good way.  The lotion is not greasy and seems to moisturize.  Best value that I could find for a lotion with SPF that was not going to be overly scented.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, keeps my mug soft and smooth after a good shave. All my wenches agree.</li>
            <li> Great facial moisturizer for men.  No funny or fruity smell!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin burn and leaves me blotchy. It feels much more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer to me.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Hydrates skin for the whole(!) day.&lt;br /&gt;- Small, compact, flat packaging wastes little space and easily fits in backpack / toiletry bag etc.&lt;br /&gt;- Includes SPF. Remember, it takes about 15-30 mins for SPF to actually start working in the vast majority of sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t make skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good. Not girly, just good. Olfactory reviews from the ladies: &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; &amp;#34;so clean&amp;#34; &amp;#34;smells soooo good!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- When lotion runs low (&amp;#60;10% remaining) it can be somewhat annoying to extract the remaining supply. Usually I&#x27;ll keep the cap/top point down and swing my arm around using circumferential force to coax the last few drops out. This is really more a con about the package design rather than the product it contains, but there aren&#x27;t many practical ways around this from a manufacturer standpoint. Also note that it helps a lot if you store the package standing up with the cap down, rather than lying on its side.</li>
            <li> The lotion/suncreen itself is fine. It&#x27;s fairly light and non-greasy, which is nice.     However, it has a very heavy cologne scent that is bothersome. If I wanted to put on perfume/cologne, I would do so separately. Disappointed that it&#x27;s not labeled as scented.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a combo aftershave/SPF product for a long time.  Particularly one that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling after use.  This one fills the bill. It is much easier on my face than any of the regular aftershaves I have used.  It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;dry\\&quot; quite as quickly as a regular product but after a couple of minutes I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s on.  It does have a slight aroma but I find it pleasant and my wife likes it so I consider that a plus.  I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees and liked it.  This product is similar but has the SPF I wanted.</li>
            <li> awesome product...shipment great!</li>
            <li> This was agood deal on a good product. I use it for the daily sun protection. Good after shave feel</li>
            <li> I discovered this during my last deployment to Afghanistan. Because the water is heavily treated with chlorine, it leaves your face dry. I must have aged a year for every month. I started using this it brought me back to normal. I continued to use it after the deployment - the ladies notice. I live in Colorado Springs and spend a lot of time outdoors - the SPF helps. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue either and doesn&#x27;t make you smell \\&quot;pretty.\\&quot; Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I actually look forward to the aftermath of shaving now. Any skin irritation I may encounter after shaving is completely relieved with this product. The moisturizing element is well balanced and gives my skin a healthy look and feels great. Not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> its burn my face.i think one of the ingredient got allergy to me.1st day itself i stop to use.now i am in india.so i cant return this.thanks to amazon to give a chance to review this item.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and it makes my face feel better after shaving.  The SPF really works well, living in Florida is solid proof.</li>
            <li> The first thing I need to mention is the disappointment in the size.  Perhaps I should have paid more attention, but nonetheless, considering the price, I expected more.  The best thing I can say about this moisturizer is that my woman loves the smell.  The first time I put in on, she immediately asked what I was wearing, with a big smile, and well that ended up making it worth the purchase right there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen or felt a big difference using this.  Perhaps it will function better to prevent damage, but I&#x27;ve been using it more as a sunscreen and on days I feel a little dried out, which isn&#x27;t very often.  Hopefully you will have better luck.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and I really love the product. It is not greasy like 90% of the spf face lotions out there. It absorbs very well into the skin and leaves it feeling smooth. I have used many products before but this works the best. For some the price may seem a little steep because you do not get a lot of lotion but it is well worth the price. Also has a nice subtle scent to compliment.</li>
            <li> A little early to tell, but so far it seems as advertised. None of these products seem to be as &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; as they claim to be, however.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch of different brands, specifically those for men, but none have been better than this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! This heavily dried out my skin. It was the worst week of my life. My chin was peeling and felt so raw. I looked like an alien and didn&#x27;t want to leave the house. I would recommend burts bees moisturizer because it makes your skin feel soft and healthy as ever.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling moisturized, but not greasy.  It is a little thick and doesnt seem to cover much, but it provides protection though the workday.  I really like this product.  After doing a lot of research this product was usually recommended as the best or top 3 of every so called expert that I researched.  You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years.  Smells clean and gives good protection</li>
            <li> After receiving this product, I discovered it has parabens in it.  Tossed it.</li>
            <li> Feels good.  Great for after a shave, and I need the sun protection.</li>
            <li> If you are on the line, get it. It moisturizes, it goes through airports, it will last you longer than you think, and did I mention it moisturizes.</li>
            <li> god this stuff is sooooo Good.  I just cant stop eating it!  The white creamy taste of this face cream is of some of the best quality food I have ever found.  Delicious!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few months, so far I believe it is the lotion I am looking for. It is smooth,  moisturizing and also has a pleasant scent. I also like it because it provide a certain level of sun protection.</li>
            <li> Very neutral when it comes to fragrance which is what I prefer, easy to apply and not overly oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> My Husband loves this product, great moisturizer plus sunscreen. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so good! Every use I feel I&#x27;ve lost 10 yrs of age and people begin to call me Brad, as in Pitt or Cooper!</li>
            <li> I have a dry face and sometimes I get flakes. this product heals my face and I&#x27; stop having acne issues.</li>
            <li> Great product that moisturized newly shaves face skin without burning or getting too thick.  Nice feature that it has a significant sun screen.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since years. It feels just perfect after applying. Its good for all seasons. I apply it after shaving as well as after face wash</li>
            <li> A face cream was sent to me,to Italy labeled as Medicine,it has withheld by Italian Customs authority and I havent received it.&lt;br /&gt;Simply sending the item with its true identification description would have probably made things easier.</li>
            <li> So, i was looking to get a reasonably priced lotion that was not strong smelling and had SPF. This is exactly what i was after. It does have a faint scent. However, the smell is masculine and only going to be noticed if someone is very close, such as a hug. That being said, the first time i tried it, my girlfriend gave me a hug and immediately pulled back and said \\&quot;What are you wearing? You smell great!\\&quot; So, female approved. I use it every single day to do my entire face and the two bottles have lasted me about 3 months. You cant go wrong here.</li>
            <li> I just talked to Neutrogena customer service and they confirmed that there is no UVA protection in this product (no PA ranking). I liked this product but now I need to find something else.</li>
            <li> Love that there is no greasy feeling on my face after use.</li>
            <li> I have an oily face and I occasionally break out in pimples. I always thought the pimples were from the oily face so I always tried to keep my face dry. Then I read that if you put moisturizer on your face, your face won&#x27;t need to produce as much oil. So I purchased this product and since then my complexion has significantly improved. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and I&#x27;m very happy with the product. Also, the smell is light and my wife says the scent is manly when she gets close. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes how the lotion is smooth, not sticky. There is no lingering smell, but it does have a pleasant scent. So far it has been the best face moisturizing lotion for men that he has tried, and with the plus of sun protection.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this daily. It&#x27;s lightweight and not greasy. It&#x27;s a good mix of lotion and sun protection. He even uses it as aftershave. It doesn&#x27;t go on quite as smoothly as aftershaves without sunscreen. However, it works better than most sunscreens alone.</li>
            <li> Meh. I have sensitive skin and it still caused issues.  I don&#x27;t see this as being a very good product.</li>
            <li> I love using this lotion because it answers two needs in one product.  After I shave, this lotion calms the razor burn and moisturizes my face in one step.  It leaves my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Protect Face Lotion for about a month now and thought I&#x27;d share my thoughts.   Firstly, This lotion is very light and, as the description states, non-greasy. The trade-off to this is that it doesn&#x27;t spread very well in comparison to other \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot; lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  I feel that this inhibits the lotion&#x27;s ability to moisturize skin. Even the emergency 99-cent body lotion that I bought from walgreens does a better job in terms of moisturizing.  Other reviews have complained about the lotion&#x27;s fragrance, and while there is a noticeable scent I don&#x27;t think it is as overwhelming as others have claimed. It is definitely not a breaking point in the lotion.  Lastly the 1.7 fl. oz bottle can rattle in the box that the lotion is packaged in. I&#x27;m not sure that the amount you receive is worth the price tag.  tldr; If what you&#x27;re looking for is a quality product to protect your skin from UV this is a fantastic lotion, if you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizing lotion you might want to look somewhere else. If price is not a factor, I recommend Kheil&#x27;s Facial Fuel with SPF 15.</li>
            <li> My husband used to get a lot of bumps not so much now.  The product was exactly what I ordered.  New item and delivered on time.  I will purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t much of a lotion guy, but when my father repeatedly had to have skin cancer areas looked at, I found this stuff.  SPF 20, great smelling, but not too strong.  Typical &amp;#34;guy&amp;#34; grey tube without much decor.  leak-proof lid.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion twice a day in the morning and evening usually before going to bed and my face is feeling dry. I stopped shaving a while back but kept using it because of how light and effective it was but if you&#x27;ve shave its an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I bought the fist pack of two this spring and now ordered another pack while the price is good. I like the feeling and it&#x27;s nice that it has a bit of sunblock effect.</li>
            <li> SPF little low for summers but a perfect after shave lotion and winter protection.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a must have for men&#x27;s grooming. I used other men&#x27;s products before and this is great because not greasy feeling, light and soothes razor burn. Only downside is pricey</li>
            <li> The product provides good moisturizing while giving some sunscreen protection.  It lasts well and feels refreshing.  I am pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Great lotion for everyday use. Doesn&#x27;t feel too oily. Has SPF so protects skin from aging.</li>
            <li> I always use this lotion because it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> great men&#x27;s lotion. I found this on amazon searching for a smaller size men&#x27;s lotion that fits in TSA approved travel Ziploc bags. My husband loves it although he has tried other brand names and more expensive products. Loves the subtle smell too!</li>
            <li> triple protection and a great smell............feels truly rich and blends in quickly....signed up for sub. and save</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many face lotions but never tried this one.  I really love it.  Great smell.  It works.</li>
            <li> Have been using this 2x/day for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Great product! As I&#x27;m exposed to the sun on a daily basis the SPF 20 gives me the protection I need.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ll accidentally pick up this product at the store when attempting to purchase the following product: &amp;#34;Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Oil Free Moisture, SPF 30, 1.7 Ounce&amp;#34; (a five star product by the way) because the packaging is very similar and easy to confuse if you&#x27;re not paying attention.This &amp;#34;Triple Protect&amp;#34; lotion has an inordinate amount of very strong fragrance that I personally find pretty disgusting. Other than that, it&#x27;s fine lotion. If you prefer fragrance-free or mildly scented products, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had an aversion to rubbing sunscreen or lotion on my face.  Its something about how the scent just overpowers your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I decided I needed to grow up and start taking care of my skin a bit better and this stuff has been great.  Its definitely pricier than just about anything out there, but its saved me many a sunburn and helps prevent ingrowns after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> Both like this face lotion. One is over 50 and the other just 13! Great purchase. Will buy again soon.</li>
            <li> I use it every day - non greasy and stays on all day. Good value and also highly recommended.Try it.</li>
            <li> Using this as an aftershave is fine. It&#x27;s pretty strong in its cologne odor.&lt;br /&gt;But as a daily face lotion it&#x27;s just ok. Pretty thin and didn&#x27;t feel like it lasted long.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Nivea for men lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most annoying, the tube doesn&#x27;t stand up. It has to be laid on its side as the cap it tiny and unbalanced. Needs a lot of shelf space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how effective this inexpensive lotion is both as I hike in sunlight and just as facial skin treat at the end of the day. I have dry skin and this really helps. Also, I am surprised how long one application lasts for me.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning to protect against the sun and prevent dry skin.  As a guy, I didn&#x27;t want a facial moisturizer that smelled like strong perfume or sun screen, and this product fits the bill.  It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent at all, which is fine.  It is light and non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  This is my third bottle, so I think it&#x27;s a quality product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend will be deploying soon and is training in very cold temps, he needed something to keep his face soft and protected... Seem to work great for him.</li>
            <li> It appeared that my forehead wrinkles looked better after using this product. I think I&#x27;m just crazy though. I&#x27;m going to keep using it though because it affordable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff daily for a long time... I love the SPF protection and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li> This is a really great moisturizer.  It has a good scent, too. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a man just needs to treat his skin as well as it treats him. This face lotion from neutrogena sooths and moisturizes so hard.</li>
            <li> Feels good and doesn&#x27;t irritate or clog pores. I have not found many moisturizers with sunscreen that don&#x27;t clog my pores so this was great</li>
            <li> I have been using this triple protect face lotion with SPF 20 protection for several years now. I had been purchasing this in a Target or grocery store prior to this purchase. This is a much better price and more conveniently packages with two tubes making up one order. I have consistently used this product for years, mostly after shaving but on my entire face. Use a dime size or smaller squeeze and use it all over your face. The lotion has kept my face smooth, especially during the winter when the heat tends to dry out my skin. This is just what the doctor ordered (seriously, my doctor said I should get this and it has both helped with dry skin and helped with sun protection with the SPF 20 protection.</li>
            <li> I use this as a daily lotion in the morning, and I have relatively oily skin but this stuff works great and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin shiny or oily even at the end of the day. It also has a nice, masculine smell to it, and doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen or perfume at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light!&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t clog pores like other sunscreen would</li>
            <li> Was having dry patches around my eyes.  Made me realize I better take better care of my skin.  Goes on nicely, not greasy.  I don&#x27;t mind the scent and don&#x27;t even notice it now.  With daily use my skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li> There are soany choices and soany prices and I have tried.many over the years. Goes on.light absorbs well light scent. Wish it had more of matte finish.but iits good</li>
            <li> Keeps me looking like a young Mickey Rorke... sans botox.</li>
            <li> after trying several products in 2011, I found this one to prevent razor rash on my neck after shaving.  I stopped looking after that.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. I&#x27;ve been using Jack Black for a while and I decided to try this since it was substantially cheaper and it works just as well for me. I have oily skin and it helps with razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Goes on a little greasy but this is one of my favorite lotions for being outdoors.  I can put this on before starting a round of golf and not get burnt without having to reapply.  There is a slight scent that is not overpowering, my girlfriend even enjoys it</li>
            <li> Men do not buy this, it smells like it was made for women.</li>
            <li> Bought this product hoping to replace a more expensive name brand product that got discontinued.  Made me breakout and made me look like I had a rash where ever I applied the product.</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily and actually moisturizes the skin!</li>
            <li> Non greasy which is what I wanted and seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> Use it every day on my own face. The SPF combined with moisturizer is reason I use it. It makes my skin stay nice. I like it.</li>
            <li> Nowhere on the product itself or in the product description online  does it state that there is a strong scent with this product..I usually use another Neutrogena lotion that has no scent but they were out..I gave this a try but had I known about the scent I would have passed..</li>
            <li> Excellent, i have three years using it, and the best prices is always here. It , is the better product for men after shave and protect skin</li>
            <li> This lotion soothes dry skin but does not make your face feel oily like most face lotions! It also helps you look like your shave is a little closer. I have really dark facial hair, and it looks like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow even after I shave. This lotion slightly masks my shadow with it&#x27;s white tint. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. It doesn&#x27;t make your face look like a vampire&#x27;s pale face, but it does help your shave look slightly better!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.  My skin gets dried out and flaky in certain areas of my face after a certain amount of shaving, washing, daily life, etc.  So I need a moisturizer.  But I also always had skin problems of the acne variety.  So most products left me trying to balance breakouts with dry skin.  Same thing for any SPF face products if I were going outside in the sun for long.&lt;br /&gt;Meaning, I needed a non comedogenic (sp?)(doesn&#x27;t clog pores/ cause breakouts) Moisturizer and SPF?  For men (hey, it doesn&#x27;t have to be embarrassing to buy, right?).&lt;br /&gt;This fits the bill perfectly.  I use it after shaving every day.  No more dry, flakey skin.  No breakouts.  Protection from the sun.  And, I agree with their claim that your skin also just looks healthier with a better tone.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and disappears quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like anything is on your face, and, just as importantly,  doesn&#x27;t look like anything is on it either.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought about it before, but after seeing reviews here, I suppose the scent could be improved.  Its not bad at all, to me, but it doesn&#x27;t add to the product.  Although, its lack of &amp;#34;defining&amp;#34; scent is certainly preferable to adding a scent that makes it unusable for some people.  So, I don&#x27;t know, maybe make a second iteration, like how head and shoulders now has an old spice scented shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great product.  Fits the bill perfectly.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It does the job and comes at a nice price.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate this.. Was finally able to start using this today and as I put it on, I began to build red patches on my face!  And it&#x27;s itchy!  I&#x27;ve never been allergic to anything in my life &#x3D;/  not the products fault I guess, but ugh I&#x27;m so damn itchy right now!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel great without any oiliness or scents. The 20 SPF additive is a nice protective factor.</li>
            <li> Bought it for hubby who uses it during fall/winter. He loves it and his feedback is: it&#x27;s smooth and light. SPF20 protects as well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I used to use a Nivea Q-10 lotion. But after I tried this, I switched immediately. It&#x27;s lightweight and non-greasy. It gets immediately absorbed by the skin for a refreshing feel.</li>
            <li> So I am guy, and I really don&#x27;t care about lotions and potions.  I just needed something with sunblock that wasn&#x27;t greasy so I could rub it all over my face and bald head.  I tend to turn pink if left in the sun for 5 minutes so had to try everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great, protects me from the sun, absolutely no grease whatsoever...cannot even tell anything is on.  The other nice thing, from my completely unexpected and unbiased opinion, is it really made my skin nicer and younger looking.  Kinda weird actually because I never thought these &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; potions did anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive as hell, but cheaper than cancer.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do at a decent price.  Delivered on time. All I can ask for and more.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  Not too strong of a scent. Makes his skin look younger. Great that it has some sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> Actually used by my by husband and he has used if for years.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended for hubby by his dermatologist.  He uses it daily and says it goes on great, he doesn&#x27;t even know it is there.  Works great, too, keeping the sun off his face and hoping to lessen or prevent any more skin cancer problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for 15 years now and it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li> Love the cream..non greasy..has SPF for added sun protection...packing is nice and simple and to top it all, it lasts quite long</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and it claims at least to have the proper sunscreen. NOTE: Neutrogena has been in the news over it&#x27;s alleged sun screens and their lack of effectiveness. We now have guidelines in place to determine if we have the right lotion. They should say UVA UVB wide spectrum in order to be effective. My old tube says only uva/uvb so I&#x27;m going to presume it works. The lotion goes on great and soothes after shaving.</li>
            <li> Great product works exceptionally well. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Smells manly, and doesn&#x27;t leave you oily like regular sunblock.</li>
            <li> Great lotion with sunscreen.  I really like the way it is quickly absorbed and leaves no shine or residue.  Leaves skin soft and looking natural. Will definitely reorder as needed.</li>
            <li> its pretty good....does a fair job in keeping my face hydrated.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  Have used it for years with no issues</li>
            <li> Fragrance not the best, but nice lotion</li>
            <li> Amazon advertises this as a pack of 2, it is NOT, it is a pack with ONE item. Beware. I bought five, thinking I was getting five packs of two for a total of ten, but, only got five.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it. He is using it every day.  I did not see there were two packings while I placed order.</li>
            <li> This product really relieved my irritated and red skin from shaving. It&#x27;s lite and not oily, I use it everyday. Now my skin is smooth and bumb and irritation free. I would defintely recommend this product to all men of color. Affordable skin care that works.</li>
            <li> Great lotion but didn&#x27;t expect there to be a noticeable scent. I&#x27;d prefer no scent at all but it&#x27;s easy to get used to. It&#x27;s not that strong so that it&#x27;s the only thing you smell all day. But you&#x27;ll notice the scent when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. I have been using it for years and would venture to try anything else at this point. This takes away any razor burns, soaks in easily, and leaves your skin feeling great. Highly recommend a try if you are looking for an aftershave.</li>
            <li> The skin on my nose and on each side is abnormally dry, requiring daily use of a lotion else it will turn red and flake off. I have tried various lotions over the years from several brands and all work, but they are all greasy, even so called non greasy lotions such as Gold Bond. I found this product on sale in a national pharmacy chain and bought it on their recommendation. I can say that this is the most non greasy lotion I have ever come across. About 20 seconds, if that long, after application you can&#x27;t even tell it has been applied. It is a very light lotion, and spreads easily. Aside from applying it in these areas, I also use it when my razor is starting to get dull and causes irritation, which this soothes quickly. Although it claims not to sting, I have noticed a -very slight- stinging sensation for a few seconds when applied to a very dry or very irritated area. The scent is very nice as well, more like a fresh, clean scent rather than a fragrance, and is not very potent so it will not interfere with aftershave or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tolerance for greasy lotions is very low, which is why my hands are pretty dry, and I highly recommend this product. Remember a little bit will go a long way, so this small 1.7oz tube will last longer than you think.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude who doesn&#x27;t like to think about moisturizing and SPF stuff but I live in LA and is sort of mandatory to protect your skin. I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have always been satisfied with the effectiveness for the price. Nothing fancy, but no problems and no sunburn. Easy peasy.</li>
            <li> Does a good job. I like the little bit of extra SPF protection. Not the best after shave solution, though, as it will sting a bit.</li>
            <li> This lotion helps keep my face moisturized in the winter. If you have severe dry skin I would not recommend this but if you have light dry skin this should do the trick</li>
            <li> Ah, Neutrogena triple protect! Self proclaiming to guard the skin via soothing razor irritation, healing dry skin, and helping to fight the signs of aging with its SPF 20 sunscreen protection. That&#x27;s all fine and dandy until you flip the bottle over only to read the fine print on the reverse side where it is revealed that (emphasis mine):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT SKIN CANCER OR EARLY SKIN AGING\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading between the lines, this implies that it only affords protection against UVB rays. Disappointing in that this lotion really does a great job in the after-shave uses that it is touted for. Unfortunately, in the end, its an expensive product that underwhelms in the skin protection department.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent and feel of the lotion on my face.  It does it task.  This is a nice alternative to more expensive lotions.</li>
            <li> Great product I would highly recommend this face lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li> I can feel it protect my skin as I apply it. Nice aroma!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has used this for years. I started buying it for him seven or eight years ago because it wasn&#x27;t obnoxious scent-wise and was a great value. The price is a lot better if you order it from Amazon, rather than buying it retail. He has great skin; and this doesn&#x27;t clog his pores or make his skin look oily.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of facial moisturisers as my face gets so dry from the toners I use for my really oily face. so far this is the best product from the reasonably priced ones that I&#x27;ve tried (price range of $15-$30, I find it impractical to spend loads of money on a moisturiser). best because:&lt;br /&gt;1. very easy to apply as it&#x27;s quite fluid;&lt;br /&gt;2. since it&#x27;s very fluid, a little amount goes a long way - I think one bottle will last me 3 months of once a day use&lt;br /&gt;3. doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy after, seems like you didn&#x27;t put anything&lt;br /&gt;4. very reasonable priced&lt;br /&gt;5. and of course, keeps my face moisturised together with sun protection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, these are all I need from a facial moisturiser</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, thinking he&#x27;d be more apt to remember to put on sunscreen every day. It worked! it&#x27;s now part of his morning routine! it goes on nicely, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sunscreen film at all.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff daily and I still haven&#x27;t ran out. All you need is a small bead on your finger and then can spread it around. It has a great masculine smell and is very soothing. I will be buying again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I use it in the summer primarily because of the sun protection. I use a more hydrating formula in the winter.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it works.  I apply it in the morning and I do not have dry skin all day.</li>
            <li> Soothing to skin, and the spf works I assume. Never really put the spf to the test, but I live in Phoenix and haven&#x27;t gotten burned so that&#x27;s something.</li>
            <li> The ladies love the scent. What other reason do you need for buying it?</li>
            <li> Love it! been using it for some time.  It is the only cream my husband will use. It is not sticky or greasy and it does its job like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion/sunscreen to keep in your bag for emergencies but I wouldn&#x27;t really use this everyday.  It moisturizes but the added scent isn&#x27;t too great.  I dumped it into my desk at work and will probably use it when I leave my day-to-day face lotion at home or run out.</li>
            <li> Good after shaving lotion! Makes my face feel super smooth, and it still has the light, temporary burn of aftershave.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that when you read the back of the bottle it says that it doesn&#x27;t protect you from skin cancer or skin ageing, it merely stops sunburn.</li>
            <li> I use this as part of my daily regimen, goes on nice and clear and provides the necessary SPF to protect the face from aging. Not so sure about moisturizer, I use a different lotion at night.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way. Cheaper online than at Walgreens!</li>
            <li> Great product that does a great job at moisturizing. In addition the SPF 20 helps to reduce the impact of UVA &amp; UVB rays from damaging skin. Highly Recommended. Very good service from supplier.</li>
            <li> While it smells nice, it leaves my face feeling very dry and easily cracked. This product also stings a little bit, perhaps due to the high alcohol content. If you have razor burn, it will cause further irritation, and not feel very good when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite face lotion for men is: [[ASIN:B0014ZR2R4 L&#x27;Oreal Men&#x27;s Expert Comfort Max Anti-Irritation After Shave Balm with SPF 15 Sunscreen,  3-Ounce Bottle  (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;Also available in a single pack: [[ASIN:B0013NHSEO L&#x27;Oreal Paris Men&#x27;s Expert Comfort Max Anti-Irritation After Shave Balm, SPF 15, 3.3-Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to buy both the L&#x27;Oreal and Neutrogena lotions so you can compare them and decide which works best for you.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a great for everyday sun protection particularly if you need to protect the top of your head as I do.  Smells good and is not greasy...works well for total head protection for folicly challenged.</li>
            <li> I actually had to return this. I thought I was getting AgeFighter, but unfortunately, this arrived, and it is nothing like Age Fighter. The odor on this one was so strong and so lady-like, I could not use it. I&#x27;m not sure why the market this as a men&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for sunscreen. I use it for burns, sun related and sweat related and otherwise. It&#x27;s absolutely excellent to relief the burning pain and sensation. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this forever. Works great. Expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> This works great. I use this after shaving and it helps with razor burn. It has a pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave an over oily residue.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in my face almost immediately. A little goes a long way. My face looks more healthier and skin has a better texture.</li>
            <li> not greasy, has uv protection and keeps my face from feeling dryer out.  Not cheap but worth the money (unlike many other lotions)</li>
            <li> Works great.  It is not greasy. My skin is no longer dry and the SPF 20 is enough to keep the UV rays to a minimum.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell, bad, but doesn&#x27;t smell appealing. Doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and the bottle is very small. I&#x27;d wear this at the beach, but for daily use.. no thanks.</li>
            <li> I really the multi applications of this lotion, especially the sunscreen. Takes care of all my needs with one cream. I normally buy this lotion from rite aid, target or whichever store is having a sale. The best deal I got though was buy one get one half off. When I looked it up through Amazon, I found the same lotion in a two pack for what I normally pay for one. I think I&#x27;ll stock up on my next order.</li>
            <li> I shave with a safety razor so my razor provides a very close shave while stripping my face of its natural oils. Plus, if razor is not at its sharpest, it will cause skin irritation. Neutrogena Triple Protect Face Lotion for Men gently moisturizes my face after my shave. It also soothes my skin after shaving so it stops shaving related skin irritation rashes. Its fragrance is very gentle and refreshing  (it lacks any overpowering qualities unless you have the scent of a hound.) I have always used Neutrogena products because their primary focus is the overall health of one&#x27;s skin. The fact that this lotion contains sunscreen demonstrates their focus on long term skin health. Really, how many men would actually apply sunscreen to face after shaving if this product did not contain sunscreen?</li>
            <li> Its a good lotion that protects from sun while not letting an oily feel. It moistures well and have just a little essence.</li>
            <li> My husband is a firefighter, and during the summer he tended to get sun burned a lot when out on calls. Not to mention his skin dries out a lot on the job. I first bought this for him a couple years ago from Walmart and he loved it. I found it a lot cheaper from this seller on Amazon and you get a pack of two! I will continue to buy from here..</li>
            <li> My face is sensitive to shaving and this lotion helps.  I apply it right right after shaving to prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice at this whole sunscreen/block stuff.  I&#x27;m a male &amp; non-caucasion but that&#x27;s not an excuse for being an ignorant old wrinkly man decades down the road.  So I spent a little time doing some research and combined that with a little common knowledge I already have.&lt;br /&gt;Basically you should be looking for a sunscreen that&#x27;s BROAD SPECTRUM.  Typically clearly labeled on the box and or product.  Broad Spectrum offers both UVA &amp; UVB protection... I&#x27;ll let you do the research into UVA &amp; UVB to learn the importance and distinction.  Also this product has oxy-whatever it&#x27;s called.  That wasn&#x27;t a complete turn off for me after reading about the concerns, but what the heck why take the chance. (And of course there&#x27;s other products out there that offer much more without the oxy-whatever.)&lt;br /&gt;But in regards to this specific product, I did think it applies very light and smooth.  Also has a masculine smell so that&#x27;s all good too.  My verdict is get another product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Mild smell. Not Oily. Keeps my bald head from burning. Good to go.</li>
            <li> I really liked this moisturizer until I realized that it doesn&#x27;t offer broad spectrum SPF so it doesn&#x27;t protect against UV Rays that cause photoaging</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff. He uses it daily after he shaves. It does not cause irritation, and his skin is very smooth. It&#x27;s nice that it has SPF.</li>
            <li> decent product and reasonable</li>
            <li> the fragrance is way too strong</li>
            <li> So my husband was looking for an after shave lotion...he likes this but it is pricey even for 2 small 1.7oz tubes. 3 stars for it being a Neutrogena product...otherwise, just ok.</li>
            <li> This lotion is expensive but light and effective.  Smells like a light cologne instead of typically flowery smelling lotion.  I like the added sunblock too.</li>
            <li> It said it was going to come on the 6th but it came today instead. But still satisfied nonetheless yeah</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion on and off for a couple months. I have used it in sun and though it seems to work, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it provides all the protection I want. It has smoothed out a couple lines on my forhead a bit, but nothing drastic. Don&#x27;t look for miracles here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Fiance says it smells really good and she loves kissing me when I wear it. It also works as a good after shave. considering buying again, just not 100%.</li>
            <li> This face lotion makes my shave so much more pleasant. I also put it on my nose to soothe the kleenex burn from blowing it so much when I had a cold.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product which my husband has been using for some time.  As with most, if not all, Neutrogena products, it beats similar brands hands down.  We have it on Amazon&#x27;s auto-ship program which makes it even more affordable.</li>
            <li> This product applies nicely with good rub-in.  It is light.  However, it made my eyes tear.  Perhaps the fragrance is causing this effect.  I returned the product.</li>
            <li> works great, SPF is low but it is great for daily use.</li>
            <li> We LOVE Neutrogena products.  Quite simply, this one let us down.  Aside from arriving even too late for the crazy snow to be an excuse, we opened it up and it smelled terrible.  We bought another Neutrogena product for the face - not &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; - and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is sticky and smelly.  It might not suppose to be that way, but that&#x27;s what it was for us.</li>
            <li> very good, keep me motorized and looking healthy</li>
            <li> This is a very small, much smaller than expected. To make matters worse, you need to use a lot a lot to do it&#x27;s job. Nice scent, but way to expensive. I would not buy it again or recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I like this product, and I love that it also has an SPF to protect your face from the sun, but I don&#x27;t like how it smells at all. I would recommend complementing the Nitrogena Face Wash with a different product. Just my 2 cents.</li>
            <li> After too many years of sun damage and dermatologists burns, I started using this as face cream and SPF each day.  It adds protection from the sun and  keeps ,y skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> I have used this face protect for many year and I love it. The price to a two pack can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> only lotion i can get the bf to wear. lightweight, doesn&#x27;t smell girly, has spf- which is the big sell for me.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product so much that he orders it in bulk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for years.  It&#x27;s fragrance free and dries non-greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like some other sunscreens.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> I like how this smells nice and doubles as an aftershave of sorts. However because of the sun protection my face feels a little oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is a bit much for my liking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s face lotion, and its decently priced.  Can&#x27;t complain.  I can attest to the fact that it is a moisturizer and it does contain SPF, but all other claims are a bit unclear such as &#x27;reducing the signs of aging&#x27;.  I look young for my age, so given that my clients don&#x27;t trust me with their accounts because I look like a child, or as someone once asked, &amp;#34;is it bring your son to work day?&amp;#34;  I probably shouldn&#x27;t be using this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion does smell pretty Brut, so if you want to smell manly, but are afraid that putting on face lotion will distract from that, then I recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good product for its price. Neutrogena is a reliable brand and will continue to purchase the same product in the future.</li>
            <li> Actually I did not use it, and my boyfriend says it is good. So, this product is suitable for him.</li>
            <li> This along with the loreal face lotion are my two favorites.  However, this one I like even more because it costs a little less and seems to smell a little better.</li>
            <li> Too much fragrance in this product. I guess the \\&quot;for men\\&quot; part means it stinks like cologne. Luckily I know someone who doesn&#x27;t mind the smell though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It is great for your skin after you shave - no burn and you get sun protection.</li>
            <li> I purchased Neutrogena Triple Protect because it supposedly had all that I wanted in a face lotion: an aftershave balm, moisturizer and sunscreen. It far exceeded my expectations and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product. It goes on well, has no oily residue, soothes the skin and makes it soft. It also has a pleasant, but subtle smell. It is now part of my morning care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face lotion for several years now and I really like it. Great price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best product for my face. It adds moisture and sun protection at the same time.</li>
            <li> Outstanding, high quality and soaks in fast.  I&#x27;m 40+ years old and have had recurring occasional mild acne most of my life.  This strikes the perfect balance in that it soothes razor irritated skin (I have a heavy beard) yet provides a balanced, non-greasy moisture so that I have virtually no skin issues any longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not listed in the ingredients in the description, but it contains the cheaper Oxybenzone for the SPF which has a warning by the CDC as being toxic. The good quality creams use the more expensive zinc oxide or titanium dioxide which doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin as Oxybenzone does. Search Oxybenzone online and look at the CDC warnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it. They should list this in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I started using this the past month because my face had started feeling overly dry and nearly everything I tried felt very greasy and didn&#x27;t absorb into the skin.  This, however, works very well.  My face has felt and looked a lot better since I started using it and it is absorbed very quickly into the skin so that the skin is moisturized, but not slick or greasy.  It also has some sunscreen in it to help prevent UV damage in daily activity.  A good, inexpensive and effective product that I plan to keep using.</li>
            <li> Causes my face to swell and breakout.  Whatever is in this stuff, I can&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Nice product and nice size for traveling!</li>
            <li> Irritation and burning will occur for people who are allergic</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my husband. All I can get out of him is ... it is just fine. So it is hard for me to rate.</li>
            <li> So far, this is a good product. It&#x27;s a thinner lotion, which I prefer, spreads easily and smells good - meaning men will like it or at least not mind it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice already. I love it. I never forget to leave the house without putting this on. Make you feel younger and has a nice scent to it. I do see my skin less dry (especially around the nose area) and it has actually gotten rid of my acne a bit ;o So it&#x27;s a neat product :) as a bonus, the price is really for for 2 of them</li>
            <li> Good sunblocker, absorbs quickly too</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local drugstore and got compliments on my skin after using for a week or two. I have moderately oily skin, and this lotion manages that at the same time as providing some SPF. Really solid everyday men&#x27;s skin care product.</li>
            <li> hubby really likes the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who appreciates a reliable product and delivers value. This is it. I use it as an aftershave and a daily sunscreen. (I have fair skin) it goes on clean, it isn&#x27;t greasy and you can wear it to the office or out on the trails.  I never write product reviews but this one deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I used to use another neutrogena product that after putting on I would have to wipe the greasiness off. This stuff works great and leaves no trace or greasiness, just keeps your face from being all dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> BF loves it, 5th bottle bought :P</li>
            <li> My skin gets dry after the shower.  This product goes on very well.  Not oily and barely any smell.  spf 20 provides an added protection in the morning.  I have been using this for almost a year and have been very happy.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but not exceptional and does not, for me, represent good value for money, in it&#x27;s small size.</li>
            <li> excellent as described</li>
            <li> This is not the strongest moisturizer, nor is it a serious broad spectrum sunscreen. But it applies beautifully so you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re wearing a sunscreen - great to use with street clothes on days when you&#x27;ll in the sun for a couple hours</li>
            <li> Best face lotion for my sensitive face.  Removes razor burn and keeps my skin from getting dry and itchy.  Love that fact that it has SPF built in for added protection.  Will continue to buy and use.</li>
            <li> Been using this every day for at least a year or two now. Love the feel and smell and it&#x27;s always nice to have some SPF. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This product works well on sensitive skin.  No reaction like with regular sunscreen.  My only complaint is the scent.  It&#x27;s not bad, but unscented would be much better.</li>
            <li> I use this after every shave, and i like it.  It helps keep my face skin moisturize throughout the day (especially in the morning after shaving and washing my face i would get dry skin).  The smell is alright, I dont hate it or like it.  Would buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 6 years now and still the best option.  Keeps face moisten and feeling fresh all day plus it acts as a sun block.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer this made my eyes burn all day.  It must be the fragrance because I did not apply the lotion near my eyes.</li>
            <li> As an avid Art of Shaving user, I spent years using their facial creams as my default daily facial lotion. It was fine and smelled good but it was expensive and didn&#x27;t offer UV protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting a facial done, the therapist stressed the need for using a cream with SPF to protect my face. That&#x27;s how I came across this product and I could not be happier with the results after using it for over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- UV protection through SPF&lt;br /&gt;- Great scent: I actually like it more than the AofS lotions I used to use&lt;br /&gt;- Soothing: I do find that it helps reduce irritation after shaving&lt;br /&gt;- Price: Very reasonable price especially for 2 bottles in one&lt;br /&gt;- Size: love that each bottle is only 1.5 ounces so you can travel with it without checking in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- none</li>
            <li> Despite the high spf, it goes on easy even with facial hair and it not greasy at all. Pretty great product.</li>
