            <li>/&gt;The most amazing things about these brushes is how well they apply the product, and how clean they come just from using them.</li>

            <li>Love the packaging, great for travelling I needed a new set.</li>

            <li>The brush is also good for applying concealer around the lips for a nice and clean look, and for covering a little imperfections on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Fan Brush: This fan brush is ideal for applying highlighter on my cheek bones.</li>
            <li>When I got the opportunity to review these brushes I was so excited!</li>
            <li>this brush set comes with 12 brushes and this case for them to fit in, which I really like because it’s great for traveling and throwing in my gym bag for after my workouts when I have somewhere to go.</li>
            <li>also love how I can store them easily and</li>
            <li>It comes in a lovely compact bag that easily fits in your purse or bag.</li>
            <li>you do makeup professionally or just do your own; a good set of brushes is always a must.  </li>
            <li>to see more pictures and a more detailed description, check out my blog.  </li>
            <li>Another great thing is that the hairs are soft and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li>favorite is the Blush Brush, as I can never find a blush brush that isn&#x27;t cheap or one that comes with the blush</li>
            <li>misshapen.&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately my thoughts are: these are good for a travel set since it can be portable and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>Although I received complimentary from Petunia, the opinions and experiences are all my own</li>
            <li>Another cool thing about this set is that it also comes with brush guards!</li>
            <li>They come in a cute little plether case and would make a great gift!</li>
            <li>These brushes come in a convenient fold-up pouch that is easy to travel with and protect your brushes from dust and dirt.</li>
            <li>The brushes comes with a carry case which makes them easy to store and adds to the glamour of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Go easy on it.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to carry these anywhere</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are lightweight and easy to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can blend them easily without the streaks.</li>
            <li>Synthetic brushes are great for liquid-based makeup, while natural hair brushes pick up and distribute powder makeup evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>When you put the eyeshadow on your lids it covers easily (vs. coming off all at once immediately where you touch).</li>
            <li>I love the bristles, soft and so good</li>
            <li>It had a strong nail polish like odor to it.</li>
            <li>They came with a strong chemical odor of some sort which did go away after an airing and washing.</li>
            <li>Next best thing to what a professional makeup artist uses!It comes in a nice case as well.</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a brush set, or need a good gift to give a special girl in your life, I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li>was in dire need of some new brushes so every brush in the kit has been put to good use.  </li>
            <li>However I still use it under my eye area for setting up my concealer with powder and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>and after that every thing smelled fine</li>
            <li>Everything is also super visually appealing.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best brushes I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>I find that some brushes, are just hot glued together, and break very easily, these do not seem to be that way, and each brush is clamped.</li>
            <li>I find that some brushes, are just hot glued together, and break very easily, these do not seem to be that way, and each brush is clamped.</li>

            <li>The bristles of the brushes are great quality and the little Set comes really handy when travelling.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean just use shampoo as it says in the trifold that tells you each brush and what it&#x27;s use is.</li>
            <li>There was a great extra in the box that I was not expecting and it was brush guards.</li>
            <li>Instead of having your brushes all over a bag you can store them securely in the bag</li>

            <li>is this amazing Professional 12 Set Makeup Brush Kit that they sent me to review for my blog,</li>
            <li>all these brushes retail for $89.99, they sell for  $47.77, I can&#x27;t say I feel like they are worth that price tag, but  they are higher quality and better brushes</li>
            <li>my full review on my blog meandmyminime.com</li>
            <li>The bristles were nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>but I do know I&#x27;ve never owned anything as nice as the Professional 12 Set Makeup Brush Kit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying extra sets as gifts because I KNOW how good they are.</li>
            <li>absolute favorite of the brushes are the foundation brush (10), eyeshadow brush (9), and smudge brush (</li>
            <li>They are all soft and the brush tips are nice and full.</li>
            <li>: I use this brush mainly for applying highlighter in the inner corner of my eyes and it works great because is small, and it fits perfect there.</li>
            <li>The color of the brushes are beautiful which a combination of magenta and black.</li>
            <li>All the other brushes are great too</li>
            <li>Great, basic brushes at a really affordable price.</li>
            <li>but my excitement quickly dissipated once I opened the package.</li>
            <li>I have smaller eyes, and a more noticeable crease in my eye lids, which is where I use this brush most, to blend my eye-shadow together.</li>

            <li>all these brushes retail for $89.99, they sell for  $47.77, I can&#x27;t say I feel like they are worth that price tag, but  they are higher quality and better brushes than a lot out there, for the same set, with price tag, these are the better brushes, if you are trying to choose.  </li>
            <li>Positive besides the nice design of this pretty brushes is, they do not lose hair when washing and are very soft.</li>
            <li>LOTS of shedding on the larger brushes, the rest are nice though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and sleek to the touch and looks adorable.</li>

            <li>Nothing to complain about there, although the large fan brush, I did have to clip one of the bristles off, as it would not stay in place!</li>

            <li>After I cleaned them for the first time they did not shed at all.  </li>
            <li>After having kids especially, I started leaving the house without makeup more often than not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>brushes are a pretty color and a great, thick quality.</li>
            <li>These brushes did not have any smell when I first opened them and it has not shed as well since I washed them.</li>
            <li>I love makeup brushes, believe it or not they are all different</li>
            <li>This product is first class.</li>
            <li>The case is very well made and has taken the full purse abuse and has not broken or cracked.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brush, and smudge brush are the two brushes I use the most, and imagine most will, the only thing I can say, is I do wish the smudge brush was slightly smaller.</li>
            <li>It does feel and look as if it is a higher quality sponge though.</li>
            <li>Petunia really didn&#x27;t leave anything out here, when making them!</li>

            <li>/&gt;Sample Provided for Reviewa lot out there, for the same set, with price tag, these are the better brushes, if you are trying to choose.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, yeah, the package had a funny smell.</li>
            <li>The length of the handles is interesting because they&#x27;re in-between travel size and my standard pro brushes.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this product when I first received the bag it did smell</li>
            <li>The case does have a funny smell upon arrival but it didn&#x27;t affect the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li>, thou I first</li>
            <li>But they are not, there more like a Red color</li>
            <li>and honestly it&#x27;s not as bad as everyone is making It out to be, they&#x27;re brand new</li>
            <li>These brushes are awesome and they will last really long if you know how to properly care for them.</li>
            <li>other thing I really liked about these brushes is they were not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>Other than that, a really nice brush set for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, so, these are so amazing that they literally have changed the game for how I put on makeup.</li>
            <li>Even if I was using it as foundation brush, I still think that is too small and it will take a long time to achieve a perfect blended foundation all over.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes had fantastic handles they were not flimsy at all the even after cleaning them the brushes went right back to their shape.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very well made, easy to clean, they dry fast and keep their shape after washing.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very well made, easy to clean, they dry fast and keep their shape after washing.</li>
            <li>I personally do not think it&#x27;s a good product , it&#x27;s nice to have CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR THOSE WHO ARE STARTING IN MAKEUP , BUT NOT REALLY SOFT TOUCH WITH SKIN AND EACH TIME</li>
            <li>I love brush guards for after washing my brushes to help them maintain their shape while they dry.</li>
            <li>They make it easy to cover different parts of the face with each angle and brush</li>
            <li>Its angled shape is ideal for applying bronzer in the hollow of the cheekbones, down the sides of the nose, underneath the chin, in the depth of the temples, and along the hairline.</li>
            <li>I would probably also bring additional foundation brush, large powder brush, blending brush and a eyeliner brush.</li>

            <li>The brush roll, or pouch is a very high quality material and quality made.</li>
            <li>of the 12 pieces are usable although personal favorites are the large and super soft powder brush, the angled blush brush which is the perfect slightly flat shape for contouring as well and the fluffy blending brushes for the eye.</li>
            <li>For everyday, basic brushes this set was a great buy.</li>
            <li>The makeup application is really a no-brainer with them.</li>
            <li>There are a couple brushes inthis set which I really enjoy and have been using on a daily basis (eyebrow brush, smudge brush, eye shadow brush and the concealer brush)</li>
            <li>They help make the application of your makeup so much easier</li>
            <li>These brushes are fabulous with distributing product in a simple swipe.</li>
            <li>The makeup brushes that come with makeup are cheap and often fall apart in short time after purchase.  </li>
            <li>While this really does not bother me, and I don&#x27;t see it being a problem.  </li>
            <li>They pick up both very evenly, and apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>They pick up both very evenly, and apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;the eye shadow, and smudge brush applied the shadow evenly, and uniformly across my hand.</li>
            <li>Petunia really didn&#x27;t leave anything out here, when making them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Petunia really didn&#x27;t leave anything out here, when making them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes so fast, is a much quicker process, and cleanup time is a snap!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I buy high end makeup brands, why the HELL don&#x27;t they purchase these to stick with their products?!</li>
            <li>I still like to use it to gently sweep away fall out and</li>
            <li>I am still in awe at how much of the product went onto my face and stayed off the brush.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much of the product blended into my face vs. stuck to the brush.</li>
            <li>and I could really blend the darker colors and control where I was pulling the color to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It highlights the lashline without being as intense as mascara.</li>
            <li>I think it would pick up gel &amp; liquid very well.</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the portability also and the case they come in.  </li>
            <li>I totally recommend this lovely makeup brush set for beginners or professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li>I had REALLY high hopes for these ones, the reviews that were positive convinced me.</li>
            <li>The folding pouch doesn&#x27;t look like a make-up brush pouch but looks like a cute and pretty little purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I almost always have to clean my brushes after using especially my foundation brush.</li>
            <li>These brushes come in a really nice case that folds flat, yes flat without damaging the brushes.</li>
            <li>I can say, is that the little compartments where you are to slide each brush into, some of them are larger than need be, I can actually fit more than one brush in them.</li>

            <li>The pink color is a great contrast to the black handle and bristles.</li>
            <li>pouch has slots for each brush to sit in and a small flap to cover the brushes, protect them, and keep them from falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a variety of brushes that each have their own function, whether it&#x27;s for the eyes, lips, eyelashes, eyebrows, powder, or liquids.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to hold, soft and gentle on the face, and overall they do what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>This way I have way more control and the whole filling process is quicker and easier when the bristles are a little shorter.&lt;br /&gt;Concealer Brush</li>
            <li>then I put the brush guard on the brushes and they look and feel just like new!</li>
            <li>Who does not like trying new makeup brushes!?</li>
            <li>but as I got older and more confident in myself and put less stock in my looks; it became less of a necessity.</li>
            <li>The main brushes I use are for blush, powder and eyeshadow</li>
            <li>I washed each one of the brushes, with some mild baby shampoo before using, and I think maybe 2 or 3 bristles fell out total among all the brushes.</li>

            <li>When you are done the brush is very close to being clean &amp; dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are all very soft to the touch and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>QUALITY BRUSHES, HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS, AND</li>
            <li>Made with a combination high quality pony hair, goat hair, and synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>I am somewhat of a beauty product aficionado and I have a lot of makeup brushes, both high end and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The brushes are made with high quality goat hair, pony hair and synthetic hair and applies my makeup without any streaking or marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally prefer a flat top brush to apply my foundation and think that shape of a brush is  one that might be an addition that I would like to see in another</li>
            <li>It comes in the cutest, most convenient little carrying case.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to using other things, this brush is so amazing, how the HELL did I ever live without it?</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know a whole lot about professional makeup or brushes</li>
            <li>but now I really see the difference and that you completely get what you pay for when it comes to brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is the carrying case compact but includes every brush you need to complete your full face of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>THE ULTIMATE PROFESSIONAL STUDIO QUALITY MAKEUP BRUSH KIT - Our 12 set makeup brushes includes all the essential pieces for any type of makeup applications you desire; from eyelashes to eyebrows to eyeshadow to foundation to lips and to powder - everything you&#x27;ll need on a day-to-day basis and even more, we&#x27;ve got you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used crappy normal lip brushes before, and then I tried this.</li>
            <li>would not probably use the sponge applicator (3) and liked this least of all because I Do not like sponge brushes.</li>
            <li>The fan brush is a bit thin for makeup application, but is good for brushing off any fall out you may have after applying your eye shadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s great that they come in the little black Travel Pouch, which protects against dust</li>
            <li>They are very soft and made of high quality.</li>
            <li>I would like this to be swapped with either a second smudge brush OR a very small smudge brush that I could use as a brow highlighter, brow filler, or to apply more precise eyeshadow around the lashline/in the crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However the small and compact size is comfortable enough to hold in the hand, and the rounded shape of the bristles provides really precise application.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also nice to make a little extra effort now and again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live these brushes.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to set of brushes for my purse.</li>
            <li>Sort of like a new car</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been years since I bought myself new make up brushes.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is simple to roll and easy to lay flat for ease of use.</li>
            <li>However I use a spoolie brush every single day to brush my brows into place and this one works just as any other of its kind.</li>
            <li>I like it better than my current black lip brush, because this one is much cuter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought these were for the softness, there are soft but the brush hair falling out makes that point moot.</li>
            <li>Each brushes bristles are very soft, or sturdy depending on what the brush is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each brushes bristles are very soft, or sturdy depending on what the brush is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are either natural (high quality pony hair or goat hair) or synthetic.</li>
            <li>I gave some to my friend who also frequently puts on make up, and she loves them too!</li>
            <li>Way better quality than my other brushes, even my Urban Decay brushes.</li>
            <li>The brush are silky soft and you have one for everything!</li>
            <li>Instead of buying individual brushes I&#x27;ve been looking for brush sets, especially ones that come with some sort of brush roll or case to keep everything clean.</li>

            <li>Set Makeup Brushes come in a fantastic black travel pouch.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brush seems to apply color much better than my previous brushes; the color actually comes off of the brush and onto your lid without having to apply over and over.</li>
            <li>have a problem with many of the brushes I&#x27;ve bought breaking away where (for example) the red on the Petunia Skincare brushes meets the black of the handle because the glue doesn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li>I typically use a stiffer foundation brush for my liquid foundation but this brush actually works better.</li>
            <li>I had very little fallout (which is partially due to using good quality eyeshadow).</li>

            <li> Another great thing is that the hairs are soft and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> favorite is the Blush Brush, as I can never find a blush brush that isn&#x27;t cheap or one that comes with the blush</li>
            <li> misshapen.&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately my thoughts are: these are good for a travel set since it can be portable and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Although I received complimentary from Petunia, the opinions and experiences are all my own</li>
            <li> Another cool thing about this set is that it also comes with brush guards!</li>
            <li> They come in a cute little plether case and would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> These brushes come in a convenient fold-up pouch that is easy to travel with and protect your brushes from dust and dirt.</li>
            <li> The brushes comes with a carry case which makes them easy to store and adds to the glamour of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Go easy on it.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to carry these anywhere</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are lightweight and easy to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can blend them easily without the streaks.</li>
            <li> Synthetic brushes are great for liquid-based makeup, while natural hair brushes pick up and distribute powder makeup evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> When you put the eyeshadow on your lids it covers easily (vs. coming off all at once immediately where you touch).</li>
            <li> I love the bristles, soft and so good</li>
            <li> It had a strong nail polish like odor to it.</li>
            <li> They came with a strong chemical odor of some sort which did go away after an airing and washing.</li>
            <li> Next best thing to what a professional makeup artist uses!It comes in a nice case as well.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a brush set, or need a good gift to give a special girl in your life, I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> was in dire need of some new brushes so every brush in the kit has been put to good use.  </li>
            <li> However I still use it under my eye area for setting up my concealer with powder and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> and after that every thing smelled fine</li>
            <li> Everything is also super visually appealing.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best brushes I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> I find that some brushes, are just hot glued together, and break very easily, these do not seem to be that way, and each brush is clamped.</li>
            <li> I find that some brushes, are just hot glued together, and break very easily, these do not seem to be that way, and each brush is clamped.</li>
            <li> The best part, the little brush guards to keep the shape, when cleaning and drying your brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best part, the little brush guards to keep the shape, when cleaning and drying your brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brushes are great quality and the little Set comes really handy when travelling.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean just use shampoo as it says in the trifold that tells you each brush and what it&#x27;s use is.</li>
            <li> There was a great extra in the box that I was not expecting and it was brush guards.</li>
            <li> Instead of having your brushes all over a bag you can store them securely in the bag</li>

            <li> is this amazing Professional 12 Set Makeup Brush Kit that they sent me to review for my blog,</li>
            <li> all these brushes retail for $89.99, they sell for  $47.77, I can&#x27;t say I feel like they are worth that price tag, but  they are higher quality and better brushes</li>
            <li> my full review on my blog meandmyminime.com</li>
            <li> The bristles were nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> but I do know I&#x27;ve never owned anything as nice as the Professional 12 Set Makeup Brush Kit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying extra sets as gifts because I KNOW how good they are.</li>
            <li> absolute favorite of the brushes are the foundation brush (10), eyeshadow brush (9), and smudge brush (</li>
            <li> They are all soft and the brush tips are nice and full.</li>
            <li> : I use this brush mainly for applying highlighter in the inner corner of my eyes and it works great because is small, and it fits perfect there.</li>
            <li> The color of the brushes are beautiful which a combination of magenta and black.</li>
            <li> All the other brushes are great too</li>
            <li> Great, basic brushes at a really affordable price.</li>
            <li> but my excitement quickly dissipated once I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I have smaller eyes, and a more noticeable crease in my eye lids, which is where I use this brush most, to blend my eye-shadow together.</li>

            <li> all these brushes retail for $89.99, they sell for  $47.77, I can&#x27;t say I feel like they are worth that price tag, but  they are higher quality and better brushes than a lot out there, for the same set, with price tag, these are the better brushes, if you are trying to choose.  </li>
            <li> Positive besides the nice design of this pretty brushes is, they do not lose hair when washing and are very soft.</li>

            <li> Nothing to complain about there, although the large fan brush, I did have to clip one of the bristles off, as it would not stay in place!</li>

            <li> It looked natural and blended the blush into my foundation easily.    </li>
            <li> After I cleaned them for the first time they did not shed at all.  </li>
            <li> After having kids especially, I started leaving the house without makeup more often than not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> brushes are a pretty color and a great, thick quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes did not have any smell when I first opened them and it has not shed as well since I washed them.</li>
            <li> I love makeup brushes, believe it or not they are all different</li>
            <li> This product is first class.</li>
            <li> The case is very well made and has taken the full purse abuse and has not broken or cracked.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brush, and smudge brush are the two brushes I use the most, and imagine most will, the only thing I can say, is I do wish the smudge brush was slightly smaller.</li>
            <li> It does feel and look as if it is a higher quality sponge though.</li>
            <li> Petunia really didn&#x27;t leave anything out here, when making them!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Sample Provided for Reviewa lot out there, for the same set, with price tag, these are the better brushes, if you are trying to choose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, yeah, the package had a funny smell.</li>
            <li> The length of the handles is interesting because they&#x27;re in-between travel size and my standard pro brushes.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this product when I first received the bag it did smell</li>
            <li> The case does have a funny smell upon arrival but it didn&#x27;t affect the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> , thou I first</li>
            <li> But they are not, there more like a Red color</li>
            <li> and honestly it&#x27;s not as bad as everyone is making It out to be, they&#x27;re brand new</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome and they will last really long if you know how to properly care for them.</li>
            <li> other thing I really liked about these brushes is they were not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Other than that, a really nice brush set for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, so, these are so amazing that they literally have changed the game for how I put on makeup.</li>
            <li> Even if I was using it as foundation brush, I still think that is too small and it will take a long time to achieve a perfect blended foundation all over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes had fantastic handles they were not flimsy at all the even after cleaning them the brushes went right back to their shape.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very well made, easy to clean, they dry fast and keep their shape after washing.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very well made, easy to clean, they dry fast and keep their shape after washing.</li>
            <li> I personally do not think it&#x27;s a good product , it&#x27;s nice to have CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR THOSE WHO ARE STARTING IN MAKEUP , BUT NOT REALLY SOFT TOUCH WITH SKIN AND EACH TIME</li>
            <li> I love brush guards for after washing my brushes to help them maintain their shape while they dry.</li>
            <li> They make it easy to cover different parts of the face with each angle and brush</li>
            <li> Its angled shape is ideal for applying bronzer in the hollow of the cheekbones, down the sides of the nose, underneath the chin, in the depth of the temples, and along the hairline.</li>
            <li> I would probably also bring additional foundation brush, large powder brush, blending brush and a eyeliner brush.</li>

            <li> The brush roll, or pouch is a very high quality material and quality made.</li>
            <li> of the 12 pieces are usable although personal favorites are the large and super soft powder brush, the angled blush brush which is the perfect slightly flat shape for contouring as well and the fluffy blending brushes for the eye.</li>
            <li> For everyday, basic brushes this set was a great buy.</li>
            <li> The makeup application is really a no-brainer with them.</li>
            <li> There are a couple brushes inthis set which I really enjoy and have been using on a daily basis (eyebrow brush, smudge brush, eye shadow brush and the concealer brush)</li>
            <li> They help make the application of your makeup so much easier</li>
            <li> These brushes are fabulous with distributing product in a simple swipe.</li>
            <li> The makeup brushes that come with makeup are cheap and often fall apart in short time after purchase.  </li>
            <li> While this really does not bother me, and I don&#x27;t see it being a problem.  </li>
            <li> They pick up both very evenly, and apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While this really does not bother me, and I don&#x27;t see it being a problem.  </li>
            <li> They pick up both very evenly, and apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;the eye shadow, and smudge brush applied the shadow evenly, and uniformly across my hand.</li>
            <li> Petunia really didn&#x27;t leave anything out here, when making them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Petunia really didn&#x27;t leave anything out here, when making them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes so fast, is a much quicker process, and cleanup time is a snap!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I buy high end makeup brands, why the HELL don&#x27;t they purchase these to stick with their products?!</li>
            <li> I still like to use it to gently sweep away fall out and</li>
            <li> I am still in awe at how much of the product went onto my face and stayed off the brush.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much of the product blended into my face vs. stuck to the brush.</li>
            <li> and I could really blend the darker colors and control where I was pulling the color to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It highlights the lashline without being as intense as mascara.</li>
            <li> I think it would pick up gel &amp; liquid very well.</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the portability also and the case they come in.  </li>
            <li> I totally recommend this lovely makeup brush set for beginners or professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li> I had REALLY high hopes for these ones, the reviews that were positive convinced me.</li>
            <li> The folding pouch doesn&#x27;t look like a make-up brush pouch but looks like a cute and pretty little purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I almost always have to clean my brushes after using especially my foundation brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes come in a really nice case that folds flat, yes flat without damaging the brushes.</li>
            <li> I can say, is that the little compartments where you are to slide each brush into, some of them are larger than need be, I can actually fit more than one brush in them.</li>

            <li> The pink color is a great contrast to the black handle and bristles.</li>
            <li> pouch has slots for each brush to sit in and a small flap to cover the brushes, protect them, and keep them from falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a variety of brushes that each have their own function, whether it&#x27;s for the eyes, lips, eyelashes, eyebrows, powder, or liquids.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to hold, soft and gentle on the face, and overall they do what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This way I have way more control and the whole filling process is quicker and easier when the bristles are a little shorter.&lt;br /&gt;Concealer Brush</li>
            <li> then I put the brush guard on the brushes and they look and feel just like new!</li>
            <li> Who does not like trying new makeup brushes!?</li>
            <li> but as I got older and more confident in myself and put less stock in my looks; it became less of a necessity.</li>
            <li> The main brushes I use are for blush, powder and eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I washed each one of the brushes, with some mild baby shampoo before using, and I think maybe 2 or 3 bristles fell out total among all the brushes.</li>

            <li> Made with a combination high quality pony hair, goat hair, and synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat of a beauty product aficionado and I have a lot of makeup brushes, both high end and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The brushes are made with high quality goat hair, pony hair and synthetic hair and applies my makeup without any streaking or marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally prefer a flat top brush to apply my foundation and think that shape of a brush is  one that might be an addition that I would like to see in another</li>
            <li> It comes in the cutest, most convenient little carrying case.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using other things, this brush is so amazing, how the HELL did I ever live without it?</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know a whole lot about professional makeup or brushes</li>
            <li> but now I really see the difference and that you completely get what you pay for when it comes to brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is the carrying case compact but includes every brush you need to complete your full face of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used crappy normal lip brushes before, and then I tried this.</li>
            <li> would not probably use the sponge applicator (3) and liked this least of all because I Do not like sponge brushes.</li>
            <li> The fan brush is a bit thin for makeup application, but is good for brushing off any fall out you may have after applying your eye shadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s great that they come in the little black Travel Pouch, which protects against dust</li>
            <li> They are very soft and made of high quality.</li>
            <li> I would like this to be swapped with either a second smudge brush OR a very small smudge brush that I could use as a brow highlighter, brow filler, or to apply more precise eyeshadow around the lashline/in the crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However the small and compact size is comfortable enough to hold in the hand, and the rounded shape of the bristles provides really precise application.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also nice to make a little extra effort now and again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live these brushes.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to set of brushes for my purse.</li>
            <li> Sort of like a new car</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I bought myself new make up brushes.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is simple to roll and easy to lay flat for ease of use.</li>
            <li> However I use a spoolie brush every single day to brush my brows into place and this one works just as any other of its kind.</li>
            <li> I like it better than my current black lip brush, because this one is much cuter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought these were for the softness, there are soft but the brush hair falling out makes that point moot.</li>
            <li> Each brushes bristles are very soft, or sturdy depending on what the brush is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each brushes bristles are very soft, or sturdy depending on what the brush is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are either natural (high quality pony hair or goat hair) or synthetic.</li>
            <li> I gave some to my friend who also frequently puts on make up, and she loves them too!</li>
            <li> Way better quality than my other brushes, even my Urban Decay brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush are silky soft and you have one for everything!</li>
            <li> Instead of buying individual brushes I&#x27;ve been looking for brush sets, especially ones that come with some sort of brush roll or case to keep everything clean.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and fluffy and applies the blush easy and evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very soft and fluffy and applies the blush easy and evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> New addition to my brush collection is a Professional Makeup Brush Kit by Petunia Scincare.</li>

            <li> Set Makeup Brushes come in a fantastic black travel pouch.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brush seems to apply color much better than my previous brushes; the color actually comes off of the brush and onto your lid without having to apply over and over.</li>
            <li> have a problem with many of the brushes I&#x27;ve bought breaking away where (for example) the red on the Petunia Skincare brushes meets the black of the handle because the glue doesn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> I typically use a stiffer foundation brush for my liquid foundation but this brush actually works better.</li>
            <li> I had very little fallout (which is partially due to using good quality eyeshadow).</li>
            <li> When it comes to powder brush I like it as large as possible.</li>

            <li> This is a fun new technique (to me) that really makes a pale lid pop against crease makeup.</li>

            <li> The hairs spread more so it covers a bigger area, and the angle lets me get into little spaces around my nose and under my eyes.</li>

            <li> When I opened and washed them I was sad to feel how light and cheap feeling they are.</li>
            <li> To help prevent skin breakouts I&#x27;ve been really strict about keeping my brushes clear, switching them out and not allowing them to be out in the open where dust and irritants can settle on them.</li>
            <li> When I hold each brush next to the make-up brushes I already have (bought at Costco years ago), you can see that they really skimped on the bristles.</li>
            <li> It keeps my brush soft and pliable and protect it form the dust that can get attracted to is from the moisture of my lipstick.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I guess I&#x27;m trying to say when I swiped my lid it was evenly coated with product, versus very heavy where I started &amp; light at the end of the swipe.</li>
            <li> I received no other compensation.</li>
            <li> You barely even have to!</li>

            <li> I personally love the eyeliner brush because it&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li> This kind of eyeliner brushes have always been useless to me, because I use angled brush to line my eyes.</li>
            <li> that my kids are getting a little older and I&#x27;M getting older</li>
            <li> So much product came off the other brush, I wondered how any even made it to my eye lid; Petunia Skincare&#x27;s brush had none.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brush is stiff, and long enough to accurately apply any gel liner.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brush is stiff, and long enough to accurately apply any gel liner.</li>
            <li> Although it does smell a little funky at first.</li>
            <li> I washed them first as suggested and only lost a few bristles but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> People say that they have a harsh odor to them when you first get them</li>
            <li> The first time I went to smudge, I wound up looking like I was half dead, &#x27;cause I had loaded up WAY too much color.</li>
            <li> It is not rough, it does not irritate the area around my brows and it looks so much prettier than my regular black spoolie brush.&lt;br /&gt;Lip</li>
            <li> The brushes are very pretty, they have silky matte black handles with their logo on each handle and metallic pink ferrules.</li>
            <li> These brushes are definitely comparable to some of the other high end brushes that I own.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am using them for a little over 2 months now and I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The brown bristles brushes are soft and the black and white brushes (synthetic) are the softest.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough to hold powder but soft enough that they do not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> The flat eye shadow brush, I don&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flat eye shadow brush, I don&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These seem as if they&#x27;re going to last a long time and hold up well to washing and disinfecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it will last a very long time too.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for makeup and always buy when I don’t really need it and the same goes for brushes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how much the brush picked up because it is a thin brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles were oddly not cut uniformly the way they are on all the other pieces and it&#x27;s too thin to do very much.</li>
            <li> However I used this brush to apply dark metallic blue eyeshadow across my upper and lower eyelashes and it works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also have no smell however the ones made from goat hair stink only when they are wet.</li>
            <li> They also have no smell however the ones made from goat hair stink only when they are wet.</li>
            <li> They are dense, thick and shaped really well.</li>
            <li> My Sephora set was actually about the same price as this and only included half the brushes AND are travel size!</li>
            <li> The brushes with the black bristles (natural hair) are stiffer than all the other brushes and not as dense.</li>
            <li> Again, very minor detail.</li>

            <li> I tried pulling apart the brush apart where the red of the handle meets the black of the handle.</li>
            <li> Your makeup products that are super expensive?</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry</li>
            <li> You get 12 brushes for every single one of your makeup needs!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so little, that you you have to apply blush several times.  </li>
            <li> It closes with a magnetic clasps so it stays closed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expected.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be too much Pink for me since I don&#x27;t like the color</li>
            <li> Pink.  </li>
            <li> not much wiggle room in there.  </li>
            <li> Someone had reviewed that the sleeves in the case are too loose and you can add other brushes to the pockets.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased brushes from other brands and have ran into problems such as shedding and the brushed being a little harsh.</li>
            <li> They apply makeup on every part of the face and eye area, I don&#x27;t need any other set with this in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other sets have the bristles falling out of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> Love the feel of these brushes but unfortunately some of them will leave bristles behind.</li>
            <li> often get breakouts and skin irritation when using make-up brushes with a slight rough texture.</li>
            <li> so I can accurately apply my eyeliner to just the base of my upper lashes to create the no make-up look.</li>
            <li> I just hate these kinds of brushes being included in a set, because the second you use a dark color, you can&#x27;t really clean it.</li>

            <li> It can be quite annoying when your brushes are falling apart while you&#x27;re trying to apply your makeup, but not to worry that won&#x27;t happen with Petunia Skincare&#x27;s Makeup Brushes!</li>

            <li> The bristles of the brushes are great quality and the little Set comes really handy when travelling. You have everything in this set that you need for a daily makeup look. In reality, the brushes look even better. Positive besides the nice design of this pretty brushes is, they do not lose hair when washing and are very soft. The high-quality wooden handles are adapted to the natural hand shape and don&#x27;t slip in your hand. The makeup application is really a no-brainer with them. The definitely high quality brushes are suitable for both beginners and professionals. I am using them for a little over 2 months now and I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s great that they come in the little black Travel Pouch, which protects against dust and they can be transported great. The free Set of Brush Guards that comes with the set is great to keep the brushes in shape and you save money, because usually they are sold separately.&lt;br /&gt;I received these brushes to review on my beauty blog for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Petunia Skincare&#x27;s fabulous brushes have quickly become some my favorite, the perfect edition to my kit. I recommend you all go out and get a set of your own, believe me you&#x27;ll be glad you did. They allow you to apply the perfect amount of makeup and pigment for a flawless application. A better quality set for this price, you could not get anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review on my blog meandmyminime.com</li>
            <li> Great, basic brushes at a really affordable price. For everyday, basic brushes this set was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I got these to try. Weather you do makeup professionally or just do your own; a good set of brushes is always a must.  I have had the chance to try out quite a few and I loved these.  The bristles were nice and soft.  After I cleaned them for the first time they did not shed at all.  One thing I hate is when your brush leaves bristles all over your face.  The brushes had fantastic handles they were not flimsy at all the even after cleaning them the brushes went right back to their shape.</li>
            <li> I have become a huge fan of all things by Petunia Skincare and my most recent favorite product is this amazing Professional 12 Set Makeup Brush Kit that they sent me to review for my blog, GlamRiver!&lt;br /&gt;I was in dire need of some new brushes so every brush in the kit has been put to good use.  I love the look &amp; feel of these brushes and I am super impressed with the quality.  These brushes are definitely comparable to some of the other high end brushes that I own.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the cute travel pouch &amp; brush guards that are included and will come in handy to help the brushes maintain their shape.&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for some new brushes I totally recommend these, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I personally do not think it&#x27;s a good product , it&#x27;s nice to have CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR THOSE WHO ARE STARTING IN MAKEUP , BUT NOT REALLY SOFT TOUCH WITH SKIN AND EACH TIME YOU USE THE LEAVE YOUR HAIR IN FACE</li>
            <li> I live these brushes. I wanted something that was sturdy and that my make up didn&#x27;t stick too. They are easy to clean just use shampoo as it says in the trifold that tells you each brush and what it&#x27;s use is. The case is sturdy and very nice. I am so hlad I bought these instead of all the others I was looking at.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people that has never been that into makeup. Sure I wear it but as I got older and more confident in myself and put less stock in my looks; it became less of a necessity. After having kids especially, I started leaving the house without makeup more often than not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my kids are getting a little older and I&#x27;M getting older, I decided it&#x27;s time to make more of an effort again. It&#x27;s nice to have the confidence to not feel it&#x27;s a requirement but it&#x27;s also nice to make a little extra effort now and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about professional makeup or brushes but I do know I&#x27;ve never owned anything as nice as the Professional 12 Set Makeup Brush Kit I recently got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set has a great first impression because it comes in a beautiful case that looks like a nice purse. It would look beautiful tucked away in a purse or even carried on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it just rolls out with everything inside. each brush comes covered so it&#x27;s in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are a pretty color and a great, thick quality. I&#x27;ve always just bought the cheapest brushes I could find since I wasn&#x27;t that into makeup before but now I really see the difference and that you completely get what you pay for when it comes to brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there are twelve, it has everything you need and more! It includes the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using these right away and they have become a regular part of my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of 12 Professional Makeup Brushes would make a beautiful gift for someone, or just for yourself!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes from Petunia Skincare. It&#x27;s so great that it comes with a travelling fold-able pouch and free brush guards to maintain it&#x27;s shape whenever you clean them. The brushes are so soft and I use this whole set for my everyday makeup which is awesome because I have everything I need for my face, cheeks, eyes and to my brows. These brushes did not have any smell when I first opened them and it has not shed as well since I washed them. I totally recommend this lovely makeup brush set for beginners or professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m was so excited to receive these beautiful brushes but my excitement quickly dissipated once I opened the package. These brushes have no fullness to them. When I hold each brush next to the make-up brushes I already have (bought at Costco years ago), you can see that they really skimped on the bristles. The main brushes I use are for blush, powder and eyeshadow but these are just so wimpy, I can&#x27;t use them.  I&#x27;ll be giving these brushes away. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try out this set of 12 makeup brushes from Petunia. It comes in a great travel brush roll. There was a great extra in the box that I was not expecting and it was brush guards. I love brush guards for after washing my brushes to help them maintain their shape while they dry. I like that it comes with an insert that tell you how each brush is recommended to be used. This is  great for any beginners. This set is a great beginners brush set. It has the different types of brushes you will need to compete a look. I personally prefer a flat top brush to apply my foundation and think that shape of a brush is  one that might be an addition that I would like to see in another set.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color combo of this set. The brushes are comfortable in the hand and the most of the brushes are good. The brown bristles brushes are soft and the black and white brushes (synthetic) are the softest. The brushes with the black bristles (natural hair) are stiffer than all the other brushes and not as dense. They are better for powder applications. The fan brush is a bit thin for makeup application, but is good for brushing off any fall out you may have after applying your eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;There is one unique brush which is great to keep in your makeup bag. The lip brush with the cover is perfect. It keeps my brush soft and pliable and protect it form the dust that can get attracted to is from the moisture of my lipstick.&lt;br /&gt; When you get your brushes the larger brushes will have brush guards to protect them which is a need thing when and if you plan on keeping your brushed rolled up in the brush roll to protect your bristle form getting misshapen.&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately my thoughts are: these are good for a travel set since it can be portable and doesn&#x27;t take up much space. The quality is good, but with some improvements in a couple of the brush texture, can be a fantastic set. It is convenient to have a variety of brushes in one spot. There are a couple brushes inthis set which I really enjoy and have been using on a daily basis (eyebrow brush, smudge brush, eye shadow brush and the concealer brush) I do however use some of these brushes for different uses than the suggested use. I received this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or unbiased opinions</li>
            <li> Next best thing to what a professional makeup artist uses!It comes in a nice case as well. Great for a starting makeup artist and makes a really good gift for someone that loves makeup.</li>
            <li> Every woman should have these Professional Makeup Brushes in their makeup kit.  They help make the application of your makeup so much easier and well there is a brush for everything you need in one neat package.  Being able to take them wherever you go in the neat travel pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to see more pictures and a more detailed description, check out my blog.  The blog post can be found here ...  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my makeup kit to facilitate my review and to give my honest opinion.  I received no other compensation.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes a lot. Don&#x27;t care for the blush brush , or I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes.  I should note there&#x27;s a odd smell when opening the case it comes it.  That will probably go away after letting it air out though.  The brushes are good quality and sleek looking.</li>
            <li> I love makeup brushes, believe it or not they are all different so I have lots of them.  I have my favorites but for the most part I use them all. When I was chosen to review these from Petunia Skincare I was so excited. These brushes come in a really nice case that folds flat, yes flat without damaging the brushes. Plus the case has a little zippered pouch on the side for anything you can think of. It closes with a magnetic clasps so it stays closed. But it easily opens as well.&lt;br /&gt;These are the perfect set to take when traveling. Not only is the carrying case compact but includes every brush you need to complete your full face of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are very nice quality. With bristles soft enough to feel good on my face but stiff enough to apply makeup with ease. The bristles are firmly in place and I have seen no shedding or breaking. I love the color burst so they are not the typical black brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I received this set complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.</li>
            <li> This product is first class. I love the bristles, soft and so good</li>
            <li> Good quality... Very nice</li>
            <li> This is my new go to set of brushes for my purse. They are all soft and the brush tips are nice and full. I did receive this product for review. The case is very well made and has taken the full purse abuse and has not broken or cracked. Great Product Petunia Skincare.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best brushes I have tried so far! The quality is great and apply makeup so nicely. I have purchased brushes from other brands and have ran into problems such as shedding and the brushed being a little harsh. This makeup brush set comes with 12 brushes and a cosmetic bag to store your brushes. Another cool thing about this set is that it also comes with brush guards! When I got the opportunity to review these brushes I was so excited! I used the brushes a few times and washed them then I put the brush guard on the brushes and they look and feel just like new! They keep the brush hair in place. I have recreated several makeup looks and these brushes are perfect. I&#x27;m so happy I got these and now they are a valuable asset to my makeup collection. The cosmetic bag that you can store the brushes in is very cute and convenient for travel. Instead of having your brushes all over a bag you can store them securely in the bag and it will protect them from any damage. Another great thing is that the hairs are soft and the quality is top notch. If something was to ever happen to my brushes I would definitely re order and even give a set to my friends!</li>

This is a perfect set of brushes, each have different sizes and shapes. They make it easy to cover different parts of the face with each angle and brush size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The amount you get and the bag that comes with it is like buying the entire set for the price of one Kabuki brush. I am like shocked how crazy that is and still amazed every time I use these because I can&#x27;t really tell a big difference. They apply makeup on every part of the face and eye area, I don&#x27;t need any other set with this in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome kit</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box, there was a chemical scent, it didn&#x27;t bother me much and diminished significantly after having it out a bit. I washed the brushes before using them and let the case set overnight, by morning the smell was completely gone. The brushes arrived in perfect condition (with the exclusion of the fan brush, which was a little rough looking but easily repaired). They are well made, no shedding or loose tops. I am truly impressed with the amazing quality, they are soft, but sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Makeup application is a breeze, they don&#x27;t hold excess product, which would then require you to wash between each application. These brushes are fabulous with distributing product in a simple swipe. The eyeshadow brush seems to apply color much better than my previous brushes; the color actually comes off of the brush and onto your lid without having to apply over and over. I did a test with Petunia Skincare&#x27;s eyeshadow brush vs. another like brush, the results were much better with Petunia Skincare. After use, I brushed each on a towel...So much product came off the other brush, I wondered how any even made it to my eye lid; Petunia Skincare&#x27;s brush had none.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these brushes are fantastic and I am elated to own them. The coloring of the brushes is gorgeous and attractive. The carrying case is simple to roll and easy to lay flat for ease of use. I will use these till there&#x27;s nothing left of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received Petunia Skincare&#x27;s 12 Set Makeup Brush Kit free for review. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.**</li>
            <li> LOTS of shedding on the larger brushes, the rest are nice though.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome and they will last really long if you know how to properly care for them. I am somewhat of a beauty product aficionado and I have a lot of makeup brushes, both high end and inexpensive. But these brushes are off the charts for this great price. They are dense, thick and shaped really well. They are very soft and made of high quality. The bristles are firm enough to hold powder but soft enough that they do not irritate the skin. They don&#x27;t shed which is absolutely amazing. The brushes comes with a carry case which makes them easy to store and adds to the glamour of the brushes. The color of the brushes are beautiful which a combination of magenta and black. These are absolutely the best make up brushes that I have ever used. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review. However the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set!  The makeup brushes that come with makeup are cheap and often fall apart in short time after purchase.  other sets have the bristles falling out of the brushes.  I have NOT experienced any of that with Petunia Skincares Professional 12 set makeup brushes.  They are durable, varied in size and purpose, and look great.  I also like the convenience of the travel case to hold them.  it keeps the brushes organized and protected when not in use.  I recommend!  Although I received complimentary from Petunia, the opinions and experiences are all my own</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. This set is perfect for amateur make up enthusiasts.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of these brushes but unfortunately some of them will leave bristles behind. Get stuck in the cream foundation on your face.</li>
            <li> The little pamphlet has a picture of each brush, and what its used for.  Each brush is individually wrapped in plastic, with guards on the larger fluffier brushes.  There is a very strong paint smell when you open these brushes for the first time, but that goes away with some air, and time. The brush roll, or pouch is a very high quality material and quality made. The best part, the little brush guards to keep the shape, when cleaning and drying your brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flap that covers the brushes, is same material, which is really nice compared to many companies, that don&#x27;t give you the quality material there too.  The only draw back I can say, is that the little compartments where you are to slide each brush into, some of them are larger than need be, I can actually fit more than one brush in them. While this really does not bother me, and I don&#x27;t see it being a problem.  I think it&#x27;s worth noting, maybe you could add in another one of your favorite brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the hot pink and black design, the brushes themselves are solid. I find that some brushes, are just hot glued together, and break very easily, these do not seem to be that way, and each brush is clamped. Making them less likely to endure brush fall out.  I washed each one of the brushes, with some mild baby shampoo before using, and I think maybe 2 or 3 bristles fell out total among all the brushes. Nothing to complain about there, although the large fan brush, I did have to clip one of the bristles off, as it would not stay in place! Again, very minor detail. Each brushes bristles are very soft, or sturdy depending on what the brush is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have not used a couple brushes from this set, but as far as each brush goes. The all over face brush, the largest one is amazing. It is fluffy, and huge. It picks up the product, and disperses it enough to evenly apply product all over your face, without it being concentrated in one area. I like using this one, with my finishingpowder.  I have switched the foundation and blush brush, as I prefer my blush brush to be angled, I use this brush for blending my blush and contour lines together, both brushes are soft, and evenly apply product.  The fan brush, I mostly use for dusting off any fallout from eye shadow. The eyeshadow brush, and smudge brush are the two brushes I use the most, and imagine most will, the only thing I can say, is I do wish the smudge brush was slightly smaller. I have smaller eyes, and a more noticeable crease in my eye lids, which is where I use this brush most, to blend my eye-shadow together. It works very well for that, the brush is so soft and fluffy, and really picks up your shadows, cream, powder, or pressed. They pick up both very evenly, and apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the eye shadow, and smudge brush applied the shadow evenly, and uniformly across my hand. With product coming off, from the start to the end of the stroke.  As far as the eye brow brush and concealer brush. I tend to not use the eye brow one, unless I am spot concealing.  I prefer angled eye brow brushes, the concealer brush I find works perfectly to get in the crease of my nose, and works great for contouring.  The flat eye shadow brush, I don&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It does feel and look as if it is a higher quality sponge though. I just hate these kinds of brushes being included in a set, because the second you use a dark color, you can&#x27;t really clean it. So its like one and done in my mind.  The eyeliner brush is stiff, and long enough to accurately apply any gel liner. The spoolie brush is perfect for brushing out eye lashes, or eye brows, before applying product. My favorite brush is the lip brush, the little case makes me feel so high class!!! and, it helps save money and product by only grabbing what you need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all these brushes retail for $89.99, they sell for  $47.77, I can&#x27;t say I feel like they are worth that price tag, but  they are higher quality and better brushes than a lot out there, for the same set, with price tag, these are the better brushes, if you are trying to choose.  I am very impressed with the design, and quality of these brushes.  Petunia really didn&#x27;t leave anything out here, when making them! Product Received for reviewing purposes.</li>

            <li> Okay, so, these are so amazing that they literally have changed the game for how I put on makeup. It goes so fast, is a much quicker process, and cleanup time is a snap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, yeah, the package had a funny smell. Let it air out. The brushes are what you&#x27;re here for, and that&#x27;s ALL that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, Oh my GOD.. The lip brush. I&#x27;ve used crappy normal lip brushes before, and then I tried this. I put a lip paint on with it. I will never go back to using other things, this brush is so amazing, how the HELL did I ever live without it? I wish I was joking, it&#x27;s just SO AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, when you&#x27;re applying makeup with all of these, GO LIGHT on loading your brush up. EVERYTHING that gets on it is gonna be deposited on your face! I know that it says on here that the brushes will release everything... They aren&#x27;t kidding! The first time I went to smudge, I wound up looking like I was half dead, &#x27;cause I had loaded up WAY too much color. Go easy on it. With these brushes, you&#x27;re going to save SO much as far as product goes. Your makeup products that are super expensive? Get ready for them to last longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, washing them. You barely even have to! Everything just comes right out! These are so wonderful. I have never had brushes this good. And I buy high end makeup brands, why the HELL don&#x27;t they purchase these to stick with their products?! If everyone did, we&#x27;d be so much better off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these to test out, and I am so thrilled. I&#x27;ll be buying extra sets as gifts because I KNOW how good they are. Take the plunge and try them, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for some must-have brushes, I&#x27;ve bought two different sets on amazon I&#x27;ve been left unimpressed. I had REALLY high hopes for these ones, the reviews that were positive convinced me. When I opened and washed them I was sad to feel how light and cheap feeling they are. When I used the powder and foundation brush, the hair stuck to my face. The main reason I bought these were for the softness, there are soft but the brush hair falling out makes that point moot. Maybe over time it&#x27;ll get better, but for now I&#x27;d keep looking for better ones.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!  They are the softest, yet most durable brushes I&#x27;ve owned and I love how they are in their own, cute black carrying case pouch that folds.  It makes it easy to carry these anywhere I go!  The brushes are made with high quality goat hair, pony hair and synthetic hair and applies my makeup without any streaking or marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is the Blush Brush, as I can never find a blush brush that isn&#x27;t cheap or one that comes with the blush and it&#x27;s so little, that you you have to apply blush several times.  These brushes picks up just the right amount of makeup for even distribution.  You get 12 brushes for every single one of your makeup needs!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!!! how love how soft they are and how they really do even out my makeup a lot more than what i was using before!! i would tell everyone that they need this set!! Hello boyfriends and husbands everywhere: this also makes the perfect gift!! *wink wink*</li>
            <li> The Petunia Skincare Professional 12 Set Makeup Brushes come in a fantastic black travel pouch. It&#x27;s soft and sleek to the touch and looks adorable. Although it does smell a little funky at first. The smell eventually fades. Sort of like a new car smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouch has slots for each brush to sit in and a small flap to cover the brushes, protect them, and keep them from falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a variety of brushes that each have their own function, whether it&#x27;s for the eyes, lips, eyelashes, eyebrows, powder, or liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are all very soft to the touch and gentle on the skin. The hair or fibers they&#x27;re  made out of is a great quality. None of the hairs are flyaway or kinked. The brushes are able to leave or drop the makeup onto your skin with precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are lightweight and easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with many of the brushes I&#x27;ve bought breaking away where (for example) the red on the Petunia Skincare brushes meets the black of the handle because the glue doesn&#x27;t hold. I tried pulling apart the brush apart where the red of the handle meets the black of the handle. It didn&#x27;t give way. The glue or what material Petunia Skincare uses to help hold their brushes together held strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of these brushes is impressive. They&#x27;re one of my favorite brush sets to use now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product through a promotion in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and pretty. The pink color is a great contrast to the black handle and bristles. The folding pouch doesn&#x27;t look like a make-up brush pouch but looks like a cute and pretty little purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often get breakouts and skin irritation when using make-up brushes with a slight rough texture. These brushes are so soft that make-up application is easier and I can blend them easily without the streaks. These brushes doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch while I use them. I personally love the eyeliner brush because it&#x27;s thin so I can accurately apply my eyeliner to just the base of my upper lashes to create the no make-up look. All the other brushes are great too and I like how I have the perfect set of brushes in just 1 pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love how I can store them easily and the plastic guards are perfect to keep the brushes in tact. They&#x27;re easy to clean and the brushes doesn&#x27;t come off when I wash them. For those who are not familiar with make-up brushes, there is a flyer/instruction page inside which has a picture of each brush and how or where to use it. I love that because I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m using one or two of the brushes wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are high-quality brushes and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample to inspect, try and review. No other form of compensation was received. All opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I bought myself new make up brushes. Years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was so excited when given the chance to try these for free and review them. I love this set. Look at all those beautiful brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To tell you the truth, there are a couple of brushes here that I&#x27;ve never had before. I had to look up what they were used for. I didn&#x27;t know there was such a thing as a foundation brush but there is and now I have one and even though it will take a little time to get used to using it, I will be using it. Better than using my finger tips like I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush set comes with a nice pouch to keep all the brushes in one place and in good shape. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the smell of the pouch. It had a strong nail polish like odor to it. But hopefully that will fade over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I really liked about these brushes is they were not tested on animals. Petunia Skincare is cruelty free and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. They are good quality and come in a cute pouch. I am very happy with these. I am happy I was able to review them, they are my new favorite.</li>
            <li> To help prevent skin breakouts I&#x27;ve been really strict about keeping my brushes clear, switching them out and not allowing them to be out in the open where dust and irritants can settle on them. Instead of buying individual brushes I&#x27;ve been looking for brush sets, especially ones that come with some sort of brush roll or case to keep everything clean. This one turned out to be really nice in quality and softness. The handles on each brush are not flimsy but instead nicely weighted and feel substantial. The  ferrule and heel which feels like metal does not budge and none of the synthetic bristles have shed from any of the brushes. The length of the handles is interesting because they&#x27;re in-between travel size and my standard pro brushes. These seem as if they&#x27;re going to last a long time and hold up well to washing and disinfecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the 12 pieces are usable although personal favorites are the large and super soft powder brush, the angled blush brush which is the perfect slightly flat shape for contouring as well and the fluffy blending brushes for the eye. The only brush which was slightly disappointing was the fan brush. The bristles were oddly not cut uniformly the way they are on all the other pieces and it&#x27;s too thin to do very much. I still like to use it to gently sweep away fall out and extra setting powder from under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also you&#x27;re going to have to set the entire brush roll and brushes outside or in an open window to air them out. They came with a strong chemical odor of some sort which did go away after an airing and washing. Other than that, a really nice brush set for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petunia Skincare sent a free sample for review.</li>
            <li> I got this free to try from Tomoson, and i really like it! These makeup brushes are really soft. I gave some to my friend who also frequently puts on make up, and she loves them too! The carrying case that comes with these brushes is really adorable. Everything is also super visually appealing.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these make up brushes! They work so well with applying your product and they are so cute ! People say that they have a harsh odor to them when you first get them and honestly it&#x27;s not as bad as everyone is making It out to be, they&#x27;re brand new it&#x27;s expected.  All I did was take the out of the pouch and put them all in a glass jar for a day or two to let them air out...and they are perfectly fine!!</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for makeup and always buy when I don’t really need it and the same goes for brushes. I think that I have about a little over 50 brushes. It may not see like a lot but to me it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this brush set comes with 12 brushes and this case for them to fit in, which I really like because it’s great for traveling and throwing in my gym bag for after my workouts when I have somewhere to go. It’s also great for a makeup artist to have with them in their kit. They are synthetic brushes, so no ANIMAL hair here, which I prefer because I don’t like using products that have or contain Animal Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Who does not like trying new makeup brushes!? If you are a makeup lover, you are a makeup brush lover as well! There, I said it! New addition to my brush collection is a Professional Makeup Brush Kit by Petunia Scincare. The kit comes with 12 handmade brushes housed in a compact and durable branded travel pouch which is perfect for traveling. The brushes are very pretty, they have silky matte black handles with their logo on each handle and metallic pink ferrules. The bristles are either natural (high quality pony hair or goat hair) or synthetic. Synthetic brushes are great for liquid-based makeup, while natural hair brushes pick up and distribute powder makeup evenly and smoothly. I was quite surprised with the good performance of these brushes. They are comfortable to hold, soft and gentle on the face, and overall they do what they are supposed to do. There is also information booklet included, where you can find information how to use the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Spoolie Brush: I never use a spoolie brush for my eyelashes. If I have to separate them I will use either the mascara wand or a comb brush. However I use a spoolie brush every single day to brush my brows into place and this one works just as any other of its kind. It is not rough, it does not irritate the area around my brows and it looks so much prettier than my regular black spoolie brush.&lt;br /&gt;Lip Brush: This brush comes with a metal cap that could be attached on the top of it for more control. However the small and compact size is comfortable enough to hold in the hand, and the rounded shape of the bristles provides really precise application. I like it better than my current black lip brush, because this one is much cuter.&lt;br /&gt;Sponge Applicator: Last time I have used a sponge applicator was probably in 2009. I am not a fan of them and still wonder why they include them in a makeup brush kits. Instead they should have included a blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;Eyeliner Brush: This kind of eyeliner brushes have always been useless to me, because I use angled brush to line my eyes. However I used this brush to apply dark metallic blue eyeshadow across my upper and lower eyelashes and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow Brush: For filling in my eyebrows, I like to use an angled brush with a bristles way shorter than the one included in the kit. This way I have way more control and the whole filling process is quicker and easier when the bristles are a little shorter.&lt;br /&gt;Concealer Brush: I use this brush mainly for applying highlighter in the inner corner of my eyes and it works great because is small, and it fits perfect there.The brush is also good for applying concealer around the lips for a nice and clean look, and for covering a little imperfections on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Fan Brush: This fan brush is ideal for applying highlighter on my cheek bones. It also works great for cleaning eyeshadow fall out even though I would prefer a large fan brush for this job, because it&#x60;s easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;Smudge Brush: I use this brush to apply shadow to my crease and because of its shape is also good for applying shadow to the outer V of the lid. Overall this is a nice brush for creating a smokey eye look.&lt;br /&gt;Eyeshadow Brush: This large eyeshadow brush is ideal for applying colors evenly all over the lid providing full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation Brush: I am not a fan of flat painting foundation brushes like this one. However I still use it under my eye area for setting up my concealer with powder and it works just fine. Even if I was using it as foundation brush, I still think that is too small and it will take a long time to achieve a perfect blended foundation all over.&lt;br /&gt;Blush Brush: I found this kind of angled brushes very comfortable and easy to use for contouring. The fluffy bristles distribute the color evenly without blotchy results or streaks. Its angled shape is ideal for applying bronzer in the hollow of the cheekbones, down the sides of the nose, underneath the chin, in the depth of the temples, and along the hairline. This was the only brush from the kit that seemed to shed while I was giving her a bath, but had no problems with shedding afterward.&lt;br /&gt;Powder Brush: When it comes to powder brush I like it as large as possible. This brush is with the size of a blush brush, that is why I started using it for applying a powder blush and it works well. It is very soft and fluffy and applies the blush easy and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am satisfied with the 12 set Makeup Brush Kit by Petunia Skincare. The brushes are very well made, easy to clean, they dry fast and keep their shape after washing. They also have no smell however the ones made from goat hair stink only when they are wet. This brush kit has nice variety of brushes that would be enough to take with me while traveling. I would probably also bring additional foundation brush, large powder brush, blending brush and a eyeliner brush. If you are new to makeup and wonder what kind of brushes would be good for you, I would suggest looking into this Makeup Brush Kit by Petunia Skincare. These cute brushes also make a perfect gift for any girl who wears makeup. The kit arrives in a nice branded box which makes it look presentable and high end. There are also brush guards included in the box that help your brushes maintain shape and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________&lt;br /&gt;I received this brushes complimentary for testing purposes.

            <li> I have not used all the brushes but I Sid put them to the test by washing  a few and seeing if the shapers work and.... It DID I was amazed because I never had any brushes like this personally so I was impressed and I would recommend this product when I first received the bag it did smell so I had to let it air out and after that every thing smelled fine I loved the brushes and the color and the shipping for me was quick.</li>
            <li> I was offered the opportunity to review this product at no charge. My experience with these brushes is that the case is convenient and the selection of brushes is very good. I like the smaller brushes for my brows and the blush brushes apply my powder blush smoothly. The set also comes with eye shadow applicator and a spindle brush. Great selection of brushes for many uses.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a brush set, or need a good gift to give a special girl in your life, I highly recommend this set! This set has everything you need for a full makeup application and is very high quality. I think it will last a very long time too. This is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with 12 brushes and a nice case. You can see in the top photo what brushes the set contains. The box also has an insert describing each brush with information about what materials the brush is made of and what it is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are VERY good quality. I have a brush set from Sephora, Avon, the drug store etc. and these are better quality. My Sephora set was actually about the same price as this and only included half the brushes AND are travel size! If you&#x27;ve never shopped for makeup brushes before this price is truly a steal for a set like this! Each brush has a wooden handle; all brushes are made with either pony hair, goat hair, or synthetic hair to give you the best application per brush type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most amazing things about these brushes is how well they apply the product, and how clean they come just from using them. I almost always have to clean my brushes after using especially my foundation brush. I am still in awe at how much of the product went onto my face and stayed off the brush. I feel I will save money and my products will last longer because I will not need to put as much on the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My absolute favorite of the brushes are the foundation brush (10), eyeshadow brush (9), and smudge brush (8).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation brush (10): Love this! I typically use a stiffer foundation brush for my liquid foundation but this brush actually works better. The hairs spread more so it covers a bigger area, and the angle lets me get into little spaces around my nose and under my eyes. Also, the product goes onto your face, and doesn&#x27;t stick to the hairs of the brush. When you are done the brush is very close to being clean &amp; dry. I was amazed at how much of the product blended into my face vs. stuck to the brush. It appeared like none was left on the brush at all. This is my new favorite brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeshadow brush (9) &amp; smudge brush (8): Again, LOVE these. Way better quality than my other brushes, even my Urban Decay brushes. One swipe and the brush is coated. I had very little fallout (which is partially due to using good quality eyeshadow). What separates these brushes from some of the others I&#x27;ve used is application &amp; blendability. When you put the eyeshadow on your lids it covers easily (vs. coming off all at once immediately where you touch). I guess I&#x27;m trying to say when I swiped my lid it was evenly coated with product, versus very heavy where I started &amp; light at the end of the swipe. I used the smudge brush in the crease with since it is smaller and I could really blend the darker colors and control where I was pulling the color to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the spool brush (1) to shape my brows and comb out eye lashes before mascara application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use the lip brush as a travel concealer brush since it is covered. It&#x27;s of similar material and I use gloss or balm for the most part. I&#x27;m fair and lipstick is way intense for the most part as I like a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not probably use the sponge applicator (3) and liked this least of all because I Do not like sponge brushes. I would like this to be swapped with either a second smudge brush OR a very small smudge brush that I could use as a brow highlighter, brow filler, or to apply more precise eyeshadow around the lashline/in the crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the eyeliner brush (4) on powdered eyeshadow. I used the darkest shade as a liner. I&#x27;ve been doing this more &amp; more for a natural look. It highlights the lashline without being as intense as mascara. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the brush picked up because it is a thin brush. It worked way better than I thought it would. I think it would pick up gel &amp; liquid very well. It probably isn&#x27;t stiff/strong enough to pick up color from a pencil BUT I haven&#x27;t tried that yet so I&#x27;m not sure. Very happy with how thin but distinct the line was that this brush made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow brush (5) is not one I would use on eyebrows. I use powder to fill in my brows because I feel it gives the most natural look. I felt it deposited the powder right where I first touched &amp; it didn&#x27;t blend well. I would, however, use this as a concealer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that the concealer brush (6) is angled. I have been applying my eye shadow and cleaning up the crease with concealer before doing a pale lid. This is a fun new technique (to me) that really makes a pale lid pop against crease makeup. I will have to post photos in My Stuff section for fun. Anyway, the brush really can create a clean line. Also, it is great for cleaning up makeup at the end of the eye. I have hooded eyes and if my darker shadow goes too far past where my eye ends it can make my eyes look smaller. This brush is good at helping make sure the edges of my eyeshadow are cleaned up at a nice angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fan brush (7) would be great for bronzer &amp; highlighter. I haven&#x27;t used it yet just because I haven&#x27;t went all out on my makeup lately (who am I kidding I have barely been wearing it because we have been stuck in from the cold/illness). but it looks thin enough that it wouldn&#x27;t pick up too much product. The shape appears like it would help to distribute the product &amp; contour very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blush brush (11) worked really good picking up my cream blush &amp; distributing it. It looked natural and blended the blush into my foundation easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the powder brush (12) yet. My skin is very dry and I mostly use cream &amp; liquid makeups. I would use this to blend out my makeup as a finishing touch more than I would to apply powder. The brush itself seems to be of very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. #sponsored I still LOVED this set!

            <li> Love my brushes!!! The case does have a funny smell upon arrival but it didn&#x27;t affect the quality of the brushes. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing a set for my sister and mom.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, great for travelling I needed a new set. Application of makeup goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set! It comes in a lovely compact bag that easily fits in your purse or bag. The brush are silky soft and you have one for everything! Really it is a wonderful set of brushes and is perfect for a gift or if you don&#x27;t have brushes, get these. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup brush set! It comes in the cutest, most convenient little carrying case. This set is perfect for beginners as it has one of every brush you might need. It also comes with a pamphlet explaining each brush and what they are used for. They come with brush guards as well, to keep the bristles in place after washing them. The bushes are very good quality too! You can just tell that they are made well when you hold them. The handles are nice and solid and The brushes are so soft, I haven&#x27;t noticed a single hair shedding which is great. It can be quite annoying when your brushes are falling apart while you&#x27;re trying to apply your makeup, but not to worry that won&#x27;t happen with Petunia Skincare&#x27;s Makeup Brushes! I am quite pleased with this brush set and i would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! They will not leave little hairs on your face while applying your make up. They are all extremly soft and wont irritate your skin. They come in a cute little plether case and would make a great gift! I cant say enough great things about these brushes. Dont believe me?!? Try for yourself! You wont be disappointed! Theres brushes in this set that you never know you needed. They are great!</li>
            <li> These brushes are Great!!!  The durability on how they are built and the style are perfect.  I love the color to them also, thou I first I thought it was going to be too much Pink for me since I don&#x27;t like the color Pink.  But they are not, there more like a Red color and I love them.  I really like the portability also and the case they come in.  Someone had reviewed that the sleeves in the case are too loose and you can add other brushes to the pockets.  I was liking that idea so I can add some other thin brushes I have but that is not the case; not much wiggle room in there.  They are very soft and feel nice on the skin when using them. The new smell to it when they arrived wasn&#x27;t too bad either, a few days to air out and no more smell.  I washed them first as suggested and only lost a few bristles but nothing major.  I would definitely recommend these brushes!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these brushes 4 star just because I haven&#x27;t actually used them .. but they seem Well made and the price is great ..variety of brushes for make up users .</li>
