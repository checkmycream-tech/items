            <li>I sure hope you have it all the time...</li>
            <li>I gobbed on the hydrating conditioner, which also smells like industrial cleaner, and was able to work most of the tangles out.</li>

            <li>Love the feel and texture and smell of this conditioner.</li>

            <li>omg so glad to find this stuff online.</li>
            <li>the Hemp conditioner has done more for my hair than anything else i could spend money on.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Love it rinses without feeling heavy or sticky and being a product of the sixties I love the smell of patchouli keeps hair soft shiny and moist the shipping was great and a real good price too will buy again</li>
            <li>The smell was WAY to strong for me and it lasted for a couple of days, I ended up giving it away..</li>
            <li>the smell was so strong</li>
            <li>Merchant, manufacturer&#x27;s may want to ADD a pump for this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2: STRONG scent.</li>
            <li>This hemp product is just about the only shampoo/conditioner i would put on my beautiful head.</li>
            <li>This is an exceptional conditioner, not only does it smell amazing</li>
            <li>Strong odor, not unpleasant - but definitely better suited as a mens product than womens.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fine, but will not buy the conditioner again.</li>
            <li>Makes my fine hair feel fuller and healthier.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair smell good and very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I will continue to buy it in the future!</li>
            <li>so far so good..</li>
            <li>you just can&#x27;t beat that super clean smell. :)</li>
            <li>Not user friendly texture.</li>
            <li>The best part is its not too heavy!</li>
            <li>the smell is so fresh!  </li>
            <li>I am basing most of this review off the experience of my wife and children since I do not have much</li>
            <li>Sorry, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a wonderful product</li>
            <li>so i cut the bottle and put the conditioner in a plastic container with a screw top, so doesn&#x27;t dry and  is easy to use!</li>
            <li>A new family favorite.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty much full and just sits under my sink:/</li>
            <li>The smell is great and leaves my hair so soft and actually helps my hair grow</li>
            <li>makes hair soft and has a strong scent which I like</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>This product is also very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I totally thought this was Hempz brand, which is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel it hydrated my hair any better than the brand I was already using prior.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be rather challenging to get the conditioner out of the bottle once it starts to run low.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and the scent is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>perhaps this might work better as a once a month hair mask, definitely not daily.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;can not find this product locally any more</li>
            <li>Our household is currently obsessed with all things HEMP regarding toiletries - shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion, etc - we find this product wonderful.</li>
            <li>Ive used headnshoulder till i switched to garnier natural clean, but both were poopy</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product and it made my hair feel super soft after using it only once.</li>
            <li>A smell more likely associated with medicinal properties (hint of tea tree?) and VERY MASCULINE.</li>
            <li>I really like HEMPZ products</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use to much ...</li>
            <li>NOT a scent a woman wants.</li>
            <li>Very similar to the hempz conditioner that is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner I&#x27;ve been using it for a while.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>but it really works.  </li>
            <li>it feels like a deep conditioner- super rich and creamy leaving my hair silky and smooth with much less frizz.</li>
            <li>could smell a little better but makes my hair super soft...</li>
            <li>It was delivered before expected, and the smell tends to be more masculine.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We had been using inexpensive (packed full of chemicals) shampoo and conditioner for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have a house full of girls with long hair.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very sensitive to some smells ..</li>
            <li>I will say though that my hair is so soft after!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell may be a little strong when using in the shower, but my wife and kids say they do not seem to mind it.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong, and it&#x27;s not a good smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is on the dry side due to coloring and this shampoo/conditioner combo makes my hair so soft and healthy feeling without a oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to tangle very easy, especially since it is down to the middle of their backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does well for detangling and not heavy.</li>
            <li>but my hair wasn&#x27;t heavenly soft afterward.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair soft for days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 years young.  </li>
            <li>My hubby loves it but a bit too masculine for me.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered Hemp after a hair bleaching experiment that left me with broken straw growing out of the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Even better, by hair is considered medium-long, I only have to use less than a dime size to condition all of my hair starting with the ends working up to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>This knock off conditioner is too thick and heavy compared to the real thing, but it does leave my hair soft and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li>The first few washes were fine, but it quickly dried my hair out.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a different brand, but I was pleasantly surprised at</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling really soft..</li>
            <li>I have long hair and this helps keep it moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>my girls have very long hair, we use the matching shampoo and with this conditioner their hair is so silky soft after it dries.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do not need very much of it though, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair soft and the scent is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> perhaps this might work better as a once a month hair mask, definitely not daily.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;can not find this product locally any more</li>
            <li> Our household is currently obsessed with all things HEMP regarding toiletries - shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion, etc - we find this product wonderful.</li>
            <li> Ive used headnshoulder till i switched to garnier natural clean, but both were poopy</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product and it made my hair feel super soft after using it only once.</li>
            <li> A smell more likely associated with medicinal properties (hint of tea tree?) and VERY MASCULINE.</li>
            <li> I really like HEMPZ products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use to much ...</li>
            <li> NOT a scent a woman wants.</li>
            <li> Very similar to the hempz conditioner that is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner I&#x27;ve been using it for a while.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> but it really works.  </li>
            <li> it feels like a deep conditioner- super rich and creamy leaving my hair silky and smooth with much less frizz.</li>
            <li> could smell a little better but makes my hair super soft...</li>
            <li> It was delivered before expected, and the smell tends to be more masculine.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We had been using inexpensive (packed full of chemicals) shampoo and conditioner for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have a house full of girls with long hair.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very sensitive to some smells ..</li>
            <li> I will say though that my hair is so soft after!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell may be a little strong when using in the shower, but my wife and kids say they do not seem to mind it.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong, and it&#x27;s not a good smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the dry side due to coloring and this shampoo/conditioner combo makes my hair so soft and healthy feeling without a oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to tangle very easy, especially since it is down to the middle of their backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does well for detangling and not heavy.</li>
            <li> but my hair wasn&#x27;t heavenly soft afterward.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair soft for days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years young.  </li>
            <li> My hubby loves it but a bit too masculine for me.  </li>
            <li> I first discovered Hemp after a hair bleaching experiment that left me with broken straw growing out of the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Even better, by hair is considered medium-long, I only have to use less than a dime size to condition all of my hair starting with the ends working up to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> This knock off conditioner is too thick and heavy compared to the real thing, but it does leave my hair soft and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li> The first few washes were fine, but it quickly dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a different brand, but I was pleasantly surprised at</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling really soft..</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this helps keep it moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> my girls have very long hair, we use the matching shampoo and with this conditioner their hair is so silky soft after it dries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do not need very much of it though, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As ones body changes naturally, at middle age our hair tends to change texture, with unmanageable gray hairs refusing to curl or lay flat.  </li>
            <li> but i decided to grow my hair to donate (which is now long enough to touch my chest)</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and prefer moisturizing products to help my curls be less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It help me get the tangles out of my long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner works wonders on my long wavy hair</li>
            <li> it makes my hair like stings and my hair is long</li>
            <li> Not only did it bring my ghostly locks back from the dead but brought it back to the herculean hair</li>
            <li> So disappointed because I love the hemp body wash and lotion!</li>
            <li> My hair feels a lot different compared to shampooing with other moisturizing shampoos that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair moisturized in this dry climate.</li>
            <li> I do have dry hair to begin with, and this may work for someone else.  </li>
            <li> Leaves may hair feeling dry and lackluster.</li>
            <li> it just felt like it left it dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> The scent is heavenly, and the conditioning attributes are as expected.</li>
            <li> Hair is left tangled mess and feeling like straw!</li>
            <li> The smell on the other hand is something I will have to get used to.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed the shampoo out, my hair was a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair became very dry and dull after I use this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am going to use this all because I don&#x27;t want to waste the money.  </li>
            <li> know 30 % of the bottle will be wasted.</li>
            <li> Like the product BUT in this large size bottle, very difficult to squeeze out</li>
            <li> It is a large bottle, and the conditioner very thick and difficult to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> this large bottle, nearly impossible...</li>
            <li> Your hair will small minty / like hemp oil.</li>
            <li> I have small bottle and the texture of the conditioner</li>
            <li> but it is easier to squeeze the small one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually spend upwards of fourty dollars on conditioner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is too thick and will not easy come out from the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get out of bottle.</li>
            <li> gave it away too too thick hard to use in shower</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is so difficult to get the conditioner out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!!</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick conditioner</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is not great at all, I use it 2 times a week just to use it up.  </li>
            <li> its thick and  difficult to use it from the bottle</li>
            <li> this is just too thick, almost impossible to get out of bottle with one hand while you&#x27;re in the shower.  </li>
            <li> waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> I made a mistake and bought this rather expensive product thinking it was the &amp;#34;Hempz&amp;#34; line of shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed!</li>
            <li> therefore I was unable to return</li>
            <li> Not especially conditioning and the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is difficult to extract from bottle as packaged.</li>
            <li> Very bad results and not very healthy.</li>
            <li> The bottle is made out of a really hard plastic, which makes it IMPOSSIBLE to squeeze the conditioner out!</li>
            <li> I used it anyway, and found it to be a terrible product.</li>
            <li> Horrible hydration!</li>
            <li> Smells terrible - like a combination of laundry soap, cleaning solution and perfume.</li>
            <li> - it is still terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is so awesome I just love it ..I sure hope you have it all the time...I would recomend it any time...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I have long hair and this helps keep it moisturized and soft. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down. I will never buy another kind of conditioner.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair moisturized in this dry climate.</li>
            <li> I totally thought this was Hempz brand, which is my favorite lotion. This is definitely a different brand, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well I liked it. It&#x27;s a great unisex shampoo/conditioner that smells like a hair salon. Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> makes hair soft and has a strong scent which I like</li>
            <li> The smell was WAY to strong for me and it lasted for a couple of days, I ended up giving it away.. Sorry, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a wonderful product but just wasn&#x27;t for me, I&#x27;m very sensitive to some smells ..</li>
            <li> I made a mistake and bought this rather expensive product thinking it was the &amp;#34;Hempz&amp;#34; line of shampoos and conditioners. I used it anyway, and found it to be a terrible product. I have naturally curly hair and prefer moisturizing products to help my curls be less frizzy. This shampoo is not hydrating at all! It smells like industrial cleaner and it stripped my hair of any moisture. When I rinsed the shampoo out, my hair was a tangled mess. I thought this was a &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; product! I gobbed on the hydrating conditioner, which also smells like industrial cleaner, and was able to work most of the tangles out. But after drying my hair, found it was still stripped of moisture. I am not impressed! Will never buy again. I have used dollar store brands that performed better than this product. Be warned!</li>
            <li> Reduce my frizz smells herbal</li>
            <li> Very thick. It&#x27;s hard to get out of bottle. My granddaughter loves the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Like the product BUT in this large size bottle, very difficult to squeeze out conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Squeezing a tube was no problem...this large bottle, nearly impossible...so now what to do?</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your hair so soft. My favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this thinking it will smell at all like Hempz...it doesn&#x27;t. (But in their defense, they never said it did) Strong odor, not unpleasant - but definitely better suited as a mens product than womens.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product... could smell a little better but makes my hair super soft...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel it hydrated my hair any better than the brand I was already using prior.  It is a large bottle, and the conditioner very thick and difficult to get out of the bottle.  I do have dry hair to begin with, and this may work for someone else.  It was delivered before expected, and the smell tends to be more masculine.</li>
            <li> I am basing most of this review off the experience of my wife and children since I do not have much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell may be a little strong when using in the shower, but my wife and kids say they do not seem to mind it. Once your hair dries however it smells quite different. It is not over powering thus smelling very nice in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be rather challenging to get the conditioner out of the bottle once it starts to run low. It is a very thick conditioner and I imagine this is the possible reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not need very much of it though, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my girls have very long hair, we use the matching shampoo and with this conditioner their hair is so silky soft after it dries. It also seems to make it easier to brush their hair. My children have very fine hair and it seems to tangle very easy, especially since it is down to the middle of their backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had been using inexpensive (packed full of chemicals) shampoo and conditioner for a long time. Very bad results and not very healthy. I will no longer be using shampoo and conditioners like that. This product seems to be a good fit for our family. We are very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review and I hope it helped you</li>
            <li> I opened the plastic seal on this product... therefore I was unable to return it!!!!&lt;br /&gt; And before I went to use the Conditioner I put some in my hand and the smell was so strong&lt;br /&gt;of a sterile medical and plastic odor that I never even put it on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Huge waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> I am going to use this all because I don&#x27;t want to waste the money.  I really like HEMPZ products and I thought this was one, completely different company.  This conditioner is not great at all, I use it 2 times a week just to use it up.  Not especially conditioning and the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> Smells oh so good!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!...  it works great!!! considering that the bacteria doesn&#x27;t like hemp so is healthy for my hair... I don&#x27;t have to use to much ...its thick and  difficult to use it from the bottle so i cut the bottle and put the conditioner in a plastic container with a screw top, so doesn&#x27;t dry and  is easy to use!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, and does not feel like it strips your hair of its oil. Your hair will small minty / like hemp oil.</li>
            <li> Hydrates as promised but has very strong scent.  Not a hemp smell but floral.  It does well for detangling and not heavy.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Works good too. Nice price!! Will be buying again!!!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is too thick and will not easy come out from the bottle. The bottle is big and takes both hands to press to get anything out. Taking cup off helps. I have small bottle and the texture of the conditioner is the same but it is easier to squeeze the small one.&lt;br /&gt;I know 30 % of the bottle will be wasted. I do not understand why QA control let it out. Not user friendly texture. Especially for e big bottle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do proper research and didn&#x27;t pay attention so I didn&#x27;t realize it is not the official HEMPZ brand.  This knock off conditioner is too thick and heavy compared to the real thing, but it does leave my hair soft and smelling nice.  (I&#x27;d pick the official HEMPZ brand over this any day regardless of price difference).</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong, and it&#x27;s not a good smell. The first few washes were fine, but it quickly dried my hair out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Loved the way this makes my hair feel and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> Horrible hydration! Hair is left tangled mess and feeling like straw! So disappointed because I love the hemp body wash and lotion! Definitely needs to be reformulated! Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!!</li>
            <li> Smells terrible - like a combination of laundry soap, cleaning solution and perfume. I tried it three times to see if the scent would grow on me - but nope - it is still terrible. What a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Realized I can buy this cheaper at TJ Max but this shampoo is absolutely my favorite! Love the smell and feel of my hair after use of both this and the shampoo (:</li>
            <li> product as promised.  Fast delivery!  AAA+++</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  It help me get the tangles out of my long curly hair.  Have used this product for a while and just love it!</li>
            <li> I love this Conditioner.  It leaves my hair soft and the scent is fantastic.  My son tried it and loves it as well.  This is a great product and I will continue to buy it in the future!</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes your hair smell good and very soft.</li>
            <li> This hemp product is just about the only shampoo/conditioner i would put on my beautiful head. The shine, the texture, the smell, the weed (lol just kidding), its simply the best stuff i use. Im a guy so all i was used to was headnshoulder, but i decided to grow my hair to donate (which is now long enough to touch my chest) and i wanted to keep it healthy for the donation. Ive used headnshoulder till i switched to garnier natural clean, but both were poopy cause it just felt like it left it dry and stiff. I moved over to hemp cause i beleive in the great stuff hemp can do and what do you know. Now my mom and sister hopped on hemp aswell after using more top of the line products. Highly recomend this.</li>
            <li> this is just too thick, almost impossible to get out of bottle with one hand while you&#x27;re in the shower.  The shampoo is fine, but will not buy the conditioner again.</li>
            <li> Made my hair shiny and cleaned also smells great &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Good product, would buy again</li>
            <li> Product seems to work well. Heavier conditioner than many on the market - A Good Thing!&lt;br /&gt;Two points, tho: 1. Conditioner is difficult to extract from bottle as packaged. Merchant, manufacturer&#x27;s may want to ADD a pump for this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2: STRONG scent. A smell more likely associated with medicinal properties (hint of tea tree?) and VERY MASCULINE. NOT a scent a woman wants. Consider change</li>
            <li> This is junk! It&#x27;s my fault for not reading the label correctly! It&#x27;s not Hemptz.......it&#x27;s junk.....save your money...read the label.....don&#x27;t be fooled......gave it to a friend for her dog&#x27;</li>
            <li> It worked well but it&#x27;s not a life changer. I like how big the bottle was and the smell but my hair wasn&#x27;t heavenly soft afterward. I&#x27;ll probably try something else when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product and is  always on time took  it 2-3 days .  I have gotten this product twice with the same results</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Very similar to the hempz conditioner that is no longer available.  A new family favorite.  Does a great job at conditioning.  Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This is the best product. I usually spend upwards of fourty dollars on conditioner. Now we don&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner works wonders on my long wavy hair it feels like a deep conditioner- super rich and creamy leaving my hair silky and smooth with much less frizz. The best part is its not too heavy! I&#x27;ve yet to notice build up of any kind (I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now)... I&#x27;ve been using both the shampoo and conditioner together. My holy grail hair product!!</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. The reason for my 2 star review is based on the container it comes in! The bottle is made out of a really hard plastic, which makes it IMPOSSIBLE to squeeze the conditioner out! They need to redesign this and make it easier. Maybe with a pump? I couldn&#x27;t even use all of it because it was a struggle every time! Its pretty much full and just sits under my sink:/</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product and it made my hair feel super soft after using it only once. I would def recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I have used many conditioners but this is by far the best one I have ever used! Leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Leaves may hair feeling dry and lackluster.</li>
            <li> Makes my fine hair feel fuller and healthier. Love the feel and texture and smell of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting the Hempz brand. These made my scalp itch, I threw them away.</li>
            <li> so far so good.. I tried it last night and i have to say im pretty impressed.. Left my hair feeling really soft.. The smell on the other hand is something I will have to get used to.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing shampoo that smells great.  I also bought the accompanying conditioner that works great too.  My hair feels a lot different compared to shampooing with other moisturizing shampoos that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve found for my color-treated hair</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome, I love it and will be buying more</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it is the best product for my hair.  My stylist recommended it because my hair needs hydration and it works!</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner I&#x27;ve been using it for a while. It really does work. It keeps my hair hydrated and soft. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional conditioner, not only does it smell amazing but it really works.  My hair is on the dry side due to coloring and this shampoo/conditioner combo makes my hair so soft and healthy feeling without a oily feeling.  My son who has oily hair also uses this shampoo/conditioner because it helps remove the excess oil without drying out his hair.  This product is also very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I love both the shampoo and conditioner. I had used it before, but couldn&#x27;t find it again locally, really happy I found it with you</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair. And I have to use a great deal to even make it thru my hair. And when it come time to brush it there are a ton of knots and tangles. I don&#x27;t recommend this for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, smells great, makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> very good, love the fragance</li>
            <li> gave it away too too thick hard to use in shower</li>
            <li> Does not come out of container. Have to cut the top out and but it in plastic container. Very thick. Does not have a nice scent. perhaps this might work better as a once a month hair mask, definitely not daily.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel!  And I joke to my friends, it mellows me out but makes me hungry for cheeto&#x27;s...LOL</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!!! It smells so good and it leaves my hair soft for days</li>
            <li> Love the smell &amp; feel of my hair after washing!</li>
            <li> i will forever buy this conditioner. The smell is great and leaves my hair so soft and actually helps my hair grow</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  It leaves my hair shiny, smooth and smelling wonderful even the day after.  It seems to have disappeared from the stores locally so I was happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and rinse.  Hair smells beautiful for days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years young.  As ones body changes naturally, at middle age our hair tends to change texture, with unmanageable gray hairs refusing to curl or lay flat.  This product has made my hair softer, brought back the shine of my youth and the smell is so fresh!  Even better, by hair is considered medium-long, I only have to use less than a dime size to condition all of my hair starting with the ends working up to the scalp.  I will never use another product again!  This one ROCKS!</li>
            <li> Sally Beauty stopped carrying this product for some reason.  This stuff is the best, it smells amazing.  I have a house full of girls with long hair.  This stuff ROCKS!  Im thankful im able to purchase it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love it rinses without feeling heavy or sticky and being a product of the sixties I love the smell of patchouli keeps hair soft shiny and moist the shipping was great and a real good price too will buy again</li>
            <li> Not as good as Alterna. My hair became very dry and dull after I use this shampoo and conditioner. yikes.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair like stings and my hair is long and it all gets strung together. dont like it!</li>
            <li> i like the way the product makes our hair feel and i had no problems with the shipment&lt;br /&gt;can not find this product locally any more</li>
            <li> omg so glad to find this stuff online. the Hemp conditioner has done more for my hair than anything else i could spend money on. I first discovered Hemp after a hair bleaching experiment that left me with broken straw growing out of the top of my head. Not only did it bring my ghostly locks back from the dead but brought it back to the herculean hair it was before my foray into chemistry. plus- you just can&#x27;t beat that super clean smell. :)</li>
            <li> Smells kind of after shave to me.  My hubby loves it but a bit too masculine for me.  I will say though that my hair is so soft after!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and makes my hair feel. My only complaint is that it is so difficult to get the conditioner out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Our household is currently obsessed with all things HEMP regarding toiletries - shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion, etc - we find this product wonderful. The scent is heavenly, and the conditioning attributes are as expected. We would recommend!</li>
