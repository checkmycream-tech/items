            <li>MY CONCERNS WERE FULLY SATISFIED</li>
            <li>BUYING THIS PRODUCT AT THE COSMETIC COUNTER WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING.</li>

            <li>this is a hard to find designer fragrance that is a good product at a very good price</li>
            <li>a good product as expected and very good would that offered a gift for each product purchasing and so motivate more users 100% recommend this particular product</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest, before buying any Must de Cartier EdT to check discussions on Basenotes.com to see which formulation you will prefer.  </li>
            <li>I love it, get many compliments when I wear it, and can&#x27;t say enough good things about Cartier frangrances.</li>

            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have not tried their content but their appearance can be said is right.</li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>Better yet, if you can find samples of the different formulations, testing each can aid in your decision as well.</li>

            <li> I abruptly had to ask my friend \\&quot;what is the fragrance you are wearing?\\</li>
            <li> No sweet floral which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Not sure why .</li>
            <li> I was so sad to hear it was being discontinued.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think its a fake.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> It is the worst perfume for women.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a &amp;#34;signature fragrance&amp;#34; for some time.  MUST DE CARTIER is a contender because it is clean, has staying power, a bit woodsy yet feminine.  I&#x27;m a redhead and find that fragrances do not &amp;#34;STAY&amp;#34; on me.  This one does.  A. J. Marcus</li>
            <li> It is the worst perfume for women. I didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite...need to buy the perfume when I finish saving my pennies...This is a light exotic heady cashmere warm scent, undertones with vanilla.</li>
            <li> this is a hard to find designer fragrance that is a good product at a very good price</li>
            <li> What can I say about this Eau De Toilette by Cartier.  I absolutely love it. There&#x27;s no perfume that can compare to this one. One squirt per day and it lasts all day.  This 3.4 oz bottle will last me more than a year and at Amazon it is half the price that sells for retail in the department stores.</li>
            <li> It was not as strong as I would have liked should have ordered eau du parfume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always tough to buy perfume online, because you cannot really see the bottle.  The picture depicted above may not always be exactly what you&#x27;re purchasing.  With Must de Cartier, it makes a difference.  According to Basenotes.com, there are about 4 different formulations of Must de Cartier, and they all smell different:    1.  1981 Original EdT (usually came in a leather case)  2.  1981 Original Parfum  3.  1996 reformulated EdT (frosted glass bottle with metal cap)  4.  2005 reformulated EdT (red box with white lettering, red cap)    I&#x27;ve sampled the 2005 EdT and the Parfum, and I found them to be different, but both powdery/amber vanilla takes on musk, with maybe a little manly galbanum bite.  I strongly suggest, before buying any Must de Cartier EdT to check discussions on Basenotes.com to see which formulation you will prefer.  Better yet, if you can find samples of the different formulations, testing each can aid in your decision as well.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to read that Amazon was selling Must De cartier, but when i received the toilette spray the pump on the sprayer did not work.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Just as I Expected!</li>
            <li> The smell is really good and it stays as well.   Very befitting for occasion wear.    Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its intensity and flavor are delicious. It keeps all the time and even after washing the garments retain the nuances of perfume.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.Delivered safely to my door.Driver pleasant and competent.</li>
            <li> it for my wife she love it</li>

            <li> did not meet my expectatioms.</li>
            <li> This is my number one for many years.  I love it.  I received it well packaged, which is important to me, as I know this brand very well, and on time.  It is great. I am very happy.  The fragrance is flawless.</li>
            <li> I have always had good service and my items have always been shipped&lt;br /&gt;on time&lt;br /&gt;I have worn Cartier for many years and very happy that I can buy it thru Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have told many of my friends and will continue to do my shopping this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marlena Santy</li>
            <li> a good product as expected and very good would that offered a gift for each product purchasing and so motivate more users 100% recommend this particular product</li>
            <li> Its the best. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume for years and always get compliments. Pretty bottle and lasts on my skin for hours.  Will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance I have used for nearly 4 years.  I love it, get many compliments when I wear it, and can&#x27;t say enough good things about Cartier frangrances.</li>
            <li> I WASN&#x27;T SURE THIS PRODUCT WOULD COME IN THE SAME MANNER AS BUYING AT THE COSMETIC DEP&#x27;T. MY CONCERNS WERE FULLY SATISFIED ---THE PRODUCT CAME IN AS INDICATED ON TIME AND PACKAGED PERFECTLY. BUYING THIS PRODUCT AT THE COSMETIC COUNTER WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING. THIS EXPERIENCE WAS GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AB</li>
            <li> In 1990 I was having diner with a friend at the George Cinq restaurant in Paris, France when I first sensed the delicious, unique and rich fragance. I abruptly had to ask my friend \\&quot;what is the fragrance you are wearing?\\&quot;  The answer was simply, Must de Cartier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a devotee of this elegant evocative and magical fragrance ever since.  It blends very well with my chemestry and I am always asked by many I come in contact the same \\&quot;what are you wearing?\\&quot;  Do I have to say more?  Merci, Cartier!</li>
            <li> This smelled old to me</li>
            <li> A classic yet contemporary.  Has vanilla undertones. No sweet floral which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and so easy to get.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Men love the vanilla smell!</li>
            <li> The item arrived in good condition and was as advertised.  I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought this one as a gift for my mother in law. She was very pleased. At 3.4 oz. it should last her for awhile. I knew when i gave it to her that i would be ordering one for myself very soon. I did- in August- but I chose the smaller size.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I wear it all the time if I can afford to buy it.  Makes me smell gooooooooood.</li>
