            <li>Have to use with a light touch on my sensitive skin, but great to get rid of dry skin on my back.</li>
            <li>I eventually purchased a body brush on a handle, which is much easier to use.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done with it, you KNOW your back is clean.</li>
            <li>great wet in the shower or tub and gets at the most hard to  reach places of your back.  </li>

            <li>The replacement brush lasted a little more than one month, so I am out of luck.</li>
            <li>One thing I really like is that the rope handles are sufficiently long enough to make for easy holding and scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>I also love to use it dry on an   unbearably itchy back.</li>
            <li>Love this for dry brushing my back.  </li>
            <li>I was trying to replace a sisal back scrubber I had before and thought this one might fit the bill but definitely doesn&#x27;t do well in a damp environment.</li>
            <li>wow, did I feel scrubbed!</li>
            <li>I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IT&#x27;S BETTER THAN ANY OTHER BACK WASHER I&#x27;VE HAD</li>

            <li> I looked everywhere for this to replace an old one, and finally found it here.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the back brushes that have a handle, because no matter how hard I try, it doesn&#x27;t seem like I can get the whole back.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dry brushing is essential - our SKIN is the largest organ of our body and dry brushing</li>
            <li> Solid construction, soft but firm bristles.</li>
            <li> The Sisal bristles are quite strong and stiff and give your back a REALLY serious scrubbing/scratching even when wet and soapy.</li>
            <li> the only problem is having to dry it out in a dry place, not the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Use it dry for some extra scrub (may need to work up this) or wet for a softer, gentler exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I have several of these from other companies however, my belongings at the moment are in storage</li>
            <li> I hang mine to dry</li>
            <li> I am going to just use it as a dry brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little hard the first time you use it</li>
            <li> Uses it wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> but once you get them wet, they soften.  </li>
            <li> It is NOT a gentle scrubber, so if you are looking for something soothing, forget this.  </li>
            <li> Note that It is very rough though, but that is what was wanted.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of hanging this in my shower and it immediately started turning black.</li>
            <li> To me, this feels too harsh and bristly, but he adores it.</li>
            <li> This back brush was very awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect, but close.  </li>
            <li> It smelled unpleasant too.</li>

            <li> I have strggled for years with washing my back.  Brushes with handles just don&#x27;t cut it.  Finally I found the answer and it is this brush.  The bristles are a little hard the first time you use it but once you get them wet, they soften.  Needless to say, I love it!</li>
            <li> We have had this back brush for over a year and use it frequently.    It is still just as effective as the first day we used it.  It works   great wet in the shower or tub and gets at the most hard to  reach places of your back.  I also love to use it dry on an   unbearably itchy back.</li>
            <li> The back scrubber is marvelous and I love it. I get such good products and such good service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This back brush was very awkward to use.  It smelled unpleasant too. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great sisal back scrubber. If it was just me  using it, it would be awesome, But, I bought it for my husband and the rope strap broke after the 2nd day It also got moldy here in Hawaii...</li>
            <li> In short, this product is a must have in your arsenal for good health.  I have several of these from other companies however, my belongings at the moment are in storage so I had to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry brushing is essential - our SKIN is the largest organ of our body and dry brushing is very healthy...not to mention that it feels sooooo good.  I am NATURAL and ALTERNATIVE MEDS all the way and I would never be without something like this Sisal brush and others (Sisal brushes)....&lt;br /&gt;I did not have a problem receiving it (some time ago) and the quality is equal to the bigger ones that I have which are currently/temporarily in storage.  Don&#x27;t hesitate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be well and stay with Mother Nature for all your health needs !!!!</li>
            <li> This cleans and exfoliates the back, very nice.  I like it best when I get it wet first then add some soap and you can get every part of your back as the the brush bends to the shape you need it.  I hang mine to dry and it is not left in a shower.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a back scrubber that very effectively scratches your back, this is the one you want.  The Sisal bristles are quite strong and stiff and give your back a REALLY serious scrubbing/scratching even when wet and soapy. It is NOT a gentle scrubber, so if you are looking for something soothing, forget this.

            <li> My wife and I love this product. Solid construction, soft but firm bristles. Just the right length for all arm lengths.</li>
            <li> wow, did I feel scrubbed! the only problem is having to dry it out in a dry place, not the bathroom. then the next time I get in the shower, the back brush is somewhere else. I am going to just use it as a dry brush.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this to replace an old one, and finally found it here.  Note that It is very rough though, but that is what was wanted.</li>
            <li> In my search for the ideal shower brush this ranks high on my list.  Not perfect, but close.  I have been using it for about 6 months and it seems to be holding-up well.  It enables you to get the entire back scrubbed and scratched to great satisfaction.  Although the wooden balls at each end aid in grasping the brush they can be a hazzard to naked males while soaping up the brush.  I would buy again and probably will when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my sister&#x27;s birthday day.  She loves it.  Uses it wet and dry.  When my husband saw it  remarked I should have gotten one for him.  He likes it very much.  I borrowed one day and like it too, in fact  we were both using it after a while.  I just ordered one for myself.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t master using this back brush.  I can&#x27;t seem to keep the brush steady using the rope handles.  I eventually purchased a body brush on a handle, which is much easier to use.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I actually had a bunch of micro scratches on my back.  I think that the abrasiveness mellowed out after a couple uses.  I never used it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; only in the shower.  After several months it is still in good shape and provides an invigorating scrub.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NICE ABRASIVE, BUT FLIMSY.  I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IT&#x27;S BETTER THAN ANY OTHER BACK WASHER I&#x27;VE HAD BEFORE</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  I can&#x27;t stand the back brushes that have a handle, because no matter how hard I try, it doesn&#x27;t seem like I can get the whole back.  With this, there is not problem.</li>
            <li> Great for exfoliation, especially in winter.  Use it dry for some extra scrub (may need to work up this) or wet for a softer, gentler exfoliation.  I hang it in my shower under the nozzle and it has yet to grow mould.  I used to try brushes but I would either snap the wood or the head would fly off.  This is perfect and a great gift to boot.  One of those items you wonder how you ever went without.</li>
            <li> Love this for dry brushing my back.  Works great for me.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this, as he tends to have oily and itchy skin. To me, this feels too harsh and bristly, but he adores it.</li>
            <li> This is okay, but I prefer the old style they used to make.  This isn&#x27;t that easy to use.  But it&#x27;s the best there is right now.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of hanging this in my shower and it immediately started turning black. I was trying to replace a sisal back scrubber I had before and thought this one might fit the bill but definitely doesn&#x27;t do well in a damp environment.</li>
            <li> I like something more substantial than a loofah pad. I bought some sisal wrapped sponges on eBay and they fell apart almost immediately. This this rocks and it&#x27;s built to last.</li>
            <li> Good design, feels great on your skin, but here&#x27;s the RUB: only while it lasts. And it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. The first one I ordered lasted one month, so I was able to replace it. The replacement brush lasted a little more than one month, so I am out of luck. Save your money; but another product.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever especially for people with short arms</li>
            <li> A lot stiffer bristle than I was expecting. Have to use with a light touch on my sensitive skin, but great to get rid of dry skin on my back.</li>
            <li> Been looking for this all my life. Great in the shower in the morning</li>
