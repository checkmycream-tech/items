    <ol>
            <li>Great color...</li>
            <li>Great Buyer to work with.</li>
            <li>I love these Chrome colors so much by SALLY Hansen, I cant get enough, and this color is so beautiful on the nails.</li>
            <li>For some reason, (this) bottle is super watery.</li>
            <li>Gift for my mom came quickly and was exactly what she wanted</li>
            <li>I am very suspicious that I did not receive the polish that was originally in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen polish always has those nice wide brushes, this one was skinnier than most brushes that are offered even in other brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth paying extra.</li>
            <li>The bottle was beat up and did not look new.</li>
            <li>This polish was white not pink.</li>
            <li>Very watered down..</li>
            <li>Very watered down, the color was white.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had this polish before. For some reason, (this) bottle is super watery.</li>
            <li> Not shiny like picture.</li>
            <li> Very watered down, the color was white. No Peach to it. The bottle was all scratched up and used looking. Sally Hansen polish always has those nice wide brushes, this one was skinnier than most brushes that are offered even in other brands. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this polish.</li>
            <li> This color was NOTHING like the picture shown.</li>
            <li> Great color...just not AS pink as I&#x27;d hoped. The bottle was also scratched, and looked as if it MIGHT have been previously opened. Oh well.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! THIS OLD AND WATERED DOWN! Very disappointed!! This is garbage!!</li>
            <li> COLOR DOESN&#x27;T MATCH THE COVER, not even closer.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth paying extra.</li>
            <li> Seriously not worth your money ! Do not buy it..the color is supposed to be pink but it was white and the bottle was poorly taken care of !!</li>
            <li> Product as described.  Great Buyer to work with.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and amazon but never got an answer. This product was so watered down that there was no shine. They just left me stuck with it. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Gift for my mom came quickly and was exactly what she wanted</li>
            <li> I love these Chrome colors so much by SALLY Hansen, I cant get enough, and this color is so beautiful on the nails.</li>
            <li> Very watered down..no shine</li>
            <li> Trash. Looks awful and is far too expensive to be such a farce.</li>
            <li> This polish was white not pink. It didn&#x27;t last 24 hrs before it started to fade. It is not chrome polish. The bottle was beat up and did not look new. I am very suspicious that I did not receive the polish that was originally in the bottle. Very unhappy for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Nail polish was white.</li>
