            <li>It smells nice - not medicinal at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the stuff about phyto-this and botani-that is really effective.  </li>
            <li>Very lightly scented medicated powder for your feet and, well,...</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>I had not been able to find a product like this in drug stores.</li>
            <li>Love this powder.</li>
            <li>I still use it for heat rash.&lt;br /&gt;Works better for me than baby powder.  </li>
            <li>Like, a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to try it.</li>

            <li>Was well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This product line is fantastic!</li>
            <li>So not only do you want to treat the infection, but you want to heal the skin - and this is what Medline products do best.</li>
            <li>good fast delivery and pretty good powder.</li>
            <li>And its aroma is very attractive and pleasant and long lasting.</li>
            <li>The Medline Antifungal Powder, also with miconozole nitrate 2.0%, is CORN STARCH BASED AND TALC FREE, which is important for women users.  </li>
            <li>I have been free of these infections since using this product.  </li>
            <li>He liked it so much I stole the bottle when he didn&#x27;t need it any more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sweet, light.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many antifungal powders before, and finally one that is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>While seemingly good for its stated purpose, this powder has a strong fragrance that set off my allergies quite intensely, so for me, it is far from hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>Unlike most product on the drug store shelf, this one really.</li>
            <li>Smells great non greasy absorbs into your skin very fast has worked for my dry ichy flaky feet.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li>I rarely use the cream.</li>
            <li>This product could be used alone but is best used as an add on to your current powder or every other day.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend got athlete&#x27;s foot somehow and his right foot was in misery.</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of no results with the cream, this with the spray started to get rid of the infection right away.</li>
            <li>Amazing how it helps keep one dry.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended -- we got our first container from a visiting home health nurse and have used Amazon as our supplier ever since!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more expensive, but for good reason.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much without a scent at all.  </li>
            <li>I loved the subtle, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I had a heat rash in a difficult place, and used this along with corn starch and the effect was incredible.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The antifungal part really works.</li>
            <li>It have really given me relief and is clearing up the fungus.</li>
            <li>This powder works very well to remove moisture and create dryness.  </li>
            <li>Also, the powder works very well at preventing fungal infections/skin irritations when used as a body powder.</li>
            <li>This powder is great for healing bed sores and other irritations of bed-bound people or persons who have trouble with rashes under breast or abdomen in large persons.</li>
            <li>This brand is hands down the most highly recommended-</li>
            <li>This powder helps keep you dry and comfortable in the heat of the day.</li>
            <li>It adheres to skin much better than just plain bath powder also.</li>
            <li>But it does have the same antifungal ingredient as other similar powders, and it smells way better.  </li>
            <li>Usually I use corn starch alone for such rashes, but this was a potent pair, the two of these.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s pretty much the same as/similar to all the other OTC antifungal creams out there) but the skin nourishing/protecting elements.</li>
            <li>The previous powder I had been using had medicinal odor, this one has a nice fragrance with the same ingredients and a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Use powder every day under my breasts to prevent rash or itching, A little pricey but worth it.</li>

            <li> /&gt;This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for those long days on my feet!  </li>
            <li> The powder form is soothing and helps keep the skin dry.</li>
            <li> keeping skin clear,nice and dry.</li>
            <li> Vanilla-y, totally inoffensive, slightly feminine ...</li>
            <li> Started using it when I was in a rehab center and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> The smell of other powders of this type tends to turn my stomach.  </li>
            <li> other places.  </li>
            <li> but i thought it would have came with the cream too, but other than that i have no problems .</li>
            <li> but you need surprisingly little to keep areas dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not the active ingredient which makes it work well</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the price is very high for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> Fungal infections take root when the skin is irritated and broken, eliminating our skin&#x27;s natural defenses.</li>
            <li> I need a little relief from athletes foot.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased this powered a few times already</li>
            <li> Not really happy</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this, I have not experienced a yeast infection in the areas where there is skin on skin contact.</li>
            <li> it works like crap frances cribb</li>
            <li> It works and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They sent 3 tubes of cream, not the powder. Not really happy but it isn&#x27;t worth it yo try and send back. Just won&#x27;t use them again.</li>
            <li> This powder helps keep you dry and comfortable in the heat of the day.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent powder that can be used for any kind of rash, not just a fungus.  I had a heat rash in a difficult place, and used this along with corn starch and the effect was incredible.  Usually I use corn starch alone for such rashes, but this was a potent pair, the two of these.  The nice thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad scnet to it at all.  It&#x27;s pretty much without a scent at all.  It works and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad!  What more could you want?</li>
            <li> ....great medicated powder......apply sever times dailey.....helps with my winter time skin itches...</li>
            <li> Smells great non greasy absorbs into your skin very fast has worked for my dry ichy flaky feet. Takes a while because when ur feeling with fungus it&#x27;s always a mission but truly works just be patient. And the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Great powder. Pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> There are several talc-based over-the-counter anti-fungalpowders that contain miconozole nitrate 2.0%.  The Medline Antifungal Powder, also with miconozole nitrate 2.0%, is CORN STARCH BASED AND TALC FREE, which is important for women users.  It is a pleasant and effective product and I am very glad to have found it on Amazon.  I had not been able to find a product like this in drug stores.</li>
            <li> I have had chronic fungal infections in skin folds.  I have been free of these infections since using this product.  It adheres to skin much better than just plain bath powder also.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works well. It smells nice - not medicinal at all. Sweet, light. Unfortunately, the price is very high for the amount that you get. I&#x27;d like to use this daily but I find myself rationing it out. This product could be used alone but is best used as an add on to your current powder or every other day. I alternate use in specific problem areas. I&#x27;d like to find this in larger quantities. If it weren&#x27;t for the price/quantity issue I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Love this powder. I used it while I underwent radiation for breast cancer. It helped with the heat rash. I still use it for heat rash.&lt;br /&gt;Works better for me than baby powder.  The antifungal part really works. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> The smell of other powders of this type tends to turn my stomach.  I don&#x27;t know if the stuff about phyto-this and botani-that is really effective.  I personally think that part is BS, your mileage may vary.  But it does have the same antifungal ingredient as other similar powders, and it smells way better.  Like, a lot better.  Vanilla-y, totally inoffensive, slightly feminine ... but even if you&#x27;re a guy, trust me, women (and men, for that matter) would rather you smell like a cookie than medicated powder.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many antifungal powders before, and finally one that is fantastic!! I only hope that this product can come in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I like Medline anti fungal products because I don&#x27;t get a skin reaction to them as I did with my prescription medicated powders and creams.</li>
            <li> good fast delivery and pretty good powder.</li>
            <li> Unlike most product on the drug store shelf, this one really. Works. It have really given me relief and is clearing up the fungus.</li>
            <li> This powder does what it is meant to do. I loved the subtle, fresh smell. One thing to consider is that you can get a much bigger bottle at a store for the same money. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The Remedy products I purchased did a great job of clearing the fungal skin irritation my Mom had.I recommend this product and will not hesitate to order again as needed.</li>
            <li> This powder works very well to remove moisture and create dryness.  And its aroma is very attractive and pleasant and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Work wonderfully to get rid of the itching and burning.  The powder form is soothing and helps keep the skin dry.</li>
            <li> This works great.  Started using it when I was in a rehab center and have been using it ever since.  Amazing how it helps keep one dry.</li>
            <li> not&lt;br /&gt;the product ordered substituted lesser quality  ripoff</li>
            <li> Very lightly scented medicated powder for your feet and, well,...other places.  When one of my parents was in hospital this was the product provided to help with chaffing and, well,...other things.  He liked it so much I stole the bottle when he didn&#x27;t need it any more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for those long days on my feet!  If you must buy some please don&#x27;t take it all!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got athlete&#x27;s foot somehow and his right foot was in misery. We tried cream and the infection just wasn&#x27;t going away. He is an electrician and has to wear boots all day. The cream was keeping his feet moist, which fungus loves. So, I got him this with an antifungal spray. He put the spray on at night and the powder in his boots in the day time. After a couple weeks of no results with the cream, this with the spray started to get rid of the infection right away. So glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this powered a few times already but i thought it would have came with the cream too, but other than that i have no problems .</li>
            <li> This powder is great for healing bed sores and other irritations of bed-bound people or persons who have trouble with rashes under breast or abdomen in large persons. May not work for everyone but it truly works for the person I care for daily. I rarely use the cream. I feel the powder does better for us.</li>
            <li> The powder and cream were shown as packaged together. However, what actually came packaged together was the powder and a paste, not a cream. I had already ordered the paste under a separate order. Now I had 2 pastes and no cream. So I had to order the cream separately. The product was recommended by a friend and we&#x27;ve started using them.</li>
            <li> This is great for diaper rashes or severe yeast infections.  It helped with the healing process and the discomfort that goes along with it.</li>
            <li> not what I wanted ,not what the picture shown</li>
            <li> Every once in awhile between my toes I need a little relief from athletes foot.  But if you have yeast issues this might help those as well.</li>
            <li> If you have skin-on-skin contact issues, you know that fungal infections can be an issue and this product is critical to our proactive plan against them. This is a pretty small container but you need surprisingly little to keep areas dry and that&#x27;s the key to keeping the infections at bay. Highly recommended -- we got our first container from a visiting home health nurse and have used Amazon as our supplier ever since!</li>
            <li> Was well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> very good antifungal powder. i order it for the lady  I work for.  I always search for the good product.this is the one of them. keeping skin clear,nice and dry.</li>
            <li> While seemingly good for its stated purpose, this powder has a strong fragrance that set off my allergies quite intensely, so for me, it is far from hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> The previous powder I had been using had medicinal odor, this one has a nice fragrance with the same ingredients and a little cheaper.  This one is soooooooo much better!!</li>
            <li> If you have skin to skin yeast infections, this product will PREVENT you from getting them. Since I have been using this, I have not experienced a yeast infection in the areas where there is skin on skin contact. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Use powder every day under my breasts to prevent rash or itching, A little pricey but worth it. Works really great.</li>
            <li> This product line is fantastic! I work in a hospital pharmacy and we&#x27;ve sifted through MANY brands trying to find the best product for our patients. This brand is hands down the most highly recommended- in fact, our nurses refuse to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more expensive, but for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the active ingredient which makes it work well (it&#x27;s pretty much the same as/similar to all the other OTC antifungal creams out there) but the skin nourishing/protecting elements. Fungal infections take root when the skin is irritated and broken, eliminating our skin&#x27;s natural defenses. So not only do you want to treat the infection, but you want to heal the skin - and this is what Medline products do best. Also, the powder works very well at preventing fungal infections/skin irritations when used as a body powder.</li>
            <li> do not like the blood pressure monitor it works like crap frances cribb</li>
