            <li>Nice polish.</li>
            <li>nice color.</li>
            <li>Great special polish for image stamping.</li>
            <li>If you buy the stamp kit make sure you get this kind of nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it to anyone ...</li>
            <li>so it does go on a bit better.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the important thing!</li>
            <li>Images that I could not pick up on my non-konad stamper looked much better.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>When you do nails, you have to make sure the 2 coats of polish are cured or it dents in the nail</li>
            <li>I love Konad, I have yet to find anything better for stamping.</li>
            <li>I like it much better.</li>
            <li>though I was going to get (turned out for the better).</li>
            <li>The color is very deep and the consistency is perfect.</li>
            <li>Works nicely for free hand art too.</li>
            <li>Best red</li>
            <li>But you need to wait awhile before you put a top coat on or it will smear.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice, true red---perfect for Christmas or Valentine&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>but it works great with Konad products and produces clear images.</li>
            <li>I love the Konad red polish, is a very nice red, and it stamps very good.  </li>
            <li>This item came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this red shows up great  works</li>
            <li>I have heard many complaints about stamping and how the images don&#x27;t come out fully and clean.</li>
            <li>My images are now clean, come out as seen on the imprint, and have a nice bold color.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best polish I&#x27;ve used for stamping.  </li>
            <li>I can promise you that it will not be as detailed if you used this nail polish</li>
            <li>I love the Konad system and I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with it.</li>
            <li>and I thought that this would fit the bill, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I would buy more colors of this when I need them and they work great with the Konad and other brands of design plates of nail art.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to stamp now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new at using the Konad Nail Stamping System, but I love it already!</li>
            <li>I just love this red, the color is vibrant and it stamps great.</li>
            <li>I recommend this special stamping polish color.</li>
            <li>It is a bright red</li>
            <li>not so good, however while i am not for red polish</li>
            <li>I have been using regular polish pot my stamping plates and it work good.</li>
            <li>Thick color perfect for nail art</li>
            <li>The special polishes really do work better and it&#x27;s worth it to buy them.</li>
            <li>Other then that this item is great.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth yet covers great without being too thick.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>product got shipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The red is true to color, I love the shade of red, and is a strong polish that does not chip easily.  </li>
            <li>The color is true to the bottle and stamps very well.  </li>
            <li>I think we (costumers) should be completely honest about our purchases so we can select the companies which provide a good service avoiding us of having trouble in the future.</li>
            <li>I use this to do art on top of my gel nails - great coverage with a thin layer than most other polishes and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>this isnt as good as the black one</li>
            <li>A very red red that stamps great over lighter polishes.</li>
            <li>The color is very much like the image</li>
            <li>The red is a beautiful vibrant red.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this brand!!</li>
            <li>Love this color blue, for my nail stamping.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this color, to any one.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>be purchasing more in the future</li>
            <li>well would definitely recommend I Love konad got here on time as well</li>
            <li>I love this red.  </li>
            <li>This color is very vibrant when used for stamping..</li>
            <li>Now that it&#x27;s almost holiday season, I will definitely be using my red Konad polish a lot more!</li>
            <li>I have no regrets about buying this Konad Special polish.</li>
            <li>As described.nail polish works very well.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;\\&quot;Nothing stamps as well as the real deal, Konad blk and wht are also staples for every stamper.</li>
            <li>i really like this one</li>
            <li>Only it dries pretty quick when.  </li>
            <li>works quite well, good pigmentation, does smear a little bit if one does not allow enough time to dry before putting on a top coat,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad now to know I can use different brands; I just wont get the same exact effect if it&#x27;s thinner.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend the Konad Stamping Polishes, I specially like this red polish.</li>
            <li>also less smearing with the Konad top coat for stamping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a decent size bottle especially considering you shouldn&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>I use regular red polish and they work ok, but konad red stamps a true red.  </li>
            <li>As usually recommended stamp lighter colors on darker ones,  and darker colors on lighter ones for better contrast.</li>
            <li>Be careful when applying a top coat not to smear the pattern - it will dissolve unless you let it dry completely.</li>
            <li>it makes a real difference especially if you using non-Konad polishes.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>It may be a bit old.  </li>
            <li>Konad \\&quot;special\\&quot; polish works like no other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I could see that the lines were clear, so this will be great for stamping on light colors in the future, but I am really disappointed that it is not opaque enough for dark.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and fast drying</li>
            <li>and it was barely visible at all.  </li>
            <li>The polish is really thick and should only be used for stenciling which is fine since that is what I bought the product for.</li>
            <li>My first Red polish by Konad, I have always used their black or white</li>
            <li>I really wanted a red that could be stamped on a black background</li>
            <li>I purchased this nail polish to use with my Konad nail art kit and was a little skeptical about how bright the color would be</li>

            <li> I have other reds that are exactly the same and are not special for stamping.</li>
            <li> a deep charcoal grey and stamped the red on them</li>
            <li> Konad is usually on target with their colors and the red is right on the money and is dark enough , but not too dark, that it shows up when you stamp it.</li>
            <li> I had this same problem when attempting to use other \\&quot;regular\\&quot; nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I just started nail stamping and was having trouble using regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> Yet I was curious to try and compare the difference</li>
            <li> not much else to write on this one.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works on plates other then Konad also.</li>
            <li> the designs are a bit less visible with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult because the nails have to be dry before applying.  </li>
            <li> I dont know if its me, but i find it hard to stamp with this nailpolish onto my nail.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid I can not leave negative feedback.</li>
            <li> Thick stamping polish.</li>
            <li> Did not chip or apply thin when using a stamper.</li>
            <li> and it comes with a slightly awkward brush, then again this wasnt meant to paint anything, merely to be globbed onto an immage plate</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This color is very vibrant when used for stamping.. I love it and recommend it to anyone ... even though one can use regular nail polish on the stamp plates.. I can promise you that it will not be as detailed if you used this nail polish</li>
            <li> There is no comparison between these \\&quot;special\\&quot; polishes and \\&quot;regular\\&quot; polish from different brands. Konad \\&quot;special\\&quot; polish works like no other I&#x27;ve tried. Any issues or difficulty I had before I bought this polish were solved once I used the Konad polish. It&#x27;s super easy to stamp now and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> this isnt as good as the black one but it still works well. the designs are a bit less visible with this but they still show. its thicker than regular nail polish and it comes with a slightly awkward brush, then again this wasnt meant to paint anything, merely to be globbed onto an immage plate</li>
            <li> I bought this because I just started nail stamping and was having trouble using regular nail polish. After several tries I&#x27;ve finally got it down, however I really didn&#x27;t need to buy this polish to stamp. With that said it is thicker than regular polish so it does go on a bit better. I wont be returning this because it does have it&#x27;s use. I&#x27;m just glad now to know I can use different brands; I just wont get the same exact effect if it&#x27;s thinner.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is great for art work.  It goes on smooth yet covers great without being too thick.  The color is very much like the image</li>
            <li> This polish is perfect for stamping art on your nails. Long lasting and fast drying, I highly recommend this brand!!</li>
            <li> This stamping polish is very good quality.  Only it dries pretty quick when.  The color is just as seen.  I would recommend it if you are used to using such polish.  its only for stamping.</li>
            <li> The red is true to color, I love the shade of red, and is a strong polish that does not chip easily.  I would buy more colors of this when I need them and they work great with the Konad and other brands of design plates of nail art.</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s almost holiday season, I will definitely be using my red Konad polish a lot more! Show&#x27;s up well and that&#x27;s the important thing!</li>
            <li> I just love this red, the color is vibrant and it stamps great. Images that I could not pick up on my non-konad stamper looked much better. I would recommend you invest in a konad stamper it makes a real difference especially if you using non-Konad polishes. As usually recommended stamp lighter colors on darker ones,  and darker colors on lighter ones for better contrast.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works perfectly. Excellent for the people who like stamping their nails. That&#x27;s wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> As described.nail polish works very well. Nice color. happy customer. product got shipped pretty quickly.I would recommend this product to everybody.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;\\&quot;Nothing stamps as well as the real deal, Konad blk and wht are also staples for every stamper. Works on plates other then Konad also. Recommend for beginning stampers, to assure success.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at using the Konad Nail Stamping System, but I love it already! Is quiet simple, and the prices for the items are affordable.  I love the Konad red polish, is a very nice red, and it stamps very good.  I have tried regular nail polish for stamping, but I have to say that for me, they do not work the same.  I will highly recommend the Konad Stamping Polishes, I specially like this red polish.</li>
            <li> Love this color blue, for my nail stamping.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this color, to any one.&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing more in the future</li>
            <li> The polish is really thick and should only be used for stenciling which is fine since that is what I bought the product for.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s a  good nail polish!  I had a prompt and courteous service, the item arrived on time and in perfect conditions. I think we (costumers) should be completely honest about our purchases so we can select the companies which provide a good service avoiding us of having trouble in the future.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> My first Red polish by Konad, I have always used their black or white but I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This item came very quickly. I have had no problems with it. Nothing was damaged and it still works. I am happy with this product!</li>
            <li> These Konad polish work great.  I use regular red polish and they work ok, but konad red stamps a true red.  I recommend this polish.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase! It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> works quite well, good pigmentation, does smear a little bit if one does not allow enough time to dry before putting on a top coat, also less smearing with the Konad top coat for stamping.</li>
            <li> I love the Konad system and I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with it. The special polishes really do work better and it&#x27;s worth it to buy them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail polish to use with my Konad nail art kit and was a little skeptical about how bright the color would be but I love it! It is a bright red so if you&#x27;re looking for something darker this isn&#x27;t the one but it works great with Konad products and produces clear images. It&#x27;s also a decent size bottle especially considering you shouldn&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult because the nails have to be dry before applying.  When you do nails, you have to make sure the 2 coats of polish are cured or it dents in the nail</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. I love Konad, I have yet to find anything better for stamping.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a red that could be stamped on a black background and I thought that this would fit the bill, but it didn&#x27;t.  I painted my nails a deep charcoal grey and stamped the red on them and it was barely visible at all.  I could see that the lines were clear, so this will be great for stamping on light colors in the future, but I am really disappointed that it is not opaque enough for dark.  I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, but I wanted to leave a review so that future buyers will know ahead of time what to expect.</li>
            <li> Love this red shows up great  works well would definitely recommend I Love konad got here on time as well</li>
            <li> I dont know if its me, but i find it hard to stamp with this nailpolish onto my nail.</li>
            <li> Great special polish for image stamping. Konad is usually on target with their colors and the red is right on the money and is dark enough , but not too dark, that it shows up when you stamp it. I recommend this special stamping polish color.</li>
            <li> If you buy the stamp kit make sure you get this kind of nail polish. The color is nice and bright.</li>
            <li> Great k John khb khb khbk John khb job kh both khb b of bkj j ojb job kebab kb kh kh</li>
            <li> same as with the silver i got this color to go with the stamping kit and the kit yea not so good, however while i am not for red polish i really like this one , four starred it cause canot be used for purpose bought..</li>
            <li> The only reason I give this item a 4 star is because there is NO reference to the size of the bottle. Other then that this item is great.</li>
            <li> I have been using regular polish pot my stamping plates and it work good. Yet I was curious to try and compare the difference and wow. I like it much better. I recommend this red for flower as for it gives a deeper color compared to a regular red nail polish.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a bit different from the one I though I was going to get (turned out for the better). The color is very deep and the consistency is perfect. I have no regrets about buying this Konad Special polish.</li>
            <li> Nice polish. Works great with the stamp.</li>
            <li> I love this red.  The color is true to the bottle and stamps very well.  In my opinion, if you&#x27;re stamping, Konad polishes are the best.</li>
            <li> Just as described this polish is perfect for stamping. I have other reds that are exactly the same and are not special for stamping.</li>
            <li> perfect consistency for nail art stamping, it was packaged nicely and was shipped fast, thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great stamping polish! A very red red that stamps great over lighter polishes. Works nicely for free hand art too.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described, stamps wonderful!!!  I would definately recommend stampers get Konad nail polish for stamping. I have heard many complaints about stamping and how the images don&#x27;t come out fully and clean. I had this same problem when attempting to use other \\&quot;regular\\&quot; nail polishes. Konad nail polishes solved that problem for me entirely. My images are now clean, come out as seen on the imprint, and have a nice bold color. The red is a beautiful vibrant red.</li>
            <li> Thick stamping polish. Best red I have used for stamping. A little goes a long way. Did not chip or apply thin when using a stamper. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> nice color. not much else to write on this one. nnn nn nn nn nn n n nn nn nn</li>
            <li> Does not stamp as well as I would like.  It may be a bit old.  For the price I paid I can not leave negative feedback.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.But you need to wait awhile before you put a top coat on or it will smear. The colors are great.</li>
            <li> I use this to do art on top of my gel nails - great coverage with a thin layer than most other polishes and dries quickly. Be careful when applying a top coat not to smear the pattern - it will dissolve unless you let it dry completely.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best polish I&#x27;ve used for stamping.  The color is a nice, true red---perfect for Christmas or Valentine&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> Thick color perfect for nail art</li>
