            <li> I do not understand why others have rated 5 stars, but realized all previous 6 comments were made within one week time frame in January 2014.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will have to keep using it to give you a complete review.  </li>
            <li> I started seeing improvement after a few uses.</li>

            <li> Although Amazon verified purchase, the legitimacy of the previous reviews is questionable.  </li>

            <li> Extremely disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great serum.. and quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my fav C-serums. Been using them for over 10 years.. this one does not have the tacky feel that some others have.  It is comparable to the C-factor serum I used for many years but a better price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product. Great results and I just love the smell! It&#x27;s a pale brownish colour instead of being totally clear and a little thicker i think than traditional serums but it works like a charm. My skin soft and smooth and gorgeous after use. It absorbs quite quickly into the skin as well. This one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> 20% Ferulic Acid With Vitamin C + E Serum For Face, Wrinkles, Lines and Puffiness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This merchandise was sent to me to review for free from Ultimate Smile Inc. Can’t say much about it, but with the short time using it I can say it make your face soft.  Its description says that it’s anti-aging solution for your skin and restores skin cells and moisturizes skin. Unfortunately, I will have to keep using it to give you a complete review.  This product didn’t break my face out even though I have sensitive skin. So I will keep using it and update you on the results. I gave it a three rating because of the short time using it, I could not give it a complete and good review.</li>
            <li> I love using this serum layered with my anti aging creams and sun protection products. In the mornings, I use it under an SPF Moisturizer and makeup and at night, I layer it with an anti aging product, eye cream and/or Night Repair Cream. The results I get from this product and brand has got me hooked because it dramatically changed the texture of my skin and my complexion. I have been using this religiously with amazing results. Needless to say, I will be using this product henceforth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>

There are not many products out there that have such a short ingredient list, let alone ones that I know &amp; understand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum comes in a 1 fl oz  glass bottle with a plastic dropper inside!! The bottle is dark blue which keeps the serum fresh! I love how the dropper is plastic so that it doesn&#x27;t accidentally break, which I have had happen to me before! I&#x27;ve had this serum for almost a month now!

            <li> I have tried the Vitamin C serum from this same company and was very happy with the results. Decided to give the ferulic acid a try and am very satisfied. I use very little at a time on my face before I go to bed. I have noticed a difference with how soft my face feels almost immediately.</li>
            <li> So I really wanted to give this product a great review.  I was skeptical but after seeing the prior reviews I thought it would be ok.  NOT!  I was excited because I ordered it with a Micro Needle Derma Roller and was looking forward to getting started today.  It arrived on time however it was out of the original packaging inside the larger box.  After opening it I realized the Vitamin C has already oxidized and is yellow and cloudy.  This product will not do work because it&#x27;s spoiled.  This combo should arrive clear for the Vitamin C to be effective.  Extremely disappointed.  RETURNING ASAP and ordering from another supplier.</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin, I use this serum in combination with hyaluronic acid. Both my sister and I have noticed huge differences in our skin. My face feels much younger and softer, I can&#x27;t stop touching my face! Great product that works!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, and she loves it because it has been rejuvenating her skin by reducing the amount of wrinkles in her face.  I will definitely be ordering more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I am a huge advocate of skin care and I am on amazon day and night looking for the best vitamins, minerals, capsules, oils, creams to add to my luscious collection and this brand blew me away! I love experimenting with new brands in comparison to what you can find at your local pharmacy so I can definitely say CSCS was a steal! One thing that significantly stood out to me was the silkiness of the serum when I applied it was like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used. I will be stocking up again very soon.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product this is a FIVE star product for you. The results are terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Till I find this product I use to buy SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic and pay more than $100 I found the same product for less than $25 on AMAZON can you imagine.... Than you.</li>

            <li> This worked great for my skin. I started seeing improvement after a few uses. Will be ordering more for my family soon.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this serum. It worked very well for my skin and leaves it soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Aside from cracked bottle received, the product has a very strong odor (antibiotic or sulfur like).  The serum is not clear fluid as shown in picture.  It has some precipitation that separates the fluid into two layers.  If I can smell the odor from a close distance, I cannot imagine applying it on my face.  I do not understand why others have rated 5 stars, but realized all previous 6 comments were made within one week time frame in January 2014.  Although Amazon verified purchase, the legitimacy of the previous reviews is questionable.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product it worked really well for me. I recommend this product to my friends also purchasing this product from the seller was very smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great. Have been using it for a week now and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels refreshed throughout the day.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for quality, service, and a working product. My skin already feels and looks much better after a week of applying it twice a day. I use it on my hands, arms, and face.</li>
            <li> I use this serum every night after I cleanse my skin. I replaced this for my usual toner so I could get a more accurate view on what it has done. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks I have been using it &amp; right now I only notice that my skin has been getting a natural glow to it. It&#x27;s applied easily &amp; has a gentle feel. I can say I will recommend it because it gives my skin a beautiful look. p.s. I received this to review from tomoson but obviously my opinions are my own!</li>
