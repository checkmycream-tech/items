    <ol>
            <li>It is an oil, and skin doesn&#x27;t absorb oil perfectly.</li>
            <li>product isn&#x27;t perfect, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>this works great for hands</li>
            <li>did smell good though.</li>
            <li>that said, the product itself is good</li>
            <li>good carrier for oils</li>
            <li>When I opened it a good amount when splashing on my carpet.</li>
            <li>I stopped by a beauty supply store a couple of days ago and was excited to buy this because I heard of all the wonderful stories my friends and family has had with the cocoa butter stick version.  </li>
            <li>I do love the way it makes my hands smell!</li>
            <li>It is amazing to me that hand cream can have too steep a learning curve for people.</li>
            <li>also it smells nice</li>
            <li>I love cocoa butter products and thought this was a good price</li>
            <li>I have been using it twice a day every day and my skin is my new best friend again.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and is super moisturizing without that oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Love the price and nothing works better!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>im goin for its sit on top on the skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s since become my favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either there is great discrepancy in the product itself, or maybe some of the reviewers are using too much at a time.</li>
            <li>Powerfully perfumed fragrant lotions really bother me, so I thought I&#x27;d be using neutral-smelling Aveeno forever, but this cocoa butter cream smells sooo good!</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer cream and very affordable.</li>
            <li>I have been passing that really nice bath n lotion store in the mall right by.</li>
            <li>Did not make my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>it was really cheap, so</li>
            <li>but it was cheap and did have some moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>i love how my skin feels and this was even after the first overnight experience.</li>
            <li>I mix it with pure coconut oil for an even better night cream.</li>
            <li>is feels very smooth on my skin &amp; is only lightly scented as I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances.</li>
            <li>why oils are so good at helping skin heal, most provide some kind of barrier (however thin)</li>
            <li>This is slightly ugly-looking cream, but it has a fairly inoffensive scent, it&#x27;s CHEAP, and it does a great job of heavy duty moisturizing on knees, elbows, hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and it came two days later, it was really quick</li>
            <li>it keeps them nice and soft and not dried out</li>
            <li>I first bought a travel-sized tube of this on clearance on a whim.</li>
            <li>thanks son!)</li>
            <li>I like the smell it is pleasant and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>but i usually put a good amount on my face before i go to sleep and when i wake up</li>
            <li>this is any fault of the lotion, any one who has moisturized with pure coco butter</li>
            <li>yes the product doesnt really absorb into your skin</li>
            <li>I hoped it would be the real cocoa butter cream, like they sell in Africa, the ones that make everything heal, but no.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased it at big lots for only $1, so this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>that is very hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will say, even when my skin appeared to have absorbed it completely, I could still feel it.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>It is a very runny lotion</li>
            <li>i have no problem with it, i think people just over due it because the price is very cheap...</li>
            <li>This is a watery lotion, water being the main ingredient.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much other people are paying for this product, but it should be relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>When I received it in the mail, to my dismay, it was completely melted and had leaked all over everything else in the package!</li>
            <li>tub will probably last me a whole year using it twice a day!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I use it all over but especially worked on the feet for super dry cracked heals I got after living in Colorado for 2 years!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for me, but hey, different things work differently on various types of skin.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s worth what I spent on it because I could just use baby lotion for the same effect.  </li>
            <li>But it is so worth the little bit of effort to use this cream</li>
            <li>I could see this product not absorbing well if too much was used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels light and makes your skin feel baby-smooth, and leaves behind a faint but pleasant scent similar to chocolate.</li>
            <li>I have very very dry skin, and it works okay, but not great.</li>

            <li> cocoa butter itself probably deserves three stars, but it took a really really long time to get this package.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this item to anyone who has dry skin and also for scars.</li>
            <li> is miracle worker for that, my dry elbows and heels, stretch marks (</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way -- one tub will probably last you a lifetime.</li>
            <li> The cream has a mousse like texture, not a firm cream or a soupy mess, and to use on my abdomen, I only needed a small dab on one finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it does not give me this satisfaction of cocoa butter cleam that I had expected.</li>
            <li> I expected a thicker consistency cream.</li>
            <li> but i only add very little to my forehead..</li>
            <li> Like the other review said, the stuff does not absorb into the skin....</li>
            <li> This dried like a chalky mess.</li>
            <li> I too had some issues with the formula sitting on my skin in little spots, but I think I rubbed too vigorously when applying it to my hands.</li>
            <li> Just sat there and dried.</li>
            <li> it can be a lil messy.  </li>
            <li> But I expected a rich cocoa butter cream and was very disappointed with this watery stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used cocoa butter in the past and remember it being thicker than this.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing creamy about it and even when I tried to mix it with one of my lotions it did nothing but leave nasty and very visible white streaks on my skin</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, there are no magic cocoa butter properties.</li>
            <li> All I can say about this cream is that I am addicted now!</li>
            <li> just treat it like a very expensive cream.</li>
            <li> and now there is an ugly stain that will not come out.</li>
            <li> This cream is terrible!</li>
            <li> I was concerned after reading some reviews that this product would be awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This dried like a chalky mess. Did not make my skin feel smooth. Did not sink into the skin. Just sat there and dried. Not good. did smell good though.</li>
            <li> It is amazing to me that hand cream can have too steep a learning curve for people. You&#x27;re supposed to rub the stuff in. This is slightly ugly-looking cream, but it has a fairly inoffensive scent, it&#x27;s CHEAP, and it does a great job of heavy duty moisturizing on knees, elbows, hands and feet. A little goes a long way -- one tub will probably last you a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I stopped by a beauty supply store a couple of days ago and was excited to buy this because I heard of all the wonderful stories my friends and family has had with the cocoa butter stick version.  I&#x27;m trying to get rid of some acne marks and discoloration so I could not wait to use it....well I wish I hadn&#x27;t!  Like the other review said, the stuff does not absorb into the skin....AT ALL.  It literally just sits on your face and after minutes of trying to rub the stuff in, it eventually just starts to flake up!  This cream is terrible! There&#x27;s nothing creamy about it and even when I tried to mix it with one of my lotions it did nothing but leave nasty and very visible white streaks on my skin cause it just does NOT absorb at all. I think I will try the lotion version solely based on recommendations from family and friends.</li>
            <li> yes the product doesnt really absorb into your skin but i usually put a good amount on my face before i go to sleep and when i wake up i can still feel like i have it on but then as soon as i wash my face i love how my skin feels and this was even after the first overnight experience. i still wear it during the day but i only add very little to my forehead.. i have no problem with it, i think people just over due it because the price is very cheap...just treat it like a very expensive cream. you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is super moisturizing without that oily feeling. I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I hoped it would be the real cocoa butter cream, like they sell in Africa, the ones that make everything heal, but no. It only has a tiny percent of cocoa butter, it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed by the skin, and the smell is faint. Needless to say, there are no magic cocoa butter properties.</li>
            <li> too damn water dont like its make my skinlook white and thats not the look im goin for its sit on top on the skin its not plamer coco butter thats what i will buy</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews stating this cream was watery or did not rub in well, but I have not had a problem with that at all. I actually purchased it at big lots for only $1, so this is a great deal. I like that is feels very smooth on my skin &amp; is only lightly scented as I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances. I mix it with pure coconut oil for an even better night cream.</li>
            <li> 1. This is not 100% Coco Butter! Nothing on the Jar should lead you to expect this. It is a cream (lotion) made with Coco Butter, that is very hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I too had some issues with the formula sitting on my skin in little spots, but I think I rubbed too vigorously when applying it to my hands. It is the only place on my body this happened. I will say, even when my skin appeared to have absorbed it completely, I could still feel it. I don&#x27;t this this is any fault of the lotion, any one who has moisturized with pure coco butter know that this happens. It is an oil, and skin doesn&#x27;t absorb oil perfectly. That&#x27;t why oils are so good at helping skin heal, most provide some kind of barrier (however thin) that keeps moisture in, and keeps it from getting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I don&#x27;t know how much other people are paying for this product, but it should be relatively cheap. I got it at my local dollar store for...a dollar (no tax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t perfect, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar, a lot of the contents spilled out.  It should be labeled a lotion instead of a cream.  that said, the product itself is good</li>
            <li> I use this because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It is calming while mosturizing.</li>
            <li> good carrier for oils</li>
            <li> Love the price and nothing works better! Recommended from my podiatrist. I use it all over but especially worked on the feet for super dry cracked heals I got after living in Colorado for 2 years! haha</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay. It didn&#x27;t really work for me, but hey, different things work differently on various types of skin. It might work for you.  I have very very dry skin, and it works okay, but not great. I do love the way it makes my hands smell! I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all with it soaking into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cocoa butter itself probably deserves three stars, but it took a really really long time to get this package. I was really disappointed, especially when I finally got it and opened up the jar to realize that it wasn&#x27;t even completely full! I guess you get what you pay for- it was really cheap, so I can&#x27;t complain too much. If I do buy cocoa butter again, it won&#x27;t be from this seller.</li>
            <li> this works great for hands it keeps them nice and soft and not dried out also it smells nice I would reccomend this item to anyone who has dry skin and also for scars.</li>
            <li> I love cocoa butter products and thought this was a good price so I ordered it. When I received it in the mail, to my dismay, it was completely melted and had leaked all over everything else in the package! It also got on my couch that I was sitting on while opening it and now there is an ugly stain that will not come out. I would NOT recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I first bought a travel-sized tube of this on clearance on a whim. It&#x27;s since become my favorite hand lotion. It feels light and makes your skin feel baby-smooth, and leaves behind a faint but pleasant scent similar to chocolate. Powerfully perfumed fragrant lotions really bother me, so I thought I&#x27;d be using neutral-smelling Aveeno forever, but this cocoa butter cream smells sooo good!</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell and it does not give me this satisfaction of cocoa butter cleam that I had expected.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Item as described.  Good moisturizer cream and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I expected a thicker consistency cream. This is a watery lotion, water being the main ingredient. When I opened it a good amount when splashing on my carpet. I would return it but it was cheap and did have some moisturizing properties. But I expected a rich cocoa butter cream and was very disappointed with this watery stuff.</li>
            <li> I was concerned after reading some reviews that this product would be awful. I was pleasantly surprised. The cream has a mousse like texture, not a firm cream or a soupy mess, and to use on my abdomen, I only needed a small dab on one finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either there is great discrepancy in the product itself, or maybe some of the reviewers are using too much at a time. I could see this product not absorbing well if too much was used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tub will probably last me a whole year using it twice a day!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and it came two days later, it was really quick and I will stick with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used cocoa butter in the past and remember it being thicker than this.  It is a very runny lotion and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s worth what I spent on it because I could just use baby lotion for the same effect.  I will be trying a different brand next time I purchase cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> All I can say about this cream is that I am addicted now! I have been using it twice a day every day and my skin is my new best friend again.  I suffer from Keratosis Polaris and this cream is miracle worker for that, my dry elbows and heels, stretch marks (thanks son!), everything!  I like the smell it is pleasant and not overwhelming.  The cream does take time to apply...it is a CREAM! If I try to rush and not massage it in then it can be a lil messy.  But it is so worth the little bit of effort to use this cream, I use it twice a day and I am so hooked I have been passing that really nice bath n lotion store in the mall right by.</li>
