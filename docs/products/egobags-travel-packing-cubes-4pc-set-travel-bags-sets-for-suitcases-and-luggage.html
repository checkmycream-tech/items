            <li>Best of all, I was able to fit all of these bags in 21 inch carry on bag and still had room for a pair of heels and sandals.</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent, the material is strong and the zippers easy.</li>
            <li>I placed the bags in the bedroom closet and decided to update my review to give it more stars, mostly because of the great customer service.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest-</li>
            <li>I already own</li>
            <li>There were mixed reviews, some not so great and some that were excellent.</li>
            <li>What I liked about the egobags packing cubes is the 4pc set as well as the quality of the fabric.</li>
            <li>They were very lightweight, beautiful color, good sizes, nicely made.</li>
            <li>It is so extremely handy to be able to grab one of these and</li>
            <li>At this very reasonable price the set would make a great gift for any traveler.</li>
            <li>Made very cheaply.</li>
            <li>Nice color and strong.</li>
            <li>I ordered Egobags as well because the set seemed to be a slightly better value.</li>
            <li>Would I recommend this product?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The water resistant nylon is ok, but I like the untreated nylon fabric of Ebags better.</li>
            <li>but I love the cubes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they would contain any liquid</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more for the holiday season.</li>
            <li>I advise it for travelers - it will fit any kind of luggage.</li>
            <li>i love that you can see through the mesh</li>
            <li>so I was able to make do.  </li>
            <li>My sis introduced them to me and gifted me with two.  </li>
            <li>I have used another more costly brand to store my undies in a drawer to keep everything organized.</li>
            <li>I like the size and price of these better.</li>
            <li>I just love these bags.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more for the rest of my family for gifts...</li>
            <li>I received my Ebags first, and loved them.</li>
            <li>The best thing about all this, is that unpacking and repacking was a breeze, as I never really took my stuff out of the cubes for the most part - save for some hangup items.  </li>
            <li>I have been impressed with this product and will highly recommend it to anyone looking for an easy and smart way to pack and travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m traveling abroad and was able to fit two pairs of shorts, two pairs of jeans, two dresses, two pairs of pajamas and 6 tanks in the largest cuben (using the rolling method).  </li>
            <li>It kept them from becoming wrinkled and  easy to switch from one bag to another.  </li>
            <li>It is so cool to pack!</li>
            <li>These cubes are so easy to take your clothes from your suitcase to a hotel dresser, or, the shelves on a cruise ship.  </li>
            <li>Being introduced to these packing cubes, I was amazed at how easy it made my packing and unpacking during travel.</li>
            <li>I packed medication in the smallest bag and it was easy to grab if I wasn&#x27;t taking the suitcase inside.  </li>
            <li>These seemed great at first, and then I used them to pack for the first time...</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>One of the nice things is that they have a smooth surface so it slides right out no matter where it is in the suitcase.</li>
            <li>These bags are wonderful, especially if you are continuing to essentially &#x27;live out of your suitcase&#x27; when you travel.</li>
            <li>I really love the colors on these bags, but the zipper on a couple of them broke the first time I unzipped them, so I will be returning those.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I got these because the sizes were great for packing for my long term trip.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Their reviews are so great because the seller harasses you to post a review right after you purchase, so before you actually put them to the test.  </li>
            <li>Easy, light, convenient, not expensive.</li>
            <li>The sizes are good, and barring any possible future problems it is a good value.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t even packed it that full.</li>
            <li>I labeled each packing cube (pants, shirts, etc) so that I could quickly locate items when needed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend with so many packing uses.  </li>
            <li>and I found these very helpful in organizing items so that I could get to them easily.  </li>
            <li>Hubs and I can keep our clothing and items separated so it is fast and easy to get to what we need.  </li>
            <li>The bags are cheaply made, and the zipper broke off the large bag before I could use it.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product definitely worth checking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used the largest bag to pack two days worth of dressy clothing for a party and a concert.  </li>
            <li>The product description said that they will expand to hold more (as some similar brands will not) and I can see that is true.</li>
            <li>The bags had a very strong chemical odor, similar to gas or car exhaust.</li>
            <li>recently purchased another set and was impressed when I found out that company has gone ahead to use stronger and bigger zippers as well as high quality mesh that covers the entire surface making these even more durable.</li>
            <li>Kingdom Assets customer service is good, they are really committed to making their customers happy, so if you purchase from them and are unhappy, they will rectify the problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally pack my stuff and that of my family all in many suitcases with everything tangled together.</li>
            <li>but I am sure that they are much easier to clean than similar items made of nylon and if the Egobags remains upright</li>
            <li>could not update my original review because the seller closed out the item, so I am wasting even more time on this issue.</li>
            <li>They make packing for a long trip very easy.</li>
            <li>one!&lt;br /&gt;The improved set does have bigger zipper and better seams.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it has a better smell, because both sets were sent to me in the same box.</li>
            <li>Beware if you put anything on top of one that is packed (which I thought was part of the point) as the zippers will split open.  </li>
            <li>However, because I love the colors, I&#x27;m going to give them a second shot.</li>
            <li>Brink on first use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another note is that the blue isn&#x27;t a bright blue like when you see it online, which works out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Largest is great for clothes, next size down, socks, PJs etc,</li>
            <li>The large cube didn&#x27;t even make it through packing before one of the zippers broke.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t detect much of a smell, and didn&#x27;t see any seam defects in any bags but the largest one.</li>
            <li>The largest bag had a seam that looked like it is ready to break.</li>
            <li>It made packing, unpacking, and repacking so much easier.</li>
            <li>Not really too sure how they can be considered spill proof as the lids are mesh</li>
            <li>me add that this is an absolute bargain since you get a 4pc set for the price of a 3pc set.</li>
            <li>product the whole family will use.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, these are double zippers</li>
            <li>And your clothes stay neatly folded and ready to unpack when you arrive.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>I liked the bright colors of these, but when they arrived, I was disappointed that they were not deeper than they were.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought 2 sets, and I was able to put cosmetics, electronics, golf gear, etc into individual compartments.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I also wished they offered some neutral colors--  bright blue and pink only?!  </li>
            <li>They had to be sewn again and reinforced (it wasn&#x27;t worth sending back).</li>
            <li>am looking forward to using them as I pack for my next trip; now that I have used them I can see that I would have probably realized that out of the 10 or so &#x27;tops&#x27; I brought along only 2 were sweaters suitable for English weather in October.</li>
            <li>The smell of Egobags is a pretty big turn off for me.</li>
            <li>They also made a note that they sent me 2 sets of Egobags, one new improved design and one old.</li>
            <li>I wiped them and aired them out on the balcony, but the smell persisted.</li>
            <li>Wow, these packing cubes have transformed the way I pack and travel.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 sets of these cubes and depending on the trip some can be stuffed in a duffel bag on top of our carrier, others can be stuffed inside the trunks of the trike in various positions so no space is wasted.</li>
            <li>and they are constructed far better than much more expensive bags previously purchased.</li>
            <li>I contacted them when I came back from my trip, and they very generously offered to send me a new and improved replacement set with bigger zippers.</li>
            <li>I aired it out, wondering what them smell could be, especially considering that we live on 11th floor.</li>
            <li>I have other packing cubes, but needed a few more.  </li>
            <li>But... personally I wish I spent just a little more money and gotten another set if Ebags.</li>
            <li>I hope the improved set will not have the same quality issues as the old one.  </li>
            <li>Although I expected these to be a bit bigger, they were very helpful on my recent two week trip around Europe.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty disappointing, but since other bags were ok, I just figured I got another dud in a set..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried other packing cubes, but overall, the product does not feel very sturdy and may not hold up for long.</li>

            <li> I actually bought 2 sets, and I was able to put cosmetics, electronics, golf gear, etc into individual compartments.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I also wished they offered some neutral colors--  bright blue and pink only?!  </li>
            <li> They had to be sewn again and reinforced (it wasn&#x27;t worth sending back).</li>
            <li> am looking forward to using them as I pack for my next trip; now that I have used them I can see that I would have probably realized that out of the 10 or so &#x27;tops&#x27; I brought along only 2 were sweaters suitable for English weather in October.</li>
            <li> The smell of Egobags is a pretty big turn off for me.</li>
            <li> They also made a note that they sent me 2 sets of Egobags, one new improved design and one old.</li>
            <li> I wiped them and aired them out on the balcony, but the smell persisted.</li>
            <li> Wow, these packing cubes have transformed the way I pack and travel.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets of these cubes and depending on the trip some can be stuffed in a duffel bag on top of our carrier, others can be stuffed inside the trunks of the trike in various positions so no space is wasted.</li>
            <li> and they are constructed far better than much more expensive bags previously purchased.</li>
            <li> I contacted them when I came back from my trip, and they very generously offered to send me a new and improved replacement set with bigger zippers.</li>
            <li> I aired it out, wondering what them smell could be, especially considering that we live on 11th floor.</li>
            <li> I have other packing cubes, but needed a few more.  </li>
            <li> But... personally I wish I spent just a little more money and gotten another set if Ebags.</li>
            <li> I hope the improved set will not have the same quality issues as the old one.  </li>
            <li> Although I expected these to be a bit bigger, they were very helpful on my recent two week trip around Europe.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty disappointing, but since other bags were ok, I just figured I got another dud in a set..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other packing cubes, but overall, the product does not feel very sturdy and may not hold up for long.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold anywhere near as much as my other cubes do.</li>
            <li> We recently bought a HD trike and plan to do some long distance travel.</li>
            <li> Still using them though I don&#x27;t expect them to last very long.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered a set of these bags over the summer, along with a set of Ebags. I received my Ebags first, and loved them. They were very lightweight, beautiful color, good sizes, nicely made. I ordered Egobags as well because the set seemed to be a slightly better value. The price was the same, but Egobags  offered 4 bags per set and Ebags only 3.&lt;br /&gt;I was not happy when I received my Egobags package. The bags had a very strong chemical odor, similar to gas or car exhaust. I wiped them and aired them out on the balcony, but the smell persisted. The smell lingered on the bags for another 2 weeks before dissipating. The seams on the bags were messy and the mesh ripped from the zipper as I was packing the cubes. I was extremely annoyed because I received the cubes right before my trip and I needed them. I wrote a 1 star review and left for my trip, planning to return them when I came home.&lt;br /&gt;Kingdom Assets, Egobags manufacturer and seller, replied to my review and offered a replacement. I contacted them when I came back from my trip, and they very generously offered to send me a new and improved replacement set with bigger zippers. I was very happy with the customer service, and even happier when I received the package, which contained not one, but 2 sets of bags.  How generous! The box contained a very lovely handwritten note as well. I smelled the bags and examined them. I didn&#x27;t detect much of a smell, and didn&#x27;t see any seam defects in any bags but the largest one. The largest bag had a seam that looked like it is ready to break. It was pretty disappointing, but since other bags were ok, I just figured I got another dud in a set.. I placed the bags in the bedroom closet and decided to update my review to give it more stars, mostly because of the great customer service. Some time later I was going to my son after a nap and noticed that the bedroom smelled like car exhaust. I aired it out, wondering what them smell could be, especially considering that we live on 11th floor. It persisted even after I turned on the air purifier, a fan, and opened the windows. I wondered if it might be a gas leak, and then remembered the Egobags. It was them. They were still giving off the car exhaust/ gas smell. I was annoyed again, I really wanted to like these bags.&lt;br /&gt;Last week I received an email for Kingdom Assets, they were checking if I received the package. They also made a note that they sent me 2 sets of Egobags, one new improved design and one old. That explained the ready-to-rip seams on one of the bags. I have to be honest- even though one of the sets was free, I don&#x27;t quite understand the reasoning behing sending me yet ANOTHER bad set. I already own one!&lt;br /&gt;The improved set does have bigger zipper and better seams. I can&#x27;t tell if it has a better smell, because both sets were sent to me in the same box. The bags are made of water resistant nylon, which the seller touts as a great selling feature. I don&#x27;t care for it. The nylon is not particularly flexible, and I don&#x27;t see how you could transport wet or soiled items in the cubes, considering that the cubes have mesh tops.&lt;br /&gt;I could not update my original review because the seller closed out the item, so I am wasting even more time on this issue. Oh well. Would I recommend this product?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok. The sizes are good, and barring any possible future problems it is a good value. I hope the improved set will not have the same quality issues as the old one.  I like the mesh on tip that allows me to see the bag contents. The water resistant nylon is ok, but I like the untreated nylon fabric of Ebags better. The smell of Egobags is a pretty big turn off for me. It takes a really long time to go away, and the nature of it makes me concerned. Kingdom Assets customer service is good, they are really committed to making their customers happy, so if you purchase from them and are unhappy, they will rectify the problem.&lt;br /&gt; But... personally I wish I spent just a little more money and gotten another set if Ebags.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed when I opened the package and this was what I got.  The large cube didn&#x27;t even make it through packing before one of the zippers broke.  Beware if you put anything on top of one that is packed (which I thought was part of the point) as the zippers will split open.  Definitely a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I really love the colors on these bags, but the zipper on a couple of them broke the first time I unzipped them, so I will be returning those. There were some loose seams and the labels on some were sewn crooked and upside down. However, because I love the colors, I&#x27;m going to give them a second shot. There were mixed reviews, some not so great and some that were excellent. So I just reordered the second set and hopefully this time the quality will improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note is that the blue isn&#x27;t a bright blue like when you see it online, which works out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review once I test out the second set.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got these because the sizes were great for packing for my long term trip. However, after practice packing just once, I realized that one of the seams had already separated on what of the cubes. I hadn&#x27;t even packed it that full. Then when I pulled things out of them I noticed how worn the inside already looked, like the coloring was already coming off the lining after being creased slightly.&lt;br /&gt;Very sad. I had to return them.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews that expressed concern about the zippers.  I don&#x27;t know if they will hold up or not, but I love the cubes.  Even though I have traveled a lot, I&#x27;ve never had a product like this.  It made packing, unpacking, and repacking so much easier.</li>
            <li> Great bags at great price.  Like using them and they are constructed far better than much more expensive bags previously purchased.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for a trip from California to England. Had to pack in a terrible rush so just kind of threw things in them haphazardly. After we settled in at our destination I took everything out of my suitcases and reorganized utilizing the Egobags properly. These bags are wonderful, especially if you are continuing to essentially &#x27;live out of your suitcase&#x27; when you travel. You don&#x27;t have to burrow through the contents of your suitcase each time you need something. It&#x27;s also helpful in terms of keeping a sort of mental inventory of your belongings and not leaving anything behind because there is literally a place for everything and you can keep everything in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to using them as I pack for my next trip; now that I have used them I can see that I would have probably realized that out of the 10 or so &#x27;tops&#x27; I brought along only 2 were sweaters suitable for English weather in October. The product description said that they will expand to hold more (as some similar brands will not) and I can see that is true. Not really too sure how they can be considered spill proof as the lids are mesh but I am sure that they are much easier to clean than similar items made of nylon and if the Egobags remains upright I&#x27;m sure they would contain any liquid spillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value for the price. I will never travel without them again!</li>
            <li> Purchased this set for a friend who is taking an extended trip.  As she was packing, her husband was jealous.  I told him to go to Amazon and buy himself a set.  These cubes are so easy to take your clothes from your suitcase to a hotel dresser, or, the shelves on a cruise ship.  Love them.</li>
            <li> I have other packing cubes, but needed a few more.  I liked the bright colors of these, but when they arrived, I was disappointed that they were not deeper than they were.  They don&#x27;t hold anywhere near as much as my other cubes do.</li>
            <li> About an inch of mesh on one of the cubes was already torn off before I even used the product.  I also wished they offered some neutral colors--  bright blue and pink only?!  I haven&#x27;t tried other packing cubes, but overall, the product does not feel very sturdy and may not hold up for long.</li>
            <li> Wow, these packing cubes have transformed the way I pack and travel. I generally pack my stuff and that of my family all in many suitcases with everything tangled together. It takes some hard work to sort things out later. Being introduced to these packing cubes, I was amazed at how easy it made my packing and unpacking during travel. What I liked about the egobags packing cubes is the 4pc set as well as the quality of the fabric. I know my fabrics well, and frankly I was amazed at the style and strength of the packing cubes. This is a quality product definitely worth checking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased another set and was impressed when I found out that company has gone ahead to use stronger and bigger zippers as well as high quality mesh that covers the entire surface making these even more durable. I have been impressed with this product and will highly recommend it to anyone looking for an easy and smart way to pack and travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me add that this is an absolute bargain since you get a 4pc set for the price of a 3pc set. I will be ordering more for the holiday season.</li>
            <li> I used these while traveling.  We were stopping in 5 different cities and I found these very helpful in organizing items so that I could get to them easily.  I packed medication in the smallest bag and it was easy to grab if I wasn&#x27;t taking the suitcase inside.  I used the largest bag to pack two days worth of dressy clothing for a party and a concert.  It kept them from becoming wrinkled and  easy to switch from one bag to another.  I plan to buy a second set.</li>
            <li> Excellent, work well, keeps things organized for your trip.  Would recommend to anyone that travels often. Good purchase for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m traveling abroad and was able to fit two pairs of shorts, two pairs of jeans, two dresses, two pairs of pajamas and 6 tanks in the largest cuben (using the rolling method).  I put my intimates in the second to smallest cube and my toiletries in the smallest one.  I&#x27;m saving the medium sized one for my dirty clothes on the way back.  Best of all, I was able to fit all of these bags in 21 inch carry on bag and still had room for a pair of heels and sandals. I can&#x27;t believe I have traveled so long without these things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy another set in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 4pc set of ego packing cubes from Kingdom Assets. They offered great customer service. I was very happy upon receiving the product. However I noticed upon using it that the seams to keep the mesh screens in place were loose. They had to be sewn again and reinforced (it wasn&#x27;t worth sending back). Over all good product and customer service, but maybe not the BEST quality.</li>
            <li> Wonderful way to organize luggage.  I bought 3 sets of the packing cubes in 3 separate colors.  It made packing easier.  I labeled each packing cube (pants, shirts, etc) so that I could quickly locate items when needed.</li>
            <li> It is so cool to pack! Easy, light, convenient, not expensive. I advise it for travelers - it will fit any kind of luggage. I like it!</li>
            <li> Brink on first use.  Made very cheaply. Their reviews are so great because the seller harasses you to post a review right after you purchase, so before you actually put them to the test.  I had 2 break, the were used reasons illy, not over-filled or abided.  A zipper broke on 1, the netting detached from another.</li>
            <li> The packing cubes made me organized in an instant. The quality is excellent, the material is strong and the zippers easy. Finally i have a way to travel where I can pull out the next day&#x27;s clothes in an instant for an overnight in a hotel before a big trip. I will never travel without them again. One of the nice things is that they have a smooth surface so it slides right out no matter where it is in the suitcase. At this very reasonable price the set would make a great gift for any traveler.</li>
            <li> I needed a way to be packed in advance and heard about packing cubes&lt;br /&gt;so I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  i love that you can see through the mesh&lt;br /&gt;to see your idems inside without having to unzip it. A great  way to organize&lt;br /&gt;your traveling idems. Having 4 of them gives you plenty of storage for all&lt;br /&gt;your idems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag inside bag design feature gives it a small storage footprint, yet&lt;br /&gt;plenty of storage when you need it. Making it great for family or business trips.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t over load or rzip them forcefully and they will last for years.&lt;br /&gt;A product the whole family will use.</li>
            <li> The bags are cheaply made, and the zipper broke off the large bag before I could use it. I was extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I had always thought that the name brand packing cubes were over priced so I was happy to buy this.  Unfortunately, before I finished packing the zipper broke on one of them and a second one broke while I was traveling.  Fortunately, these are double zippers so I was able to make do.  I will not be replacing them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine traveling for any length of time without one or all four of these.  My sis introduced them to me and gifted me with two.  Bought five for my CO family, each member getting a different color.  Helped the teens stay organized as well as mom and dad.  Highly recommend with so many packing uses.  I&#x27;ve also ordered a set of &#x27;slim&#x27; ones for my next time of traveling.</li>
            <li> Although I expected these to be a bit bigger, they were very helpful on my recent two week trip around Europe.  My clothes stayed neat and wrinkle-free.  I would recommend and am happy that I purchased them.</li>
            <li> We recently bought a HD trike and plan to do some long distance travel. I ordered 2 sets of these cubes and depending on the trip some can be stuffed in a duffel bag on top of our carrier, others can be stuffed inside the trunks of the trike in various positions so no space is wasted. Hubs and I can keep our clothing and items separated so it is fast and easy to get to what we need.  I have used another more costly brand to store my undies in a drawer to keep everything organized. I like the size and price of these better.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a trip overseas.  The second night I unzipped one of the larger cubes only to find that the seams were poorly done and they separated and left a hole.  Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> These bags are great. They make packing for a long trip very easy. And your clothes stay neatly folded and ready to unpack when you arrive.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed. Quality,value and function. Nice color and strong. The sizes are perfect and will organize my belongings. I will order from this company again. I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I just love these bags.  I bought 4, each in a different color.  Perfect for our trip.  Now, our clothes won&#x27;t get wrinkled.  Excellent buy.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These seemed great at first, and then I used them to pack for the first time... they&#x27;re quite cheaply made: the fabric is fraying and one of the zippers has broken. I hadn&#x27;t overpacked or anything, it was just poor quality. Still using them though I don&#x27;t expect them to last very long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I got along traveling without these for so long.  The well constructed nylon bags with zippered mesh tops are ideal for organizing my belongings into compartments.  It is so extremely handy to be able to grab one of these and know that everything is organized into these neat little units.  Largest is great for clothes, next size down, socks, PJs etc, next size down held four rolled up sweaters, and the smallest, jewelry.  I actually bought 2 sets, and I was able to put cosmetics, electronics, golf gear, etc into individual compartments.  The best thing about all this, is that unpacking and repacking was a breeze, as I never really took my stuff out of the cubes for the most part - save for some hangup items.  Highly recommend!  I will buy more for the rest of my family for gifts...</li>
