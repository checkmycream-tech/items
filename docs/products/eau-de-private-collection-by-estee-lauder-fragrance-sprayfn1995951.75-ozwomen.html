            <li>Excellent!  </li>
            <li>no matter where she is, it makes her so very happy, and that, is the best thing a daughter could do!!!</li>
            <li>The perfune is absolutely wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Item is perfect and I am so thankful I can still get it since the formula has been changed in the stores</li>
            <li>Very good product...</li>
            <li>Great product and price.</li>
            <li>Smells great great price</li>
            <li>The price was great.</li>
            <li>Great product and good price.</li>
            <li>I loved, loved, loved this perfume.  </li>
            <li>i always order them on line because the price is right and the service, excellent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Private Collection is one of the most delicious, enticing, voluptuous, sexy, and strong (think character not smell) scents that I have ever smelt.  </li>
            <li>Liked it then, still like it.  </li>
            <li>this and joy are my most favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>This is a great price - fast shipping and she was delighted to get it for Christmas.</li>
            <li>However, there was enough sillage left over in my bottle to recall to me this wonderful, wonderful, wonderful scent, and I will not shy away from ordering it again!  </li>
            <li>Wearing it to bed tonight and am sure to have very sweet dreams indeed!</li>
            <li>The scent was very light.  </li>
            <li>it can take you from sophisticated to&lt;br /&gt;sensual</li>
            <li>I am so glad that did not stop me.  </li>
            <li>It is very strong when you first spray it on, and then after it &amp;#34;settles&amp;#34; it is just lovely.  </li>
            <li>oh my goodness&lt;br /&gt;it is just too strong.</li>
            <li>Estee Lauder&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Sensuous&amp;#34; is by far the most luxurious and gorgeous fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find a source for this classic floral fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a scent I first tried many years ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;is 100% full as it shows a decrease in the content.</li>
            <li>but we always want the &amp;#34;old fashioned - tried and true version.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I got away from scent, if one may say it this way, for about twenty-five years, but recently, I have experienced a Renaissance in my love for scent, and one of the first I ordered from Amazon Prime was Private Collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>....makes me smile.  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely fragrance and the price was a little better than in the store.</li>
            <li>People want what they think smells nice but aren&#x27;t necessarily concerned about how others respond to the scent, yet the main reason for wearing it is to impress others by your scent.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to love this Private collection</li>
            <li>Private Collections is my favorite of all Estee Lauder products.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy the pure fragrance however this purchase was good for the money.</li>
            <li>The odor was absolutely HORRID.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder</li>
            <li>Once I got it home, I realized I didn&#x27;t care for it as much as I remembered, so I gave it as a gift to my sister.</li>
            <li>Of all the different fragrances I have purchased for my wife over the years this is by far her favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance but this bottle of fragrance is not fresh.  </li>
            <li>They have new version out</li>
            <li>delicate and lovely it is.</li>
            <li>Se only wears this perfume and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>like a cheap knock off or past expiration date.  </li>
            <li>I order this for my mother ever year, it&#x27;s her fav, and she cannot seem to find it through the normal Macy&#x27;s stores, back east.</li>
            <li>I use no other fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am out the money and incurred medical fees to clear up a bronchial condition caused by the fumes.  </li>
            <li>I went directly to a department store and purchased a proper bottle.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon, for the endless variety of merchandise!</li>

            <li> Thanks, Amazon, for the endless variety of merchandise!</li>
            <li> it smells like it has been sitting on the shelf way to long.  </li>
            <li> It has been the only fragrance that I have used due to allergy control and the scent does not interfere with my respiratory system.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bottle I ordered was not delivered on time, and due to a holiday weekend, it sat for nearly an extra week inside a UPS truck in blisteringly hot and humid weather.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, and only takes a small spray for all day.  </li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Heat, light, and humidity are scents&#x27; worst enemies, and my bottle of Private Collection and Miss Dior suffered accordingly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed as I had not treated myself to a bottle for a while and was so looking forward to enjoying the scent again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not what I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what happened</li>
            <li> they are difficult to find  in local stores.</li>
            <li> The Box is worn out bad and the bottle does not look new and I am not sure if the bottle&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find now.  </li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for years, but it has become hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> After reading customer reviews I was a little hesitant to order it because of a few bad comments about the smell.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I took it on vacation without sampling it.  </li>
            <li> It is a fake or it is expired.</li>
            <li> ALLERGIC REACTION MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO USE</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible and I threw it out and, at least with fragrances, will never purchase another bottle of perfume through Amazon again!</li>
            <li> This product was HORRIBLE!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fragrance is #2 on my list of favorites!  Depends on the time of day it can take you from sophisticated to&lt;br /&gt;sensual....makes me smile.  People always comment on how my &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; seem to be made &amp;#34;just for me&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> This product was HORRIBLE!!!  This was NOT the product that was described...it was not the product that I have used solely.  I use no other fragrance.  I have used this product for 14 years PLUS.  It has been the only fragrance that I have used due to allergy control and the scent does not interfere with my respiratory system.  Unfortunately I took it on vacation without sampling it.  The odor was absolutely HORRID.  Please in consideration of future buyers do not misrepresent it.  I thought I had saved time in purchasing from Amazon rather than a trip to store....that will NEVER happen again.  Buyer BEWARE.  I am out the money and incurred medical fees to clear up a bronchial condition caused by the fumes.  Mary P.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  On time service!!!!!!  Will order sgain.</li>
            <li> I order this for my mother ever year, it&#x27;s her fav, and she cannot seem to find it through the normal Macy&#x27;s stores, back east. I adore having this sent to her as a surprise no matter where she is, it makes her so very happy, and that, is the best thing a daughter could do!!!</li>
            <li> The scent was very light.  not what I have had in the past.  Not sure what happened but the scent fades in a short time.  It used to last all day and take one spritz.  Now I use 7 or 8 spritzes from this bottle. Will go back to purchasing my scent from department stores again.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, made some browny points too.</li>
            <li> Private Collection was my signature scent throughout the 1980s.  I got away from scent, if one may say it this way, for about twenty-five years, but recently, I have experienced a Renaissance in my love for scent, and one of the first I ordered from Amazon Prime was Private Collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Private Collection is one of the most delicious, enticing, voluptuous, sexy, and strong (think character not smell) scents that I have ever smelt.  Unfortunately, the bottle I ordered was not delivered on time, and due to a holiday weekend, it sat for nearly an extra week inside a UPS truck in blisteringly hot and humid weather.  Heat, light, and humidity are scents&#x27; worst enemies, and my bottle of Private Collection and Miss Dior suffered accordingly.  I blame UPS for this, not Amazon.  However, there was enough sillage left over in my bottle to recall to me this wonderful, wonderful, wonderful scent, and I will not shy away from ordering it again!  I cannot wear most Estee Lauder scents (they literally make me ill), but this is definitely the exception!  Wearing it to bed tonight and am sure to have very sweet dreams indeed!</li>
            <li> I usually buy the pure fragrance however this purchase was good for the money.</li>
            <li> The Box is worn out bad and the bottle does not look new and I am not sure if the bottle&lt;br /&gt;is 100% full as it shows a decrease in the content. Not like the one shown in photo.</li>
            <li> Thanks Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder</li>
            <li> Wore this fragrance in the seventies.  It&#x27;s hard to find now.  Found it on  Amazon and when I smelled it again, it took me back to my youth.  Liked it then, still like it.  Thanks, Amazon, for the endless variety of merchandise!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance but this bottle of fragrance is not fresh.  it smells like it has been sitting on the shelf way to long.  like a cheap knock off or past expiration date.  I&#x27;m very disappointed as I had not treated myself to a bottle for a while and was so looking forward to enjoying the scent again.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to love this Private collection but oh my goodness&lt;br /&gt;it is just too strong. A fragrance shouldn&#x27;t enter the room 10 minutes before&lt;br /&gt;YOU do, and that&#x27;s why I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. Estee Lauder&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Sensuous&amp;#34; is by far the most luxurious and gorgeous fragrance. People&lt;br /&gt;have stopped me at the gym to ask what fragrance I was wearing.....that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;how delicate and lovely it is.</li>
            <li> When I was younger I loved, loved, loved this perfume.  Once I got it home, I realized I didn&#x27;t care for it as much as I remembered, so I gave it as a gift to my sister.</li>
            <li> Of all the different fragrances I have purchased for my wife over the years this is by far her favorite. Fragrances are a peculiar item. People want what they think smells nice but aren&#x27;t necessarily concerned about how others respond to the scent, yet the main reason for wearing it is to impress others by your scent. Go figure. But having said that, she loves it and I know it is always a hit as a gift.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and expected. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is NOT Eau De Private Collection by Estee Lauder! It is a fake or it is expired. The smell was horrible and I threw it out and, at least with fragrances, will never purchase another bottle of perfume through Amazon again! I went directly to a department store and purchased a proper bottle. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> My Mother has worn Private Collection since I was a girl.  They have new version out but we always want the &amp;#34;old fashioned - tried and true version.&amp;#34;  This is a great price - fast shipping and she was delighted to get it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is a scent I first tried many years ago.  After reading customer reviews I was a little hesitant to order it because of a few bad comments about the smell.  I am so glad that did not stop me.  The perfune is absolutely wonderful!  It is very strong when you first spray it on, and then after it &amp;#34;settles&amp;#34; it is just lovely.  It lasts a long time, and only takes a small spray for all day.  This will always be one I keep on hand from now on.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price.</li>
            <li> Private Collections is my favorite of all Estee Lauder products.  I have been using this fragrance for 35 years and still receive compliments every time I am out and about!</li>
            <li> Smells great great price</li>
            <li> ALLERGIC REACTION MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO USE</li>
            <li> Very good product... my wife has used it for years... LOVES IT...!</li>
            <li> Item is perfect and I am so thankful I can still get it since the formula has been changed in the stores</li>
            <li> this and joy are my most favorite scents.  i always order them on line because the price is right and the service, excellent.  they are difficult to find  in local stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Mother&#x27;s Day as it is my mother&#x27;s signature perfume. It has a lovely fragrance and the price was a little better than in the store.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for years, but it has become hard to find in stores. I was very pleased to find a source for this classic floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a close family member. Se only wears this perfume and absolutely loves it. The price was great.</li>
