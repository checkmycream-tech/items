    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best trimmer I have ever had as it cuts well and never needs a charge.</li>
            <li>Great product, you will not regret buying these.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, well built and does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>They always seem to lack the power needed for a good trim.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it has good balance, a well-designed on-off switch, and everything needed for home hair/beard trimming.  </li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t have to squeeze anything into it, and the acessories are nice but nothing to fancy.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s how much I liked it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re cool with that, this is great for beard maintenance.</li>
            <li>Hope it works better than it sounds and feels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will outlast the rechargables many times over.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will spend even more money on another just to find out.  </li>
            <li>It has many attachments and a case to go with it.</li>
            <li>Its a very good machine, overall work clean and neat.</li>
            <li>Here it goes:  If you drive a Chevy and the quality doesnt bother you, this trimmer should be fine for you.   </li>
            <li>All in excellent, but main machine is not working  properly</li>
            <li>Maybe some of the higher Andis models are better, I don&#x27;t know, but this was all that was available at the store.  </li>
            <li>I found it easy to use and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Instead of being cheap, I should have just spent more money for a better product!</li>
            <li>As for use, I like it and am happy that I spent the money.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t cut good sent them back.</li>
            <li>have to say that this shaver has an excellent blade shape to it and is very soft on the more delicate skin areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Meaning, that sometimes you have to go over the same area 2 or 3 times to get a nice, even cut.</li>
            <li>Not that powerful and doesn&#x27;t cut well</li>
            <li>This product feels great in your hand and work prefertly, it cuts clean giving clear trim lines, and no more charging the batteries.  </li>
            <li>, however I can&#x27;t recommend these because there are better clippers out there for a similar cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, my hair is very fine, which may make it harder for this shaver to cut it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better success with the black 11 piece set.</li>
            <li>nothing too much.</li>
            <li>I also really like the case</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li>the first use of these, my old trim-guard showed up and I haven&#x27;t used them since.  </li>
            <li>Decent quantity of kit contents for the price.</li>
            <li>The trimmer has great size, wide head, and you know you got it in your hand as the weight is heavy but</li>
            <li>in the military so I need something that can give me a very short cut, comfortably and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to evaluate its long lastingness, but it is well made, as are the accessories, itself a good sign.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new set of trimmers that are easy to take apart and clean, as I had trouble putting my Wahl back together.  </li>
            <li>I thought well maybe its time for new ones.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I foolishly thought that this particular headliner would be able to produce the same results since it also has a t-blade, but obviously all t-blades aren&#x27;t created equal.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has a powerful motor, a long cord (so you can reach anywhere you need it), and attachments to set the length of the cut.  </li>
            <li>It has the feel and power of a professional quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>I purchased these because I had lost the trim guard for my 7 year old clippers and</li>
            <li>My hair is generally not long at all, nor is it particularly thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly and easily, down to short stubble with no trimming head and up to 3/8-inch with the longest setting.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t dislike them enough to return them, but they definitely won&#x27;t be replacing my main shaver anytime ever.</li>
            <li>do the job and there are no annoying or negative features</li>
            <li>They are very dull &amp; the clipper just dosen&#x27;t have a strong motor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Never mind the taking apart and putting back together, this thing would barely even cut my hair.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not capable of removing all of the hair.</li>
            <li> this wasnt  what i expected</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> was better off saving my money. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This is the first time I see an Andis trimmer work so poorly !</li>
            <li> Works not up to the level that I had expected!</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the blade action is a little slow, resulting in an inconsistent cut.</li>
            <li> Unlike the cordless trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past, the Andis had no trouble with my beard, cutting it to a very even 3/8 inch length without sticking, stalling, or pulling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a clean cut at all and at times you can see that that hair is not coming off as you&#x27;re going across it.</li>
            <li> I may as well just tried to cut my hair with the little scissors that come with it.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a replacement for a cordless trimmer I used for a while and got tired of the battery running out or low.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to put it.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but wanted to for this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for its Cyber Monday deal (65% off) to replace my Wahl that I have been using for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> I went from a 3 minute cut to a nearly 30 minute cut because the blade action is awful.  </li>
            <li> If you are at least a BMW type of guy</li>
            <li> Others have complained that it doesn&#x27;t shave that close.</li>
            <li> If you decide to grow a beard, you need something at least in the ball park with this tool.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is a china version of Andis but surely not a Andis made in china !!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a corded beard trimmer because I was tired of the rechargable ones.</li>
            <li> you may be a little disappointed, as I am.   </li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I could line up with this trimmer, sadly mistaken.</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t handle any buildup of cut hair on the blade at all, until it got stuck, then it just tugged at my hair without cutting it, and it hurt.  </li>
            <li> it work by intermittent, it tear off in place of cutting some time.</li>
            <li> Well, sadly they don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t wish this product on my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> That shaver was terrible.</li>

            <li> Not sure how to put it. Here it goes:  If you drive a Chevy and the quality doesnt bother you, this trimmer should be fine for you.   If you are at least a BMW type of guy you may be a little disappointed, as I am.   i&#x27;ll keep it for now. Hope it works better than it sounds and feels.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t trim close enough to get that line that you want. Still need a razor to get close enough. You have to slide the clippers multiple ways to trick the hair into getting cut, and even then it doesn&#x27;t cut evenly along the line.    Occasionally the trimmer makes a noise as if something is loose and vibrating around.    Trimmer body has marks on it as if it was dropped - probably just shipping though.    Decent quantity of kit contents for the price.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but wanted to for this product. It is a great product, well built and does the job nicely. I use it as a replacement for a cordless trimmer I used for a while and got tired of the battery running out or low. The trimmer has great size, wide head, and you know you got it in your hand as the weight is heavy but nothing too much. I also really like the case, you don&#x27;t have to squeeze anything into it, and the acessories are nice but nothing to fancy. I would reccomend this product to anyone who is looking for a trimmer and shaver.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a corded beard trimmer because I was tired of the rechargable ones. They always seem to lack the power needed for a good trim. This one turned out to be just what I needed. It has the feel and power of a professional quality trimmer. For the money, you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;m sure it will outlast the rechargables many times over. And I won&#x27;t have to worry about buying a battery for it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut good sent them back.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new set of trimmers that are easy to take apart and clean, as I had trouble putting my Wahl back together.  Never mind the taking apart and putting back together, this thing would barely even cut my hair.  It couldn&#x27;t handle any buildup of cut hair on the blade at all, until it got stuck, then it just tugged at my hair without cutting it, and it hurt.  I tried several attachments, as well as the blade that&#x27;s on it, same thing.  My hair is generally not long at all, nor is it particularly thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the military so I need something that can give me a very short cut, comfortably and quickly.  I went from a 3 minute cut to a nearly 30 minute cut because the blade action is awful.  I may as well just tried to cut my hair with the little scissors that come with it.  Maybe some of the higher Andis models are better, I don&#x27;t know, but this was all that was available at the store.  I don&#x27;t think I will spend even more money on another just to find out.  Never mind me ill-recommending this trimmer, I wouldn&#x27;t wish this product on my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for its Cyber Monday deal (65% off) to replace my Wahl that I have been using for the past 5 years. My old shaver was simply too dull and needed a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that this shaver has an excellent blade shape to it and is very soft on the more delicate skin areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the blade action is a little slow, resulting in an inconsistent cut. Meaning, that sometimes you have to go over the same area 2 or 3 times to get a nice, even cut. However, my hair is very fine, which may make it harder for this shaver to cut it.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I could line up with this trimmer, sadly mistaken. It&#x27;s not a clean cut at all and at times you can see that that hair is not coming off as you&#x27;re going across it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers with confidence that they will get the job done. Well, sadly they don&#x27;t! These clippers just don&#x27;t cut ! They are very dull &amp; the clipper just dosen&#x27;t have a strong motor.&lt;br /&gt;I was better off saving my money. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I brought these to replace a battery operated trimmer/shaver which operated well for a while but constantly required charging. This product feels great in your hand and work prefertly, it cuts clean giving clear trim lines, and no more charging the batteries.  Great product, you will not regret buying these.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut very well. It&#x27;s definitely not capable of removing all of the hair. I use mine to cut my head bald because I can&#x27;t use razors. This cannot get the job done. I&#x27;ve had better success with the black 11 piece set. I foolishly thought that this particular headliner would be able to produce the same results since it also has a t-blade, but obviously all t-blades aren&#x27;t created equal.</li>
            <li> this wasnt  what i expected</li>
            <li> Not that powerful and doesn&#x27;t cut well</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I had lost the trim guard for my 7 year old clippers and I thought well maybe its time for new ones.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use of these, my old trim-guard showed up and I haven&#x27;t used them since.  They don&#x27;t cut close enough for my liking and they aren&#x27;t adjustable like my other clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can get a closer shave on my beard from my hair clippers than I can from these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do the job and there are no annoying or negative features, however I can&#x27;t recommend these because there are better clippers out there for a similar cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t dislike them enough to return them, but they definitely won&#x27;t be replacing my main shaver anytime ever.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a powerful motor, a long cord (so you can reach anywhere you need it), and attachments to set the length of the cut.  It cuts cleanly and easily, down to short stubble with no trimming head and up to 3/8-inch with the longest setting.  Unlike the cordless trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past, the Andis had no trouble with my beard, cutting it to a very even 3/8 inch length without sticking, stalling, or pulling.  I have used it on my mustache, sideburns, and eyebrows as well, and if I wanted my hair to be that short I would have no hesitation about using the Andis Headliner to trim my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it has good balance, a well-designed on-off switch, and everything needed for home hair/beard trimming.  I found it easy to use and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> solid product. Others have complained that it doesn&#x27;t shave that close. But it&#x27;s not designed to be a shaver. It is a trimmer. Without any attachment, you can only get down to the scruffy look. If you&#x27;re cool with that, this is great for beard maintenance. I&#x27;ve also used it on my head. Don&#x27;t do what I did and plug it in overseas into a 220 V outlet. Fried it and now this is my second one. But that&#x27;s how much I liked it.</li>
            <li> All in excellent, but main machine is not working  properly i will next machine demand soon.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> That shaver was terrible. My wife uses it for the cat now.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever had as it cuts well and never needs a charge. It has many attachments and a case to go with it.</li>
            <li> If you are going to grow any facial hair, from soul patch to mountain man, you&#x27;ll need something like this. You can get by for years trimming a regulation UPS &#x27;stash; I did it. If you decide to grow a beard, you need something at least in the ball park with this tool. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to evaluate its long lastingness, but it is well made, as are the accessories, itself a good sign. As for use, I like it and am happy that I spent the money. Grow away!</li>
            <li> As expected. I like the brushes it came with along with the case.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I see an Andis trimmer work so poorly ! This cannot be an item to recommend...it work by intermittent, it tear off in place of cutting some time. I suppose this is a china version of Andis but surely not a Andis made in china !!</li>
            <li> Instead of being cheap, I should have just spent more money for a better product! Works not up to the level that I had expected!</li>
            <li> Its a very good machine, overall work clean and neat. i recommend it to anybody!</li>
