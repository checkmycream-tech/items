            <li>Very effective for me.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Eyelash Growth Serum from Omiera Labs for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I ordered it immediately.</li>
            <li>All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>(I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all and is very easy to apply which you apply twice a day.</li>
            <li>This product was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>product is a natural eyelash serum , Omiera Labs Revimour is the best lash and brow enhancer serum to grow thicker longer eyelashes and bolder eyebrows in about a month.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t get it in your eye because it burns.</li>
            <li>It has no unwanted scent, and comes in a sleek and stylish package.</li>
            <li>I really love omiera..</li>
            <li>I just wish I got more for my money.</li>
            <li>and I am really glad that I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried many medication like Latisee but nothing helped that much&lt;</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and apply just follow the directions</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy product to use .</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m running out very quickly.</li>
            <li>it was 1/4 full.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this based on all the great reviews and unfortunately, it looks like most those reviews were based upon receiving free product.</li>
            <li>Amazing results in just 2 weeks, finally something works for me</li>
            <li>But using this product is restoring my lashes back to their original fullness plus more .</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure you will be amazed with the results , the same as I did</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what other special stuff people were using but this did nothing significant to the growth of my lashes.  </li>
            <li>The sponge like applicator never seems to apply much product and my eyelashes are shorter than when I started.</li>
            <li>It is a gradual process but works very well.</li>
            <li>recommend this product to u if you are losing your eyelashes fast or u have no eye lashes&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the kind of thing that you need to use every single day in order to see the results, but if you stick to it, it will work!</li>
            <li>but I really really like it so far!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used multiple other serums from Rapid Lash to GrandeLash MD and all have worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working ok, I guess, but hard to tell since the tube was only filled about 40%</li>
            <li>Peptide has been clinically proven to trigger new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try this to experiment with something new</li>
            <li>and I can already see new growth and longer lashes.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with every single Omiera Labs product I have tried so far, and this Revimour Eyelash and Eyebrow Enhancer definitely lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>The product arrived clearly used!</li>
            <li>When applying it goes on clear which is convenient during makeup application.</li>
            <li>This product is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Eyelash Growth Serum from Omiera for anyone who wants to have longer lashes and thicker eyebrows.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was no evidence of it possibly leaking during shipment, so it is safe to say it has been heavily used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot speak to how well it works only my experience so far.</li>

            <li> I cannot speak to how well it works only my experience so far.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly for my eyebrows because the hairs get a little sparse by the tails.</li>
            <li> eyelashes are thicker and longer , I did get false eyelashes a lot over the past year and they have done a lot of damage to my own lashes .</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes, so I was really worried that it would be irritating.</li>
            <li> I like thick long lashes and really need help with mine because I have over waxed and plucked my eyebrows and my over use of waterproof mascara has ruined my wanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long</li>
            <li> but as I said I haven&#x27;t been using it that long yet</li>
            <li> The seal was completely open and it was only half full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product, so it will last a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent $30 an</li>
            <li> Appeared used when it arrived, and the seal was broken so I almost threw it straight in the trash, as I won&#x27;t risk using a used product on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> And if you stop using it, your lashes will not fall out, unlike other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go for small size as it gets cloudy over a relatively short period of time.</li>
            <li> This is the first eyelash growth product I&#x27;ve ever tried, I&#x27;ve always been afraid that they would cause eye irritation or have some other freak accident happen.</li>
            <li> This product was not completely full.  </li>
            <li> So far the only thing that has worked for me is Lilash which is almost impossible to find now.</li>
            <li> It comes half empty!!!!</li>
            <li> Not effective.</li>
            <li> It also nourishes skin around hair follicles, which helps to reverse damage done by false eyelashes and over plucking.</li>
            <li> Product did not work :-((((</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly dissatisfied and a bit disgusted.</li>

            <li> This is a perfect product to have fuller longer eyelashes , this product came just as described .It arrived quickly and the packaging was perfect .It arrived in perfect condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a natural eyelash serum , Omiera Labs Revimour is the best lash and brow enhancer serum to grow thicker longer eyelashes and bolder eyebrows in about a month. Peptide has been clinically proven to trigger new hair growth. It also nourishes skin around hair follicles, which helps to reverse damage done by false eyelashes and over plucking. This product is made with natural ingredients. And if you stop using it, your lashes will not fall out, unlike other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for awhile and I have seen great results .My eyelashes are thicker and longer , I did get false eyelashes a lot over the past year and they have done a lot of damage to my own lashes . But using this product is restoring my lashes back to their original fullness plus more . This is easy to use and apply just follow the directions and you will have beautiful fuller and longer lashes .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I am noticing a difference in my eyelashes already. They seem thicker. It&#x27;s an easy product to use . Just make sure you don&#x27;t get it in your eye because it burns.</li>
            <li> I got this today and tested it out. I cannot speak to how well it works only my experience so far. It has no unwanted scent, and comes in a sleek and stylish package. It went on my lashes perfect and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I am looking forward to continuing to use this product and am hopeful that I will see great results.</li>

            <li> I really love omiera.. I solute this product.. Very effective for me. I don&#x27;t really  need to wear mascara everyday. Highly recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what other special stuff people were using but this did nothing significant to the growth of my lashes.  I&#x27;ll try it again after another product</li>
            <li> This product was not completely full.  I spent $30 an it was 1/4 full.  It worked. I just wish I got more for my money.</li>
            <li> The product arrived clearly used! The seal was completely open and it was only half full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no evidence of it possibly leaking during shipment, so it is safe to say it has been heavily used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly dissatisfied and a bit disgusted. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. (I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> It comes half empty!!!! I can&#x27;t believe it</li>
            <li> I buy it again and again.  Go for small size as it gets cloudy over a relatively short period of time.</li>
            <li> Product did not work :-((((</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on all the great reviews and unfortunately, it looks like most those reviews were based upon receiving free product. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for over six weeks now and I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed. I&#x27;ve used multiple other serums from Rapid Lash to GrandeLash MD and all have worked amazingly well. I thought I would try this to experiment with something new and it looks like I never should have strayed from what works. The sponge like applicator never seems to apply much product and my eyelashes are shorter than when I started. If I could return this for money back, I would. Don&#x27;t believe the reviews on here that have basically been bought.</li>
            <li> Appeared used when it arrived, and the seal was broken so I almost threw it straight in the trash, as I won&#x27;t risk using a used product on my eyelashes. Out of principal I will be returning it which is just a pain in the ass. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long but I really really like it so far! This is the first eyelash growth product I&#x27;ve ever tried, I&#x27;ve always been afraid that they would cause eye irritation or have some other freak accident happen. I went ahead and took a chance with the Revimour and I am really glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all and is very easy to apply which you apply twice a day. You don&#x27;t need to apply a ton of it so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it clumping on making your eyelashes look weird!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of difference in the growth but as I said I haven&#x27;t been using it that long yet but I think this definitely will work! I would definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Not effective. Ad is misleading.</li>
            <li> I like thick long lashes and really need help with mine because I have over waxed and plucked my eyebrows and my over use of waterproof mascara has ruined my wanted facial hair. So when I was offered this Eyelash Growth Serum from Omiera Labs for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I ordered it immediately. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks now and I can already see new growth and longer lashes. I definitely recommend this Eyelash Growth Serum from Omiera for anyone who wants to have longer lashes and thicker eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working ok, I guess, but hard to tell since the tube was only filled about 40% so I&#x27;m running out very quickly. Would not buy again just for that reason alone.</li>
            <li> This product is great! When applying it goes on clear which is convenient during makeup application. This product was very easy to apply. The packaging was great quality. The product did not cause irritation in any way. I have been using this product for a week now and can already see results. It is a gradual process but works very well.</li>
            <li> Amazing results in just 2 weeks, finally something works for me, I&#x27;ve tried many medication like Latisee but nothing helped that much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to u if you are losing your eyelashes fast or u have no eye lashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure you will be amazed with the results , the same as I did</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.  I actually started LOSING lashes.  So far the only thing that has worked for me is Lilash which is almost impossible to find now.</li>
