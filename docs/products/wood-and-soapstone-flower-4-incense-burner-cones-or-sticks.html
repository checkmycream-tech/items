    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>found this best suited for cone insense.</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be the best option as a holder.</li>
            <li>Very attractive product, just not at all functional for purpose purchased.  </li>
            <li>Top all that off with the wonderfully fragrant incense I&#x27;ve been using</li>
            <li>Moreover, for the price, this was as good as I could have hoped.</li>
            <li>The sale itself was good.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for something better!</li>
            <li>I do have to say it&#x27;s not as nice as in the picture though.</li>
            <li>nice workmanship&#x3D;</li>
            <li>Not an elegant solution.</li>
            <li>If there were anything that could make this better it would have to be a well deserved slap to the bollocks.</li>
            <li>Looks okay</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>sale was fine.</li>
            <li>and it would cost me more to return it than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Item was cheap,  </li>
            <li>Liked so much</li>
            <li>inscense still lean to the side significantly while burning, dropping ash on the table or where ever.</li>
            <li>Especially since although its advertised for sticks, good luck getting one to stay standing up.  </li>
            <li>it arrived quickly</li>
            <li>It looks nice and it was cheap the sandstone fell off the wood the second day.  </li>
            <li>wooden dish is smaller than it seems like it would be from the website, and doesn&#x27;t do a good job of catching</li>
            <li>it is worth about 50cents.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m about ready to climb to the top of a clock tower with a high powered rifle.</li>
            <li>Ensure you know the exact size of the incense you are trying to purchase a burner for.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful little piece of craftsmanship with wood exterior and soapstone flower in the middle.  </li>
            <li>The holes in the dish are too large and do not hold the incense cones or sticks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little incense burner.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>most incense sticks don&#x27;t fit in the holes provided (only the center hole).  </li>
            <li>This will NOT hold them up straight</li>
            <li>Although it is a very nice looking Incense Burner , the Middle is to large for the largest round incense stick.  </li>
            <li>The holes are a strange size and don&#x27;t fit my incense.</li>
            <li>However the product states that its made for sticks and cones and  the holes are not nearly big enough for most of the sticks I have and weren&#x27;t deep enough to hold up the sticks that were smaller and did fit.</li>
            <li>The beautiful wood finish, the well constructed soapstone flower in the middle, and the absolute perfect size is enough to drive a grown man mad with disappointment.</li>
            <li>Do Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>the center insert fell out right out of the package-no glue to hold it in.</li>
            <li>I liked the overall design, but the center piece is plastic and a little tacky looking.  </li>
            <li>The holes are large enough to hold the stick incense without the wooden ends on it.</li>
            <li>Fairly pretty junk, and it&#x27;s okay for burning fat short cones, but if you are looking for something even vaguely quality, pass this by.</li>
            <li>After using it twice, the soapstone portion came free of the wood portion, revealing the shoddy glue.</li>
            <li>I will go back to using an old candle to hold incense sticks.</li>
            <li>Most of my inscense are too thin to stand in the holder and my thickest</li>
            <li>When it arrived, however, I found that the inscent stick holes are nothing more than very shallow divots</li>
            <li>As it was described, I expected the holes to be able to handle stick incense, but the holes are too shallow.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two and asked the seller if he had ones that were drilled deeper so the sticks would stand up, he suggested that I break the wood off the incense to accommodate the shallow fit -- unfortunately, it only worked twice out of 20 sticks tried.  </li>

            <li> &quot; it by drilling a tiny hole in the center so the sticks stand upright and the problem was solved.</li>
            <li> very pretty and seems like it would work well, but the indentations are very shallow, leading to cones as well as sticks tipping over at the slightest breath.&lt;br</li>

            <li> The holes that were bored into this are too wide for even the largest incense sticks</li>
            <li> Also the base isn&#x27;t wide enough, the ashes from the incense go everywhere</li>

            <li> After getting so frustrated, I tried ramming a stick in so hard that the soapstone in the center busted in pieces.</li>

            <li> I expected this incense burner to hold the incense sticks upright, but they don&#x27;t stand up well and seem to be in danger of falling. I will keep the item because I can burn cone incense on it anyway and it would cost me more to return it than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> As it was described, I expected the holes to be able to handle stick incense, but the holes are too shallow.  I snipped off the wooden stick end of the incense and put the thicker incense-covered part of the stick into the hole, and it seemed to stand up that way.  Not an elegant solution.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use incense cones, so this burner/holder is useless for me.  Especially since although its advertised for sticks, good luck getting one to stay standing up.  The holes that were bored into this are too wide for even the largest incense sticks I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a disappointment really.  Was hoping for something better!</li>
            <li> I have spent weeks agonizing over this purchase I can say with no doubts what so ever that I think I made a mistake. The beautiful wood finish, the well constructed soapstone flower in the middle, and the absolute perfect size is enough to drive a grown man mad with disappointment. Top all that off with the wonderfully fragrant incense I&#x27;ve been using and I&#x27;m about ready to climb to the top of a clock tower with a high powered rifle. If there were anything that could make this better it would have to be a well deserved slap to the bollocks.</li>
            <li> I used mine once or twice for cones before finally deeming it useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very pretty and seems like it would work well, but the indentations are very shallow, leading to cones as well as sticks tipping over at the slightest breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also very difficult to keep clean. After using it twice, the soapstone portion came free of the wood portion, revealing the shoddy glue. I haven&#x27;t bothered to put it back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wooden dish is smaller than it seems like it would be from the website, and doesn&#x27;t do a good job of catching ashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d call it junk. Fairly pretty junk, and it&#x27;s okay for burning fat short cones, but if you are looking for something even vaguely quality, pass this by.</li>
            <li> I liked the overall design, but the center piece is plastic and a little tacky looking.  However, given the price, this is to be expected.  Moreover, for the price, this was as good as I could have hoped.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful little piece of craftsmanship with wood exterior and soapstone flower in the middle.  The holes are large enough to hold the stick incense without the wooden ends on it.</li>
            <li> Do Do not waste your money. Holes in the holder or not deep enough to hold any sticks of incense but I have</li>
            <li> The sale itself was good. Item was cheap,  it arrived quickly sale was fine. However the product states that its made for sticks and cones and  the holes are not nearly big enough for most of the sticks I have and weren&#x27;t deep enough to hold up the sticks that were smaller and did fit.</li>
            <li> The holes are a strange size and don&#x27;t fit my incense. They are too big.</li>
            <li> Liked so much I ordered two...</li>
            <li> The holder I got had very shallow holes and wouldn&#x27;t hold the sticks very well.&lt;br /&gt;I drilled the holes to make them deeper and it works alright but you still may end up with ash on your table.&lt;br /&gt;I found this best suited for cone insense.</li>
            <li> The holes in the dish are too large and do not hold the incense cones or sticks.  Completely useless.  I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to burn inscense in my home for a while and I thought this would be the best option as a holder. When it arrived, however, I found that the inscent stick holes are nothing more than very shallow divots int he soap stone. Most of my inscense are too thin to stand in the holder and my thickest inscense still lean to the side significantly while burning, dropping ash on the table or where ever. This defeats the purpose of an inscense holder! I will have to drill into it to make the holes deeper and hope that this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Although it is a very nice looking Incense Burner , the Middle is to large for the largest round incense stick.  Ensure you know the exact size of the incense you are trying to purchase a burner for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little incense burner. I do have to say it&#x27;s not as nice as in the picture though.</li>
            <li> Looks okay most incense sticks don&#x27;t fit in the holes provided (only the center hole).  It looks nice and it was cheap the sandstone fell off the wood the second day.  I had to glue it back together. Also the base isn&#x27;t wide enough, the ashes from the incense go everywhere but in the wood tray where they belong.  I will go back to using an old candle to hold incense sticks.</li>
            <li> cant use-holes werent drilled deep enough i would never buy this item again&#x3D;nice workmanship&#x3D;why buy something you cant ever use</li>
            <li> Honestly, I almost never review products, but the anger this product has caused me has compelled me to do so.  I would definitely not recommend this for incense sticks.  This will NOT hold them up straight (if at all usually).  After getting so frustrated, I tried ramming a stick in so hard that the soapstone in the center busted in pieces.</li>
            <li> Craftsmanship in the picture doesn&#x27;t do the product justice as the carved flower is in soapstone and not wood.  Very attractive product, just not at all functional for purpose purchased.  I ordered two and asked the seller if he had ones that were drilled deeper so the sticks would stand up, he suggested that I break the wood off the incense to accommodate the shallow fit -- unfortunately, it only worked twice out of 20 sticks tried.  So I am trying again with pewter product that appears not to have that problem.</li>
            <li> The holes couldn&#x27;t hold sticks of incense</li>
            <li> the center insert fell out right out of the package-no glue to hold it in. there were no holes for incense sticks-- just a picture that looks like there is. i glued in the insert and drilled out the incense stick holes. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. it is worth about 50cents.</li>
            <li> When i received the burner the holes for the incense sticks were too shallow. I would imagine it may only be my specific stone but just in case now you know</li>
            <li> Very shallow, wont hold an incense. If you break the stick shorter, the incense leans away from the bowl, so ashes drop on the table.&lt;br /&gt;Its cute but useless for stick incense.</li>
            <li> The size of the unit is smaller than I expected.  Also, the holes are big enough to put 3 incent sticks into.  If you only have one stick in the hole, the stick leans way over and the ashes fall onto the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I \\&quot;Fixed\\&quot; it by drilling a tiny hole in the center so the sticks stand upright and the problem was solved.</li>
            <li> Good quality. I love it. Just can&#x27;t use it yet. The holes for the incense aren&#x27;t deep enough to hold the incense. Thank you.</li>
