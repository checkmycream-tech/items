She has also done the nails for family and friends and helped them get started.

            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t too oily but it keep the skin around the nails soft. I use it in my fingers and toes. I bought this bc it came with the girlish kit but I didn&#x27;t like the polish. It&#x27;s very hard to apply. I&#x27;ll just stick to the salons for my gel manicures.</li>
