            <li>Smells really nice, I got this for my boyfriend, after smelling someone in the grocery store and asked him what</li>
            <li>Amazon needs to invest some kind of on-screen scratch card you can sniff at, so I just stick to ordering what I know I am going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality wise, this is easily my favorite of the Polo scents.</li>
            <li>the shipping was quick and product was a great deal for the amount you get n</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, great product</li>
            <li>bottled version, as that is another of my favorites and probably most popular with the Polo range.  </li>
            <li>For those loving and very warm and sincere ladies out there, your Man will love you forever if he gets this as a special treat, I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>Great price for a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Great product - fast shipping</li>
            <li>fantastic price!</li>
            <li>the smell is nonexistent even if i were to add more.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>Love Amazon, but....</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>My husband love this</li>
            <li>I checked the price per ml and ordered the one that I was getting the most for my money.  </li>
            <li>Always get many compliments on this cologne.  </li>
            <li>nothing but love for this one also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sophisticated scent that works in any situation and in any weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its almost MAGICAL , so do not buy this stuff .or</li>
            <li>Sophisticated and sexy</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely delicious and the scent last for hours.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Great fresh clean scent, the idea purchase for any man on your list for whom you do now know what to give.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast free delivery.</li>
            <li>I like being able to buy a larger bottle not to mention the price was great.</li>
            <li>No scent, just strong alcohol odor.</li>
            <li>This bottle is HUGE</li>
            <li>So, for me, its the genuine article.  </li>
            <li>It is a suave smell, and nothing cheap or Axe body-sprayish.  </li>
            <li>Same product and great price for the size.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a manly smell not to sweet or strong</li>
            <li>Overwhelming alcohol smell not the woodsy tones that make this such an exceptional cologne.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m stuck with a full bottle of this stuff.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is very concentrated you only need 3-4 sprays and you will be smelling great for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>this is my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>believe this was fulfilled by Amazon and although the estimated delivery date was far out, it came to me after about 4 days, which I thought was OK (even though I have Prime Membership).  </li>
            <li>So far my favorite cologne for men.</li>
            <li>so far I like this one the most, but I do like them all.</li>
            <li>It smells &#x27;rich&#x27; and the price suggests as much.</li>
            <li>,he was we a ring, I came home and ordered right away.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was much cheaper than retail stores.</li>
            <li>I love Polo Black, and get compliments from women almost daily on how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>Let me assure you that if you order from Amazon you will get exactly what you expect.  </li>
            <li>There is no warning on the bottle but after my experience there better be in the future.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>I even had to double my order more Vigra , DO NOT</li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased to find this large bottle for the price of a much smaller one!</li>
            <li>Had polo black cologne and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>wild!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid around $74 and the bottle is LARGE.  </li>
            <li>Great cologne but this 6.7 version is incredibly weak.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for years and always get complements when i wear it, its really for fall and winter season when i wear it during the summer</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize just how much 6.7oz turns out to be when ordering online,</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell the whole room up.</li>
            <li>Really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I often get subtle comments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>Love Polo Black</li>
            <li>I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended</li>
            <li>something I don&#x27;t normally do with perfumes and cologne.  </li>
            <li>I love polo black!</li>
            <li>When I was younger, I used far too much each time I sprayed it on, I practically bathed in the stuff!!  </li>
            <li>This is my new scent.</li>
            <li>To say that the dolce gabbana  light blue last longer is already saying a lot</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a more mature or complex version of Armani code.</li>
            <li>I BUY THE SAME PRODUCT AT MY LOCAL PHARMACY FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE</li>
            <li>Given colognes delicate nature to light and temperatures this can happen i suppose.  </li>
            <li>I like this cologne, so I am obviously biased as far as the scent it gives off.  </li>
            <li>Even when put on right away there is little sent.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m off to, erm, sniff out a new deal if you will excuse the pun.  </li>
            <li>Polo double black is much better than polo black.</li>
            <li>will however say it is not long lasting.</li>

            <li> will however say it is not long lasting.</li>
            <li> So, be warned and if it&#x27;s your first time, order a smaller bottle, at least until you know you like the scent.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a big bottle that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> As mentioned above the fragrance has a long lasting effect without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> so far I tried these RALPH LAUREN colognes the green,the blue and the black.</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s going to be a long day.</li>
            <li> Nowadays, I use just a few mini &amp;#34;puffs&amp;#34; and notice the aroma stays on me for several hours, so I expect it to last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a single time when I have worn it that it hasn&#x27;t garnered a compliment.</li>
            <li> so well I don&#x27;t want the other guys to know its power .Woman</li>
            <li> Usually $50 for a third this size.</li>
            <li> Seems watered down compared to other Polo Black cologne from Dillard&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I ordered Polo Black from Amazon (sold and shipped by them).  </li>
            <li> I have been using Polo Black for years.  </li>
            <li> if you like Polo Black - you will like this</li>
            <li> I never leave the house without a few squirts.</li>

            <li> excellent fragrance for men, the best there is</li>
            <li> Great price and fast free delivery.</li>
            <li> I ordered Polo Black from Amazon (sold and shipped by them).  Other reviewers mentioned that they got fake product.  Let me assure you that if you order from Amazon you will get exactly what you expect.  I love Polo Black, and get compliments from women almost daily on how good I smell.  I never leave the house without a few squirts.</li>
            <li> Polo double black is much better than polo black.</li>
            <li> Do not make this purchase unless you are prepared to be attacked by women as if a zombie virus has gone airborne. There is no warning on the bottle but after my experience there better be in the future. One last word of advice I would board up your windows and have plenty of rations and water before you spray this on your boys.</li>
            <li> Great fresh clean scent, the idea purchase for any man on your list for whom you do now know what to give. Always smells great, and quickly becomes a memorable scent that brings great memories. Great buy, and even greater deal! This bottle is HUGE</li>
            <li> Great product - fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smells great on my husband!</li>
            <li> fantastic price! Love Polo Black</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and always get complements when i wear it, its really for fall and winter season when i wear it during the summer the smell is nonexistent even if i were to add more.</li>
            <li> A great smell for my son and husband.  A perfect gift for the &amp;#34;hard to buy for&amp;#34; man in your life.</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping and product</li>
            <li> It made the perfect Christmas gift for my husband, this is his favorite brand of cologne and it makes him smell so good.  It was a little expensive but it&#x27;s a big bottle that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, I got this for my boyfriend, after smelling someone in the grocery store and asked him what,he was we a ring, I came home and ordered right away.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> best price anywhere and great service would recommened to anyone if you like to smell great for you or the women in your life this is it</li>
            <li> Best price I found, delivered fast!</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly what i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipment and reliable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great price for the product</li>
            <li> I like the scent, but I received the product without a nozzle. Not sure how to spray it now so I&#x27;m stuck with a full bottle of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne, so I am obviously biased as far as the scent it gives off.  When I was younger, I used far too much each time I sprayed it on, I practically bathed in the stuff!!  Nowadays, I use just a few mini &amp;#34;puffs&amp;#34; and notice the aroma stays on me for several hours, so I expect it to last a very long time.  I often smell it on the clothes at night when I take them off.  So, for me, its the genuine article.  It has a masculine fragrance and is noticeable but not so it will behave like an insect repellent and scare away your chosen mate, lol.  For those loving and very warm and sincere ladies out there, your Man will love you forever if he gets this as a special treat, I&#x27;m sure you and he won&#x27;t be disappointed, especially if the fragrance drives you wild!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid around $74 and the bottle is LARGE.  I didn&#x27;t realize just how much 6.7oz turns out to be when ordering online, something I don&#x27;t normally do with perfumes and cologne.  So, be warned and if it&#x27;s your first time, order a smaller bottle, at least until you know you like the scent.  Amazon needs to invest some kind of on-screen scratch card you can sniff at, so I just stick to ordering what I know I am going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this was fulfilled by Amazon and although the estimated delivery date was far out, it came to me after about 4 days, which I thought was OK (even though I have Prime Membership).  That may change when you buy, it just depends on the Fulfillment partner who gets the order from Amazon.  Good product, well priced, and great packaging.  I recommend it.  I may order the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; bottled version, as that is another of my favorites and probably most popular with the Polo range.  So, I&#x27;m off to, erm, sniff out a new deal if you will excuse the pun.  Good luck...</li>
            <li> I have been using Polo Black for years.  It is a very elegant fragrance that is not overbearing, both rugged and dressed-up.  This was a great value at this price for this size container.</li>
            <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong Amazon has always made me free and better; acquires another company uses Amazon are excellent, Amazon is always an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance, for example, I love the way all I can even give gende and love and is also author of Through Amazon, as well as any product I buy, is truly exquisite.</li>
            <li> My husband tried a sample of this from a department store so knew we would like it.  I think it&#x27;s a manly smell not to sweet or strong</li>
            <li> This is my new scent. Smells manly, lasts through 8 hrs of work. Doesn&#x27;t smell the whole room up.</li>
            <li> Is a good product and good service</li>
            <li> Love Amazon, but....i&#x27;ve been wearing this stuff for years.  So I thought I might as well get the largest size...mistake.  Overwhelming alcohol smell not the woodsy tones that make this such an exceptional cologne.  Given colognes delicate nature to light and temperatures this can happen i suppose.  Nonetheless, i wont be buying cologne online any longer.  Get a good bottle and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> if you like Polo Black - you will like this if course.  the shipping was quick and product was a great deal for the amount you get n the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love polo black! Smells so good! So far my favorite cologne for men. This is also the largest bottle I have ever found. Great deal!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product</li>
            <li> My husband love this and it smells good on him</li>
            <li> Great smell, huge bottle.  I checked the price per ml and ordered the one that I was getting the most for my money.  I&#x27;m happy I did because this stuff smells great.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was much cheaper than retail stores. Quality wise, this is easily my favorite of the Polo scents. I don&#x27;t think there is a single time when I have worn it that it hasn&#x27;t garnered a compliment. Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> As mentioned above the fragrance has a long lasting effect without being overpowering. I often get subtle comments on how good I smell. While I like all POLO fragrances this one seems to be the best.</li>
            <li> Had polo black cologne and liked it a lot. This product does not last but a short while. Even when put on right away there is little sent. Used to get compliments on the sent all the time. Nothing with this.</li>
            <li> Always get many compliments on this cologne.  Really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Daily I get someone asking me what scent I am wearing.  It is a suave smell, and nothing cheap or Axe body-sprayish.  It smells &#x27;rich&#x27; and the price suggests as much.</li>
            <li> Great buy for this men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased to find this large bottle for the price of a much smaller one! It was a Christmas gift for my fiance and was everything I could ask for.</li>
            <li> This does smell great many lady&#x27;s ask baby u smell good</li>
            <li> so far I tried these RALPH LAUREN colognes the green,the blue and the black. so far I like this one the most, but I do like them all.</li>
            <li> Seems watered down compared to other Polo Black cologne from Dillard&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Very nice product....quantity excellent for the price</li>
            <li> nothing but love for this one also, it&#x27;s a great smell, smell great on me, my wife likes it also...enough said.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Polo.</li>
            <li> Great cologne but this 6.7 version is incredibly weak. Almost like it was a 4.2 diluted with water. Scent doesn&#x27;t last at all. To say that the dolce gabbana  light blue last longer is already saying a lot</li>
            <li> this is my new favorite cologne. i&#x27;m not very good at characterizing scents to me it&#x27;s like a more mature or complex version of Armani code. It&#x27;s a sophisticated scent that works in any situation and in any weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will however say it is not long lasting. I usually carry an atomizer (I recommend travalo brand) if I know i&#x27;m going to be outside or if it&#x27;s going to be a long day.</li>
            <li> Great shipping and product!</li>
            <li> I BUY THE SAME PRODUCT AT MY LOCAL PHARMACY FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE AND THE SCENT IS LASTING WITH ONLY 10 TO 15 SPRAYS,</li>
            <li> No scent, just strong alcohol odor.</li>
            <li> It works so well I don&#x27;t want the other guys to know its power .Woman come up to me in the store and I mean a lot of woman ,and ask me what I have on . I swear it ,. I have had &amp;#34;offers from woman trying to pick me up&amp;#34; and belive me I am not a good looking guy. this stuff is amazing. I never leave the house with out it on. Its almost MAGICAL , so do not buy this stuff .or do and send it to me I will take it off your hands. and I will pay the shipping. I even had to double my order more Vigra , DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT &amp;#60; IT COULD CHANGE YOU LIFE FOREVER</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem smells great and I will recommend it to anyone :) value for your money !!!</li>
            <li> Great price for a large bottle. I have had this polo before and it smells really good. Usually $50 for a third this size.</li>
            <li> Sophisticated and sexy</li>
            <li> I have bought this cologne for my boyfriend several times and it never disappoints. It smells absolutely delicious and the scent last for hours. The fact that it is very concentrated you only need 3-4 sprays and you will be smelling great for the rest of the day. This is my all time favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I like being able to buy a larger bottle not to mention the price was great.</li>
            <li> Same product and great price for the size.</li>
            <li> LOVED it!!!!  Fast shipping.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> People approach at work saying &amp;#34;You smell good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wonderful and not overbearing fragrance............ Love it</li>
