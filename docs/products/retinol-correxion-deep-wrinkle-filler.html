            <li>The smell is very nice</li>
            <li>This is a very effective product which does act as a filler for the lines around and below the mouth area.</li>

            <li>I find this product to be the best for my skin; and I love it.</li>

            <li>Have not seen any good results yet.  </li>
            <li>Feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to be good if used as recommended</li>
            <li>Price is good.</li>
            <li>, i read reserch about good product,  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not greasy &amp; it arrived in good time.</li>
            <li>I remember my Mom swearing by Roc products when I was growing up; a couple of years ago I started using them and could see why she loved them so.</li>
            <li>and I do  see good results from  the Roc Products.  </li>
            <li>Its a good item</li>
            <li>I have used it before and loved it.</li>
            <li>and  had a comment today on how good my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>, no one ever guess my age, believe me, I do not care about peoples, what they say, most important I feel great about the product, one of the best.</li>
            <li>i was able to use this product 4 times before my daughter lifted it &amp; took it off to college!  </li>
            <li>and my face looks much better all day!  </li>
            <li>but it does diminish them and make your face look a lot better!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>i is amazing</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a month, and already see amazing results.  </li>
            <li>What an amazing  ingredient,  always admired</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and for now</li>
            <li>The product goes on nicely...</li>
            <li>I am reasonably sure it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Roc products for about 2 years and this one is absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I did not notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I liked it, would continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>I cant say that I am that impressed with this product right now, I will have to give it more time and then update my review</li>
            <li>It may be a good product, but I can&#x27;t  use it because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Received very quickly and was a good price.  </li>
            <li>Used to be an Oil of Olay user until I found the Roc line seems to be much more effective.</li>
            <li>this is a great product worth the price.</li>
            <li>If my wrinkles don&#x27;t plump up any more than they already have, I&#x27;d be okay with that; but if they keep on plumping, well I&#x27;d be thrilled.  </li>
            <li>so my concealer goes on smooth, I love it!</li>
            <li>I am sure it will work for me.</li>
            <li>love all</li>
            <li>The Amazon price is so much better than in the stores.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better now than it&#x27;s ever looked</li>
            <li>- what&#x27;s not to love?????</li>
            <li>and I look years better in the morning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product and will get on the autoship when I reorder.</li>
            <li>Have yet to see results, but will give it more time.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product &amp; will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>My deepest lines, around my lips, are plumping up (as are the portions of my lips that I accidentally get cream on) and I have to admit I look better.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the RoC Deep Wrinkle Filler.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t satisfied at all, didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li>I was using a L&#x27;Bre product that appeared to work better</li>
            <li>Roc is a wonderful line and this one not only fills my lines but works on reducing them as well.</li>
            <li>Patience is key here so have that abd you&#x27;ll be impressed too.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Hopefully the longer I use it, the sooner I will see more improvement that will seal my decision about whether I will continue using these products.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the longer I use it, the sooner I will see more improvement that will seal my decision about whether I will continue using these products.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Will be vying again for sure üëç</li>
            <li>but I feel better wearing it</li>
            <li>my wife is pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I am not implying that this stuff is not the &amp;#34;miracle cream&amp;#34; that everyone else seems to think it is.</li>
            <li>Okay is the word for this item.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and the fact it can be sent to my door is even better.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from trying it because it does work for so many people.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>but I am going to continue and give it more time.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 weeks and love it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother and she is very happy with it, and she has tried many different products over the years.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to purchase any ROC product.&lt;br /&gt;ROC</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you Amazon, Candace Love</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall these products do plump up the skin, there is more volume in all of there application areas.  </li>
            <li>stars!would love to get a cream that plumps lips out, thusly reducing hash marks under lower lip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Lines are much more diminished..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, will continue to use and see.. will be a process.</li>
            <li>That means that if it lasts more than that, you are not using it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Together with the product you can massage your face as seen in YouTube.</li>
            <li>but I had a lot of damage and grafting but of all the products I have used this was much better than Landcome estee lauder</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this Roc product.  </li>
            <li>Some people have better genes so age better than others and respond better to products than others.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I love RoC products.</li>
            <li>Test it first !!!  </li>
            <li>good  goes on nice  not harsh on your face, but i do not see an improvement.  </li>
            <li>Good products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>I see a difference when I don&#x27;t use this- don&#x27;t expect it to make anything disappear, but it does &#x27;soften&#x27; the wrinkle between my brows, and I think ROC is a good company and very knowledgeable about skin care.</li>
            <li>I really wish I was able to use it more than 4 times before that sneaky thief stole it!</li>
            <li>This just seemed to be a good moisturizer, I didn&#x27;t really see too much that impressed me as far as \\&quot;filling\\&quot; lines</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is very mild.</li>
            <li>After using this product twice a day for four days I did have to cut back to once a day do to a burning sensation however, well worth it to look in the miror and look as good as i feel!!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it because I use a moisturizer by RoC and it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>they certainly didn&#x27;t leave me homebound for a week like this stuff has!!!  </li>
            <li>Thanks ROC for a great product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I have fine lines on my cheeks and around my mouth.</li>
            <li>but it take off fine lines and makes them almost invisible also helps your skin look youthful.</li>
            <li>It diminished the fine lines around my eyes and the frown crease in between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Yes my skin was softer but y fine lines were still there.</li>
            <li>So I started getting fine lines about 2 years ago</li>
            <li>One huge problem I have noticed when I use this product and also</li>
            <li>and I saw a HUGE diff.</li>
            <li>Is smooth, not &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>thank you for making this available .</li>
            <li>so comfortable on the skin</li>
            <li>this cream loosens the skin and leaves it smooth</li>
            <li>For smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Overall Roc is a  great value</li>
            <li>I drank a lot back then and cried a lot lol reason im stating these facts is becaue my eyes would be swollen in the morning and this would help them a lot.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such a wonderful product...</li>
            <li>, I am fair and sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I have to say they are significantly lighter.</li>
            <li>I waited to write a review until I utilized this product for a significant amount of time to ensure I wasn&#x27;t being too biased.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best anti wrinkle stuff out there it actually does work it dont make miracles</li>
            <li>This stuff works, &amp; the price is right!</li>
            <li>And now, thanks Amazon for marketing it at an even better price</li>
            <li>Obviously the good reviews are from people who are reaping the benefits of using retinol.</li>
            <li>Good product if it is used regularly.</li>
            <li>I have tested countless moisturizers over the years and stores like Sephora, Ulta and The Derm Store loved me.  </li>
            <li>Not oily, good price, I use as a daily and night time cream</li>
            <li>Like all of the other Roc products I&#x27;ve used, this one is great.</li>
            <li>The ones on the left side are more noticeable, but even that side looks a lot better than before I started using ROC.  </li>
            <li>I am really recommended is a great cream for deep wrinkle .</li>
            <li>In the daytime I use Roc Completelift because it dries quickly and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I believe im not one of the lucky ones which says a lot about this product.</li>
            <li>One of the few products out  there with excellent price  and Real results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that you can expect a significant difference right away, so I will continue to use this product for another 3 months and see if I can tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>Immediately I noticed a difference in the look of my skin the very first time I used this.  </li>
            <li>I other RoC products work amazing!</li>
            <li>It really does plump up and smooth the skin that tends to wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>and I can say that it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>this is a powerful product.</li>
            <li>It goes on soft and smooth and does just that on your face - smooth out and soften lines.</li>
            <li>Time will tell, but so far I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>cannot say it is worth the effort, or price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth noting that I have NEVER had an alergic reaction to any product before.</li>
            <li>I have smile lines.</li>
            <li>we raise our eyebrows and we smile</li>
            <li>so we have smile lines, a cream cant prevent that.</li>
            <li>But this helps my fine wrinkles also, that came from being in the sun too long because i didnt know any better.</li>
            <li>Oh well, wait &amp; see right?</li>
            <li>also clinique and price was right Dog took 75 percent of lower lip and almost lost my right eye</li>
            <li>This is not meant to be a \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; cream; it is more like a medical prescription, though not as strong as straight retinol.  </li>
            <li>When I read the reviews of this product before purchasing, I was surprised to read that most reviews were positive and people saw immediate changes in their appearance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that if you use wet makeup, the Deep Wrinkle moisturizer would be good for daytime.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for 6 weeks, noticed changes in 2, it must be working as the wrinkles are not as deep, very pleased, but you do need sun cream on if your out in the sun as it affects the retinol in the cream, easy to use .</li>
            <li>Easy to use but be sure to use sunscreen with it due to the retinol content.</li>
            <li>Not huge, but enough to be impressed!</li>
            <li>Really works, from the very first day you can see results</li>
            <li>The creases above my lip seem a little better too, and maybe with more time, I will see more of an effect.</li>
            <li>Good, but the amount is just a little.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 58) at first.</li>
            <li>But, I have to use it consistently</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would at least lessen it to the point where good makeup would take it the rest of the way to smooth, unfortunately no.</li>
            <li>I actually noticed more redness on my face after use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I saw results the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li>but whatever I see first thing in the morning gradually wears off as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, time will tell whether I see any a pronounced difference in my wrinkles but at this point, it is helping some, I just wish it would do more and last longer.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, time will tell whether I see any a pronounced difference in my wrinkles but at this point, it is helping some, I just wish it would do more and last longer.  </li>
            <li>i use this in conjunction with the deep wrinkle serum every day, and the results are much better than i had hoped.</li>
            <li>this is just  a facial cream, nothing more.  </li>
            <li>Will most likely but again.</li>
            <li>Just finished my first tube</li>
            <li>So I tried many different things and they just didn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li>This product help my skin to look younger and healthy.</li>
            <li>Good for moisturizing,,,, I have been using 2x a day everyday for 5 weeks.</li>
            <li>This was a waste of good money.  </li>
            <li>The lines on my face might be a little softer, but I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s any more effective than regular moisturizer you can get in the grocery store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright for fine pores and vry fine lines, but really doesn&#x27;t fill in wrinkles likesome other products.</li>
            <li>Besides that I have fair skin and have had past sun damage to it.</li>
            <li>, I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on something for my face, but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>however I have not used it long enough to really give it a great review as far as filling my wrinkles as well as</li>
            <li>I have used Roc Deep Wrinkle Filler for 6 weeks and it delivers what it promises; The fine wrinkles under my eyes disappear as soon as I apply it</li>
            <li>I am finally seeing fine lines on my forehead and deep smile or laugh lines around my mouth areas.  </li>
            <li>It has really made a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li>I have been using RoC products for about 1 1/2 years now, after switching from another brand, and really like this.  </li>
            <li>Product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Used the whole bottle just in case it would be an accumulative effect.</li>
            <li>It is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, either.</li>
            <li>but she doesn&#x27;t have much patience with things either.</li>
            <li>It  works very well.</li>
            <li>and it cleared up fast</li>
            <li>Works as stated and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>Its ok......dont really see any difference</li>
            <li>My skin looks much happier when I do that.</li>
            <li>I feel this product has filled my wrinkles and has helped my skin overall.</li>
            <li>it really works for me.</li>
            <li>Didnt do much for me</li>
            <li>It really has helped the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Deep Wrinkle Filler primarily for temporary coverage of my wrinkles</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a wrinkles since I am 27</li>
            <li>and my wrinkles are really filling up.</li>
            <li>haha&#x27;</li>
            <li>I like this lotion, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, so don&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li>Just starting so will know more in a few weeks or more</li>
            <li>really tell that it fills in the lines.</li>
            <li>I have never in my life wrote a review for a product but felt absolutely compelled to do so in this case.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product on some forehead lines-which really were not that noticeable, and it irritated the skin, to the point it burned.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not been as much as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>I was very unsure of the product</li>
            <li>Absolutely did nothing to improve.</li>
            <li>I jokingly call it spackle because of how it really fills in the cracks and crevices.  </li>
            <li>but I def see an improvement thanks</li>
            <li>I really see a difference.  </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t have any I feel as if my makeup isn&#x27;t complete, am sure it helps enormously with the lines none of us want.</li>
            <li>, my skin does feel lovely after using it, but I&#x27;, not positive about the reduction of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have used other RoC products and been fairly pleased.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well to fill deep wrinkles but not quite as effective as expected.</li>
            <li>Does not seem to work any better than any of my other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>No one ones to look old and this product is very much something can help to improve healthiness in your skin</li>
            <li>There are stronger ROC products that will do that much more quickly and don&#x27;t go on so thick.</li>
            <li>Its more like an average moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I normal have very normal skin.</li>
            <li>I have some crows feet on the sides of my eyes and some deep vertical creases above my top lip, so that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 25, but have a very stressful life raising a 4 year old while going to school full time, lack of sleep, ect.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product just expect some drying bc</li>
            <li>I thought it would be great to use ,but, unfortunately, my skin did not like it.</li>
            <li>If not permanently, then at least temporarily as some kind of \\&quot;under makeup\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>laugh lines, etc., which have gotten deep this year.  </li>
            <li>your bux, and get botox esp on the deep laugh line side wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The product is delicate and the smale is nice.</li>
            <li>I believe that it is doing a good job of gradually minimizing the small lines around my eyes and the larger creases in my forehead.  </li>
            <li>This product has such a strong perfume smell, that I cannot use it anywhere above my nose.  </li>
            <li>It is far, far better than any other over-the-counter products that promise wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li>or they&#x27;re right back.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of wrinkles I was getting above my lip.it didn&#x27;t work right away and over time I didn&#x27;t notice any&lt;br /&gt;chance.will not buy again.</li>
            <li>I have been careful about applying it thin enough and making sure I rub it in good</li>
            <li>However, over a few weeks I did see my lines start to soften and more importantly, the dark circles under my eyes seemed to be improving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29, I&#x27;ve been using various ROC retinol products for the last 4 months and they made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Heaven knows, I&#x27;ve tried so many skin care products, paid a small fortune, and haven&#x27;t seen a thing, so I wasn&#x27;t going to be too upset when this one did nothing like the rest.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nearly gone!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not sure the results will get any better as some reviewers shared.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 7 weeks now, made no difference so far!</li>
            <li>every wrinkle I had looks exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>It can be used day or night and under makeup, but I prefer using it at night since it stings a bit (but not uncomfortably so) and because I roll over onto my side (and face) at night (so extra wrinkle plumping is needed).</li>
            <li>I have used countless facial products for various things and while many didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the deep wrinkle filler.</li>
            <li>I have already ordered my second tube, even though I haven&#x27;t finished the first one.  </li>
            <li>I have only reapplied it a couple of times later in the day if I am going some place special.  </li>
            <li>I suggest not using it after buff-puff scrubbing or other rough exfoliation of your skin because the stinging will be more intense.</li>
            <li>It has made me very self conscious, and my bangs just barely covered it up.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my previous product that is better which is called Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Loreal deep wrinkle filler does a way better job for much less.</li>
            <li>I assume they will clear once this reaction is over.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping for that filler effect to be noticeable instantly</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m liking the ROC products I purchased from Amazon.com very well.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any results thus far but hopeful that it will diminish the look of wrinkles somewhat, eventually.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, I see no difference at all in my rather light age wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>If you want to completely eradicate  wrinkles, you will have to see a Dermatologist, bottom line.</li>
            <li>It damn near tore the skin off.  </li>
            <li>I have found it gentle enough to use around crow&#x27;s feet without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>I would highley recommend to any one with natural lines and women like me with unnatural lines</li>
            <li>ROC has saved my skin and is going to keep my looking young like I should.</li>
            <li>I believe if a girl in her 20 esp early 20s</li>
            <li>early you cant wait til youre 30 like me and be like</li>
            <li>I was hoping as with the other RoC products I purchased at the same time as I purchased the deep wrinkle filler that I would see better results the longer</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and the only signs of aging I have left are some extremely fine creases on my forehead and under my eyes, and a line on the left side (due to a crooked smile).</li>
            <li>I tried the ROC deep wrinkle filler mainly bc</li>
            <li>After about a week it did dry out my forehead which is the main place that needs help, I stopped for a week and used my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li>I understand the nuances of slight tingling sensations or mild burning or dryness or flakiness.</li>
            <li>Those fine lines seemed to be less obvious.</li>
            <li>It works on my 40 yo manface, virtually eliminating the dark circles under my eyes and the laugh lines as well.</li>
            <li>Right now it&#x27;s red and dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I have only used about half of this tube but am so excited I found this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of these products but his one I really couldn&#x27;t tell if I was using anything as my wrinkles began to come back.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous creams and nothing has really made it appear smaller.</li>
            <li>and I would be willing to try other ROC items.</li>
            <li>Fills like no other</li>
            <li>I have told them I hadn&#x27;t used the products long enough to really give a review</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 years old and have some deep lines on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I am a beauty product nerd, I have been using mositurizers religiously since i was about 30 years old and it shows,</li>
            <li>i look far younger than my 46years.  </li>
            <li>Only thing that will take it away completely will be Botox.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not happy with your wrinkles you&#x27;re better off just getting botox.</li>
            <li>i apply: I have expression based wrinkles,  above my right eyebrow, on my forehead, a few lines near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wks b/c of deep lines) is more wrinkley and the skin looks worse.</li>
            <li>Gross but no other way to describe them.</li>
            <li>I kept tract in a small notebook to make sure I used it everyday.</li>
            <li>I sleep on my side and in the morning my wrinkles are usually pretty obvious, but since using this filler, I am sure that the crows feet are not as bad.</li>
            <li>I have also always had dark circles under my eyes and have been told by multiple people my eyes are so much lighter and asked if I was doing anything different.</li>
            <li>I have two fine lines on my face, thought this wrinkle remover would work, have used it for 4 plus months am &amp; pm and still no changes, have that thin line showing.</li>
            <li>Makes wrinkles waaaaay worse what was a fine line just forming is now a fully grown embedded wrinkle with only 3 uses.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of stuff, cheap and expensive, and bought this on a whim... was I surprised when it really worked on the lines that were creeping down from my eyes to my cheeks!  </li>
            <li>the good and the bad then clicked purchase.  </li>

            <li> I remember my Mom swearing by Roc products when I was growing up; a couple of years ago I started using them and could see why she loved them so.</li>
            <li> and I do  see good results from  the Roc Products.  </li>
            <li> Its a good item</li>
            <li> I have used it before and loved it.</li>
            <li> and  had a comment today on how good my skin looked.  </li>
            <li> , no one ever guess my age, believe me, I do not care about peoples, what they say, most important I feel great about the product, one of the best.</li>
            <li> i was able to use this product 4 times before my daughter lifted it &amp; took it off to college!  </li>

            <li> This product is amazing and for now</li>
            <li> The product goes on nicely...</li>
            <li> I am reasonably sure it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Roc products for about 2 years and this one is absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I did not notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I liked it, would continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I cant say that I am that impressed with this product right now, I will have to give it more time and then update my review</li>
            <li> It may be a good product, but I can&#x27;t  use it because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly and was a good price.  </li>
            <li> Used to be an Oil of Olay user until I found the Roc line seems to be much more effective.</li>
            <li> this is a great product worth the price.</li>
            <li> If my wrinkles don&#x27;t plump up any more than they already have, I&#x27;d be okay with that; but if they keep on plumping, well I&#x27;d be thrilled.  </li>
            <li> so my concealer goes on smooth, I love it!</li>
            <li> I am sure it will work for me.</li>

            <li> - what&#x27;s not to love?????</li>
            <li> and I look years better in the morning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product and will get on the autoship when I reorder.</li>
            <li> Have yet to see results, but will give it more time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product &amp; will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> My deepest lines, around my lips, are plumping up (as are the portions of my lips that I accidentally get cream on) and I have to admit I look better.  </li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the RoC Deep Wrinkle Filler.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t satisfied at all, didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> I was using a L&#x27;Bre product that appeared to work better</li>
            <li> Roc is a wonderful line and this one not only fills my lines but works on reducing them as well.</li>
            <li> Patience is key here so have that abd you&#x27;ll be impressed too.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Hopefully the longer I use it, the sooner I will see more improvement that will seal my decision about whether I will continue using these products.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the longer I use it, the sooner I will see more improvement that will seal my decision about whether I will continue using these products.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Will be vying again for sure üëç</li>
            <li> but I feel better wearing it</li>
            <li> my wife is pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I am not implying that this stuff is not the &amp;#34;miracle cream&amp;#34; that everyone else seems to think it is.</li>
            <li> Okay is the word for this item.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and the fact it can be sent to my door is even better.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from trying it because it does work for so many people.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> but I am going to continue and give it more time.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks and love it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and she is very happy with it, and she has tried many different products over the years.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to purchase any ROC product.&lt;br /&gt;ROC</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you Amazon, Candace Love</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall these products do plump up the skin, there is more volume in all of there application areas.  </li>
            <li> stars!would love to get a cream that plumps lips out, thusly reducing hash marks under lower lip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Lines are much more diminished..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, will continue to use and see.. will be a process.</li>
            <li> That means that if it lasts more than that, you are not using it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Together with the product you can massage your face as seen in YouTube.</li>
            <li> but I had a lot of damage and grafting but of all the products I have used this was much better than Landcome estee lauder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this Roc product.  </li>
            <li> Some people have better genes so age better than others and respond better to products than others.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> I love RoC products.</li>
            <li> Test it first !!!  </li>
            <li> good  goes on nice  not harsh on your face, but i do not see an improvement.  </li>
            <li> Good products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> I see a difference when I don&#x27;t use this- don&#x27;t expect it to make anything disappear, but it does &#x27;soften&#x27; the wrinkle between my brows, and I think ROC is a good company and very knowledgeable about skin care.</li>
            <li> I really wish I was able to use it more than 4 times before that sneaky thief stole it!</li>
            <li> This just seemed to be a good moisturizer, I didn&#x27;t really see too much that impressed me as far as \\&quot;filling\\&quot; lines</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is very mild.</li>
            <li> After using this product twice a day for four days I did have to cut back to once a day do to a burning sensation however, well worth it to look in the miror and look as good as i feel!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it because I use a moisturizer by RoC and it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> they certainly didn&#x27;t leave me homebound for a week like this stuff has!!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks ROC for a great product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I have fine lines on my cheeks and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> but it take off fine lines and makes them almost invisible also helps your skin look youthful.</li>
            <li> It diminished the fine lines around my eyes and the frown crease in between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Yes my skin was softer but y fine lines were still there.</li>
            <li> So I started getting fine lines about 2 years ago</li>
            <li> One huge problem I have noticed when I use this product and also</li>
            <li> and I saw a HUGE diff.</li>
            <li> Is smooth, not &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> thank you for making this available .</li>
            <li> so comfortable on the skin</li>
            <li> this cream loosens the skin and leaves it smooth</li>
            <li> For smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Overall Roc is a  great value</li>
            <li> I drank a lot back then and cried a lot lol reason im stating these facts is becaue my eyes would be swollen in the morning and this would help them a lot.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such a wonderful product...</li>
            <li> , I am fair and sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I have to say they are significantly lighter.</li>
            <li> I waited to write a review until I utilized this product for a significant amount of time to ensure I wasn&#x27;t being too biased.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best anti wrinkle stuff out there it actually does work it dont make miracles</li>
            <li> This stuff works, &amp; the price is right!</li>
            <li> And now, thanks Amazon for marketing it at an even better price</li>
            <li> Obviously the good reviews are from people who are reaping the benefits of using retinol.</li>
            <li> Good product if it is used regularly.</li>
            <li> I have tested countless moisturizers over the years and stores like Sephora, Ulta and The Derm Store loved me.  </li>
            <li> Not oily, good price, I use as a daily and night time cream</li>
            <li> Like all of the other Roc products I&#x27;ve used, this one is great.</li>
            <li> The ones on the left side are more noticeable, but even that side looks a lot better than before I started using ROC.  </li>
            <li> I am really recommended is a great cream for deep wrinkle .</li>
            <li> In the daytime I use Roc Completelift because it dries quickly and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I believe im not one of the lucky ones which says a lot about this product.</li>
            <li> One of the few products out  there with excellent price  and Real results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that you can expect a significant difference right away, so I will continue to use this product for another 3 months and see if I can tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> Immediately I noticed a difference in the look of my skin the very first time I used this.  </li>
            <li> I other RoC products work amazing!</li>
            <li> It really does plump up and smooth the skin that tends to wrinkle.  </li>
            <li> and I can say that it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> this is a powerful product.</li>
            <li> It goes on soft and smooth and does just that on your face - smooth out and soften lines.</li>
            <li> Time will tell, but so far I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> cannot say it is worth the effort, or price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth noting that I have NEVER had an alergic reaction to any product before.</li>
            <li> I have smile lines.</li>
            <li> we raise our eyebrows and we smile</li>
            <li> so we have smile lines, a cream cant prevent that.</li>
            <li> But this helps my fine wrinkles also, that came from being in the sun too long because i didnt know any better.</li>
            <li> Oh well, wait &amp; see right?</li>
            <li> also clinique and price was right Dog took 75 percent of lower lip and almost lost my right eye</li>
            <li> This is not meant to be a \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; cream; it is more like a medical prescription, though not as strong as straight retinol.  </li>
            <li> When I read the reviews of this product before purchasing, I was surprised to read that most reviews were positive and people saw immediate changes in their appearance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that if you use wet makeup, the Deep Wrinkle moisturizer would be good for daytime.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 6 weeks, noticed changes in 2, it must be working as the wrinkles are not as deep, very pleased, but you do need sun cream on if your out in the sun as it affects the retinol in the cream, easy to use .</li>
            <li> Easy to use but be sure to use sunscreen with it due to the retinol content.</li>
            <li> Not huge, but enough to be impressed!</li>
            <li> Really works, from the very first day you can see results</li>
            <li> The creases above my lip seem a little better too, and maybe with more time, I will see more of an effect.</li>
            <li> Good, but the amount is just a little.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 58) at first.</li>
            <li> But, I have to use it consistently</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would at least lessen it to the point where good makeup would take it the rest of the way to smooth, unfortunately no.</li>
            <li> I actually noticed more redness on my face after use.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I saw results the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li> but whatever I see first thing in the morning gradually wears off as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, time will tell whether I see any a pronounced difference in my wrinkles but at this point, it is helping some, I just wish it would do more and last longer.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, time will tell whether I see any a pronounced difference in my wrinkles but at this point, it is helping some, I just wish it would do more and last longer.  </li>
            <li> i use this in conjunction with the deep wrinkle serum every day, and the results are much better than i had hoped.</li>
            <li> this is just  a facial cream, nothing more.  </li>
            <li> Will most likely but again.</li>
            <li> Just finished my first tube</li>
            <li> So I tried many different things and they just didn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> This product help my skin to look younger and healthy.</li>
            <li> Good for moisturizing,,,, I have been using 2x a day everyday for 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of good money.  </li>
            <li> The lines on my face might be a little softer, but I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s any more effective than regular moisturizer you can get in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright for fine pores and vry fine lines, but really doesn&#x27;t fill in wrinkles likesome other products.</li>
            <li> Besides that I have fair skin and have had past sun damage to it.</li>
            <li> , I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on something for my face, but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> however I have not used it long enough to really give it a great review as far as filling my wrinkles as well as</li>
            <li> I have used Roc Deep Wrinkle Filler for 6 weeks and it delivers what it promises; The fine wrinkles under my eyes disappear as soon as I apply it</li>
            <li> I am finally seeing fine lines on my forehead and deep smile or laugh lines around my mouth areas.  </li>
            <li> It has really made a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I have been using RoC products for about 1 1/2 years now, after switching from another brand, and really like this.  </li>
            <li> Product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Used the whole bottle just in case it would be an accumulative effect.</li>
            <li> It is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, either.</li>
            <li> but she doesn&#x27;t have much patience with things either.</li>
            <li> It  works very well.</li>
            <li> and it cleared up fast</li>
            <li> Works as stated and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> Its ok......dont really see any difference</li>
            <li> My skin looks much happier when I do that.</li>
            <li> I feel this product has filled my wrinkles and has helped my skin overall.</li>
            <li> it really works for me.</li>
            <li> Didnt do much for me</li>
            <li> It really has helped the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Deep Wrinkle Filler primarily for temporary coverage of my wrinkles</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a wrinkles since I am 27</li>
            <li> and my wrinkles are really filling up.</li>
            <li> haha&#x27;</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, so don&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li> Just starting so will know more in a few weeks or more</li>
            <li> really tell that it fills in the lines.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life wrote a review for a product but felt absolutely compelled to do so in this case.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product on some forehead lines-which really were not that noticeable, and it irritated the skin, to the point it burned.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not been as much as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> I was very unsure of the product</li>
            <li> Absolutely did nothing to improve.</li>
            <li> I jokingly call it spackle because of how it really fills in the cracks and crevices.  </li>
            <li> but I def see an improvement thanks</li>
            <li> I really see a difference.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t have any I feel as if my makeup isn&#x27;t complete, am sure it helps enormously with the lines none of us want.</li>
            <li> , my skin does feel lovely after using it, but I&#x27;, not positive about the reduction of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have used other RoC products and been fairly pleased.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well to fill deep wrinkles but not quite as effective as expected.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to work any better than any of my other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> No one ones to look old and this product is very much something can help to improve healthiness in your skin</li>
            <li> There are stronger ROC products that will do that much more quickly and don&#x27;t go on so thick.</li>
            <li> Its more like an average moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I normal have very normal skin.</li>
            <li> I have some crows feet on the sides of my eyes and some deep vertical creases above my top lip, so that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 25, but have a very stressful life raising a 4 year old while going to school full time, lack of sleep, ect.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product just expect some drying bc</li>
            <li> I thought it would be great to use ,but, unfortunately, my skin did not like it.</li>
            <li> If not permanently, then at least temporarily as some kind of \\&quot;under makeup\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> laugh lines, etc., which have gotten deep this year.  </li>
            <li> your bux, and get botox esp on the deep laugh line side wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The product is delicate and the smale is nice.</li>
            <li> I believe that it is doing a good job of gradually minimizing the small lines around my eyes and the larger creases in my forehead.  </li>
            <li> This product has such a strong perfume smell, that I cannot use it anywhere above my nose.  </li>
            <li> It is far, far better than any other over-the-counter products that promise wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li> or they&#x27;re right back.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of wrinkles I was getting above my lip.it didn&#x27;t work right away and over time I didn&#x27;t notice any&lt;br /&gt;chance.will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been careful about applying it thin enough and making sure I rub it in good</li>
            <li> However, over a few weeks I did see my lines start to soften and more importantly, the dark circles under my eyes seemed to be improving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29, I&#x27;ve been using various ROC retinol products for the last 4 months and they made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Heaven knows, I&#x27;ve tried so many skin care products, paid a small fortune, and haven&#x27;t seen a thing, so I wasn&#x27;t going to be too upset when this one did nothing like the rest.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nearly gone!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure the results will get any better as some reviewers shared.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 7 weeks now, made no difference so far!</li>
            <li> every wrinkle I had looks exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> It can be used day or night and under makeup, but I prefer using it at night since it stings a bit (but not uncomfortably so) and because I roll over onto my side (and face) at night (so extra wrinkle plumping is needed).</li>
            <li> I have used countless facial products for various things and while many didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the deep wrinkle filler.</li>
            <li> I have already ordered my second tube, even though I haven&#x27;t finished the first one.  </li>
            <li> I have only reapplied it a couple of times later in the day if I am going some place special.  </li>
            <li> I suggest not using it after buff-puff scrubbing or other rough exfoliation of your skin because the stinging will be more intense.</li>
            <li> It has made me very self conscious, and my bangs just barely covered it up.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my previous product that is better which is called Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Loreal deep wrinkle filler does a way better job for much less.</li>
            <li> I assume they will clear once this reaction is over.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping for that filler effect to be noticeable instantly</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m liking the ROC products I purchased from Amazon.com very well.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results thus far but hopeful that it will diminish the look of wrinkles somewhat, eventually.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I see no difference at all in my rather light age wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> If you want to completely eradicate  wrinkles, you will have to see a Dermatologist, bottom line.</li>
            <li> It damn near tore the skin off.  </li>
            <li> I have found it gentle enough to use around crow&#x27;s feet without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> I would highley recommend to any one with natural lines and women like me with unnatural lines</li>
            <li> ROC has saved my skin and is going to keep my looking young like I should.</li>
            <li> I believe if a girl in her 20 esp early 20s</li>
            <li> early you cant wait til youre 30 like me and be like</li>
            <li> I was hoping as with the other RoC products I purchased at the same time as I purchased the deep wrinkle filler that I would see better results the longer</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and the only signs of aging I have left are some extremely fine creases on my forehead and under my eyes, and a line on the left side (due to a crooked smile).</li>
            <li> I tried the ROC deep wrinkle filler mainly bc</li>
            <li> After about a week it did dry out my forehead which is the main place that needs help, I stopped for a week and used my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li> I understand the nuances of slight tingling sensations or mild burning or dryness or flakiness.</li>
            <li> Those fine lines seemed to be less obvious.</li>
            <li> It works on my 40 yo manface, virtually eliminating the dark circles under my eyes and the laugh lines as well.</li>
            <li> Right now it&#x27;s red and dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I have only used about half of this tube but am so excited I found this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of these products but his one I really couldn&#x27;t tell if I was using anything as my wrinkles began to come back.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous creams and nothing has really made it appear smaller.</li>
            <li> and I would be willing to try other ROC items.</li>
            <li> Fills like no other</li>
            <li> I have told them I hadn&#x27;t used the products long enough to really give a review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 years old and have some deep lines on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I am a beauty product nerd, I have been using mositurizers religiously since i was about 30 years old and it shows,</li>
            <li> i look far younger than my 46years.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that will take it away completely will be Botox.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not happy with your wrinkles you&#x27;re better off just getting botox.</li>
            <li> i apply: I have expression based wrinkles,  above my right eyebrow, on my forehead, a few lines near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wks b/c of deep lines) is more wrinkley and the skin looks worse.</li>
            <li> Gross but no other way to describe them.</li>
            <li> I kept tract in a small notebook to make sure I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I sleep on my side and in the morning my wrinkles are usually pretty obvious, but since using this filler, I am sure that the crows feet are not as bad.</li>
            <li> I have also always had dark circles under my eyes and have been told by multiple people my eyes are so much lighter and asked if I was doing anything different.</li>
            <li> I have two fine lines on my face, thought this wrinkle remover would work, have used it for 4 plus months am &amp; pm and still no changes, have that thin line showing.</li>
            <li> Makes wrinkles waaaaay worse what was a fine line just forming is now a fully grown embedded wrinkle with only 3 uses.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of stuff, cheap and expensive, and bought this on a whim... was I surprised when it really worked on the lines that were creeping down from my eyes to my cheeks!  </li>
            <li> the good and the bad then clicked purchase.  </li>
            <li> I think their products work as well as high end products, but they cost so much less.  </li>
            <li> The right side lines aren&#x27;t as deep as the left - probably because I sleep on my left side, but the lines on the right side are so much less noticeable in just shy of 3 weeks, it&#x27;s unbelieveable.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to know if it makes a difference in deep lines or not.</li>
            <li> If you already use products with retinol, or if you are only dealing with fine lines, this \\&quot;Deep Wrinkle Filler\\&quot; is probably useless for you.</li>
            <li> It fixed what RoC undid previously within 1 week.  </li>
            <li> Because I use dry mineral makeup, I only use this as a night cream.  </li>
            <li> I do notice that sometimes the thin tissue around my eyes burn when I apply this, but it goes away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed but not completely upset because it is a good lotion</li>
            <li> Also had some pretty hefty wrinkles on my forehead and this help make them look less harsh</li>
            <li> Sinks into crevices and smooths out surface prior to applyimg makeup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used ROC products for a long time no issues.</li>
            <li> I expected it to \\&quot;fill\\&quot; that line next to my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been so long ago that I can&#x27;t remember if it worked or not, which is the reason for the three stars</li>
            <li> It is okay..but does not work for long period of time.can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Seeing some minor results.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> While I have only been using this product for only one and a half weeks, to my surprise</li>
            <li> In fact, once I am done using my current skin care line I will switch to other RoC skin care products.</li>
            <li> Since I neglected them for so long - I&#x27;m amazed at how well this stuff works!</li>
            <li> and they haven&#x27;t been around very long</li>
            <li> Not oily or dry.</li>
            <li> and I can use it this winter to keep my face from getting dry.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> and I have never gotten any single benefit from any of their products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put it on every single morning and night.</li>
            <li> old and my skin has the usual crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> so I will probably go back to that since it cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> Save yourself a ton of money on useless higher end products and buy this!</li>
            <li> If you opt to buy this, PLEASE test it out a couple of times to make sure you do not have a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I am back to using it everyday</li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> I put this filler on my skin and a few minutes later, started itching.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tries everything.</li>
            <li> Anyway, these last few years i had been using Neutrogena during the daytime and Strivectin at night.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Only after using it for a few day my lines have dimished tramatically.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times &amp; it doesn&#x27;t even begin to fill in small wrinkles much less deep ones!  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use, but not certain I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> With dry makeup, you don&#x27;t want to put the dry makeup over any moisturizer that stays moist, because it causes heavy buildup and streaks.  </li>
            <li> Have not used this yet because I had to use other products I bought.  </li>
            <li> Only small amount is required.</li>
            <li> I took the others advice on using every other day until my face was accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about deep wrinkles</li>
            <li> It also did not make me break out like a different Roc product I tried in the past</li>
            <li> just spent a ridiculous amt of money so only they benefitted!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T and only used it on my one problem wrinkle across my forehead (I&#x27;m 27), and I saw no difference over the past few months.</li>
            <li> Bloody well better.  </li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do the job as well as I would have wanted however, it did make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Worked in a week, lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> like i am in 25, my bags under eye gone, black secrcle gone, my wrinkls gone,,, i have used also retin a,,, and this month i started using</li>
            <li> After a while the filler part becomes needed less as it reduces lines.</li>
            <li> I began to notice the difference of the slight wrinkles fading.</li>
            <li> The amount in the tube is for less than one month( perhaps two or three weeks).</li>
            <li> To much to mess with, time consuming.</li>
            <li> It does help make wrinkles look less harsh and fills in temporarily.</li>
            <li> I saw little to no results after using twice a day for 3 months.</li>
            <li> They did not diminish even a little.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my dark circles with results!</li>
            <li> Product is a little greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Been a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months</li>
            <li> used this for a few months, never saw any improvement.</li>
            <li> I would like to know if there is something I am missing when applying these two products in the morning since the directions do say that that you can use the moisturizer over the wrinkle filler.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money when I bought it up to $70...</li>
            <li> I use it already for few years</li>
            <li> my friends, i am f 38 old,  from saudi arabia, i have used almost all products sheap and expensive, everything, 1 month</li>
            <li> i did reserch about the secret of being younger...</li>
            <li> and i eat it everyday  ,,,,</li>
            <li> Will never buy again, waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing to eliminate wrinkles, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product again.</li>
            <li> I use ROC everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday as part of my nighttime skin care regiment and noticed a difference after 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Does not leave face feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve only got worse.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years.</li>
            <li> It actually made my lines look worse because it dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> nothing for crease lines that usually show beside the nose, and down the lower cheek.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at the store but found it on amazon for half the price.</li>
            <li> I tried this product by ROC, and it did very little.  </li>
            <li> So far, I don&#x27;t see any discernible results with this one, which is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Finally just recently got on Retin-A, these otc products are always a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I used it however in the past two to three weeks that I have used it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product is giving me red blotches all over my face.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what this stuff has in it that my skin hates</li>
            <li> sorry about my english</li>
            <li> I didnt have unrealistic expectations, especially not  from a drugstore</li>
            <li> * The awful line above my eyebrow has lessened in depth, big  big difference.</li>
            <li> usually use it twice a day and have noticed that I can skip a day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t skimp late at night either, a generous amount</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have alot of wrinkles, but i see some forming on the sides of my face inward......</li>
            <li> They do not keep their promise, at least not to me.</li>
            <li> we have used it for at least 12 weeks, and it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I think people expect miracles and that only sets them up for disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that not everything works for every one, so you have to try different products, which can get expensive!</li>
            <li> I hate them.....makes me look years older, and I want them gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but it&#x27;s ridiculous to complain about a slight odor or a tingling sensation with the use of the RoC Retinol Correction line.  </li>
            <li> After using this for about two days, my skin under my eye area turned red and it burned like crazy!</li>
            <li> DUMB, DUMB, DUMB.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thin to keep isolated to the inside of the wrinkle/crease.</li>
            <li> I hate sending things back</li>
            <li> i read the secret</li>
            <li> contain the secret  which in that website which i posted..........</li>
            <li> I switched from olay to see if some of the puffiness and tired look would improve.  </li>
            <li> is completely false advertising</li>
            <li> After one week of this cream, all of the areas where I had been applying the very small amount as directed, broke out in weird looking sores.</li>
            <li> little disappointing, but maybe it&#x27;ll take longer than they say!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not have any changes after using this product.</li>
            <li> This has helped with those creepy lines from my nose to my mouth.</li>
            <li> sorry folks no difference yet, even with loads of moisturizer it has not helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I was sent the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> etc  sorry about my english^_^&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I failed to toss it.  </li>
            <li> younger.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for my terrible English</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used inexpensive brands to the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> and I already notice the line has become very thin.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointing product.  </li>
            <li> Was unhappy with product and will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of schrunching my face up</li>
            <li> This product works for some, but others have had a bad reaction after using it, myself included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out under my eyes before going to bed</li>
            <li> My bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s quite disappointing!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very unhappy!</li>
            <li> Now, I am stupid admittedly for trying it again....and even dumber for trying it on my neck.......</li>
            <li> oh crap</li>
            <li> side effects of bad headaches for weeks after and not to mention the price and putting poison in my body!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed at this point.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Hate those!</li>
            <li> Worst thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have not used this yet because I had to use other products I bought.  I am sure it will work for me.</li>
            <li> Sinks into crevices and smooths out surface prior to applyimg makeup.  Only small amount is required. Is smooth, not &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such a wonderful product...It has really made a difference in my complexion. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have used ROC products for years. ..love all</li>
            <li> I have been using RoC products for about 1 1/2 years now, after switching from another brand, and really like this.  I have been getting asked by my doctor and her receptionist what I have done.  I now have them using RoC products.</li>
            <li> the roc is really very good for the winkles. i am using every night for 1 week and i already saw the results. i is amazing</li>
            <li> Product did absolutely nothing. No results, no changes at all. Used the whole bottle just in case it would be an accumulative effect. Nope. Just threw away my money. Would give zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I have been using it for a month and I see a difference.  The Amazon price is so much better than in the stores.  It is a real bargain. It&#x27;s scent is very mild.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any good results yet.  Been a few weeks.  Oh well, wait &amp; see right?</li>
            <li> Received on time. Only been using it for a week so can&#x27;t say if it works.  My cousin swears by it.  I will check back in a couple of weeks. I do use it on my entire face and under chin.</li>
            <li> i was able to use this product 4 times before my daughter lifted it &amp; took it off to college!  The product goes on nicely... Not greasy at all... &amp; Retinol !!  I really wish I was able to use it more than 4 times before that sneaky thief stole it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. Actually it looks like my skin on my forehead (where I have been using it for 2+ wks b/c of deep lines) is more wrinkley and the skin looks worse. I&#x27;ve stopped using it. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This just seemed to be a good moisturizer, I didn&#x27;t really see too much that impressed me as far as \\&quot;filling\\&quot; lines (I&#x27;m 58) at first. However, over a few weeks I did see my lines start to soften and more importantly, the dark circles under my eyes seemed to be improving. Now I&#x27;m about 9 months into using this product and I can say that it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I use it after taking off all my makeup in the evening, before putting on my regular moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t take much, either. One tube lasts me about 4 months. My mom tried it and wasn&#x27;t impressed but she doesn&#x27;t have much patience with things either. You have to keep using it on a regular basis and you will see results. My skin looks better now than it&#x27;s ever looked and I don&#x27;t have to use undereye concealer at all anymore!!!! Thanks ROC for a great product at a reasonable price! And now, thanks Amazon for marketing it at an even better price - what&#x27;s not to love?????</li>
            <li> This stuff burns my skin and causes a red, itchy rash. It also causes acne at the application site. It&#x27;s too thin to keep isolated to the inside of the wrinkle/crease. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my mum and she loves it. She&#x27;s 60 and her skin doesnt look a day over 45. It  works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this. It works on my 40 yo manface, virtually eliminating the dark circles under my eyes and the laugh lines as well. But, I have to use it consistently or they&#x27;re right back. I don&#x27;t skimp late at night either, a generous amount and I look years better in the morning</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how a One Ounce container of this, which if for sale for $13.58 can be priced at $7.07 an ounce...</li>
            <li> I have two fine lines on my face, thought this wrinkle remover would work, have used it for 4 plus months am &amp; pm and still no changes, have that thin line showing. I am in my late 40&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have alot of wrinkles, but i see some forming on the sides of my face inward......thought this product would work, but i see no changes, i am going to try another product and see if that one will work.</li>
            <li> I tried the ROC deep wrinkle filler mainly bc I had a gift card and wrinkles, I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on something for my face, but it is absolutely worth it. I took the others advice on using every other day until my face was accustomed to it. After about a week it did dry out my forehead which is the main place that needs help, I stopped for a week and used my normal moisturizer and it cleared up fast I am back to using it everyday and I have to say I am impressed! I have deep forehead wrinkles bc I have a bad habit of schrunching my face up and I have to say they are significantly lighter. I highly recommend this product just expect some drying bc this is a powerful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used ROC products for a long time no issues. Works as stated and gentle on skin. I also can&#x27;t say enough bout the subscribe and save program!!</li>
            <li> I do not have deep wrinkles but enough to want covered.  This was a disappointing product.  It didn&#x27;t do the job as well as I would have wanted however, it did make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s I have fine lines on my cheeks and around my mouth. For me this product did nothing. I saw no improvement. It actually made my lines look worse because it dried my skin out. I felt no tingeling or tightning of my skin. So for me it did not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 years old and have some deep lines on my cheeks.  I read the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.  Heaven knows, I&#x27;ve tried so many skin care products, paid a small fortune, and haven&#x27;t seen a thing, so I wasn&#x27;t going to be too upset when this one did nothing like the rest.  I started using ROC Deep Wrinkle Filler on December 12th.  I&#x27;ve faithfully been putting it on a.m &amp; p.m. and can&#x27;t believe the difference in those lines.  The right side lines aren&#x27;t as deep as the left - probably because I sleep on my left side, but the lines on the right side are so much less noticeable in just shy of 3 weeks, it&#x27;s unbelieveable.  The ones on the left side are more noticeable, but even that side looks a lot better than before I started using ROC.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and I&#x27;d encourage anyone who has facial lines to use it, too.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product and will get on the autoship when I reorder.</li>
            <li> I have been using it  (Roc deep wrinkle filler) for several weeks now and see NO results at all. I will not buy this product again. They do not keep their promise, at least not to me.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  I saw little to no results after using twice a day for 3 months.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it because I use a moisturizer by RoC and it&#x27;s good.  This product does next to nothing.  If it is working it&#x27;s so minute it&#x27;s not worth it.  I went back to my previous product that is better which is called Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer.  It fixed what RoC undid previously within 1 week.  I hate sending things back so I&#x27;m using RoC at night but will not reorder it again.</li>
            <li> Have yet to see results, but will give it more time. Feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> This product is just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  Was not blown away with anything great.  No immediate results or anything like that. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again but will use what I have.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It goes on soft and smooth and does just that on your face - smooth out and soften lines.</li>
            <li> I use all of the product before submitting a product review. I kept tract in a small notebook to make sure I used it everyday. This product does not minimize the look of wrinkles. I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles so I should have seen some difference. Save your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of these products but his one I really couldn&#x27;t tell if I was using anything as my wrinkles began to come back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but it&#x27;s ridiculous to complain about a slight odor or a tingling sensation with the use of the RoC Retinol Correction line.  This only means it is working! This is not meant to be a \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; cream; it is more like a medical prescription, though not as strong as straight retinol.  I&#x27;ve used it for almost a year and can tell you that if you use these four RoC products (RoC Retinol Correction line) day filler, eye cream, moisturizer &amp; night cream, you will see noticeable results.  My only regret is that I just discovered I can save a bundle by ordering it from Amazon rather than purchasing it at any of my local drugstores.  It is far, far better than any other over-the-counter products that promise wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li> Its ok......dont really see any difference</li>
            <li> If you already use products with retinol, or if you are only dealing with fine lines, this \\&quot;Deep Wrinkle Filler\\&quot; is probably useless for you. That&#x27;s the case for me. I&#x27;m 29, I&#x27;ve been using various ROC retinol products for the last 4 months and they made a HUGE difference. My skin is soft and the only signs of aging I have left are some extremely fine creases on my forehead and under my eyes, and a line on the left side (due to a crooked smile). I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. I expected it to \\&quot;fill\\&quot; that line next to my mouth. If not permanently, then at least temporarily as some kind of \\&quot;under makeup\\&quot; product. It doesn&#x27;t do anything AT ALL. I&#x27;m not understanding what the point of this product is. Obviously the good reviews are from people who are reaping the benefits of using retinol. There are stronger ROC products that will do that much more quickly and don&#x27;t go on so thick. Look up the correxion serums or night creams.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  My mother&#x27;s side of the family is cursed with deep lines over the upper lip...genetic I guess.  This cream has already started smoothing them out.</li>
            <li> I waited to write a review until I utilized this product for a significant amount of time to ensure I wasn&#x27;t being too biased. It&#x27;s been a few months and I have seen no difference. I was really hoping for that filler effect to be noticeable instantly, that was not the case. I followed the directions to a T and only used it on my one problem wrinkle across my forehead (I&#x27;m 27), and I saw no difference over the past few months. I was really hoping it would at least lessen it to the point where good makeup would take it the rest of the way to smooth, unfortunately no. .... I just gave up and opted for bangs.</li>
            <li> I am 56 yrs. old and my skin has the usual crow&#x27;s feet. laugh lines, etc., which have gotten deep this year.  I have only used about half of this tube but am so excited I found this.  My skin can still break out &amp; get clogged pores.  I put this on before make up and my face looks much better all day!  And I have no problem with break outs.  Love this product &amp; will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I used this brand religously until I used up 2 tubes (bought at costco).&lt;br /&gt;This does not worrrrrrk!!! Its more like an average moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews of this product before purchasing, I was surprised to read that most reviews were positive and people saw immediate changes in their appearance.  Great, where do I sign up?  I bought this product, and two others - day and night moisturizers - and set to work filling in the lines.  It works.  My deepest lines, around my lips, are plumping up (as are the portions of my lips that I accidentally get cream on) and I have to admit I look better.  If my wrinkles don&#x27;t plump up any more than they already have, I&#x27;d be okay with that; but if they keep on plumping, well I&#x27;d be thrilled.  Time will tell, but so far I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  And the moisturizers.  Good products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> I am a 53 y/o woman who wanted to find a wrinkle solution for lines under my eyes and around my mouth. The Deep Wrinle Filler is it! Worked in a week, lines are less noticeable. Even the expression lines that stretch from my mouth across to my cheecks are truly diminished! I have no adverse reactions, no dryness. I use it am/pm, I am fair and sensitive. Use a 30 Sps everywhere. My chest had sun damage and it&#x27;s nearly gone! Only problem was my fault, forgot to apply sunscreen on chest and neck, I burned. Love. love ROC!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I actually noticed more redness on my face after use. I prefer creams without a lot of synthetics. I prefer to mix oils together. My skin looks much happier when I do that. This stuff also broke me out. I didn&#x27;t notice any line reduction.</li>
            <li> I have used other RoC products and been fairly pleased.  So far, I don&#x27;t see any discernible results with this one, which is disappointing.  If continued use brings improvement, I will edit my review.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be great to use ,but, unfortunately, my skin did not like it. After using this for about two days, my skin under my eye area turned red and it burned like crazy! i have no idea why.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the RoC Deep Wrinkle Filler. I feel this product has filled my wrinkles and has helped my skin overall. In fact, once I am done using my current skin care line I will switch to other RoC skin care products. You should give this product a try!</li>
            <li> This stuff works, &amp; the price is right! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t satisfied at all, didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> very nice product. I would recommend this to others. it really works for me. thank you for making this available .</li>
            <li> This product has such a strong perfume smell, that I cannot use it anywhere above my nose.  It causes my eyes to water, and if I use it during the day, I experience a lot of visual discomfort. It may be a good product, but I can&#x27;t  use it because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li> This product did not work like I thought it would.  I have been using it for three weeks and don&#x27;t see any change.  I was using a L&#x27;Bre product that appeared to work better so I will probably go back to that since it cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> I saw results the first time I used this product. After using this product twice a day for four days I did have to cut back to once a day do to a burning sensation however, well worth it to look in the miror and look as good as i feel!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve went twice for botox on my deep forehead lines. I never used sunscreen in my 20&#x27;s and now I&#x27;m 35 and paying for it! Botox worked but side effects of bad headaches for weeks after and not to mention the price and putting poison in my body! I decided to stop the botox and do creams/fillers. I&#x27;ve spend hundreds of dollars and nothing helped dramatically so I went cheaper and guess what?! This one works!!!!! Roc is a wonderful line and this one not only fills my lines but works on reducing them as well. Patience is key here so have that abd you&#x27;ll be impressed too.</li>
            <li> Dont know what the hype is on this product.  Didnt do much for me</li>
            <li> this is by far the best anti wrinkle stuff out there it actually does work it dont make miracles but it take off fine lines and makes them almost invisible also helps your skin look youthful.</li>
            <li> used this for a few months, never saw any improvement. Finally just recently got on Retin-A, these otc products are always a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Received very quickly and was a good price.  Haven&#x27;t used long enough to know if it makes a difference in deep lines or not.</li>
            <li> Tried this today.  Very disappointed at this point.  Can&#x27;t get the lid off to a pointed tip. Is this supposed to have a pointed tip, or do we just slop it all over our face for it to work?</li>
            <li> It really has helped the wrinkles around my eyes. I love it</li>
            <li> Works pretty well to fill deep wrinkles but not quite as effective as expected. Easy to use but be sure to use sunscreen with it due to the retinol content.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m liking the ROC products I purchased from Amazon.com very well. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This works ok,for forehead lines.&lt;br /&gt;Does nothing for crease lines that usually show beside the nose, and down the lower cheek.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say it is worth the effort, or price.&lt;br /&gt;As we have used it for at least 12 weeks, and it&#x27;s results do not justify the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Save your bux, and get botox esp on the deep laugh line side wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have deep wrinkles around my mouth.  I hate them.....makes me look years older, and I want them gone.  I tried this product by ROC, and it did very little.  I will not buy this again.  Amazon carries it, but it did not work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not have any changes after using this product. Will try a different one.</li>
            <li> This has helped with those creepy lines from my nose to my mouth. Hate those! i do use this morning and night under olay regenerist and i know it helps!</li>
            <li> I have been contacted numerous times by Amazon to write a review on RoC products that I recently purchased.  I have told them I hadn&#x27;t used the products long enough to really give a review but since they continue to e-mail me about it, I will give it my best shot.  I like this Deep Wrinkle Filler for how it goes onto my face and how it feels when I apply it in the morning.  The smell is very nice however I have not used it long enough to really give it a great review as far as filling my wrinkles as well as I&#x27;d like.  I will say that it has probably brightened my complexion some and there may be discernible wrinkle coverage but whatever I see first thing in the morning gradually wears off as the day goes on.  I have only reapplied it a couple of times later in the day if I am going some place special.  I had hoped this would be something I would not have to worry would wear off by mid afternoon.  I purchased the Deep Wrinkle Filler primarily for temporary coverage of my wrinkles but I was thinking it would last until I washed my face in the evening. I was hoping as with the other RoC products I purchased at the same time as I purchased the deep wrinkle filler that I would see better results the longer I used it however in the past two to three weeks that I have used it, I&#x27;m not sure the results will get any better as some reviewers shared.  One huge problem I have noticed when I use this product and also the deep wrinkle moisturizer is that when I apply the moisturizer over the RoC Deep Wrinkle Filler that I also apply in the mornings, it tends to flake and I have to wipe off all the excess flaking that comes from either the filler or the moisturizer, whichever is doing it.  I have been careful about applying it thin enough and making sure I rub it in good but it still has a tendency to flake which is a big nuisance.  I would like to know if there is something I am missing when applying these two products in the morning since the directions do say that that you can use the moisturizer over the wrinkle filler.  At any rate, time will tell whether I see any a pronounced difference in my wrinkles but at this point, it is helping some, I just wish it would do more and last longer.  Hopefully the longer I use it, the sooner I will see more improvement that will seal my decision about whether I will continue using these products.  At this point, if I ran out of them tomorrow, I probably would not reorder.use the moisturizer over the wrinkle filler.

            <li> I bought this because of wrinkles I was getting above my lip.it didn&#x27;t work right away and over time I didn&#x27;t notice any&lt;br /&gt;chance.will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results thus far but hopeful that it will diminish the look of wrinkles somewhat, eventually.  At my age I don&#x27;t expect a miracle, just an improvement.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money when I bought it up to $70...&#x27;instant&#x27; should be deleted from packaging. Sales woman at Shoppers suggested ROC so I bought it.  Never worked. Loreal deep wrinkle filler does a way better job for much less.</li>
            <li> No problems with this product or the delivery. It seems to be good if used as recommended and I would be willing to try other ROC items.</li>
            <li> This is excellent on my skin. I don&#x27;t really have a wrinkles since I am 27 but I do have frown lines and this has visibly reduced those! I am a believer in RoC now!</li>
            <li> I use it already for few years and I love it. The product is delicate and the smale is nice. I recomende it</li>
            <li> Used it religiously since I bought it maybe 4 months ago and not a spec of difference. it&#x27;s time for injections!!&lt;br /&gt;Saw it recommended on KATIE on Tv so ordered it. It doesn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> Really works, from the very first day you can see results</li>
            <li> Used the entire tube and saw no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about deep wrinkles but I used this for an indented scar I have above my eye.  It has made me very self conscious, and my bangs just barely covered it up.  I had tried every type of scar treatment to diminish its appearance, but nothing worked.  Been using this product for a month, and already see amazing results.  My scar is not as deep, and I can now wear makeup and it&#x27;s almost invisible.  Didn&#x27;t show up in any of my wedding photos and that was a relief.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> best products. I&#x27;ve beeb using &amp;#34;Roc&amp;#34; w/retinol for day &amp; night and around my eyes over 40 years. No product is as &amp;#34;Roc&amp;#34; and started using the filler too, no one ever guess my age, believe me, I do not care about peoples, what they say, most important I feel great about the product, one of the best.</li>
            <li> Awesome results.  Great price.  Will be vying again for sure üëç</li>
            <li> This would probably be very good if you strictly do the regimen, but I seem to be lacking in that dept, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from buying this product. It won&#x27;t work if you don&#x27;t use it correctly.</li>
            <li> I use this as faithfully as I can but nobody&#x27;s said anything but I feel better wearing it, my skin does feel lovely after using it, but I&#x27;, not positive about the reduction of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> A big difference in my skin since I have been using ROC products.  The trick is to be faithful about the use.</li>
            <li> my wife is pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> What an amazing  ingredient,  always admired&lt;br /&gt;my elders, just now following  the Leaders !!!</li>
            <li> Does NOT fill in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Cannot tell a difference after a week or so.</li>
            <li> Test it first !!!  I read the reviews, the good and the bad then clicked purchase.  This product works for some, but others have had a bad reaction after using it, myself included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out under my eyes before going to bed then the next morning I looked in the mirror and freaked out. The area of application was red as in a chemical burn, puffy and severely swollen...horrible experience.  If you opt to buy this, PLEASE test it out a couple of times to make sure you do not have a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I am really recommended is a great cream for deep wrinkle .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 7 weeks now, made no difference so far! Using it as per instruction!&lt;br /&gt;Although I can feel it for about 10 min after putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;A little disappointing, but maybe it&#x27;ll take longer than they say! I have even taken before and after pictures. sorry folks no difference yet, even with loads of moisturizer it has not helped.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also has seen no difference and she has been using it for 3 months now!</li>
            <li> I saw no change to my wrinkle when I added this</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product is giving me red blotches all over my face. I normal have very normal skin. Not oily or dry. Right now it&#x27;s red and dry and flaky. I will have to discontinue use.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing but I do not see that it smooths away wrinkles instantly as it claims. So it&#x27;s quite disappointing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for months and I see no change,  I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I am not implying that this stuff is not the &amp;#34;miracle cream&amp;#34; that everyone else seems to think it is. I just feel that reviews need to be well rounded to actually work. I have used retinoid products for years. I understand the nuances of slight tingling sensations or mild burning or dryness or flakiness. ALL of those would have been welcomed conditions compared to what I got from this cream! I have never had a blemish in my entire life. After one week of this cream, all of the areas where I had been applying the very small amount as directed, broke out in weird looking sores. Gross but no other way to describe them. I scoured the internet only to find term like your skin might &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; after use. Believe me, this is not purging‚Ä¶this is outright alergic reaction to something. NOT that I am judging this cream for everyone‚Ä¶just giving others who might fall into my category, a heads up. It is worth noting that I have NEVER had an alergic reaction to any product before. I am not sure what this stuff has in it that my skin hates but I do know that you do not want to experience what I have, if you do not have to! Just be careful. I even backed off and stopped using for days because they advise to do that‚Ä¶nevertheless, the day I started again, BOOM‚Ä¶zombie face‚Ä¶just sayin&#x27;!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright for fine pores and vry fine lines, but really doesn&#x27;t fill in wrinkles likesome other products. Price is good. I just use it on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> so comfortable on the skin and my wrinkles are really filling up. this cream loosens the skin and leaves it smooth</li>
            <li> To much to mess with, time consuming.</li>
            <li> save your money . didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 weeks and finally gave up when I didn&#x27;t see ANY results. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of stuff, cheap and expensive, and bought this on a whim... was I surprised when it really worked on the lines that were creeping down from my eyes to my cheeks!  It also did not make me break out like a different Roc product I tried in the past (forgot which).  The only reason I subtracted one star is because I would like clearer directions about combining this with an eye cream and how. Save yourself a ton of money on useless higher end products and buy this!</li>
            <li> Okay is the word for this item.  I used it faithfully according to the instructions, but didn&#x27;t see any results regarding my deep wrinkles.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to work any better than any of my other moisturizers.  My deep frown wrinkle between my eyes does not look diminished just well moisturized.  Do not expect miracles</li>
            <li> Excellent product but I wish it were unsented. It has a really gross perfume smell that I can not stand, but I do like the way it feels on the skin.</li>
            <li> Buy it buy it buy it.  I have been using for 2 weeks now.  Hands down it works!  Follow instructions and I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good, but the amount is just a little. You would need to buy about 6 of this one. haha&#x27;</li>
            <li> I am reasonably sure it is a good product.  However I was sent the wrong product. Did not bother to return it because I didn&#x27;t want to go thru the hassel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months now.  I believe that it is doing a good job of gradually minimizing the small lines around my eyes and the larger creases in my forehead.  I don&#x27;t think that you can expect a significant difference right away, so I will continue to use this product for another 3 months and see if I can tell the difference.  I do notice that sometimes the thin tissue around my eyes burn when I apply this, but it goes away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Good for moisturizing,,,, I have been using 2x a day everyday for 5 weeks.,wrinkles have not changed at all...  I am going to finish product anyway.</li>
            <li> i use this in conjunction with the deep wrinkle serum every day, and the results are much better than i had hoped.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the fact it can be sent to my door is even better. Fills like no other</li>
            <li> Did not like this product , it did not work for me . I would not recommend this product to any one</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, so don&#x27;t expect much.  I have used it for two months (religiously morning and night).  The lines on my face might be a little softer, but I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s any more effective than regular moisturizer you can get in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Just starting so will know more in a few weeks or more</li>
            <li> The redness never went away after several months of use. Just didn&#x27;t work for me. I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from trying it because it does work for so many people.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning along the the Deep wrinkle Serum and I have noticed a big differance. sometimes I have to look in the mirror twice to notice my \\&quot;11&#x27;s\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Sorry. It&#x27;s been so long ago that I can&#x27;t remember if it worked or not, which is the reason for the three stars</li>
            <li> my friends, i am f 38 old,  from saudi arabia, i have used almost all products sheap and expensive, everything, 1 month a go i did reserch about the secret of being younger...etc  sorry about my english^_^&lt;br /&gt;anyway, i read reserch about good product,  i read the secret is they should contain wakame,,,,,,,ok  i bought wakame  and i eat it everyday  ,,,,,i swear i swear  my brother my friends  have asked me what did u do???you r diffrent  another person....like i am in 25, my bags under eye gone, black secrcle gone, my wrinkls gone,,, i have used also retin a,,, and this month i started using http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V98RQ4/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i start to understand these points,,, and start buying products contain them.....[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now i am going to move from retin a to roc retenol........and continue eating wakame and searching for products contain the secret  which in that website which i posted..........sorry about my english agine,,,,,,,,,,,,please buy wakame now now now now  and pray for me when u reallly see the diffrents</li>
            <li> This is a very effective product which does act as a filler for the lines around and below the mouth area.</li>
            <li> Good product if it is used regularly. I have not been consistent as I had been in the past.. I know it works but use it ref. For smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It is okay..but does not work for long period of time.can&#x27;t really tell that it fills in the lines. Okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again and again and again....it works well, it&#x27;s not greasy &amp; it arrived in good time.</li>
            <li> I put this filler on my skin and a few minutes later, started itching.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have a chance to find out if it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference but I am going to continue and give it more time. Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day, I guess.</li>
            <li> Nothing happened.........every wrinkle I had looks exactly the same.  They did not diminish even a little.  I tried it on one side of my face and asked family members to see if they could tell a difference and everyone said they couldn&#x27;t.  The product says it will work immediately, but even after 1 week I did not see any results.  I will definitely be sending it back if there is a return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very unhappy!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  After a few weeks, I see no difference at all in my rather light age wrinkles.  I was hoping for some results by now.</li>
            <li> I have tried many wrinkle creams - I can say that this one gives the best results.  It does not get rid of wrinkles ( I don&#x27;t think anything but botox will )- but it does diminish them and make your face look a lot better!  Makeup goes on so smoothly.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks and love it.  It does not irritate my skin either.  I&#x27;ve learned that not everything works for every one, so you have to try different products, which can get expensive!</li>
            <li> I have smile lines. DEEP ones. I&#x27;m 32 but have had them since 13! I&#x27;ve tries everything. Prices up to 150 a bottle. No results. Two weeks and I saw a HUGE diff. As did others. Recommend to friends. I apply twice daily. As a filler I apply and cover with my facial moitstrizer then apply foundation. After a while the filler part becomes needed less as it reduces lines. I also use it on my dark circles with results!</li>
            <li> I remember my Mom swearing by Roc products when I was growing up; a couple of years ago I started using them and could see why she loved them so. I have used Roc Deep Wrinkle Filler for 6 weeks and it delivers what it promises; The fine wrinkles under my eyes disappear as soon as I apply it so my concealer goes on smooth, I love it!</li>
            <li> Using it for about 3 weeks now and starting to notice sun damage wrinkles around my mouth fading</li>
            <li> Will never buy again, waste of money. Worst thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. Makes wrinkles waaaaay worse what was a fine line just forming is now a fully grown embedded wrinkle with only 3 uses. It has harmful chemicals in it</li>
            <li> This product does nothing to eliminate wrinkles, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just started using the cream, too soon to tell if it will work to my expectations</li>
            <li> I cant say that I am that impressed with this product right now, I will have to give it more time and then update my review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Roc products for about 2 years and this one is absolutely the best.  It really does plump up and smooth the skin that tends to wrinkle.  Wish I&#x27;d known about this sooner, I plan to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Because I use dry mineral makeup, I only use this as a night cream.  Only been using it for about 2 weeks, and it seems to be helping.  In the daytime I use Roc Completelift because it dries quickly and not greasy.  With dry makeup, you don&#x27;t want to put the dry makeup over any moisturizer that stays moist, because it causes heavy buildup and streaks.  I use Instant Under Eye for daytime, but don&#x27;t put moisturizer under it.  I&#x27;m sure that if you use wet makeup, the Deep Wrinkle moisturizer would be good for daytime.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think one should expect miracles from a wrinkle cream, but you will see a noticeable difference. I bought this for my mother and she is very happy with it, and she has tried many different products over the years. Just be patient and give it some time to work.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over 3 months and still have the same wrinkles I started with.  They&#x27;re still as deep as before.  Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product again. It states it will help fill in wrinkles but it doesn&#x27;t.  It I had known it was incapable of helping to reduce the signs of wrinkles, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at the store but found it on amazon for half the price. I like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost 3 mos. And while I feel like it&#x27;s helped the appearance of some of my finer wrinkles, the wrinkles on my forehead still plague me. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle... but I&#x27;m only 29 and they haven&#x27;t been around very long so I was hopeful. Sigh.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference whatsoever. Save your money!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work and do what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I am disappointed but not completely upset because it is a good lotion and I can use it this winter to keep my face from getting dry.  But if you are looking for a wrinkle corrector look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> this is just  a facial cream, nothing more.  I should have known better than to purchase any ROC product.&lt;br /&gt;ROC is completely false advertising and I have never gotten any single benefit from any of their products.&lt;br /&gt;I just spent a ridiculous amt of money so only they benefitted!</li>
            <li> I use ROC everyday.  Can&#x27;t beat the deal on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon, Candace Love</li>
            <li> I use it everyday as part of my nighttime skin care regiment and noticed a difference after 6-8 weeks. It diminished the fine lines around my eyes and the frown crease in between my eyebrows. It can be used day or night and under makeup, but I prefer using it at night since it stings a bit (but not uncomfortably so) and because I roll over onto my side (and face) at night (so extra wrinkle plumping is needed). I suggest not using it after buff-puff scrubbing or other rough exfoliation of your skin because the stinging will be more intense. You can definitely feel the Retinol working!</li>
            <li> I can see a difference on my face from using this product for a short while now.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I am a beauty product nerd, I have been using mositurizers religiously since i was about 30 years old and it shows, i look far younger than my 46years.  I have tested countless moisturizers over the years and stores like Sephora, Ulta and The Derm Store loved me.  Anyway, these last few years i had been using Neutrogena during the daytime and Strivectin at night.  I believe in switching things up, so  2 months ago I bought Roc Deep Wrinkle daytime and the Deep Wrinkle Filler and the Serum.  I didnt have unrealistic expectations, especially not  from a drugstore product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time frame : 2 months,  Deep Wrinkle spf 30 1x in morning, &amp; Deep wrinkle filler 1x in morning, Serum at night.&lt;br /&gt;Where i apply: I have expression based wrinkles,  above my right eyebrow, on my forehead, a few lines near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results******* The awful line above my eyebrow has lessened in depth, big  big difference. Only thing that will take it away completely will be Botox.  ******The forehead lines are softened ..but they will always be there because of my expressions. (Botox or chemical peel will help, i know.  *****My crows feet,  these have softened definately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these products do plump up the skin, there is more volume in all of there application areas.  I dont know if this is temporary or not...but I do know that I had low expectations and I do  see good results from  the Roc Products.  I think their products work as well as high end products, but they cost so much less.  Overall Roc is a  great value and I will be buying them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s.  I think people expect miracles and that only sets them up for disappointment.  If you want to completely eradicate  wrinkles, you will have to see a Dermatologist, bottom line.</li>
            <li> Its a good item this one!&lt;br /&gt;The quality is very good and works perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was very good too!</li>
            <li> Under no circumstances should anyone buy this product.  I have never in my life wrote a review for a product but felt absolutely compelled to do so in this case.  I tried this product on some forehead lines-which really were not that noticeable, and it irritated the skin, to the point it burned.  I aborted it.  Unfortunately I failed to toss it.  My bad.  Then 6 months later seeing it in the cabinet I thought I would give it another chance.  I FOOLISHLY tried it on my neck where I have some lines.  DUMB, DUMB, DUMB.  It damn near tore the skin off.  It looks like I have third degree burns-no lie. I also have about 50 deep wrinkles now instead of one or two lines!!  I assume they will clear once this reaction is over.  Bloody well better.  Now, I am stupid admittedly for trying it again....and even dumber for trying it on my neck.......but this stuff is truly like battery acid.  I feel like suing!!  I have used countless facial products for various things and while many didn&#x27;t work...they certainly didn&#x27;t leave me homebound for a week like this stuff has!!!  Do not buy this stuff.  It should be pulled from the shelves!!!</li>
            <li> Have seen some improvement but it&#x27;s not been as much as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> I find this product to be the best for my skin; and I love it.</li>
            <li> I switched from olay to see if some of the puffiness and tired look would improve.  Seeing some minor results.</li>
            <li> Immediately I noticed a difference in the look of my skin the very first time I used this.  Those fine lines seemed to be less obvious. I have only been using this for a week, so I&#x27;ve yet to learn if it actually improves the appearance as well as it conceals it.</li>
            <li> My review is the same as for RoC Serum. I can see where the product would have helped my face several years ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using Roc for years but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the deep wrinkle filler. I have some crows feet on the sides of my eyes and some deep vertical creases above my top lip, so that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve been using this. I apply it at night before bed. I sleep on my side and in the morning my wrinkles are usually pretty obvious, but since using this filler, I am sure that the crows feet are not as bad. The creases above my lip seem a little better too, and maybe with more time, I will see more of an effect. After using it for over a week, I&#x27;m happy and I will repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning after my moisturizer. Does a great job reducing the look of wrinkles. Used to be an Oil of Olay user until I found the Roc line seems to be much more effective. Does not leave face feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles all over y face, just an expression line across my forehead. I have tried numerous creams and nothing has really made it appear smaller. This product actually seems to be working. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and I already notice the line has become very thin. Will finish the tube and see where I&#x27;m at. Will most likely but again.</li>
            <li> I was very unsure of the product but I continued to use daily I began to notice the difference of the slight wrinkles fading.</li>
            <li> Product did not work and did nothing to improve my crows feet. I&#x27;m 29 and have crows feet lines and forehead lines. I put it on every single morning and night. Absolutely did nothing to improve. I used the entire tube. Complete waste of money. All it did was give me acne around my crows feet that I&#x27;ve never had in that area before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you&#x27;re not happy with your wrinkles you&#x27;re better off just getting botox. I feel like none of these creams work at all. Was unhappy with product and will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> excellant, I give it 4 stars!would love to get a cream that plumps lips out, thusly reducing hash marks under lower lip.</li>
            <li> Works before my eyes! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have used it before and loved it. If I don&#x27;t have any I feel as if my makeup isn&#x27;t complete, am sure it helps enormously with the lines none of us want.</li>
            <li> Like all of the other Roc products I&#x27;ve used, this one is great. I was actually looking for the instant deep wrinkle filler and ordered this by mistake -  but I&#x27;ve found that using this one does help a lot. I had some deep forehead wrinkles that seem to be disappearing. Since I neglected them for so long - I&#x27;m amazed at how well this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I used the entire tube. Honestly, I did not notice a difference. I have a couple of deep wrinkles on my forehead, it did not diminish them at all. I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 6 weeks, noticed changes in 2, it must be working as the wrinkles are not as deep, very pleased, but you do need sun cream on if your out in the sun as it affects the retinol in the cream, easy to use . AND IF IT WORKS FOR ME IT WILL WORK FOR ANYONE.</li>
            <li> good  goes on nice  not harsh on your face, but i do not see an improvement.  Not oily, good price, I use as a daily and night time cream</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I don&#x27;t see any changes</li>
            <li> Product is a little greasy feeling and I don&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; like directions say. But it does seem to moisturize well. Will continue to use, but not certain I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Using this with eye cream and Night cream have made my skin look Great!  Noticed a difference within a week.</li>
            <li> Product came on time. Also been using for two weeks and i see results on my forehead and upper lip. I have also always had dark circles under my eyes and have been told by multiple people my eyes are so much lighter and asked if I was doing anything different. So yes i recommend this prodect</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that will temporarily hide even deep wrinkles, this is it.  I jokingly call it spackle because of how it really fills in the cracks and crevices.  It will instantly fill them up and keep your skin plump for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it twice a day and have noticed that I can skip a day.  It obviously has some residual benefit and actually repairs your skin.  I have found it gentle enough to use around crow&#x27;s feet without any irritation.  This is a great base to use before an all over moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I notice that I have wound on my nose and face since using this product. I had to stop using it and saw the doctors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok...I couldn&#x27;t see drastic results, but felt that it did help a bit on the # 11&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Just finished my first tube and  had a comment today on how good my skin looked.  I noticed a difference after a couple weeks.  Lines are much more diminished..I had recommended this to a friend who had harsh &#x27;smoker lines&#x27; around her mouth and after using for awhile her skin is much improved.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be without this filler!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, will continue to use and see.. will be a process. Don&#x27;t expect overnight results.</li>
            <li> It works, but only if you use it regularly, with discipline. The amount in the tube is for less than one month( perhaps two or three weeks). That means that if it lasts more than that, you are not using it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Together with the product you can massage your face as seen in YouTube. Voil&amp;agrave;, you are after 3 months ten years younger.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for my terrible English</li>
            <li> I see  improvement but I had a lot of damage and grafting but of all the products I have used this was much better than Landcome estee lauder also clinique and price was right Dog took 75 percent of lower lip and almost lost my right eye so they grafted from inside my cheeks so as time goes on lines r getting deeper but I def see an improvement thanks I would highley recommend to any one with natural lines and women like me with unnatural lines takes a couple of days ROC ROCKS</li>
            <li> I liked it, would continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Received it  yesterday and after just two applications I have noticed a difference. Not huge, but enough to be impressed!</li>
            <li> So I tried many different things and they just didn&#x27;t worked. I&#x27;ve used inexpensive brands to the expensive ones. So I had enough of every store telling me something works and it didn&#x27;t. I was at my wits end of spending all this money on something that didn&#x27;t work. Yes my skin was softer but y fine lines were still there. I&#x27;m only 25, but have a very stressful life raising a 4 year old while going to school full time, lack of sleep, ect. Besides that I have fair skin and have had past sun damage to it. So I started getting fine lines about 2 years ago and they&#x27;ve only got worse. By 30 I probably wouldn&#x27;t of started getting crows feet if I didn&#x27;t find out about these Roc products. I was getting my yearly examine from my dermatologist and was talking to her about my concerns and she told me to use ROC. This product is amazing and for now on I&#x27;m only buying ROC. Seriously instantly my lines started softening. Only after using it for a few day my lines have dimished tramatically. ROC has saved my skin and is going to keep my looking young like I should. So I&#x27;m basically getting 1/2 a presciption for grocery store price. You have to try it.</li>
            <li> This product help my skin to look younger and healthy. No one ones to look old and this product is very much something can help to improve healthiness in your skin</li>
            <li> While I have only been using this product for only one and a half weeks, to my surprise I really see a difference.  I am finally seeing fine lines on my forehead and deep smile or laugh lines around my mouth areas.  I have been using it twice a day and I definitely see an improvement.  I can&#x27;t believe it.  I&#x27;m so pleased with this Roc product.  I have already ordered my second tube, even though I haven&#x27;t finished the first one.  I recommend this product.  Lol</li>
            <li> This was a waste of good money.  I have used it several times &amp; it doesn&#x27;t even begin to fill in small wrinkles much less deep ones!  I&#x27;ll never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks I already see the deep lines around my nose plumping up, and filling in. It is what it&#x27;s called. Also like the affordable price.</li>
            <li> Works great!!!  Bought several tubes and recommend it to friends as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years. I started when i was around 29 im 32 now. I drank a lot back then and cried a lot lol reason im stating these facts is becaue my eyes would be swollen in the morning and this would help them a lot. I do not and am not ageing well Either. But this helps my fine wrinkles also, that came from being in the sun too long because i didnt know any better. Also had some pretty hefty wrinkles on my forehead and this help make them look less harsh but they arent all gone. We are human we raise our eyebrows and we smile so we have smile lines, a cream cant prevent that. The plumping and filling it does is temporary but realistically you cant expect a product over counter for only around 20 bucks to permanently eliminate entirely, signs of aging, sun damage, or the what not. It does help make wrinkles look less harsh and fills in temporarily. Some people have better genes so age better than others and respond better to products than others. I believe im not one of the lucky ones which says a lot about this product. this is a great product worth the price. Because of it i have faith in products now. I believe if a girl in her 20 esp early 20s starts using this with her regular routine that she will def help stall the aging process but you girls gotta get started early you cant wait til youre 30 like me and be like oh crap im about to be 40 and expect these things to work miracles :) prevention works best! Sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I see a difference when I don&#x27;t use this- don&#x27;t expect it to make anything disappear, but it does &#x27;soften&#x27; the wrinkle between my brows, and I think ROC is a good company and very knowledgeable about skin care.</li>
            <li> Use this in the morning before makeup.  Follow the directions and let it dry.  Works great.  Love the product.  Very good price  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I love RoC products. Very good results everytime. I other RoC products work amazing! One of the few products out  there with excellent price  and Real results.</li>
