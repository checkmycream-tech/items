            <li>If you are concerned about pain, I would recommend you talk to your dentist and find out what whitening method would be best for you.</li>
            <li>this works great</li>
            <li>For this product, Amazon has a great price, however.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Experience more of the wonderful thank you</li>
            <li>This is a really good product.  </li>
            <li>The results are just as good as what I got from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>and they do a good job.  </li>
            <li>It works even better than I thought!</li>
            <li>my teeth whitened really fast and look great!</li>
            <li>Excellent was beautiful and wonderful, but after experience pain in the teeth of cold water</li>
            <li>Yes Crest Whitestrips did a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>I have a whitening membership with my cosmetic dentist which is lovely</li>
            <li>People have to realize though, that the more stained your teeth are, the more times you may have to use them.  </li>
            <li>This is not a miracle, but works great if you do your part too, like having your teeth cleaned regularly and maintaining good oral health.  </li>
            <li>They are great and really work.  </li>
            <li>these are the best white strips on the market</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by the great results after just one use.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT BRUSH YOUR TEETH RIGHT BEFORE APPLYING ANY WHITENING PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li>They really stay on your teeth and fit good.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend these.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking for a brighter smile!</li>
            <li>Treatment worked really well on my top teeth but not as well on the bottom.</li>
            <li>They really keep my teeth bright, and I am 61 years old.</li>
            <li>Really does the job and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These strips are not cheap, but are definitely this best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Ive used other white strips, but this particular formula of whitestrips works great!</li>
            <li>This whitening product is by far hands down the ABSOLUTE  best I have tried like wow.</li>
            <li>far as whitening results go, I did find the Intensive professional Effects whitestrips to have the most whitening.</li>
            <li>The cheaper, quicker ones I have got in the past work just as good</li>
            <li>but I am still willing to pay the extra money for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I felt intense pain in my teeth.</li>
            <li>It lasted the whole week.</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>If you are a heavy soda drinker or eat a lot of acidic foods you may have enamel loss and that will also make whitening significantly less effective and whole lot more painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had extraordinary results from it with all my yellow Tetracycline stains removed and my whitening was whiter than their charts.</li>
            <li>These are worth the money since you only have to use them for 7 days.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s not the same, but this is the best over the counter whitening kit I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>your teeth are not too badly stained or you have done professional whitening before, this kit is excellent.</li>
            <li>how do the Intensive Professional Effects whitestrips compare to the real deal professional whitening?</li>
            <li>When I had my professional whitening done it cost $300, and that was just my top teeth and was back in the late 1990s, so I&#x27;m sure it would be way more expensive now.</li>
            <li>I learned to take a Tylenol in advance of applying the whitestrips and it significantly cuts down on pain.</li>
            <li>I have tried both the Crest Whitestrips Professional Effects with level 4 whitening and the Intensive Professional Effects with level 5 whitening.</li>
            <li>As a kid my teeth were discolored by Tetracycline, so I had my teeth professionally whitened years ago</li>
            <li>My professional whitening was syringes of peroxide gel I added to a custom fitted plastic tray that I wore twice a day for 2 hours each time.</li>
            <li>I have a stubborn stain that keeps coming back between my two front/bottom teeth, these strips really help with it.</li>
            <li>To expect that is like expecting exercise to not make your muscles really hurt when you haven&#x27;t exercised them in a very long time.</li>
            <li>Unless your teeth are already white and have been whitened before professionally you aren&#x27;t likely to get blinding white results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For the first few days expect a lot of tooth sensitivity.</li>

            <li> /&gt;For the first few days expect a lot of tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> To use whitening products too soon after brushing your teeth is basically to put peroxide directly into these tiny cuts which equals a lot more pain, and you&#x27;re also directly putting the peroxide into your bloodstream which can make you sick.</li>
            <li> If you have really deep stains, enamel loss, or other concerns I would recommend you save your money and get your teeth professionally whitened bya dentist.</li>
            <li> I mean this thing  is for 2 hours after the first hour</li>
            <li> I did 3 rounds of the professional whitening system and my teeth stayed white for years, but in the past couple years I have had to touch them</li>
            <li> I take aspirin before applying the strips and only do a treatment every other day to ease the pain.</li>
            <li> I have also had professional whitening done in the past through the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rinsing with warm milk does help, but it is still a little painful.</li>
            <li> Did not do as well as I expected</li>
            <li> Tooth and gum sensitivity is to be expected.</li>
            <li> You are putting peroxide and other whitening ingredients onto your teeth and they are made to permeate the surface.</li>
            <li> My pearly whites glow in the dark........</li>
            <li> What I do is start brushing with a toothpaste made to cut back on sensitivity at least 14 days in advance of the whitening process.</li>
            <li> The reason for this is because when you brush your teeth you commonly get very tiny cuts in your mouth.</li>
            <li> With the professional effects series of whitestrips you can drink water, but I recommend using a straw if possible  because if you get the strips too wet they will start to slip and you digest some of the gel which can make you sick to yourstomach.</li>
            <li> Wait at least an hour after brushing to apply the whitestrips.</li>
            <li> they are hardly visible!</li>
            <li> The price has been going up, which is disappointing</li>

            <li> This is a really good product.  The results are just as good as what I got from the dentist.  These strips are not cheap, but are definitely this best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Yes Crest Whitestrips did a fantastic job! Would recommend to anyone looking for a brighter smile!</li>
            <li> This whitening product is by far hands down the ABSOLUTE  best I have tried like wow. I have a whitening membership with my cosmetic dentist which is lovely but I just can&#x27;t stop coming back to purchase these. They are my holy grail. I always get compliments on my teeth! I strongly recommend these. The price has been going up, which is disappointing but I am still willing to pay the extra money for such an amazing product. The strips stay on your teeth, I can drink water while wearing them, and talk not to mention swallow without getting the horrendous gel taste in my throat!! I can wear them anywhere they are hardly visible!</li>
            <li> Excellent was beautiful and wonderful, but after experience pain in the teeth of cold water&lt;br /&gt;Experience more of the wonderful thank you</li>
            <li> I mean this thing  is for 2 hours after the first hour I felt intense pain in my teeth. It lasted the whole week. I will never buy this piece of junk again.</li>
            <li> Worked very well. The price was lower than at the stores. I would recommend this to any one who wanted  to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> The best OTC whiteners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have used white strips for years and have had no problem or sensitivity with them and they do a good job.  People have to realize though, that the more stained your teeth are, the more times you may have to use them.  Stuff that stains if used regularly includes coffee, soda, cigarettes, wine etc.  You have to keep up with it and there has to be constant oral care.  This is not a miracle, but works great if you do your part too, like having your teeth cleaned regularly and maintaining good oral health.  They really keep my teeth bright, and I am 61 years old.</li>
            <li> Ive used other white strips, but this particular formula of whitestrips works great! my teeth whitened really fast and look great!</li>
            <li> My pearly whites glow in the dark........</li>
            <li> Did not do as well as I expected but I did see results.</li>
            <li> this works great and I don&#x27;t have a sensitivity issue</li>
            <li> These are what I always buy to whiten my teeth once or twice a year.  They are great and really work.  Definitely recommend buying these. These are worth the money since you only have to use them for 7 days. They really stay on your teeth and fit good.</li>
            <li> Really does the job and easy to use.  I was really surprised by the great results after just one use.  These will be part of my regular dental care.</li>
            <li> Treatment worked really well on my top teeth but not as well on the bottom. Definitely an improvement though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside was tooth sensitivity afterwards. Rinsing with warm milk does help, but it is still a little painful. Still recommend it though!</li>
            <li> Perfect! these are the best white strips on the market</li>
            <li> There are 7 strips. You have to wear them for 2 hours. I have used 4 of them in 2-3 weeks because of tooth sensitivity and it&#x27;s a pain for the 2 hours. The cheaper, quicker ones I have got in the past work just as good it appears and are easier. Save your money like I am going to do next time and get generic cvs or target ones.</li>
            <li> I got my pearly whites</li>
            <li> ...did not score my highest review as they did not have the whitening power I had been led to believe that they would.  For this product, Amazon has a great price, however.  At any price, the strips do not perform as one would expect.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the Crest Whitestrips Professional Effects with level 4 whitening and the Intensive Professional Effects with level 5 whitening. I have also had professional whitening done in the past through the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to state up front that whitening your teeth will not be a painless process. You are putting peroxide and other whitening ingredients onto your teeth and they are made to permeate the surface. You have nerves inside your teeth and peroxide burns. Tooth and gum sensitivity is to be expected. You&#x27;re bleaching your teeth. Do not whiten your teeth expecting zero sensitivity or pain. To expect that is like expecting exercise to not make your muscles really hurt when you haven&#x27;t exercised them in a very long time. It&#x27;s going to hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you deal with the sensitivity? What I do is start brushing with a toothpaste made to cut back on sensitivity at least 14 days in advance of the whitening process. Also use a mouthwash or rinse made for sensitivity as well. DO NOT BRUSH YOUR TEETH RIGHT BEFORE APPLYING ANY WHITENING PRODUCTS!! The reason for this is because when you brush your teeth you commonly get very tiny cuts in your mouth. To use whitening products too soon after brushing your teeth is basically to put peroxide directly into these tiny cuts which equals a lot more pain, and you&#x27;re also directly putting the peroxide into your bloodstream which can make you sick. Wait at least an hour after brushing to apply the whitestrips. If you&#x27;re worried about debris on your teeth you can rinse your mouth out with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first few days expect a lot of tooth sensitivity. I learned to take a Tylenol in advance of applying the whitestrips and it significantly cuts down on pain. With the professional effects series of whitestrips you can drink water, but I recommend using a straw if possible  because if you get the strips too wet they will start to slip and you digest some of the gel which can make you sick to yourstomach. I hydrate prior to whitening so I&#x27;m not having to guzzle water during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as whitening results go, I did find the Intensive professional Effects whitestrips to have the most whitening. Don&#x27;t expect  to get teeth as white as what you see on TV or in magazines. Unless your teeth are already white and have been whitened before professionally you aren&#x27;t likely to get blinding white results. As a kid my teeth were discolored by Tetracycline, so I had my teeth professionally whitened years ago The thing is, really deep stains DO start to reappear over time so whitening is not permanent, especially if you drink coffee, soda, tea and eat staining foods. If you are a heavy soda drinker or eat a lot of acidic foods you may have enamel loss and that will also make whitening significantly less effective and whole lot more painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how do the Intensive Professional Effects whitestrips compare to the real deal professional whitening? Honestly, it&#x27;s not the same, but this is the best over the counter whitening kit I have ever used, hands down. When I had my professional whitening done it cost $300, and that was just my top teeth and was back in the late 1990s, so I&#x27;m sure it would be way more expensive now. My professional whitening was syringes of peroxide gel I added to a custom fitted plastic tray that I wore twice a day for 2 hours each time. I had extraordinary results from it with all my yellow Tetracycline stains removed and my whitening was whiter than their charts. I did 3 rounds of the professional whitening system and my teeth stayed white for years, but in the past couple years I have had to touch them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your teeth are not too badly stained or you have done professional whitening before, this kit is excellent. It will save you a lot of money, time, and effort. If you have really deep stains, enamel loss, or other concerns I would recommend you save your money and get your teeth professionally whitened bya dentist. If you are concerned about pain, I would recommend you talk to your dentist and find out what whitening method would be best for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big cola/wine/tea/coffee person so I use these strips once a year. And yes these hurt my teeth, but only for a day after a treatment. After that it&#x27;s like it never happened. I have a stubborn stain that keeps coming back between my two front/bottom teeth, these strips really help with it. I take aspirin before applying the strips and only do a treatment every other day to ease the pain.</li>
            <li> It works even better than I thought! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days and I&#x27;ve already seen a huge difference. You won&#x27;t regret buying those.</li>
