            <li>I LOVE IT......FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li>This one works wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and I find it works the best....</li>
            <li>This is a very good shaver for your legs, it&#x27;s not meant to be used for your underarms.</li>
            <li>It burns my underarms and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job on the legs.  </li>
            <li>and I have been very satisfied with them all up until this one!</li>
            <li>The Shaver works great</li>
            <li>works great.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Great shave.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Price was great for the items.  </li>
            <li>Another great example of planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li>great shaver&lt;br /&gt;Discontinued so i ordered here</li>
            <li>Works great without water.</li>
            <li>This works great.</li>
            <li>The Remington WDF-3600 was a great price of $9.17.</li>
            <li>she is very happy, more like the ones made years ago with a lot of oomph rather than the ones these days that have a replaceable batter that never lasts....</li>
            <li>For an electric shaver it does a good job.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything good about this razor.  </li>
            <li>It was a good razor for me.</li>
            <li>I also get good results.&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn</li>
            <li>Granted, the shave takes a bit longer, but it still does a good job.</li>
            <li>Gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li>but I have always loved Remington shavers with no problems.</li>
            <li>why oh why don&#x27;t they make good razors for women?</li>
            <li>good value for price</li>
            <li>I loved that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button clicked all the way on and off</li>
            <li>it was not working it was a good looking shaver</li>
            <li>The shaver was a good value and was well made.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not as good as my wdf-3000 one; it doesn&#x27;t have the adjustable front clipper like the wdf-3000</li>
            <li>so I guess this is good! :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased to find it so durable and resistant.</li>
            <li>I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>love its cut and it stays charged for each use!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is advertised to do, and the attachments are great, too!  </li>
            <li>but it sure is easier than balancing on one leg in my shower!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It would also be nice if packaging mentioned this unit is not intended for anywhere but legs.  </li>
            <li>I really love this shaver a good buy.</li>
            <li>has provided the closest shave I have had since I stopped using the disposable kind.</li>
            <li>Nice to not have to use any pressure</li>
            <li>a favor...go out &amp; buy one of these in a nice department store.</li>
            <li>Even a carry case would have been nice.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always liked it.</li>
            <li>Before I was able to do my own research, my BF purchased the Remington WDF-3600 for me.</li>
            <li>and this by far is one of the best electric razors I have ever used</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my legs felt great</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>absolutely* silky smooth, but very good.</li>
            <li>The 1 star reviews on Amazon are accurate!</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be used while it&#x27;s plugged in, and it won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to switch to an electric shaver in order to minimize the breaking out</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have never been able to do my underarms with an electric razor, this one included.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>OK turn on razor, doesn&#x27;t turn on</li>
            <li>OK shave the legs time,</li>
            <li>Love it and didn&#x27;t want anything more advance, just this again.</li>
            <li>The one I had before this one was not cordless but had been in use for decades (it belonged to my grandmother) and still did a great job - really regretting having thrown it away just for the &amp;#34;convenience&amp;#34; of a cordless,</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use it in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Operated Women&#x27;s Shaver]] as it is a much better product, it just isn&#x27;t rechargable.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this latest model either.</li>
            <li>The charge time is low and the bikini attachment is great!</li>
            <li>When I used this product I was pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have used one of these shavers for many years.</li>
            <li>Probably one of my most regrettable purchases.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave!  </li>
            <li>So it cost me more to return it</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I hope this one lasts many more years.</li>
            <li>, I absolutely love it...</li>
            <li>I slipped and dropped to the floor from about one foot and broke the top piece off.</li>
            <li>I had one of these about 6 years ago and it was built much better.</li>
            <li>The battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Shaver has a nice easy to handle shape and does a more than adequate job or removing hair painlessly.</li>
            <li>I like the shape it makes the shaver easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and charge.</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>Its so easy to find items that fit all your needs.</li>
            <li>Received quickly; just in time for our vacation!</li>
            <li>It leaves your legs very smooth, no sutbles, you must hold the shaver at the right angle.</li>
            <li>In order to get a smooth shave, I have to hold it at one angle to utilize the cutters for the longer hair and then another angle to utilize the foil to get the smooth shave I desire.</li>
            <li>Trying to use this Remington, I have had to shave everyday,which I wouldn&#x27;t mind if I could have smooth legs.</li>
            <li>This shaver does make my legs LOOK smooth and hair free.  </li>
            <li>Today, when I tried to charge it, the light acted like it was charging, but it won&#x27;t turn on at all now.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I am a repeat customer for the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver and appreciate that the quality has not changed.  </li>
            <li>B000BH3CGQ Remington WDF1250SS Smooth &amp; Silky Battery</li>
            <li>I go back to the Panasonic happily.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky wdf-1600in August 2010 and had to replace it.  </li>
            <li>The battery life isn&#x27;t that fabulous either.</li>
            <li>This one, maybe 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with a bikini trimmer for free.</li>
            <li>it is not going to be  razor smooth</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor to replace my 30+ year old Remington that I have loved.  </li>
            <li>great replacement for the old one and easier to use, cuts better and closer.replacement blades reasonable.</li>
            <li>Clean, close, smooth shave, no muss, no fuss.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.....</li>
            <li>Works great and holds a charge for a long time</li>
            <li>When my first one stopped working (I dropped it one too many times)</li>
            <li>We bought this second one because my wife like it and our grand daughter tried it and also liked it.</li>
            <li>does not give a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>At first, I loved this new shaver.  </li>
            <li>it is a great product and performs as expected.</li>
            <li>After three weeks, I returned it for a full refund.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Truth though, if I could more readily find replacement blades and foils for my wdf-3000</li>
            <li>It was actually pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give as clean a shave as the first Smooth &amp; Silky I had.</li>
            <li>I was hoping they were still making these and happy to find them at Amazon for much less for I paid for my original.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product, because it has been a quick loss of forty dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, even after charging overnight, I&#x27;m lucky if I get a minute.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for an adequate amount of time.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a good one for long time, found it</li>
            <li>OK 24 hours have passed and I&#x27;m looking forward to using my new razor...</li>
            <li>It just works better for me to buy a new one of these every couple of years.</li>
            <li>Aside from the battery draining quickly, the Remington did not seem to be as powerful</li>
            <li>Of course, the closest shave you&#x27;ll get is with a regular razor, but the Panasonic was pretty good.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did not throw out my old Remington WDF 5500 yet!</li>
            <li>Really!?!</li>
            <li>but it is pretty close!</li>
            <li>well it&#x27;s easy to use, and it&#x27;s ok to use if you are only looking for the \\&quot;illusion\\&quot; of shaved legs, but it does NOT give a close shave.</li>
            <li>Very smooth against skin, and not too loud.</li>
            <li>It comes with a little cleaning brush which is great.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old shaver.</li>
            <li>It was the only one she could find that she liked.</li>
            <li>As far as electric shavers go, this one gives a smooth shave!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s not been that good of an experience.</li>
            <li>Other wise I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone seeking an eco-alternative to disposables.</li>
            <li>Most electric shavers do not give you as close a shave as a razor or cream, but this razor gives an even less close shave than most electric shavers.</li>
            <li>I have been using electric shavers for many, many years on my underarms only because they&#x27;re too sensitive for razors and no matter what the product info says electric shavers do not shave as close as razors on your legs</li>
            <li>okay but takes long time to get a good closes have when hairs isn&#x27;t very long.</li>
            <li>And always smooth enough that my legs look completely smooth in shorts and skirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is as good as my previous Remington.</li>
            <li>I think I will buy replacement blades for my old one- which gives a much BETTER shave than this new one!  </li>
            <li>This is a cheap imitation of a better model.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to other types of hair removal, and you care more about smooth Looking legs than smooth Feeling legs, by all means, go with this product.  </li>
            <li>A regular razor works better</li>
            <li>To top it off, when calling Remington to check on the cost of replacing the foil/cutters, the price plus shipping would equal 90% of the cost of the shaver.  </li>
            <li>My first use, I shaved under my arms and my legs.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with that Remington shaver until it finally died on me.</li>
            <li>Living in Florida, my legs are exposed more often than not, so when I was using a regular blade razor, I shaved my legs every 2 or even 3 days.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I ended up having to go back with a razor to make sure nothing was missed.  </li>
            <li>Ugghhh I never buy anything without first reading reviews.</li>
            <li>I saw that it had a moisturizing strip and my first thought was,</li>
            <li>First charge takes 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I returned the shaver and hope to get a replacement, as my last one lasted many years.  </li>
            <li>if you are interested in a Remington Shaver go with a higher number (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this one for several months and am thoroughly pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Be aware: this is not for use on underarms.</li>
            <li>Rated it 4 stars because first one came with a plastic cover that clips over the shaving head</li>
            <li>I read the reviews first</li>
            <li>I came online to look for replacement Screens &amp; Cutters for this shaver to see if it was available cheaper than directly from Remington.  </li>
            <li>Exactly like the one I used to have.</li>
            <li>Leaving her legs soft and hair free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works fairly well on the bikini area; to be honest, I&#x27;ve never found anything that works quite as well as I&#x27;d like down there, short of making so many multiple passes with a disposable razor that I can barely walk.</li>
            <li>Not quite smooth enough for The First Date, but definitely smooth enough for the 2nd or 3rd date, lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for many years and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>and I am loving the little mini one, MPT-3000, that came with it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a close shave, in a short amount of time, for the right price and works like it is supposed too!!</li>
            <li>After a fantastic experience with a Panasonic electric shaver that lasted 10 years, it finally died.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave; it&#x27;s just so-so for when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>Smooth legs just aren&#x27;t possible with this product.</li>
            <li>But I had to go over and over and over the same areas just to get to the point where my legs Looked smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is a A very noisy shaver; i dont like it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to any woman wanting a closer shave!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;floating\\&quot; head shavers and found them very inferior to this remington.</li>
            <li>in fact, it cuts my skin so much under my arms that I just use a disposable razor for that job.</li>
            <li>I contacted Discounts Jungle and Sam was very helpful.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely devoted to - it served me well for about 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it cheaper to just replace the whole thing, rather than to buy the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>, wouldn&#x27;t shave as closely, had to shave over the same spot several times to be effective.   </li>
            <li>It was super easy to use and worked easily over my knees, behind my knees, ankle bones....  </li>
            <li>and so getting the longer hairs on my legs requires more passes with the shaver whereas with my old one needed only one or two.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and shaving with a razor is pretty much out of the question.</li>
            <li>She continued using the original &amp; it didn&#x27;t take but about 10-12 months &amp; the foil started to come apart, causing the same scratching of the skin as others have reported</li>
            <li>I ended up taking them all back to the store and getting on Amazon to buy my original one.  </li>
            <li>However, I find that this one sometimes leaves me with more red and bumps than using a regular razor.</li>
            <li>I would NOT buy this particular model again.</li>
            <li>This shaver seems to do a decent job shaving; however, it came without a protective head guard, a cleaning brush, or a carrying pouch.  </li>
            <li>It never shaved as closely as an older Remington</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that it didn&#x27;t come with a protective head or a cleaning brush, items that came with my older shaver.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very smooth feel on legs, under arms, and other sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure all of those are more dangerous than an electric razor.</li>
            <li>High.</li>
            <li>, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>After the initial 24 hour charge, the first time she used it the rubber between the trimmer blades shredded!</li>
            <li>Bought this on a whim, wanted to have something that would be quick, easy, and wouldn&#x27;t tear my very sensitive skin up on a daily basis like conventional razors do.</li>
            <li>It charged quickly and lasted as long as I needed it.</li>
            <li>My metal foil on this razor broke within a few months--and my hair is not very thick,  I bought the replacement blade/foils for this shaver, and againg the \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; metal foil  torn across the top, which I didnt realize until it cut me.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new one, so I went to Walmart.</li>
            <li>So I get my new purchase home and start reading the directions.</li>
            <li>My last Remington razor lasted me YEARS, worked wet/dry in the shower, held the charge much longer and could be used while plugged in AND offered a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>Less than pleased with the fact that it takes more than a day to charge it and the battery life doesn&#x27;t last long enough to finish both legs.</li>
            <li>My first Remington (in an aqua blue) needed new screens and blades.</li>
            <li>Time for a new one, and I want the exact same one!</li>
            <li>I had to go over the same areas to try to get a smooth shave; had to shave every day; and, the foils have worn/torn even though I am extremely careful to use a gentle pressure.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>But after the first time I cleaned it, per instructions, the head has never fully popped back in place.</li>
            <li>The battery pooped out today, but I&#x27;m ok with that, because I&#x27;ve used it A LOT over the past years.</li>
            <li>However I was out buying my husband a new electric hair trimmer and saw this razor near the trimmers; and I bought it on a whim.</li>
            <li>When I use this on my bikini area, I can still *feel* a slight stubble, but it *looks* smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true -- it left my underarms red and irritated.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try it anywhere other than legs, but it would be nice to have one shaver that works in other areas.  </li>
            <li>Luckily they still make what is essentially the same shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver is incredibly loud.  </li>
            <li>This unit comes nowhere near a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Even then, I still felt like i had two or three day old stubble.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit big for that area, so sometimes some imaginative positioning and multiple tries are necessary to get all of the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>I tried once, and it really didn&#x27;t do anything; the hair under my arms was already fairly short, and this didn&#x27;t get any closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only purchased the razor a month or two ago, and have come to use it very infrequently.</li>
            <li>considering the cordless quit and my old one was still going.</li>
            <li>While granted I was hoping it would completely take away the need to use a disposable razor for the underarms and bikini area</li>
            <li>at least not that I&#x27;ve found with the many women&#x27;s electric razors I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>it was so loud even to him.  </li>
            <li>It is loud and needs to be charged often but does the job.</li>
            <li>It is extremely loud and scares the cats every time I turn it on.  </li>
            <li>Her old Remington was pooping out after about 16 years of use.</li>
            <li>After a few more trials of back and forth on and off the cord.</li>
            <li>get me wrong, it works and fairly well.</li>
            <li>Like many of the previous comments, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long.</li>
            <li>Came with a small tiny personal trimmer too, which was nice.  </li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Remington Shavers in the past, such as the WDF-1600 which gave a better, closer shave.</li>
            <li>I have purchased older versions of this model and this is definitely an improved version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the litle tiny ones before though, and they&#x27;re never powerful enough to do much good down there,</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I am not spending money every month and creating trash with the disposable replacements of other conventional shavers.  </li>
            <li>This little one is perfect to just shave them away, with no worries about cutting myself, either.</li>
            <li>I keep it plugged in to the wall outlet 24/7, which is the only way it keeps a charge long enough to quickly shave my legs.  </li>
            <li>But the real icing on the cake was when, similar to many others&#x27; comments, apparently the foils on the head had broken.  </li>
            <li>I am currently in the market for a new underarm shaver.</li>
            <li>She does have to go over &amp; over the same area to get a reasonably close shave, but she feels that&#x27;s the same with all shavers.</li>
            <li>When you plug it into the charger the light is a solid green, and does not change, at all, to let you know that it is fully charged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this razor a few times, but have yet to find a comfortable way to hold it.  </li>
            <li>Will never make a purchase like this without first checking how other customers rate the product.  </li>
            <li>Have liked previous Remington electric shavers; however, this one is a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li>I also find that it frequently allows me to \\&quot;miss spots\\&quot;, even after going over them several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is loud, but it&#x27;s the only one she&#x27;ll use.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Remington!&lt;br /&gt;gerard masters</li>
            <li>(interesting since the item was broken) and the $10.00 to ship it.  </li>
            <li>But after just a few months,  I began to have the same issues with this product as many of the other reviewers:  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor not quite 2 years ago and noticed that for at least the past 6-8 months, it was only good for about 2-1/2 shaves.  </li>
            <li>I guess the only upside has been that the batteries last considerably longer between chargings than the Conair she had before.</li>
            <li>It loses a full charge after about 4 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>I have had other electric razors and this particular model</li>
            <li>As a fan of electric razors, I can tell the good from the bad which is why I return to the Remington series.  </li>

            <li> I LOVE IT......FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> This one works wonderful.  </li>
            <li> and I find it works the best....</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver for your legs, it&#x27;s not meant to be used for your underarms.</li>
            <li> It burns my underarms and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job on the legs.  </li>
            <li> and I have been very satisfied with them all up until this one!</li>
            <li> The Shaver works great</li>
            <li> works great.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great shave.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> Price was great for the items.  </li>
            <li> Another great example of planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li> great shaver&lt;br /&gt;Discontinued so i ordered here</li>
            <li> Works great without water.</li>
            <li> This works great.</li>
            <li> The Remington WDF-3600 was a great price of $9.17.</li>
            <li> she is very happy, more like the ones made years ago with a lot of oomph rather than the ones these days that have a replaceable batter that never lasts....</li>
            <li> For an electric shaver it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything good about this razor.  </li>
            <li> It was a good razor for me.</li>
            <li> I also get good results.&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn</li>
            <li> Granted, the shave takes a bit longer, but it still does a good job.</li>
            <li> Gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li> but I have always loved Remington shavers with no problems.</li>
            <li> why oh why don&#x27;t they make good razors for women?</li>
            <li> good value for price</li>
            <li> I loved that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button clicked all the way on and off</li>
            <li> it was not working it was a good looking shaver</li>
            <li> The shaver was a good value and was well made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not as good as my wdf-3000 one; it doesn&#x27;t have the adjustable front clipper like the wdf-3000</li>
            <li> so I guess this is good! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased to find it so durable and resistant.</li>
            <li> I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> love its cut and it stays charged for each use!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is advertised to do, and the attachments are great, too!  </li>
            <li> but it sure is easier than balancing on one leg in my shower!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It would also be nice if packaging mentioned this unit is not intended for anywhere but legs.  </li>
            <li> I really love this shaver a good buy.</li>
            <li> has provided the closest shave I have had since I stopped using the disposable kind.</li>
            <li> Nice to not have to use any pressure</li>
            <li> a favor...go out &amp; buy one of these in a nice department store.</li>
            <li> Even a carry case would have been nice.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always liked it.</li>
            <li> Before I was able to do my own research, my BF purchased the Remington WDF-3600 for me.</li>
            <li> and this by far is one of the best electric razors I have ever used</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my legs felt great</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> absolutely* silky smooth, but very good.</li>
            <li> The 1 star reviews on Amazon are accurate!</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be used while it&#x27;s plugged in, and it won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to switch to an electric shaver in order to minimize the breaking out</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have never been able to do my underarms with an electric razor, this one included.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> OK turn on razor, doesn&#x27;t turn on</li>
            <li> OK shave the legs time,</li>
            <li> Love it and didn&#x27;t want anything more advance, just this again.</li>
            <li> The one I had before this one was not cordless but had been in use for decades (it belonged to my grandmother) and still did a great job - really regretting having thrown it away just for the &amp;#34;convenience&amp;#34; of a cordless,</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use it in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Operated Women&#x27;s Shaver]] as it is a much better product, it just isn&#x27;t rechargable.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this latest model either.</li>
            <li> The charge time is low and the bikini attachment is great!</li>
            <li> When I used this product I was pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have used one of these shavers for many years.</li>
            <li> Probably one of my most regrettable purchases.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave!  </li>
            <li> So it cost me more to return it</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I hope this one lasts many more years.</li>
            <li> , I absolutely love it...</li>
            <li> I slipped and dropped to the floor from about one foot and broke the top piece off.</li>
            <li> I had one of these about 6 years ago and it was built much better.</li>
            <li> The battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Shaver has a nice easy to handle shape and does a more than adequate job or removing hair painlessly.</li>
            <li> I like the shape it makes the shaver easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and charge.</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> Its so easy to find items that fit all your needs.</li>
            <li> Received quickly; just in time for our vacation!</li>
            <li> It leaves your legs very smooth, no sutbles, you must hold the shaver at the right angle.</li>
            <li> In order to get a smooth shave, I have to hold it at one angle to utilize the cutters for the longer hair and then another angle to utilize the foil to get the smooth shave I desire.</li>
            <li> Trying to use this Remington, I have had to shave everyday,which I wouldn&#x27;t mind if I could have smooth legs.</li>
            <li> This shaver does make my legs LOOK smooth and hair free.  </li>
            <li> Today, when I tried to charge it, the light acted like it was charging, but it won&#x27;t turn on at all now.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer for the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver and appreciate that the quality has not changed.  </li>
            <li> B000BH3CGQ Remington WDF1250SS Smooth &amp; Silky Battery</li>
            <li> I go back to the Panasonic happily.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky wdf-1600in August 2010 and had to replace it.  </li>
            <li> The battery life isn&#x27;t that fabulous either.</li>
            <li> This one, maybe 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with a bikini trimmer for free.</li>
            <li> it is not going to be  razor smooth</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace my 30+ year old Remington that I have loved.  </li>
            <li> great replacement for the old one and easier to use, cuts better and closer.replacement blades reasonable.</li>
            <li> Clean, close, smooth shave, no muss, no fuss.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.....</li>
            <li> Works great and holds a charge for a long time</li>
            <li> When my first one stopped working (I dropped it one too many times)</li>
            <li> We bought this second one because my wife like it and our grand daughter tried it and also liked it.</li>
            <li> does not give a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> At first, I loved this new shaver.  </li>
            <li> it is a great product and performs as expected.</li>
            <li> After three weeks, I returned it for a full refund.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Truth though, if I could more readily find replacement blades and foils for my wdf-3000</li>
            <li> It was actually pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give as clean a shave as the first Smooth &amp; Silky I had.</li>
            <li> I was hoping they were still making these and happy to find them at Amazon for much less for I paid for my original.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product, because it has been a quick loss of forty dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, even after charging overnight, I&#x27;m lucky if I get a minute.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for an adequate amount of time.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a good one for long time, found it</li>
            <li> OK 24 hours have passed and I&#x27;m looking forward to using my new razor...</li>
            <li> It just works better for me to buy a new one of these every couple of years.</li>
            <li> Aside from the battery draining quickly, the Remington did not seem to be as powerful</li>
            <li> Of course, the closest shave you&#x27;ll get is with a regular razor, but the Panasonic was pretty good.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did not throw out my old Remington WDF 5500 yet!</li>
            <li> Really!?!</li>
            <li> but it is pretty close!</li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s easy to use, and it&#x27;s ok to use if you are only looking for the \\&quot;illusion\\&quot; of shaved legs, but it does NOT give a close shave.</li>
            <li> Very smooth against skin, and not too loud.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little cleaning brush which is great.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old shaver.</li>
            <li> It was the only one she could find that she liked.</li>
            <li> As far as electric shavers go, this one gives a smooth shave!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s not been that good of an experience.</li>
            <li> Other wise I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone seeking an eco-alternative to disposables.</li>
            <li> Most electric shavers do not give you as close a shave as a razor or cream, but this razor gives an even less close shave than most electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for many, many years on my underarms only because they&#x27;re too sensitive for razors and no matter what the product info says electric shavers do not shave as close as razors on your legs</li>
            <li> okay but takes long time to get a good closes have when hairs isn&#x27;t very long.</li>
            <li> And always smooth enough that my legs look completely smooth in shorts and skirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is as good as my previous Remington.</li>
            <li> I think I will buy replacement blades for my old one- which gives a much BETTER shave than this new one!  </li>
            <li> This is a cheap imitation of a better model.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to other types of hair removal, and you care more about smooth Looking legs than smooth Feeling legs, by all means, go with this product.  </li>
            <li> A regular razor works better</li>
            <li> To top it off, when calling Remington to check on the cost of replacing the foil/cutters, the price plus shipping would equal 90% of the cost of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> My first use, I shaved under my arms and my legs.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with that Remington shaver until it finally died on me.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida, my legs are exposed more often than not, so when I was using a regular blade razor, I shaved my legs every 2 or even 3 days.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I ended up having to go back with a razor to make sure nothing was missed.  </li>
            <li> Ugghhh I never buy anything without first reading reviews.</li>
            <li> I saw that it had a moisturizing strip and my first thought was,</li>
            <li> First charge takes 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I returned the shaver and hope to get a replacement, as my last one lasted many years.  </li>
            <li> if you are interested in a Remington Shaver go with a higher number (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for several months and am thoroughly pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Be aware: this is not for use on underarms.</li>
            <li> Rated it 4 stars because first one came with a plastic cover that clips over the shaving head</li>
            <li> I read the reviews first</li>
            <li> I came online to look for replacement Screens &amp; Cutters for this shaver to see if it was available cheaper than directly from Remington.  </li>
            <li> Exactly like the one I used to have.</li>
            <li> Leaving her legs soft and hair free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works fairly well on the bikini area; to be honest, I&#x27;ve never found anything that works quite as well as I&#x27;d like down there, short of making so many multiple passes with a disposable razor that I can barely walk.</li>
            <li> Not quite smooth enough for The First Date, but definitely smooth enough for the 2nd or 3rd date, lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for many years and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and I am loving the little mini one, MPT-3000, that came with it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a close shave, in a short amount of time, for the right price and works like it is supposed too!!</li>
            <li> After a fantastic experience with a Panasonic electric shaver that lasted 10 years, it finally died.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave; it&#x27;s just so-so for when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> Smooth legs just aren&#x27;t possible with this product.</li>
            <li> But I had to go over and over and over the same areas just to get to the point where my legs Looked smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is a A very noisy shaver; i dont like it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to any woman wanting a closer shave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;floating\\&quot; head shavers and found them very inferior to this remington.</li>
            <li> in fact, it cuts my skin so much under my arms that I just use a disposable razor for that job.</li>
            <li> I contacted Discounts Jungle and Sam was very helpful.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely devoted to - it served me well for about 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it cheaper to just replace the whole thing, rather than to buy the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> , wouldn&#x27;t shave as closely, had to shave over the same spot several times to be effective.   </li>
            <li> It was super easy to use and worked easily over my knees, behind my knees, ankle bones....  </li>
            <li> and so getting the longer hairs on my legs requires more passes with the shaver whereas with my old one needed only one or two.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and shaving with a razor is pretty much out of the question.</li>
            <li> She continued using the original &amp; it didn&#x27;t take but about 10-12 months &amp; the foil started to come apart, causing the same scratching of the skin as others have reported</li>
            <li> I ended up taking them all back to the store and getting on Amazon to buy my original one.  </li>
            <li> However, I find that this one sometimes leaves me with more red and bumps than using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I would NOT buy this particular model again.</li>
            <li> This shaver seems to do a decent job shaving; however, it came without a protective head guard, a cleaning brush, or a carrying pouch.  </li>
            <li> It never shaved as closely as an older Remington</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it didn&#x27;t come with a protective head or a cleaning brush, items that came with my older shaver.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very smooth feel on legs, under arms, and other sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure all of those are more dangerous than an electric razor.</li>
            <li> High.</li>
            <li> , I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After the initial 24 hour charge, the first time she used it the rubber between the trimmer blades shredded!</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim, wanted to have something that would be quick, easy, and wouldn&#x27;t tear my very sensitive skin up on a daily basis like conventional razors do.</li>
            <li> It charged quickly and lasted as long as I needed it.</li>
            <li> My metal foil on this razor broke within a few months--and my hair is not very thick,  I bought the replacement blade/foils for this shaver, and againg the \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; metal foil  torn across the top, which I didnt realize until it cut me.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new one, so I went to Walmart.</li>
            <li> So I get my new purchase home and start reading the directions.</li>
            <li> My last Remington razor lasted me YEARS, worked wet/dry in the shower, held the charge much longer and could be used while plugged in AND offered a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Less than pleased with the fact that it takes more than a day to charge it and the battery life doesn&#x27;t last long enough to finish both legs.</li>
            <li> My first Remington (in an aqua blue) needed new screens and blades.</li>
            <li> Time for a new one, and I want the exact same one!</li>
            <li> I had to go over the same areas to try to get a smooth shave; had to shave every day; and, the foils have worn/torn even though I am extremely careful to use a gentle pressure.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> But after the first time I cleaned it, per instructions, the head has never fully popped back in place.</li>
            <li> The battery pooped out today, but I&#x27;m ok with that, because I&#x27;ve used it A LOT over the past years.</li>
            <li> However I was out buying my husband a new electric hair trimmer and saw this razor near the trimmers; and I bought it on a whim.</li>
            <li> When I use this on my bikini area, I can still *feel* a slight stubble, but it *looks* smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true -- it left my underarms red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try it anywhere other than legs, but it would be nice to have one shaver that works in other areas.  </li>
            <li> Luckily they still make what is essentially the same shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver is incredibly loud.  </li>
            <li> This unit comes nowhere near a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Even then, I still felt like i had two or three day old stubble.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit big for that area, so sometimes some imaginative positioning and multiple tries are necessary to get all of the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> I tried once, and it really didn&#x27;t do anything; the hair under my arms was already fairly short, and this didn&#x27;t get any closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only purchased the razor a month or two ago, and have come to use it very infrequently.</li>
            <li> considering the cordless quit and my old one was still going.</li>
            <li> While granted I was hoping it would completely take away the need to use a disposable razor for the underarms and bikini area</li>
            <li> at least not that I&#x27;ve found with the many women&#x27;s electric razors I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> it was so loud even to him.  </li>
            <li> It is loud and needs to be charged often but does the job.</li>
            <li> It is extremely loud and scares the cats every time I turn it on.  </li>
            <li> Her old Remington was pooping out after about 16 years of use.</li>
            <li> After a few more trials of back and forth on and off the cord.</li>
            <li> get me wrong, it works and fairly well.</li>
            <li> Like many of the previous comments, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long.</li>
            <li> Came with a small tiny personal trimmer too, which was nice.  </li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Remington Shavers in the past, such as the WDF-1600 which gave a better, closer shave.</li>
            <li> I have purchased older versions of this model and this is definitely an improved version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the litle tiny ones before though, and they&#x27;re never powerful enough to do much good down there,</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I am not spending money every month and creating trash with the disposable replacements of other conventional shavers.  </li>
            <li> This little one is perfect to just shave them away, with no worries about cutting myself, either.</li>
            <li> I keep it plugged in to the wall outlet 24/7, which is the only way it keeps a charge long enough to quickly shave my legs.  </li>
            <li> But the real icing on the cake was when, similar to many others&#x27; comments, apparently the foils on the head had broken.  </li>
            <li> I am currently in the market for a new underarm shaver.</li>
            <li> She does have to go over &amp; over the same area to get a reasonably close shave, but she feels that&#x27;s the same with all shavers.</li>
            <li> When you plug it into the charger the light is a solid green, and does not change, at all, to let you know that it is fully charged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this razor a few times, but have yet to find a comfortable way to hold it.  </li>
            <li> Will never make a purchase like this without first checking how other customers rate the product.  </li>
            <li> Have liked previous Remington electric shavers; however, this one is a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I also find that it frequently allows me to \\&quot;miss spots\\&quot;, even after going over them several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is loud, but it&#x27;s the only one she&#x27;ll use.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Remington!&lt;br /&gt;gerard masters</li>
            <li> (interesting since the item was broken) and the $10.00 to ship it.  </li>
            <li> But after just a few months,  I began to have the same issues with this product as many of the other reviewers:  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor not quite 2 years ago and noticed that for at least the past 6-8 months, it was only good for about 2-1/2 shaves.  </li>
            <li> I guess the only upside has been that the batteries last considerably longer between chargings than the Conair she had before.</li>
            <li> It loses a full charge after about 4 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> I have had other electric razors and this particular model</li>
            <li> As a fan of electric razors, I can tell the good from the bad which is why I return to the Remington series.  </li>
            <li> This is the same exact one, hard to find.  </li>
            <li> From the get-go it has frequently grabbed my skin and \\&quot;bitten\\&quot; me, despite the fact that I&#x27;m very careful.</li>
            <li> well how long can that last, especially if you use your razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This razor is long enough to reach the lower part of your leg, yet small enough to fit into small hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty clumsy</li>
            <li> I live at the beach and shave everyday.</li>
            <li> This one I bought not that long ago.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The shaver has lasted a long time though, and the blades have never been replaced, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for a long time....</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have any trouble at all using it dry with no lotion or anything.  </li>
            <li> Like some of the other raters, she didn&#x27;t find out until after opening the box &amp; reading the manual that it is NOT recommended for underarms, only for legs.</li>
            <li> It left razor burns under my arms which I have NEVER gotten before by any other razor.  </li>
            <li> I had this same model before and didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old one had gotten.  </li>
            <li> It does not hold a charge for very long.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge very long, couldn&#x27;t tell if it was fully charged or not</li>
            <li> Works well in both the shower and dry.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> Tired of the knicks, cuts, and subsequent scars on my legs, I really wanted an electric razor.</li>
            <li> My wife has dark, coarse leg hair.</li>
            <li> I had to run it up and down again and again and finally had to shave against the grain.</li>
            <li> Even against the grain, I had to run it up and down again and again and again over the same spot!</li>
            <li> But replacing the blades in them just doesn&#x27;t seem to be cost efficient, especially since the motor slows down with age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it wet, dry, with shaving lotions, and without --  </li>
            <li> In less than one month, the blue rubber \\&quot;moisture stip\\&quot; tore.  </li>
            <li> This is the 3rd or 4th Remington Electric Razor I have purchased over the past several years</li>
            <li> It seems like a waste, but the motor only lasts just so long.</li>
            <li> But it works nicely, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the Remington did not give me a close shave at all, but left much more stubble than expected.</li>
            <li> Inconvenient, but for what I paid I&#x27;m perfectly fine with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have the most painful, stinging razor burn on my legs now.</li>
            <li> I literally leaves scrape marks on my legs and forget a even remotely close shave.</li>
            <li> Rough on the skin</li>
            <li> I have bought a few different electric razors</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is not knowing HOW long you should charge the shaver - there is no indication of it being fully charged.</li>
            <li> Plus, it can&#x27;t be used in the shower like other brands can.  </li>
            <li> I found the detail trimmer included in this package to be pretty useless.    </li>
            <li> I have only owned one other electric razor in the past, and I remembered it working</li>
            <li> Other than that it</li>
            <li> The shaver left small cuts in some places in addition to the scrapes/scratches in others.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington for over 20 years and this is the first razor that I would rate as useless.   </li>
            <li> I have found all these reviews extremely helpful as all the problems I&#x27;ve been experiencing with the unit,</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other people say they would</li>
            <li> Other shavers have cost us anywhere from $35 to $65.</li>
            <li> Hint to those who don&#x27;t use one but would like to try it, the harder you press down on an electric razor the less hair it will remove.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is there was no case to store the razor when not in use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE this product a lot after I had been using it for more than three months.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to hold it down.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine, but the charge didn&#x27;t last long and you cannot use it while it is plugged in (very stupid design).</li>
            <li> Looking less desirable now.</li>
            <li> So it did the initial shave + 1 leg, on 1 charge, this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Previously owned Remington shavers that I have had have had a rubber coating where you would grip the razor.  </li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I used the Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver (cost half the price) for about 3 years before the battery died.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously had a Remington</li>
            <li> I began to shave away, and now have big, red (and uncomfortable) scratches on my leg.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if the reviews were written by inexperienced users or what..</li>
            <li> I felt a sharp sting and realized that the \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; metal foil is torn across, and not from excessive use or force either.</li>
            <li> It comes with a separate little instrument for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge, unlike other Remington and Panasonic electric razors she has tried in the past.</li>
            <li> because I hated this one, but because if I&#x27;ve got to drop some money anyway, I&#x27;d like to see if I can do a little better.</li>
            <li> It does not feel smooth at all on your skin and the worst part is that even after you charge it, it does not last through one shave.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve actually dropped this poor razor</li>
            <li> This lasted me a few years before the foil part broke and became unusable.  </li>
            <li> Instead of going through all that trouble</li>
            <li> but after a few uses it wont power on&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely dead.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but it does a poor job at getting a close shave and an even worse job on my underarms -</li>
            <li> I was not pleased to find out in the instructions that this shaver is not recommended for underarms --</li>
            <li> Needless to say, we&#x27;re not replacing this part just purchasing a different brand - one with a 4-5* review.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have it a two instead of a one because with patiences you can shave your legs with it, you just have to re-do the small sections it misses.</li>
            <li> Maybe it should be kept plugged in at all times - waste!  </li>
            <li> After the 24 hours of pre-charging the batteries, I was anxious to try this one.  </li>
            <li> The small rubber strips on the clipper part</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about; it drags on the skin and catches on imperfections like scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for the past three years.  </li>
            <li> As mention in other reviews, even worse on underarms/bikini area.</li>
            <li> I got a SUPER painful razor burn and a cut!</li>
            <li> Bought for my Mom, who wanted something easier to hold with enough batter power and cutting power ....</li>
            <li> The wife hasn&#x27;t complained so</li>
            <li> If I could give this shaver negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> seem to be common.  </li>
            <li> and she hasn&#x27;t complained</li>
            <li> have to go over my legs a few time because it leaves hair behind.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little difficult to plug the charging cord into the shaver.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is its not sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> but my underarms were red and painful for three days.</li>
            <li> Works as well if not better than all the expensive razors I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> WORSE, though, is when I shaved under my arms.</li>
            <li> This piece of crap is going back to Walmart!</li>
            <li> It produces a close shave without irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li> I received the product and it was broken.  </li>
            <li> I have used nothing but electric razers for 20 years, and this, by far is the worst one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> How dumb is that!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this I read all the reviews and I am not sure why they were so bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed not with the actual shaving but with the lack of the razor to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I, unfortunately, returned this item and will look for a unit that provides a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I am finding it to be difficult to hold as it seems slippery in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m done with this baby, and won&#x27;t be buying a Remington product again.</li>
            <li> Another weird quirk is that you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mediocre shaver and it&#x27;s not at all durable.</li>
            <li> Performance is bad, will work as it is supposed to, I guess, just not very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Useless thing!</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> Now I have an expensive razor that needs to go to the trash bin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of their very expensive models.</li>
            <li> Even though they were bad I ordered this anyway</li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for summer and was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Never been disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointing for what it cost...and embarrassing,  </li>
            <li> but since I hate to use a razor</li>
            <li> My legs HATE razor blades, nair, and waxing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had another razor this terrible.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this razor!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received quickly; just in time for our vacation! Very smooth against skin, and not too loud. Much better than my old shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for many, many years on my underarms only because they&#x27;re too sensitive for razors and no matter what the product info says electric shavers do not shave as close as razors on your legs so it was razors for legs; shavers for underarms.  I was not pleased to find out in the instructions that this shaver is not recommended for underarms -- the only reason I bought it!  It&#x27;s true -- it left my underarms red and irritated.  So now I have to buy another shaver.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> I like the shape it makes the shaver easy to hold.  For an electric shaver it does a good job. A regular razor works better but since I hate to use a razor I&#x27;m very happy with the results of the electric shaver.</li>
            <li> We bought this shaver for my wife about 2 years ago. It was the only one she could find that she liked. Like some of the other raters, she didn&#x27;t find out until after opening the box &amp; reading the manual that it is NOT recommended for underarms, only for legs. How dumb is that! After the initial 24 hour charge, the first time she used it the rubber between the trimmer blades shredded! To Remington&#x27;s credit, they replaced the entire shaver!! Other than that, it&#x27;s not been that good of an experience. She continued using the original &amp; it didn&#x27;t take but about 10-12 months &amp; the foil started to come apart, causing the same scratching of the skin as others have reported, so they needed replacing (by the way, I&#x27;ve encountered the same problem with men&#x27;s foil shavers, too! so I use only rotary shavers now.) She does have to go over &amp; over the same area to get a reasonably close shave, but she feels that&#x27;s the same with all shavers. I guess the only upside has been that the batteries last considerably longer between chargings than the Conair she had before.</li>
            <li> My husband purchsed this shaver for me about 8 months ago.  He didn&#x27;t check customer reviews prior to making the purchase. Have liked previous Remington electric shavers; however, this one is a huge disappointment.  I had to go over the same areas to try to get a smooth shave; had to shave every day; and, the foils have worn/torn even though I am extremely careful to use a gentle pressure.  To top it off, when calling Remington to check on the cost of replacing the foil/cutters, the price plus shipping would equal 90% of the cost of the shaver.  Needless to say, we&#x27;re not replacing this part just purchasing a different brand - one with a 4-5* review. Will never make a purchase like this without first checking how other customers rate the product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and shaving with a razor is pretty much out of the question. I bought this shaver because of the hyperallergenic features. The first time I used it my legs felt great but my underarms were red and painful for three days. I read the instructions only to find that it is not recommended for use on any area of the body except legs. I am currently in the market for a new underarm shaver.</li>
            <li> After a fantastic experience with a Panasonic electric shaver that lasted 10 years, it finally died. I needed a new one, so I went to Walmart. They only have two women&#x27;s shavers by Remington. I made the mistake of buying this one before checking Amazon for reviews. My first use, I shaved under my arms and my legs. The thing would not cut 1/8inch leg hairs! I had to run it up and down again and again and finally had to shave against the grain. Even against the grain, I had to run it up and down again and again and again over the same spot! Useless thing! WORSE, though, is when I shaved under my arms. I got a SUPER painful razor burn and a cut! I have never ever ever had razor burn or been cut by an electric shaver before. This piece of crap is going back to Walmart! JUNK!!! The 1 star reviews on Amazon are accurate!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything good about this razor.  It doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave; it&#x27;s just so-so for when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  It can&#x27;t be used while it&#x27;s plugged in, and it won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a couple of uses.  Plus, it can&#x27;t be used in the shower like other brands can.  The only reason I have one is because my boyfriend bought it as a gift for my birthday. I wish he hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Prior to owning this shaver, I owned another Remington electric shaver. I was satisfied with that Remington shaver until it finally died on me. This one I bought not that long ago. In order to get a smooth shave, I have to hold it at one angle to utilize the cutters for the longer hair and then another angle to utilize the foil to get the smooth shave I desire. Now however the foil is tearing apart. I was hoping to be able to switch to an electric shaver in order to minimize the breaking out I get on my legs from shaving. However, I find that this one sometimes leaves me with more red and bumps than using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Tired of the knicks, cuts, and subsequent scars on my legs, I really wanted an electric razor. Before I was able to do my own research, my BF purchased the Remington WDF-3600 for me. This will go under the - \\&quot;It&#x27;s the thought that counts\\&quot; category.  I am SO disappointed with this product. Living in Florida, my legs are exposed more often than not, so when I was using a regular blade razor, I shaved my legs every 2 or even 3 days. Trying to use this Remington, I have had to shave everyday,which I wouldn&#x27;t mind if I could have smooth legs. I am taking a lot of time to go over and over my legs.  I&#x27;ve tried every direction - I&#x27;ve tried using it wet, dry, with shaving lotions, and without --  but I still can&#x27;t get legs that I would let anyone touch - even immediately after I have shaved them! Smooth legs just aren&#x27;t possible with this product.</li>
            <li> I did it! I got the guts to try it! It was actually pretty easy. It didn&#x27;t hurt one bit. I can do the under legs without thinking that I&#x27;m going to skin a layer of skin off. Yeah me!!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver on a whim while at a target store.  My legs HATE razor blades, nair, and waxing.  But I&#x27;d never tried an electric shaver before now.    PROS  *This unit did not hurt my legs at All.  No irritation, no redness, no cuts, no burns.  *This shaver does make my legs LOOK smooth and hair free.  *Remington has a \\&quot;30 day money back guarantee\\&quot; on this product.  After three weeks, I returned it for a full refund.    CONS  *This shaver is incredibly loud.  My neighbor across the hall can hear it.  I don&#x27;t know why I find it embarrassing, but I do.  *Instructions recommend using this shaver Only on legs, not underarms, bikini, etc.  I didn&#x27;t try it anywhere other than legs, but it would be nice to have one shaver that works in other areas.  It would also be nice if packaging mentioned this unit is not intended for anywhere but legs.  I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it in the first place.  *This unit comes nowhere near a close shave.  I know electric shavers will never provide as close a shave as razor blades.  But I had to go over and over and over the same areas just to get to the point where my legs Looked smooth.  Even then, I still felt like i had two or three day old stubble.  *I found the detail trimmer included in this package to be pretty useless.    OVERALL  If you&#x27;re sensitive to other types of hair removal, and you care more about smooth Looking legs than smooth Feeling legs, by all means, go with this product.  I, unfortunately, returned this item and will look for a unit that provides a closer shave.</li>
            <li> This razor does not work as well as it claims.  Yes it will remove some hairs on your leg after you&#x27;ve rubbed it over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over the same spot numerous times.  It doesn&#x27;t make a very smooth shave.  I ended up having to go back with a razor to make sure nothing was missed.  It left razor burns under my arms which I have NEVER gotten before by any other razor.  It does not hold a charge for very long.  It was loosing the charge before I was even finished shaving my legs.  I&#x27;m going to give this away &amp; I&#x27;ve orderd an Epilator.  I&#x27;m hoping this does the trick.</li>
            <li> It does not feel smooth at all on your skin and the worst part is that even after you charge it, it does not last through one shave. I&#x27;m very disappointed..</li>
            <li> This razor lasted for a year. Today, when I tried to charge it, the light acted like it was charging, but it won&#x27;t turn on at all now. There was no accident, I didn&#x27;t drop it, it just died. Inconvenient, but for what I paid I&#x27;m perfectly fine with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gave the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten on my legs with an electric razor; not *absolutely* silky smooth, but very good. Not quite smooth enough for The First Date, but definitely smooth enough for the 2nd or 3rd date, lol. And always smooth enough that my legs look completely smooth in shorts and skirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works fairly well on the bikini area; to be honest, I&#x27;ve never found anything that works quite as well as I&#x27;d like down there, short of making so many multiple passes with a disposable razor that I can barely walk. When I use this on my bikini area, I can still *feel* a slight stubble, but it *looks* smooth. It&#x27;s a bit big for that area, so sometimes some imaginative positioning and multiple tries are necessary to get all of the nooks and crannies. I&#x27;ve used the litle tiny ones before though, and they&#x27;re never powerful enough to do much good down there, so I don&#x27;t mind this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to do my underarms with an electric razor, this one included. I tried once, and it really didn&#x27;t do anything; the hair under my arms was already fairly short, and this didn&#x27;t get any closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m shopping for a different razor today, not because I hated this one, but because if I&#x27;ve got to drop some money anyway, I&#x27;d like to see if I can do a little better.</li>
            <li> Ugghhh I never buy anything without first reading reviews. However I was out buying my husband a new electric hair trimmer and saw this razor near the trimmers; and I bought it on a whim. I saw that it had a moisturizing strip and my first thought was, well how long can that last, especially if you use your razor in the shower.  So I get my new purchase home and start reading the directions. First charge takes 24 hours. Well darn, cannot use it until tomorrow evening...ok. Kept reading, recommended only for legs...are you kidding me...then why does it come with a bikini trimmer, and why can&#x27;t I use it on my underarms? Looking less desirable now. OK 24 hours have passed and I&#x27;m looking forward to using my new razor...on my legs only. OK turn on razor, doesn&#x27;t turn on, I don&#x27;t understand. I unplug the unit from the charger and hit the button and then it works. After a few more trials of back and forth on and off the cord. I see that it will not operate on the cord. I do not like this feature, it should work on or off the cord. OK shave the legs time, well it&#x27;s easy to use, and it&#x27;s ok to use if you are only looking for the \\&quot;illusion\\&quot; of shaved legs, but it does NOT give a close shave. Most electric shavers do not give you as close a shave as a razor or cream, but this razor gives an even less close shave than most electric shavers. I have been a fan of Remington Shavers in the past, such as the WDF-1600 which gave a better, closer shave. Went to use the shaver again for the second time and only got 1 leg shaved. The charge is already gone. So it did the initial shave + 1 leg, on 1 charge, this is ridiculous. And I went online tonight to find out how you know when your razor is charged. There is no way to tell when your razor is fully charged. When you plug it into the charger the light is a solid green, and does not change, at all, to let you know that it is fully charged. I would NOT buy this particular model again.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver for your legs, it&#x27;s not meant to be used for your underarms. It leaves your legs very smooth, no sutbles, you must hold the shaver at the right angle.</li>
            <li> The Shaver works great and I am loving the little mini one, MPT-3000, that came with it.  I was plucking the hairs at the entrance to my nose (I am blushing).  This little one is perfect to just shave them away, with no worries about cutting myself, either.</li>
            <li> I have suffered through owning this razor the entire time I&#x27;ve had it. From the get-go it has frequently grabbed my skin and \\&quot;bitten\\&quot; me, despite the fact that I&#x27;m very careful. I&#x27;ve followed the instruction manual. I&#x27;ve never had another razor this terrible.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor hoping to avoid the hassle of \\&quot;real\\&quot; razors, and all the burn they leave. I have only owned one other electric razor in the past, and I remembered it working quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was disappointed that the Remington did not give me a close shave at all, but left much more stubble than expected. I also find that it frequently allows me to \\&quot;miss spots\\&quot;, even after going over them several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only purchased the razor a month or two ago, and have come to use it very infrequently. Today though, when I attempted to use the Remington I felt a sharp sting and realized that the \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; metal foil is torn across, and not from excessive use or force either. I would not recommend this product, because it has been a quick loss of forty dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the noise level? High.</li>
            <li> This is a A very noisy shaver; i dont like it.  this machine, irritates my skin.  Esta es una rasuradora que hace un tremendo ruido y no corta como se debe, irrita la piel</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver i&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend it to any woman wanting a closer shave! I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;floating\\&quot; head shavers and found them very inferior to this remington.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but it does a poor job at getting a close shave and an even worse job on my underarms - in fact, it cuts my skin so much under my arms that I just use a disposable razor for that job. Not the one I would recommend. Sorry!</li>
            <li> Bought for my Mom, who wanted something easier to hold with enough batter power and cutting power ....she is very happy, more like the ones made years ago with a lot of oomph rather than the ones these days that have a replaceable batter that never lasts....this one is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement that keeps my wife&#x27;s razor going on and on.</li>
            <li> My metal foil on this razor broke within a few months--and my hair is not very thick,  I bought the replacement blade/foils for this shaver, and againg the \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; metal foil  torn across the top, which I didnt realize until it cut me.  Also, I cannot use this razer for my underarms. I have used nothing but electric razers for 20 years, and this, by far is the worst one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to go over my legs a few time because it leaves hair behind. I have it a two instead of a one because with patiences you can shave your legs with it, you just have to re-do the small sections it misses.</li>
            <li> This razor is long enough to reach the lower part of your leg, yet small enough to fit into small hands.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great!&lt;br /&gt;I love its cut and it stays charged for each use! I recommend the Remington shavers to everyone, they are the best!</li>
            <li> In less than one month, the blue rubber \\&quot;moisture stip\\&quot; tore.  I contacted Discounts Jungle and Sam was very helpful. I returned the shaver and hope to get a replacement, as my last one lasted many years.  Note that this shaver does not come with a cover nor with a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price. I have purchased older versions of this model and this is definitely an improved version. The charge lasts a long time.  It produces a close shave without irritating the skin.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Shaver has a nice easy to handle shape and does a more than adequate job or removing hair painlessly. I would buy this product again..</li>
            <li> works great.  I&#x27;ve had this for many years and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Works great and holds a charge for a long time but it&#x27;s a little difficult to plug the charging cord into the shaver.  Other than that it&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver a good buy. The only bad thing is its not sold in stores anymore. I WILL RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYBODY</li>
            <li> Works as well if not better than all the expensive razors I&#x27;ve tried. Easy to clean. Great shave. Great price.</li>
            <li> This shaver seems to do a decent job shaving; however, it came without a protective head guard, a cleaning brush, or a carrying pouch.  I am finding it to be difficult to hold as it seems slippery in my hand.  Previously owned Remington shavers that I have had have had a rubber coating where you would grip the razor.  This one does not.  I&#x27;ve only used this razor a few times, but have yet to find a comfortable way to hold it.  I have been using Remington electric razors now since 1967 (46 years).</li>
            <li> okay but takes long time to get a good closes have when hairs isn&#x27;t very long. not the best Remington.</li>
            <li> Had one just like it for years.  This is the same exact one, hard to find.  Love it and didn&#x27;t want anything more advance, just this again.</li>
            <li> I was hoping they were still making these and happy to find them at Amazon for much less for I paid for my original.</li>
            <li> It was a good razor for me. I only used it on my legs or as a trimmer and it did the trick, although sometimes snagged when trimming. It charged quickly and lasted as long as I needed it. I always kept it in the charge bed between uses so I could just pick it up whenever I needed it. It comes with a little cleaning brush which is great. Works well in both the shower and dry. All that being said, after 4 years of use, it died on me last month. The one I had before this one was not cordless but had been in use for decades (it belonged to my grandmother) and still did a great job - really regretting having thrown it away just for the &amp;#34;convenience&amp;#34; of a cordless, considering the cordless quit and my old one was still going.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I used the Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver (cost half the price) for about 3 years before the battery died.  This Remington lasted about a year before the battery started draining immediately.  Perhaps this can be replaced, but I did not look into it as the quality of the razor was inferior to the Panasonic that I had used prior to the Remington.  Aside from the battery draining quickly, the Remington did not seem to be as powerful and I could not get as close of a shave as I could with the Panasonic.  Of course, the closest shave you&#x27;ll get is with a regular razor, but the Panasonic was pretty good.      I ended up buying another Panasonic wet/dry for about $20 and will not buy another Remington product.</li>
            <li> As a Eco-conscious person I purchased this product from another source and it included a personal trimmer.  Price was great for the items.  The instructions does state that this shaver should not be used on under-arms.  I love the fact that I am not spending money every month and creating trash with the disposable replacements of other conventional shavers.  Will purchase again if mine needs replacing.  The only complaint that I have is not knowing HOW long you should charge the shaver - there is no indication of it being fully charged. Other wise I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone seeking an eco-alternative to disposables.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer for the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver and appreciate that the quality has not changed.  I also get good results.&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn</li>
            <li> This shaver left my legs torn up. I have the most painful, stinging razor burn on my legs now. And I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this razor! This is the 3rd or 4th Remington Electric Razor I have purchased over the past several years and I have been very satisfied with them all up until this one! I&#x27;m glad I did not throw out my old Remington WDF 5500 yet! I think I will buy replacement blades for my old one- which gives a much BETTER shave than this new one!  My advice- if you are interested in a Remington Shaver go with a higher number (ie WDF 5500 or WDF 7000) verses the lower number like the WDF 3600!</li>
            <li> I never owned an electric razor before. I&#x27;ve had this one for several months and am thoroughly pleased with it. It leaves a very smooth feel on legs, under arms, and other sensitive areas. I love this product. It is durable and resistant. I love that I can use it in or out of the shower. The battery life is pretty good. I&#x27;m pretty clumsy and I&#x27;ve actually dropped this poor razor a bunch of times in the shower. I&#x27;ve been very pleased to find it so durable and resistant. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace my 30+ year old Remington that I have loved.  What a mistake!  It burns my underarms and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job on the legs.  Now I have an expensive razor that needs to go to the trash bin!</li>
            <li> The wife hasn&#x27;t complained so I guess it works to her satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Be aware: this is not for use on underarms. (I was also underwhelmed by its performance on my legs.)</li>
            <li> Rated it 4 stars because first one came with a plastic cover that clips over the shaving head but this one did not.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise would be a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever owned...had one before this that lasted ten years.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for over a year and just am now changing the \\&quot;blades.\\&quot; Granted, the shave takes a bit longer, but it still does a good job. I have had other electric razors and this particular model has provided the closest shave I have had since I stopped using the disposable kind. While granted I was hoping it would completely take away the need to use a disposable razor for the underarms and bikini area, this does not do that (the description I believe even says legs only). If I had to make the purchase over again, I would buy this razor.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve never written an online review before, but feel compelled to write this to prevent others from having a similar experience.  I&#x27;d previously had a Remington I was absolutely devoted to - it served me well for about 20 years.  So of course, when it was time to replace it, I went with a Remington.  At first, I loved this new shaver.  But after just a few months,  I began to have the same issues with this product as many of the other reviewers:  wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge very long, couldn&#x27;t tell if it was fully charged or not, wouldn&#x27;t shave as closely, had to shave over the same spot several times to be effective.   But the real icing on the cake was when, similar to many others&#x27; comments, apparently the foils on the head had broken.  I began to shave away, and now have big, red (and uncomfortable) scratches on my leg.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m done with this baby, and won&#x27;t be buying a Remington product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace one like it that I wore out. It lasted a couple of years. Gives a good close shave. I&#x27;ve found it cheaper to just replace the whole thing, rather than to buy the replacement blades. It seems like a waste, but the motor only lasts just so long. I&#x27;ve had several different razors over the years. The really expensive ones don&#x27;t seem to last any better than the cheaper ones, at least not that I&#x27;ve found with the many women&#x27;s electric razors I&#x27;ve tried. This is actually the third one of these I&#x27;ve purchased. I have to replace it every couple of years or so. But it works nicely, wet or dry. I like the Remimgton brand. I&#x27;ve had a couple of their very expensive models. But replacing the blades in them just doesn&#x27;t seem to be cost efficient, especially since the motor slows down with age. It just works better for me to buy a new one of these every couple of years.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a good one for long time, found it</li>
            <li> Came with a small tiny personal trimmer too, which was nice.  I had this same model before and didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old one had gotten.  Nice to not have to use any pressure and it cut well.</li>
            <li> This lasted me a few years before the foil part broke and became unusable.  It worked fine, but the charge didn&#x27;t last long and you cannot use it while it is plugged in (very stupid design).</li>
            <li> Used this shaver for a year before the battery refused to hold a charge. It never shaved as closely as an older Remington I&#x27;d had for 15 years. After 11 months, the battery started dying after 5 minutes. Now, even after charging overnight, I&#x27;m lucky if I get a minute. Another great example of planned obsolescence. You can bet the next shaver I ordered isn&#x27;t branded Remington.</li>
            <li> If I could give this shaver negative stars I would. I read the reviews first but I have always loved Remington shavers with no problems. I bought this one for summer and was sorely disappointed. It leaves legs scratched/scraped. I literally leaves scrape marks on my legs and forget a even remotely close shave. As mention in other reviews, even worse on underarms/bikini area. The shaver left small cuts in some places in addition to the scrapes/scratches in others. I would never recommend this product. I would recommend the [[ASIN:B000BH3CGQ Remington WDF1250SS Smooth &amp; Silky Battery Operated Women&#x27;s Shaver]] as it is a much better product, it just isn&#x27;t rechargable.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I came online to look for replacement Screens &amp; Cutters for this shaver to see if it was available cheaper than directly from Remington.  But I began wondering if I should purchase another brand.  I bought this razor not quite 2 years ago and noticed that for at least the past 6-8 months, it was only good for about 2-1/2 shaves.  It does not hold the charge and cannot be used while plugged in.  I have used Remington for over 20 years and this is the first razor that I would rate as useless.   I have found all these reviews extremely helpful as all the problems I&#x27;ve been experiencing with the unit, seem to be common.  I think I may forgo the replacement blades now and purchase another razor of a different brand.  I noticed today that there are holes now in the screen.  My last Remington razor lasted me YEARS, worked wet/dry in the shower, held the charge much longer and could be used while plugged in AND offered a much closer shave.  I would not recommend this latest model either.</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE this product a lot after I had been using it for more than three months. It either misses spot, or cuts my skin if I press it lower to get the missed spot. After three months, I dumped it in the trash bin with no compassion. It meant to be there. I go back to the Panasonic happily.</li>
            <li> My first Remington (in an aqua blue) needed new screens and blades. Instead of going through all that trouble I thought I would just purchase another razor. This one was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works and fairly well. The charge time is low and the bikini attachment is great! But after the first time I cleaned it, per instructions, the head has never fully popped back in place. It still works, but I worry that it&#x27;s life with me will be too short.&lt;br /&gt;End point: why oh why don&#x27;t they make good razors for women?</li>
            <li> When I used this product I was pleased.  Easy to use and charge.</li>
            <li> I have used one of these shavers for many years. I live at the beach and shave everyday. This is the best shaver I have ever used</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. Had three weeks or so...light already not working. Doesn&#x27;t hold charge well. No underarm attachment came with it. It was shipped in a plastic bag--no product box, etc. VERY disappointing for what it cost...and embarrassing,  as I gave this to my daughter as a birthday gift.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor...go out &amp; buy one of these in a nice department store.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky wdf-1600in August 2010 and had to replace it.  Very disappointed not with the actual shaving but with the lack of the razor to hold a charge.  Sometimes the charge was not sufficient for one use.  Maybe it should be kept plugged in at all times - waste!  Won&#x27;t buy Remington again.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent Womens shaver . We bought this second one because my wife like it and our grand daughter tried it and also liked it.The only negative I have is there was no case to store the razor when not in use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT......FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim, wanted to have something that would be quick, easy, and wouldn&#x27;t tear my very sensitive skin up on a daily basis like conventional razors do. Less than pleased with the fact that it takes more than a day to charge it and the battery life doesn&#x27;t last long enough to finish both legs. Another weird quirk is that you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging... Really!?! I use my straightener, my blow dryer, my curler, my toaster, my rice cooker, even my microwave while plugged... Pretty sure all of those are more dangerous than an electric razor. Probably one of my most regrettable purchases.</li>
            <li> great replacement for the old one and easier to use, cuts better and closer.replacement blades reasonable. good value for price</li>
            <li> Works well.  Holds a charge for an adequate amount of time.</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE&lt;br /&gt;TREMBLING HANDS AREN&#x27;T A PROBLEM WITH MULTIPLE SCLOROSIS!&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD BUY THIS IN STORES ESPECIALLY IN COSMETIC AISLE.</li>
            <li> I tried the battery operated one and didn&#x27;t like it.  This one works wonderful.  It is as good as my previous Remington.</li>
            <li> This is the third of this model I have purchased.  I recommend them for their performance in close shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before and ended up buying this one.  After the 24 hours of pre-charging the batteries, I was anxious to try this one.  I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  It was super easy to use and worked easily over my knees, behind my knees, ankle bones....  I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have any trouble at all using it dry with no lotion or anything.  I loved that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button clicked all the way on and off so I didn&#x27;t have to hold it down.  The only drawback is that it&#x27;s loud.  My husband was watching tv 2 rooms away and I had to close the bathroom door b/c it was so loud even to him.  Other than that, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it is a great product and performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Shaves well.Thank you.  KD</li>
            <li> Smooth shave!  It does exactly what it is advertised to do, and the attachments are great, too!  It comes with a separate little instrument for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was broken.  I charged it for some 24 hours and it would not turn on.  Then the supplier told me it would be 2 - 4 weeks to get a replacement and I said to refund my money and the surprise came - 15% restock fee (interesting since the item was broken) and the $10.00 to ship it.  So it cost me more to return it then I paid for it.  I should have threw the item in the trash.  It would have saved md money.</li>
            <li> it was not working it was a good looking shaver just wont work sent it back but would purchase another</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my Mom for Christmas and she hasn&#x27;t complained so I guess this is good! :-)</li>
            <li> great shaver&lt;br /&gt;Discontinued so i ordered here but after a few uses it wont power on&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
            <li> I like the convience of shopping at amazon for gift. Its so easy to find items that fit all your needs. The shaver was a good value and was well made.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one I used to have. Works great without water. I love it.  It is loud and needs to be charged often but does the job.</li>
            <li> --update-- 4 months after I bought this the battery quit out; it barely holds a charge long enough to use it. Never mind expecting it to still be charged while not in use. Unfortunately since I bought mine elsewhere I can&#x27;t get a refund, though I doubt I would have been able to if I did buy this from Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my shaver as a factory reconditioned one elsewhere but, I like to leave reviews on Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as my wdf-3000 one; it doesn&#x27;t have the adjustable front clipper like the wdf-3000 and so getting the longer hairs on my legs requires more passes with the shaver whereas with my old one needed only one or two. The small rubber strips on the clipper part I&#x27;m not sure about; it drags on the skin and catches on imperfections like scars. I don&#x27;t like that it didn&#x27;t come with a protective head or a cleaning brush, items that came with my older shaver. Even a carry case would have been nice. The battery life isn&#x27;t that fabulous either. With my wdf-3000 one charge would last for 3-5 shaves before needing a recharge. This one, maybe 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with a bikini trimmer for free. I don&#x27;t wear bikinis so I don&#x27;t see a need for it thus I haven&#x27;t used it so I don&#x27;t know what to say about it. It&#x27;s battery powered, has two additional heads for it, one for trimming smaller areas (I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d need something like that) and one for trimming longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth though, if I could more readily find replacement blades and foils for my wdf-3000 I would have definitely stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for the past three years.  It is extremely loud and scares the cats every time I turn it on.  I keep it plugged in to the wall outlet 24/7, which is the only way it keeps a charge long enough to quickly shave my legs.  It loses a full charge after about 4 minutes of use.  It is difficult to clean.  I wish the top came completely off instead of remaining on the awkward hinge.  The shaver has lasted a long time though, and the blades have never been replaced, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.</li>
            <li> As a fan of electric razors, I can tell the good from the bad which is why I return to the Remington series.  Never been disappointed with this product. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Like many of the previous comments, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long. I have had mine for 2 years. With the shaver being fully charged overnight, I can only shave once and within 24 hours- it&#x27;s completely dead. Will be buying something different here soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for about 5 years and I&#x27;ve always liked it. As far as electric shavers go, this one gives a smooth shave! The battery pooped out today, but I&#x27;m ok with that, because I&#x27;ve used it A LOT over the past years. Time for a new one, and I want the exact same one!</li>
            <li> Performance is bad, will work as it is supposed to, I guess, just not very happy with it.  I would not purchase it again or recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give as clean a shave as the first Smooth &amp; Silky I had.</li>
            <li> When my first one stopped working (I dropped it one too many times) I tried buying several others (Remington included). I ended up taking them all back to the store and getting on Amazon to buy my original one.  I hope this one lasts many more years.</li>
            <li> does not give a clean shave.  Rough on the skin</li>
            <li> My wife is soooooooooo picky when it comes to shavers. Her old Remington was pooping out after about 16 years of use. Luckily they still make what is essentially the same shaver. Keep it Simple! This shaver is loud, but it&#x27;s the only one she&#x27;ll use.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Remington!&lt;br /&gt;gerard masters</li>
            <li> It is not as close as a razor is on my legs but it sure is easier than balancing on one leg in my shower! I really didn&#x27;t expect much and was pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this if you realize up front that  it is not going to be  razor smooth but it is pretty close!</li>
            <li> This product came in packaging that was yellowed and the razor itself actually had rust looking color at its seam! I didn&#x27;t even open it!</li>
            <li> This product exemplifies how an electric razor should work. Clean, close, smooth shave, no muss, no fuss. Love it!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this I read all the reviews and I am not sure why they were so bad. I have been using an electric razor for 12 plus years and I used every brand there was out there until I started using Remington. I am not sure if the reviews were written by inexperienced users or what.. Even though they were bad I ordered this anyway and this by far is one of the best electric razors I have ever used, I absolutely love it... This works great. Hint to those who don&#x27;t use one but would like to try it, the harder you press down on an electric razor the less hair it will remove. I would recommend this 100%!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mediocre shaver and it&#x27;s not at all durable. I slipped and dropped to the floor from about one foot and broke the top piece off. It&#x27;s not useable at all, but I didn&#x27;t care for it anyway. I had one of these about 6 years ago and it was built much better. This is a cheap imitation of a better model.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few different electric razors and I find that a lot of them just don&#x27;t cut the hair. Other people say they would but I put them to my leg and nothing happens. This one however works! I have an issue with ingrown hairs and I have found shaving with electric has helped.</li>
            <li> Had the same razor and I find it works the best....Holds charge for a long time.... Quick and easy.....Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife has dark, coarse leg hair. This shaver cuts her hair to the skin. Leaving her legs soft and hair free. It takes her about ten minutes to shave each leg. The shaver keeps it&#x27;s charge, unlike other Remington and Panasonic electric razors she has tried in the past. Remington WDF-1600 was a nightmare. Would take one hour for her to shave one leg and was not a close shave. Then the charge would not last and needed recharged. The Panasonic ES2207P would cut into her skin. No matter which way she held it, it would not cut any type or length of leg hair. ( These two didn&#x27;t even work in the shower/bath tub.) The Remington WDF-3600 was a great price of $9.17. Other shavers have cost us anywhere from $35 to $65. Have not worked properly. My wife and daughter use this 5 times a week. It holds the charge each time they shave. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a close shave, in a short amount of time, for the right price and works like it is supposed too!!</li>
