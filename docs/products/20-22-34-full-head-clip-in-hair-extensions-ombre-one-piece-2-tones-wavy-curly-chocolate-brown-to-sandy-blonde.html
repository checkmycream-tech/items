            <li>Still, prices too good, 1 wear</li>
            <li>A lot of hair good price although you cannot apply heat at all</li>
            <li>I think it blends really good with my hair.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re really good quality they took a while to get them</li>
            <li>All I can say is, these extensions are so beautiful that I already will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love these extensions!</li>
            <li>The color was a great match, easy to attach and people who don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m wearing</li>
            <li>feels so real and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li>The product feels an loos nice.</li>
            <li>This matched my natural hair perfectly, was not too shiny, it works best on curled hair, the clips are really well sewn in.</li>
            <li>So, even though they are a great price, the extensions aren&#x27;t really worth it for me.</li>
            <li>also look very cheap and don&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li>Surprisingly has a decent amount of hair for the price, is longer than the picture makes it seem and blends nice into your own hair.</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>and I got soooo many compliments.</li>
            <li>and I love them .</li>
            <li>Looks so beautiful and natural I lovet!</li>
            <li>Other than that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>Could not brush HUGE knot in them.</li>
            <li>Looks good and natural.</li>
            <li>for the price definetly good extensions,  i was able to straighten them on low heat</li>
            <li>i cant seem to get the nice curl it had when i first recieved them, but other than that great product.</li>
            <li>They looked good upon arrival but as soon as she wore then outside a</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>They blend beautifully, however they slightly smell.</li>
            <li>REALLY pretty blonde ends and light brown hair top</li>
            <li>I have hair to my waist and this just blends right in.</li>
            <li>Anyone who buys extensions knows that after a while fake hair will become distressed but for the price and a quick style these are absolutely perfect!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re most definitely not long term extensions.</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty hair piece.</li>
            <li>but it was really pretty and matched my hair</li>
            <li>I love it vs actually dying my hair.</li>
            <li>It would look better underneath hair that is long.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest getting these if you&#x27;re wanting them long term, but if you&#x27;re wanting extensions while you&#x27;re in the process of saving up money for better ones, these will work.</li>
            <li>I had to order the straight one also.</li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t expect it to look real.</li>
            <li>the clips didn&#x27;t really hold the hair in that well</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t feel like real hair</li>
            <li>I really like it and for $15</li>
            <li>so they didn&#x27;t really match my hair..</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear them daily, but maybe for special occasions.</li>
            <li>decent shipping time too.</li>
            <li>And no my straightener was not on to high.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll look hot enough to be remembered&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>One piece not big enough for full head.  </li>
            <li>Now I fixed this problem by straightening them, but it completely fried them...</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected and was exactly as I wanted!</li>
            <li>but they honestly don&#x27;t feel  fake like some I&#x27;ve had .</li>
            <li>(btw you may need to wash them a few times and add perfume as they smell a bit funky when i first recieved them)</li>

            <li> I purchased the 22&amp;#34; and they are quite long.</li>
            <li> it was really long though, and it didn&#x27;t blend in with my hair at all</li>
            <li> Well, I got these WAY earlier than expected, about a month earlier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brown has a strange gray tint to it</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s not human hair, be careful not to singe when curling the rest of the hair!</li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m not giving five stars is because they are extremely delicate.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous but smell horribly like moth balls!  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair myself and these blend in even thought my hair is shortish and a different shade of brown .</li>
            <li> they are just a mess.  </li>
            <li> If you brush them you&#x27;ll mess them up.</li>
            <li> it was a little windy</li>
            <li> Not worth it !</li>
            <li> Waste of my money....</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t care for the sandy blond part, to be it looked very artificial and became somewhat frizzy right out of the bag.  </li>
            <li> Not very good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to match hair over the internet, so that&#x27;s not the company&#x27;s fault.  </li>
            <li> If your an inexperienced hair extensions buyer then yes this can get tangly because it&#x27;s fake hair!!</li>
            <li> Some reviews said that the hair looks fake in person, but I disagree.</li>
            <li> Too shiny .it just looks to fake .</li>
            <li> you can tell it&#x27;s fake but in a braid it doesn&#x27;t look too fake.</li>
            <li> It was a bit thin, but for the price, not so bad.  </li>
            <li> The smell is awful and mine came tangled and a mess</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>

            <li> I ordered this in the brown to sandy blond, but sent it back because the brown didn&#x27;t match my hair.  It&#x27;s hard to match hair over the internet, so that&#x27;s not the company&#x27;s fault.  It was a bit thin, but for the price, not so bad.  It would look better underneath hair that is long.  Mine is shoulder length, so it didn&#x27;t blend well.  I also didn&#x27;t care for the sandy blond part, to be it looked very artificial and became somewhat frizzy right out of the bag.  I don&#x27;t think you can wash or style these either.  So, even though they are a great price, the extensions aren&#x27;t really worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Get knotted, Outta place hairs, after 1 wear. Still, prices too good, 1 wear you&#x27;ll look hot enough to be remembered&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They blend beautifully, however they slightly smell. I purchased the 22&amp;#34; and they are quite long. Not bad for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t wear them daily, but maybe for special occasions.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful and mine came tangled and a mess</li>
            <li> They looked good upon arrival but as soon as she wore then outside a it was a little windy they were all ratty and tangled.  We tried brushing, washing,  conditioning...they are just a mess.  Not very good quality.</li>
            <li> I love it! feels so real and the color is perfect. Blends in even if your hair is a bit different</li>
            <li> I love mine. I have hair to my waist and this just blends right in. My friends didn&#x27;t even know I had it on. I had to order the straight one also. Cant wait to get it!!</li>
            <li> My mom like&#x27;s it. lol</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected and was exactly as I wanted!</li>
            <li> These looked absolutely beautiful on my neice for prom.  Because it&#x27;s not human hair, be careful not to singe when curling the rest of the hair!</li>
            <li> I loved these!! I went to Europe and they were perfect for 11 days and I got soooo many compliments. If your an inexperienced hair extensions buyer then yes this can get tangly because it&#x27;s fake hair!! Anyone who buys extensions knows that after a while fake hair will become distressed but for the price and a quick style these are absolutely perfect!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and so do i</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it but it is beautiful!</li>
            <li> A lot of hair good price although you cannot apply heat at all</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! Some reviews said that the hair looks fake in person, but I disagree. I think it blends really good with my hair. I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous but smell horribly like moth balls!  Unwearable!</li>
            <li> Not worth it ! Too shiny .it just looks to fake .</li>
            <li> All I can say is, these extensions are so beautiful that I already will be ordering more (my daughter &#x27;took&#x27; mine)!! Beautiful color and thickness.... Perfect:)</li>
            <li> you can tell it&#x27;s fake but in a braid it doesn&#x27;t look too fake. it was really long though, and it didn&#x27;t blend in with my hair at all but it was 15 dollars so i didn&#x27;t expect it to look real.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty hair piece. Surprisingly has a decent amount of hair for the price, is longer than the picture makes it seem and blends nice into your own hair. REALLY pretty blonde ends and light brown hair top, you could even blend this into a darker head of hair for a three ombre look.</li>
            <li> Well, I got these WAY earlier than expected, about a month earlier.&lt;br /&gt;But, the downfall with these is that they&#x27;re way to shiny. Now I fixed this problem by straightening them, but it completely fried them... Thankfully my hair is fried already, I never thought i&#x27;d be thankful for fried hair, but I was in this situation. I don&#x27;t suggest getting these if you&#x27;re wanting them long term, but if you&#x27;re wanting extensions while you&#x27;re in the process of saving up money for better ones, these will work. They&#x27;re most definitely not long term extensions.</li>
            <li> One piece not big enough for full head.  Need two.</li>
            <li> the clips didn&#x27;t really hold the hair in that well but it was really pretty and matched my hair</li>
            <li> I got these yesturday and I love them . I have thick hair myself and these blend in even thought my hair is shortish and a different shade of brown . they don&#x27;t feel like real hair but they honestly don&#x27;t feel  fake like some I&#x27;ve had . they&#x27;re really good quality they took a while to get them although . but I&#x27;d suggest them !</li>
            <li> I really like it and for $15 it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wearing it only in a braid. Looks good and natural.</li>
            <li> Looks so beautiful and natural I lovet!</li>
            <li> for the price definetly good extensions,  i was able to straighten them on low heat i cant seem to get the nice curl it had when i first recieved them, but other than that great product. (btw you may need to wash them a few times and add perfume as they smell a bit funky when i first recieved them)</li>
            <li> The product feels an loos nice.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible. Waste of my money.... Couldn&#x27;t straighten them, brush them. They melted... And no my straightener was not on to high. Could not brush HUGE knot in them. In the garbage they go. NEVER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> The color was a great match, easy to attach and people who don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m wearing it are always complementing on how great my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I love these extensions! Blend perfectly with my hair. Only reason I&#x27;m not giving five stars is because they are extremely delicate. If you brush them you&#x27;ll mess them up. They are also course and feel like a wig. Other than that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> The brown has a strange gray tint to it so they didn&#x27;t really match my hair..&lt;br /&gt;They also look very cheap and don&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li> This matched my natural hair perfectly, was not too shiny, it works best on curled hair, the clips are really well sewn in. I love it vs actually dying my hair. decent shipping time too.</li>
            <li> Great for the price!!</li>
