            <li>Perfect product.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes GREAT, plus my dentist is impressed with the condition of my aging gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is great.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!!  </li>
            <li>taste good..</li>
            <li>The flavor is good.  </li>
            <li>I feel good that he&#x27;s not swallowing fluoride.</li>
            <li>Have a good cinnamon taste to it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, get for my teeth, and tasty!!  </li>
            <li>this is a very good fluoride free toothpaste with a cinnamon flavor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order more!  </li>
            <li>Great fluoride free tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for the perfect Natural Cinnamon Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is without fluoride (and there isn&#x27;t a huge selection out there w/o fluoride) and is the best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Love the cinnamon gum and love the toothpaste. :)</li>
            <li>I love cinnamon</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is great (cinnamon is my favorite) and it leaves my mouth and teeth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>and I use three toothpastes every day: a morning one with a light flavor that does not disrupt breakfast flavors, an after-breakfast one that keeps my mouth clean throughout the day, and a bedtime one with a very strong minty flavor because it&#x27;s sexy.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I liked this - not as strong a taste as the Tom&#x27;s cinnamon toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>its fine.</li>
            <li>We went flouride free several years ago and the cinnamon is a welcome change from the mint flavors.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It tastes great and it is even safe for the little ones still learning to brush.  </li>
            <li>the fun zing of this cinnamon toothpaste makes be actually enjoy it</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean even hours after brushing.</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s a bit too sweet for me.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste does not really give you that clean-mouth feel that you want to have before you go out for the day, but the one good thing about it is that the taste does not interfere with breakfast foods like some toothpastes</li>
            <li>My 3 year old complains that many mint toothpastes are too hot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am kind of a strange person</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Spry products, including their fluoride-free toothpaste, for over 5 years and was excited to see the new cinnamon flavor!</li>
            <li>The main disadvantage of using it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave the gums feeling as clean as I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>Wish I could like this, as I really LOVE cinnamon and am not a big fan of peppermint.</li>
            <li>I love the taste and it does help the dry mouth.</li>
            <li>This Spry toothpaste is an okay substitute for my morning Crest, but I actually will just go back to Crest since it is cheaper and equally mild in flavor (which, again, does not disrupt my breakfast flavors).</li>
            <li>Using xylitol has really helped my teeth.  </li>
            <li>THE FLAVOR IS REAL TASTEY ON THE TOOTHPASTES AND</li>
            <li>GENTLE ON MY TEETH.</li>
            <li>Love the taste, works just as well as the other flavors and MUCH BETTER than other brands.  </li>
            <li>Great taste and works, just a little more expensive than I want to pay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t endorse many products, but Spry fluoride-free toothpaste, along with a mostly raw diet of fruits &amp; veggies, has maintained my dental health with no visible plaque nor cavities.</li>
            <li>Like it.&lt;br /&gt;Taste is a bit mild compared to other products but no Fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>My seven year old said it also burned her mouth.  </li>
            <li>Typically I use original Crest in the morning, some version of Colgate Total in the afternoon, and AquaFresh at night.</li>
            <li>However, I soon developed some sore-like feelings in my mouth, and when I brushed again with Spry, it burned like fire!  </li>

            <li> I love this toothpaste!!  The flavor is great. Brushing your teeth is such a boring task and the fun zing of this cinnamon toothpaste makes be actually enjoy it</li>
            <li> At first I thought I liked this - not as strong a taste as the Tom&#x27;s cinnamon toothpaste.  However, I soon developed some sore-like feelings in my mouth, and when I brushed again with Spry, it burned like fire!  My seven year old said it also burned her mouth.  We have switched to Kiss My Face anticavity, which does have fluoride.  So far, so good.  Wish I could like this, as I really LOVE cinnamon and am not a big fan of peppermint.</li>
            <li> taste good..however, mouth begun to get dry before tube was finished....especially around the front teeth area.  Quite using it and ordered another flavor.  No problems with the peppermint.  Used Spry for years....so must be the cinnamon flavor has something in it that doesn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Was using Now&#x27;s Xyliwhite Cinnafresh, but after getting a moldy tasting tube, I switched to Spry Xlear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Spry products, including their fluoride-free toothpaste, for over 5 years and was excited to see the new cinnamon flavor! Love the taste, works just as well as the other flavors and MUCH BETTER than other brands.  I used Tom&#x27;s fluoride-free once and it didn&#x27;t do the job...actually developed spider-web like plaque within a few weeks and had to schedule a dental cleaning (I was told it changed the acidity in my mouth.)  I don&#x27;t endorse many products, but Spry fluoride-free toothpaste, along with a mostly raw diet of fruits &amp; veggies, has maintained my dental health with no visible plaque nor cavities.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes GREAT, plus my dentist is impressed with the condition of my aging gums and teeth.  What else can I say?!?</li>
            <li> This toothpaste blows me away! Not only is it fluoride-free it makes me look forward to brushing my teeth and brushing them extra well while I&#x27;m at it! This definitely gets it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, get for my teeth, and tasty!!  I&#x27;m very happy using this Spry product.  I&#x27;ll order more!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Using xylitol has really helped my teeth.  I&#x27;m not a fan of anything at all with fluoride especially water and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great taste! Love the cinnamon gum and love the toothpaste. :)</li>
            <li> I always buy this toothpaste. I love cinnamon and I know the xylitol is doing its job to kill any bacteria or any thing living in my mouth that doesn&#x27;t belong.</li>
            <li> This Spry toothpaste was recommended by my hygienist.  I have very dry mouth due to medicines I have to take regularly.  I love the taste and it does help the dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT; WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS, BUT ONLY 4 OF THE TOOTHPASTE SARRIVED WITH A GEL TOOTHPASTE, I DID NOT ORDER THE GEL; ORDERED 5 OF THE TOOTHPASTES.  THE FLAVOR IS REAL TASTEY ON THE TOOTHPASTES AND GENTLE ON MY TEETH.</li>
            <li> We went flouride free several years ago and the cinnamon is a welcome change from the mint flavors. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> yummy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah and it cleans your teeth and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mmmm</li>
            <li> Flavor wasn&#x27;t like the gum, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
            <li> Great fluoride free tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  It tastes great and it is even safe for the little ones still learning to brush.  My teeth feel super clean even hours after brushing.</li>
            <li> After reading about the dangers of fluoride, I started using this.  Great taste and works, just a little more expensive than I want to pay.</li>
            <li> I like it but, it&#x27;s a bit too sweet for me.  The flavor is good.  Not sure I will buy again.  I will keep looking for the perfect Natural Cinnamon Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothpaste because of its flavor and the fact that it was flluoride-free.  (I use fluoride toothpaste in the a.m. and this toothpaste in the evenings.)  The main disadvantage of using it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave the gums feeling as clean as I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Like it.&lt;br /&gt;Taste is a bit mild compared to other products but no Fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is without fluoride (and there isn&#x27;t a huge selection out there w/o fluoride) and is the best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.  The flavor is great (cinnamon is my favorite) and it leaves my mouth and teeth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> this is a very good fluoride free toothpaste with a cinnamon flavor.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does not really give you that clean-mouth feel that you want to have before you go out for the day, but the one good thing about it is that the taste does not interfere with breakfast foods like some toothpastes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am kind of a strange person and I use three toothpastes every day: a morning one with a light flavor that does not disrupt breakfast flavors, an after-breakfast one that keeps my mouth clean throughout the day, and a bedtime one with a very strong minty flavor because it&#x27;s sexy.

This Spry toothpaste is an okay substitute for my morning Crest, but I actually will just go back to Crest since it is cheaper and equally mild in flavor (which, again, does not disrupt my breakfast flavors).</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist suggested this toothpaste a couple of years ago.  Since I&#x27;ve been using it I have noticed a definite improvement in the amount of plaque I have to contend with and I can&#x27;t attribute the improvement to anything else,.</li>
            <li> its fine. would buy again</li>
            <li> Perfect timing. Perfect product.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old complains that many mint toothpastes are too hot.  This is the one he requests.  I feel good that he&#x27;s not swallowing fluoride.</li>
            <li> Taste like a basic cookie dough. Have a good cinnamon taste to it. This was my second order of this brand.</li>
            <li> Tasty product but hasn&#x27;t done anything to alleviate my dry mouth issues.  I&#x27;m using it along with the cinnamon mints.</li>
