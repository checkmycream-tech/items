            <li>Bella, younique etc and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>one coat of this was amazing enough that even my wonderful husband who doesn&#x27;t notice anything(and</li>
            <li>but you need a little trial and error to get good at the application and see what works best for you.  </li>
            <li>I doubt I could ever be able to use this product every day.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>and I love how it looks.</li>
            <li>And, the best part, the Double Extend is 1/2 the price of the Physicians Formula.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the top 3d mascaras out there.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t have things to do tonight.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how this could be safe or healthy for the eyes.</li>
            <li>Ok my mascara fetish has officially been smashed.</li>
            <li>I love Physicians Formula.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>, before you apply your extensions, MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This makes them stand out, and I love the look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They should have kept the wand separate from the fibers so you can control how many you grab.</li>
            <li>ok, i didn&#x27;t buy it here but had to leave a review.</li>
            <li>Interesting product.  </li>
            <li>Someone else might like more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it more for date night and not an every day application.</li>
            <li>Bought it at Wal-Mart three days ago for $12.93 and love it.</li>
            <li>You should only need do this process twice to get the best effect.</li>
            <li>Love it, does what it says.</li>
            <li>When applying the lengthening fibers, just be sure to flick the brush after removing it from the container in order to get rid of excess fibers.  </li>
            <li>I love this lash booster.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff soooo much!!!!</li>
            <li>so my own lashes grow, bit other than that, I think the search for the best mascara is over!</li>
            <li>Also washes off easily, something that is very important to me.</li>
            <li>and then you have to clean up!</li>
            <li>Instant gorgeous lashes!</li>
            <li>Not so easily wiped off if you have applied foundation.</li>
            <li>really feel like this is an amazing product, maybe application should be more focused.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>i thought it was easy to use</li>
            <li>easy</li>
            <li>Easy to apply too and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>so it may work fine for someone that does not have that problem.</li>
            <li>Dries up pretty fast but works great.</li>
            <li>Length aviene good ,expected maybe more but is okay</li>
            <li>so ease was really important to me.</li>
            <li>and I have NEVER RECEIVED ANY FREE PRODUCTS FOR A REVIEW.  </li>
            <li>You need to do this....very important.  </li>
            <li>Makes a difference in your eyes and face looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>The extension tube is filled with powder that goes everywhere.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Wont ever go back to another kind!</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes practice, but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>So first, do your homework; the ladies concerned about the fibers most likley are suffering from user error.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use them on special occasion</li>
            <li>This product really works and the look is even better than the YouTube demo.</li>
            <li>It does make my lashes look full and think as promised.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>The effect is more natural and full!</li>
            <li>Really does make your lashed longer and much thicker !!!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got the time, the patience and a steady hand this might be OK for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I will never buy anything from this company again and hope they enjoy my money since clearly my money was more valuable to them than keeping me as a customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!  </li>
            <li>It literally looks like your own natural lashes are as flawless as false lashes.  </li>
            <li>This one goes on easy and quick, and REALLY extends lashes dramatically.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it two stars is that the mascara alone is pretty good, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t get cheaper at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I use the brush gentle as always but the tube is cheap made.</li>
            <li>This is not a produt I would recommend, there are just far too many problems with it.</li>
            <li>it was worth buying and trying</li>
            <li>I used saline drops without success and then attempted to remove some of the fibers that I could see inside my eyes.</li>
            <li>Oh well it was worth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a product worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I Think it works great and better than Loreal&#x27;s voluminous false fiber mascara.</li>
            <li>It was irritating at first, but you just have to figure out what technique works best for you when applying!</li>
            <li>The only thing is I wish it came in a larger tube as I feel like I go through it pretty quickly---but that&#x27;s because I love it! :-)</li>
            <li>knowing this, i was very, very apprehensive about this product.</li>
            <li>and they really enhance the lashes and give a long feathery appearance which I love!</li>
            <li>may just not be the type that can work through the sensitivity of fiber type mascaras since this is the first that I have ever tried</li>
            <li>The first time I used it the fibers did get everywhere.</li>
            <li>These definitely give you more length and fullness.</li>
            <li>I curl mine first, then follow the directions.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I did have problems with the fibers getting into my eyes but it stopped after about a minute.</li>
            <li>Extremely reasonable price too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many as gifts for my family &amp; friends &amp; I even have an extra one to keep in my purse</li>
            <li>First, this set is under $13 at walmart.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t spend more than 5 minutes total on makeup on routine basis.</li>
            <li>At first when I bought it, the fibers fell in my eyes and I wasn&#x27;t going to use it anymore.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone, even those of you already have pretty eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>This product can only make them better.</li>
            <li>I get better results reapplying my mascara several times.</li>
            <li>The application: first coat lashes with the mascara</li>
            <li>You have to play with the mascara after the fibers a bit to get your lashes how you want, it comes out a bit spidery and clumpy at first, just wiggle the mascara wand while gingerly dragging up your lashes.</li>
            <li>Apply the first coat of mascara to one eye.</li>
            <li>You have to play with it a bit and figure it out, i like to pull out the fiber wand 3/4 and tap the top firmly a few times, then pull it out slowley while continuing to lightly tap the flat top of the fiber wand.</li>
            <li>Even after the whole process I didn&#x27;t see the results that I was expecting when I compare it to other popular extension mascara reviews out there.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li>First, apply the mascara and your fiber brush is ready to go.</li>
            <li>Easy enough.  </li>
            <li>really lengthens the lashes, not to hard to apply, good job</li>
            <li>Great mascara for those who have thin lashes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper too and can be found at Walmart or target.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t put too much mascara or the extensions.  </li>
            <li>I really like this kit.</li>
            <li>I threw the whole thing away.  </li>
            <li>I ended up with way too much on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE to leave a real review.</li>
            <li>I HAVE to leave a real review.</li>
            <li>and I really like it now ....</li>
            <li>and they were passive-aggressive dicks who didn&#x27;t really try to resolve the problem.</li>
            <li>Not so fast.  </li>
            <li>The problem is immediately following application of both tubes exactly as instructed, my eyes felt like they were full of dirt.</li>
            <li>The good news: it will make your lashes look quite thick.</li>
            <li>once again I had fibers all over the place trying to clean with an eye makeup remover and multiple cotton</li>
            <li>I read all the one stars and except the girl whose tube broke and the contacts lady, those complaints sound like they stem from first time, inexperienced users.</li>
            <li>My go to mascara for great fake looking lashes but are REAL!.</li>
            <li>May use for special occasions as I doubt I can take it back.</li>
            <li>realize the nature of working with fine, dry, micro particles and act accordingly.  </li>
            <li>I found the secret to using this product successfully so it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li>Some pointers: precurl, don&#x27;t post curl, putting a compact on the sink and leaning over it is a decent idea, don&#x27;t post coat with your regular mascara, it takes the fibers off, precoating your lashes is a good booster, but not necessary for an instant, damatic difference</li>
            <li>Most the fibers fall down on your cheek.  </li>
            <li>I get the lash booster on my lashes for about a half an hour during which time more of the fibers began falling off into and under my eyes.</li>
            <li>One think, the top part of the tube (ring) is cut off and stick to the brush which is make it more difficult to use now.</li>
            <li>The commercial implies that putting the mascara and extension is quick, as each has to be applied twice.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>Even when I finished and felt that I had cleaned up all the fibers ( I had to us tape to remove the excess off of my face because a dry clean brush didn&#x27;t work, I continued to have issues with my eyes and just decided after everything to wash it all off.</li>
            <li>i normally use lancome or tarte mascara with so so results.</li>
            <li>like you would normally, immediatly follow up with fibers.</li>
            <li>But I could live with that.  </li>
            <li>Also, my eyes are very sensitive and allergy prone</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>this does the exact same thing! 🙌</li>
            <li>and I liked the results ok, but the lash extension fluff gets everywhere and made it difficult to apply after makeup in my routine.</li>
            <li>First time using this product and only couple of times, my eyes looks longer when i applied it.</li>
            <li>They are fibers, not powder, and they will go everywhere if you don&#x27;t tap the fiber wand first like the directions specifically outline as a necessary step.</li>
            <li>reapply the actual mascara on top of the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always easier for me to apply mascara by looking down into a mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear soft lens and the fibers tend to irritate my eyes...  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I could not tolerate walking around all day feeling like had dirt in my eyes, so I removed the mascara completely.</li>
            <li>And the middle step (the &amp;#34;extensions&amp;#34; part) is VERY powdery and gets EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>But hasnt seen improvement on the eyelashes yet (longer natural eyelashes).</li>
            <li>SOFT CONTACT USERS:</li>
            <li>I wear soft contacts...</li>
            <li>This really is the better that false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>You can totally see a difference (see my picture: left vs. right eye).</li>
            <li>I am using this product I open the fibers first, again, SLOWLY, and tap it a bit over the container to get most of the fibers to fall back inside of the container, with tissue paper underneath.</li>
            <li>i hate when the little fibers get in my eye, so make sure you tap the wand with the fibers to get any fly aways off.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like how the extension wand left black dust under your eyes when you apply it to your lashes it it wipes clean with just a brush .</li>
            <li>have blonde eyelashes, and even with regular mascara, you can&#x27;t really see them, and they don&#x27;t pop.</li>
            <li>It does help to look down into a mirror to apply and also try not to do much blinking after you first apply to give it time to dry without falling into your eyes.</li>
            <li>During application some of the little fibers might fall onto your under eye area, and they&#x27;re easy to brush away from clean, dry skin, but a little more difficult if you have makeup on the skin.</li>
            <li>BEING SAID, I feel there&#x27;s a bizarre number of negative comments that are not unlike those that resulted in coffee being labeled &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>You can get it for $14.99 at the drug store so anything more than that is a rip-off.</li>
            <li>Sorry to sound harsh, but this is an amazing product that delivers exactly what it promises and doesn&#x27;t deserve the type of negative comments it&#x27;s receiving.  </li>
            <li>The smaller tube is full of tiny little hair like pieces.  </li>
            <li>First apply the mascara, then swipe on some of the little micro fibers that stick to your lashes and mascara.  </li>
            <li>So fiber; yes, the feathery little fibers were EVERYWHERE; my eye, my cheeck, on my nose, up my nose, all over-the first time, and i didnt tap the wand that well.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a waste.</li>
            <li>apply this is 3 steps, you use the black actual mascara first, then you add the exentisions (ONLY TO THE ENDS</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t have things to do tonight.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how this could be safe or healthy for the eyes.</li>
            <li> Ok my mascara fetish has officially been smashed.</li>
            <li> I love Physicians Formula.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> , before you apply your extensions, MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This makes them stand out, and I love the look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They should have kept the wand separate from the fibers so you can control how many you grab.</li>
            <li> ok, i didn&#x27;t buy it here but had to leave a review.</li>
            <li> Interesting product.  </li>
            <li> Someone else might like more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it more for date night and not an every day application.</li>
            <li> Bought it at Wal-Mart three days ago for $12.93 and love it.</li>
            <li> You should only need do this process twice to get the best effect.</li>
            <li> Love it, does what it says.</li>
            <li> When applying the lengthening fibers, just be sure to flick the brush after removing it from the container in order to get rid of excess fibers.  </li>
            <li> I love this lash booster.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff soooo much!!!!</li>
            <li> so my own lashes grow, bit other than that, I think the search for the best mascara is over!</li>
            <li> Also washes off easily, something that is very important to me.</li>
            <li> and then you have to clean up!</li>
            <li> Instant gorgeous lashes!</li>
            <li> Not so easily wiped off if you have applied foundation.</li>
            <li> really feel like this is an amazing product, maybe application should be more focused.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> i thought it was easy to use</li>
            <li> easy</li>
            <li> Easy to apply too and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> so it may work fine for someone that does not have that problem.</li>
            <li> Dries up pretty fast but works great.</li>
            <li> Length aviene good ,expected maybe more but is okay</li>
            <li> so ease was really important to me.</li>
            <li> and I have NEVER RECEIVED ANY FREE PRODUCTS FOR A REVIEW.  </li>
            <li> You need to do this....very important.  </li>
            <li> Makes a difference in your eyes and face looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> The extension tube is filled with powder that goes everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Wont ever go back to another kind!</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes practice, but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> So first, do your homework; the ladies concerned about the fibers most likley are suffering from user error.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use them on special occasion</li>
            <li> This product really works and the look is even better than the YouTube demo.</li>
            <li> It does make my lashes look full and think as promised.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> The effect is more natural and full!</li>
            <li> Really does make your lashed longer and much thicker !!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got the time, the patience and a steady hand this might be OK for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I will never buy anything from this company again and hope they enjoy my money since clearly my money was more valuable to them than keeping me as a customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!  </li>
            <li> It literally looks like your own natural lashes are as flawless as false lashes.  </li>
            <li> This one goes on easy and quick, and REALLY extends lashes dramatically.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it two stars is that the mascara alone is pretty good, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t get cheaper at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I use the brush gentle as always but the tube is cheap made.</li>
            <li> This is not a produt I would recommend, there are just far too many problems with it.</li>
            <li> it was worth buying and trying</li>
            <li> I used saline drops without success and then attempted to remove some of the fibers that I could see inside my eyes.</li>
            <li> Oh well it was worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a product worth trying.  </li>
            <li> I Think it works great and better than Loreal&#x27;s voluminous false fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> It was irritating at first, but you just have to figure out what technique works best for you when applying!</li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish it came in a larger tube as I feel like I go through it pretty quickly---but that&#x27;s because I love it! :-)</li>
            <li> knowing this, i was very, very apprehensive about this product.</li>
            <li> and they really enhance the lashes and give a long feathery appearance which I love!</li>
            <li> may just not be the type that can work through the sensitivity of fiber type mascaras since this is the first that I have ever tried</li>
            <li> The first time I used it the fibers did get everywhere.</li>
            <li> These definitely give you more length and fullness.</li>
            <li> I curl mine first, then follow the directions.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I did have problems with the fibers getting into my eyes but it stopped after about a minute.</li>
            <li> Extremely reasonable price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many as gifts for my family &amp; friends &amp; I even have an extra one to keep in my purse</li>
            <li> First, this set is under $13 at walmart.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t spend more than 5 minutes total on makeup on routine basis.</li>
            <li> At first when I bought it, the fibers fell in my eyes and I wasn&#x27;t going to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone, even those of you already have pretty eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> This product can only make them better.</li>
            <li> I get better results reapplying my mascara several times.</li>
            <li> The application: first coat lashes with the mascara</li>
            <li> You have to play with the mascara after the fibers a bit to get your lashes how you want, it comes out a bit spidery and clumpy at first, just wiggle the mascara wand while gingerly dragging up your lashes.</li>
            <li> Apply the first coat of mascara to one eye.</li>
            <li> You have to play with it a bit and figure it out, i like to pull out the fiber wand 3/4 and tap the top firmly a few times, then pull it out slowley while continuing to lightly tap the flat top of the fiber wand.</li>
            <li> Even after the whole process I didn&#x27;t see the results that I was expecting when I compare it to other popular extension mascara reviews out there.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> First, apply the mascara and your fiber brush is ready to go.</li>
            <li> Easy enough.  </li>
            <li> really lengthens the lashes, not to hard to apply, good job</li>
            <li> Great mascara for those who have thin lashes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper too and can be found at Walmart or target.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t put too much mascara or the extensions.  </li>
            <li> I really like this kit.</li>
            <li> I threw the whole thing away.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with way too much on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE to leave a real review.</li>
            <li> I HAVE to leave a real review.</li>
            <li> and I really like it now ....</li>
            <li> and they were passive-aggressive dicks who didn&#x27;t really try to resolve the problem.</li>
            <li> Not so fast.  </li>
            <li> The problem is immediately following application of both tubes exactly as instructed, my eyes felt like they were full of dirt.</li>
            <li> The good news: it will make your lashes look quite thick.</li>
            <li> once again I had fibers all over the place trying to clean with an eye makeup remover and multiple cotton</li>
            <li> I read all the one stars and except the girl whose tube broke and the contacts lady, those complaints sound like they stem from first time, inexperienced users.</li>
            <li> My go to mascara for great fake looking lashes but are REAL!.</li>
            <li> May use for special occasions as I doubt I can take it back.</li>
            <li> realize the nature of working with fine, dry, micro particles and act accordingly.  </li>
            <li> I found the secret to using this product successfully so it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Some pointers: precurl, don&#x27;t post curl, putting a compact on the sink and leaning over it is a decent idea, don&#x27;t post coat with your regular mascara, it takes the fibers off, precoating your lashes is a good booster, but not necessary for an instant, damatic difference</li>
            <li> Most the fibers fall down on your cheek.  </li>
            <li> I get the lash booster on my lashes for about a half an hour during which time more of the fibers began falling off into and under my eyes.</li>
            <li> One think, the top part of the tube (ring) is cut off and stick to the brush which is make it more difficult to use now.</li>
            <li> The commercial implies that putting the mascara and extension is quick, as each has to be applied twice.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> Even when I finished and felt that I had cleaned up all the fibers ( I had to us tape to remove the excess off of my face because a dry clean brush didn&#x27;t work, I continued to have issues with my eyes and just decided after everything to wash it all off.</li>
            <li> i normally use lancome or tarte mascara with so so results.</li>
            <li> like you would normally, immediatly follow up with fibers.</li>
            <li> But I could live with that.  </li>
            <li> Also, my eyes are very sensitive and allergy prone</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> this does the exact same thing! 🙌</li>
            <li> and I liked the results ok, but the lash extension fluff gets everywhere and made it difficult to apply after makeup in my routine.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and only couple of times, my eyes looks longer when i applied it.</li>
            <li> They are fibers, not powder, and they will go everywhere if you don&#x27;t tap the fiber wand first like the directions specifically outline as a necessary step.</li>
            <li> reapply the actual mascara on top of the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always easier for me to apply mascara by looking down into a mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear soft lens and the fibers tend to irritate my eyes...  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I could not tolerate walking around all day feeling like had dirt in my eyes, so I removed the mascara completely.</li>
            <li> And the middle step (the &amp;#34;extensions&amp;#34; part) is VERY powdery and gets EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> But hasnt seen improvement on the eyelashes yet (longer natural eyelashes).</li>
            <li> SOFT CONTACT USERS:</li>
            <li> I wear soft contacts...</li>
            <li> This really is the better that false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> You can totally see a difference (see my picture: left vs. right eye).</li>
            <li> I am using this product I open the fibers first, again, SLOWLY, and tap it a bit over the container to get most of the fibers to fall back inside of the container, with tissue paper underneath.</li>
            <li> i hate when the little fibers get in my eye, so make sure you tap the wand with the fibers to get any fly aways off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how the extension wand left black dust under your eyes when you apply it to your lashes it it wipes clean with just a brush .</li>
            <li> have blonde eyelashes, and even with regular mascara, you can&#x27;t really see them, and they don&#x27;t pop.</li>
            <li> It does help to look down into a mirror to apply and also try not to do much blinking after you first apply to give it time to dry without falling into your eyes.</li>
            <li> During application some of the little fibers might fall onto your under eye area, and they&#x27;re easy to brush away from clean, dry skin, but a little more difficult if you have makeup on the skin.</li>
            <li> BEING SAID, I feel there&#x27;s a bizarre number of negative comments that are not unlike those that resulted in coffee being labeled &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> You can get it for $14.99 at the drug store so anything more than that is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> Sorry to sound harsh, but this is an amazing product that delivers exactly what it promises and doesn&#x27;t deserve the type of negative comments it&#x27;s receiving.  </li>
            <li> The smaller tube is full of tiny little hair like pieces.  </li>
            <li> First apply the mascara, then swipe on some of the little micro fibers that stick to your lashes and mascara.  </li>
            <li> So fiber; yes, the feathery little fibers were EVERYWHERE; my eye, my cheeck, on my nose, up my nose, all over-the first time, and i didnt tap the wand that well.</li>
            <li> Pretty much a waste.</li>
            <li> apply this is 3 steps, you use the black actual mascara first, then you add the exentisions (ONLY TO THE ENDS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these mascars/fiber sets &amp; this was by far more messy &amp; irritating than the others.</li>
            <li> Using the fibers at first was pretty simple, but then I began to get little pieces in my eye causing serious irritation.</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical but this worked amazing.</li>
            <li> Instant beautifully long lashes</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on how long my lashes are and my sister actually did think they were extensions.</li>
            <li> i have used it regularly and as long as i stick to one coat of both the mascara and the fibers, no irritation.</li>
            <li> Like the product but with three applications involved, it takes a little more time than I usually spend on my mascara -- and it did clump slightly.  </li>
            <li> When you are ready to open the container with the fibers, do it with a piece of tissue paper underneath and do it SLOWLY.</li>
            <li> ; 1) my lashes are non existent at best, i mean i wear false almost daily to not look like i have some weird eyelash disorder and this mascara</li>
            <li> I am a fan of pf fake out masacara and this one is Fabulous.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> 2nd,  careful opening the extension bottle-</li>
            <li> You can feel them when you apply and all day long.</li>
            <li> My lashes look thick and much longer without looking like spiders.  </li>
            <li> Well, indeed this lash booster set did add a little length to my lashes, however, the hair-like fibers in the smaller tube (even after tapping the wand several times to remove excess from the brush) fell all over my under eye area and cheek.</li>
            <li> I would not say this product is any different than any other mascara/extension product on the market.</li>
            <li> They make your lashes very long and the product does what it says.  </li>
            <li> You will get a tiny bit of fibers on your face but nothing that a big fluffy brush won&#x27;t take care of.</li>
            <li> The big problem I had was that it left me with raccoon eyes after a few hours, but with some shellac, no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product was used and mascara was dry not a NEW item.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle so on to the next mascara wonder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use a thin coat of a conditioning mascara first</li>
            <li> I applied this the first time and my family was convinced I was wearing false lashes.  </li>
            <li> so I know if you get moisturizer on your fingers and then put in a lens...or get eyeshadow in your eye...or a hair from a make brush comes loose,</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look long and lucious!!</li>
            <li> So save yourself the money, get the EXACT SAME LOOK (and without that irritating black powder) and buy L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;(No</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really make my lashes look thicker and very messy, little powder lashes end up all over your face.  </li>
            <li> Open the tube black dust flies out everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Obviously the quality control on this product is not adequate.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product at first, however giving it a second try</li>
            <li> Big mess.......</li>
            <li> I spent another half an hour removing the tiny pieces of hair fibers from inside my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have bad allergies, and often my eyes are so irritated that I cannot wear makeup, so when I do wear makeup, I need to make sure that it isn&#x27;t going to irritate my eyes</li>
            <li> ie basically people who obviously need to be protected because they lack all common sense and personal responsibility....  </li>
            <li> it was not really what I expected.  </li>
            <li> just be careful</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I found out that the smaller container (the extension) is a fluffy material that flies all over the place.  </li>
            <li> i mean anything) said \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li> show overcurl mascara for every day use and this mascara if I feel I absolutely need dramatic extensions on occasions</li>
            <li> I will admit that I tend to have sensitive eyes, but this was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have thrown out all of my other mascaras that I use for years</li>
            <li> The products feel lighter on my skin than any other product I have ever used</li>
            <li> Repeat for the other eye.</li>
            <li> Some of them pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> They can get slightly clumpy, but not like tarantula legs or anything....be careful when applying the extensions as the fibers can dust into your eyes...</li>
            <li> After putting them over the mascara it is really hard to get the ones that fall onto your cheek area off especially if you have already put on your face makeup.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t we all accidentally tapped a mascara wand to our eye and instantly blinked so hard we looked like sobbing raccoons???</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; of eyelashes and removing the product took too much time and effort.</li>
            <li> Plus you can buy this at any drug store for about 16$. Not worth it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not worth the 30 on here.</li>
            <li> even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have use Physicians Formula produts for a while, and after my old mascara started irritating my eyes, I had to get</li>
            <li> The 2 ND time I tilted my head down and applied, and didn&#x27;t get the fibers on me.</li>
            <li> I have to say that if you follow the directions on the package and put on the extensions looking down over a mirror, you do not get anything on your face.  </li>
            <li> Another review recommended using a handheld mirror and look down into it while applying step 2.  </li>
            <li> Powder-like fibers ended up all over my eyelids and down my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Take a mirror and look down into it to apply the lash extensions.</li>
            <li> $27 down the drain.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I have to say that I was a little frightened to try this product.  </li>
            <li> The slightly added eyelash length was not worth the eye irritation.</li>
            <li> Whoever said, \\&quot;Beauty knows no pain\\&quot; never had flecks of black fibers in her eyes.</li>
            <li> For half the price!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, you can purchase this product at Target for less money.  </li>
            <li> While applying the fibers, look down a little and try not to blink.  </li>
            <li> Not true</li>
            <li> The fibers are a mess to work with.  </li>
            <li> It was a mess.</li>
            <li> Little black fibers end up everywhere just opening the container.  </li>
            <li> Continue to look down into the mirror and apply a few swipes of mascara before straightening up to fix your eye lashes the way you want them to look.</li>
            <li> With a little practice it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> but at 30 + $$ for one tube it can get a little pricey.</li>
            <li> so the brush didn&#x27;t have a little ring to wipe off the excess or keep the product protected from air or contamination.</li>
            <li> I get the same effect with Loreal False Fiber Mascara for a lot less money.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really does make your lashed longer and much thicker !!!!</li>
            <li> I like the mascara itself but when I tried to put the fibers it clumped my lashes and the fibers got inside really bad I ended up giving it away</li>
            <li> I am never one to return a product especially a cheap on that I got on sale, but this mascara is so irritating! The only reason I gave it two stars is that the mascara alone is pretty good, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t get cheaper at the drugstore. Using the fibers at first was pretty simple, but then I began to get little pieces in my eye causing serious irritation. I will admit that I tend to have sensitive eyes, but this was ridiculous. Even when I finished and felt that I had cleaned up all the fibers ( I had to us tape to remove the excess off of my face because a dry clean brush didn&#x27;t work, I continued to have issues with my eyes and just decided after everything to wash it all off. That in itself was a task since once again I had fibers all over the place trying to clean with an eye makeup remover and multiple cotton pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may just not be the type that can work through the sensitivity of fiber type mascaras since this is the first that I have ever tried so it may work fine for someone that does not have that problem. Even after the whole process I didn&#x27;t see the results that I was expecting when I compare it to other popular extension mascara reviews out there. Not worth the hassle so on to the next mascara wonder.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got the time, the patience and a steady hand this might be OK for special occasions. I doubt I could ever be able to use this product every day. The good news: it will make your lashes look quite thick. The bad news: it won&#x27;t last that long, because you will end up with smears and flacks of black fibers all over your face. The worst news: it will irritate your eyes, and that&#x27;s just not worth it. Whoever said, \\&quot;Beauty knows no pain\\&quot; never had flecks of black fibers in her eyes. This is not a produt I would recommend, there are just far too many problems with it. (And definitely stay away if you have contact lenses!)</li>
            <li> This really is the better that false eyelashes.  The effect is more natural and full!</li>
            <li> Great mascara for those who have thin lashes.  Dries up pretty fast but works great.</li>
            <li> Awful. One star because it does make lashes look thicker. It also gets in your eyes and irritates all day.</li>
            <li> Instant beautifully long lashes</li>
            <li> The first time I used it the fibers did get everywhere. The 2 ND time I tilted my head down and applied, and didn&#x27;t get the fibers on me. I love this mascara and will continue to buy it. I purchased mine at cvs!! You can control what lenghth you&#x27;d like.  With a little practice it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. You cant blame the maker if you can&#x27;t apply it that&#x27;s on you.</li>
            <li> Definitely results are seen instantly. Your lashes extend dramatically! Downside: it&#x27;s clumpy and can be irritating to those who wear contacts.  I wear soft lens and the fibers tend to irritate my eyes...  I&#x27;m sticking with Dior show overcurl mascara for every day use and this mascara if I feel I absolutely need dramatic extensions on occasions</li>
            <li> it was not really what I expected.  The brush gets clumpy and the power that makes the lashes grow, did actually seem to work, but powder would get in my eyes, cause irritation&lt;br /&gt;But it was worth buying and trying</li>
            <li> Do not like at all.  Most the fibers fall down on your cheek.  Horrible Product.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup find ever! I love it so much! Very easy to apply and I love how it looks. The only thing is I wish it came in a larger tube as I feel like I go through it pretty quickly---but that&#x27;s because I love it! :-)</li>
            <li> These definitely give you more length and fullness. You can totally see a difference (see my picture: left vs. right eye). I curl mine first, then follow the directions. They can get slightly clumpy, but not like tarantula legs or anything....be careful when applying the extensions as the fibers can dust into your eyes...</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It was irritating at first, but you just have to figure out what technique works best for you when applying! I will continue to buy this as long as it&#x27;s available! I am now using only physicians formula makeup on my entire face! This is a amazing product! The brokers, powers, and liquid makeup are just as great! Good price for the quality you get! Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look long and lucious!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! Wont ever go back to another kind!</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the thing.....the product does look great on the eyes BUT it is absolutely NO DIFFERENT than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s mascara - Double Extend.  And, the best part, the Double Extend is 1/2 the price of the Physicians Formula.  So save yourself the money, get the EXACT SAME LOOK (and without that irritating black powder) and buy L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;(No, I don&#x27;t work for the company - I have been using this mascara for a few years and wanted to try the PF brand).</li>
            <li> Instant gorgeous lashes!</li>
            <li> Wow!  I applied this the first time and my family was convinced I was wearing false lashes.  Not sure why anyone would write a negative review on this stuff...worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I liked it and it seemed to have worked.</li>
            <li> I have very short eye lashes. I&#x27;ve tried the top 3d mascaras out there. Bella, younique etc and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s so much cheaper too and can be found at Walmart or target. Although it seems cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li> Awful!  If you like the feeling of dirt in your eyes, then this is the product for you!  Step 1: Put the mascara on. Easy enough.  Not bad. step 2: sweep on fibers.  Ok here&#x27;s where things get interesting! Open the tube black dust flies out everywhere.  skeptical but Apply it to the wet mascara. Instantly eyes started burning. But fibers stuck all over my face, look like a hairy beast. Glad I didn&#x27;t have things to do tonight. Will spend the next hour trying to pick hairs out of my eyeballs and reapplying all my make up. Will never use this mascara again!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have thrown out all of my other mascaras that I use for years this is the one and only one I will use for now on</li>
            <li> Well, indeed this lash booster set did add a little length to my lashes, however, the hair-like fibers in the smaller tube (even after tapping the wand several times to remove excess from the brush) fell all over my under eye area and cheek. Not so easily wiped off if you have applied foundation. But I could live with that.  The problem is immediately following application of both tubes exactly as instructed, my eyes felt like they were full of dirt. I used saline drops without success and then attempted to remove some of the fibers that I could see inside my eyes. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive eyes. I get the lash booster on my lashes for about a half an hour during which time more of the fibers began falling off into and under my eyes. I could not tolerate walking around all day feeling like had dirt in my eyes, so I removed the mascara completely. I spent another half an hour removing the tiny pieces of hair fibers from inside my eyes. Even after this, the sensation that something was in my eyes remained for hours.  I can&#x27;t imagine how this could be safe or healthy for the eyes. Would not recommend to others, nor would I purchase again.  The slightly added eyelash length was not worth the eye irritation. Noteworthy, my eyes (the sclera) remained blood shot for days following this one time (30 minute use).</li>
            <li> Ok my mascara fetish has officially been smashed. I cant believe I finally found a product that actually works! I have no clue what those fibers are made out of but genius nonetheless and they really enhance the lashes and give a long feathery appearance which I love! I got this product at Walmart for under 12$ and it has my seal of approval. Stop paying 40/50$ for that 3D stuff...this does the exact same thing! 🙌</li>
            <li> Great product,&lt;br /&gt;No need lash extensions anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder soon</li>
            <li> really lengthens the lashes, not to hard to apply, good job</li>
            <li> Not great if you already have long lashes! And the middle step (the &amp;#34;extensions&amp;#34; part) is VERY powdery and gets EVERYWHERE. My friend who has short/thin lashes loves it, though.</li>
            <li> Is nice, does make eyelashes look fuller just be careful when applying the fibers can go into your eyes and don&#x27;t apply after foundation because they cover your cheeks and then you have to clean up! Nothing is magical and perfect!</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; of eyelashes and removing the product took too much time and effort. I&#x27;d rather not use a mascara that requires paint remover to take off the product. Clumpy lashes even after pre-application curling and post-application brushing</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I have to say that I was a little frightened to try this product.  I wear contacts etc., and people were writing about irritation.  I have to say that if you follow the directions on the package and put on the extensions looking down over a mirror, you do not get anything on your face.  I tapped of the excess in the tube as much as possible.  They make your lashes very long and the product does what it says.  I am completely happy with it.  I found that I only needed one coat of the mascara, extensions, mascara.  I did not need to apply two as the package suggests.  I will definitely keep buying this product.  I hope it isn&#x27;t discontinued because it is awesome.</li>
            <li> The before and after are remarkable.  Being in my late 60s my eyelashes are quite sparse.  I did not think it would help.  I was somewhat skeptical as many products that make claims that I never see in myself.  This product is beyond belief!!!</li>
            <li> I love Physicians Formula.  Every product I have used has staying power and looks great. The products feel lighter on my skin than any other product I have ever used and I don&#x27;t gave to keep applying during the day.</li>
            <li> I do like this product.  You can&#x27;t put too much mascara or the extensions.  You need to give it a coat so it doesn&#x27;t become too thick and the extensions will get in your eyes.  I definitely noticed a difference.  I recommend this product.  It takes some practice.</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical but this worked amazing. My tiny lashes look like my falsies. No more false lashes n no more lash glue. Love it</li>
            <li> I really like this kit. The first time I used it I did have problems with the fibers getting into my eyes but it stopped after about a minute. It does help to look down into a mirror to apply and also try not to do much blinking after you first apply to give it time to dry without falling into your eyes. Anyway the results are really amazing. I always get compliments on how long my lashes are and my sister actually did think they were extensions. Also I purchased mine at Walmart for $10</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this mascara! Extremely reasonable price too! I love physicians formula!</li>
            <li> I used to swear by the YOUNIQUE 3D lash mascara. I&#x27;ve bought so many as gifts for my family &amp; friends &amp; I even have an extra one to keep in my purse but at 30 + $$ for one tube it can get a little pricey. I then stumbled upon this product, which I can honestly say have blown the 3D out of the water! For half the price!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple tips for you guys.&lt;br /&gt;First &amp; foremost diatribe the mascara along your lashes evenly, focusing on the ends, that&#x27;s where your extensions need to stick the most.&lt;br /&gt;Next, before you apply your extensions, MAKE SURE YOU TAP THE EXCESS FIBERS AT LEAST TWICE. or else you&#x27;ll end up with furry eyeballs.&lt;br /&gt;Then reapply the actual mascara on top of the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always easier for me to apply mascara by looking down into a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;If you feel like you get mascara on your eyelids from doing this you can simply place a business card, a cosmetic sponge or even just a tissue behind your lashes to avoid any marks on your eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;I really feel like this is an amazing product, maybe application should be more focused.&lt;br /&gt;Will repurchase! Always!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Yes, it takes practice, but it is totally worth it! When you are ready to open the container with the fibers, do it with a piece of tissue paper underneath and do it SLOWLY. You WILL have a tiny bit of spillage, but what do you expect with tiny fibers on a brush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am using this product I open the fibers first, again, SLOWLY, and tap it a bit over the container to get most of the fibers to fall back inside of the container, with tissue paper underneath. First, apply the mascara and your fiber brush is ready to go. Repeat for the other eye. I only apply two coats of fibers/mascara and my eyelashes are poppin&#x27;! You will get a tiny bit of fibers on your face but nothing that a big fluffy brush won&#x27;t take care of. I get a ton of compliments when I wear this. Even from my husband, who never notices anything, like another reviewer noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a problem with &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34; lashes or spiky lashes. But hey, according to all the fashion magazines and blogs as of 7/18/15, the spiky lash look is in and was seen on the runways. I could definitely see how you could achieve that look with this product with enough coats.</li>
            <li> This product was completely dried out , both tubes - even the brush fell apart.  It was a complete waste of money.  I threw the whole thing away.  Obviously the quality control on this product is not adequate.</li>
            <li> I have bad allergies, and often my eyes are so irritated that I cannot wear makeup, so when I do wear makeup, I need to make sure that it isn&#x27;t going to irritate my eyes even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have use Physicians Formula produts for a while, and after my old mascara started irritating my eyes, I had to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really really love this stuff. I use it semi regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde eyelashes, and even with regular mascara, you can&#x27;t really see them, and they don&#x27;t pop. This makes them stand out, and I love the look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply this is 3 steps, you use the black actual mascara first, then you add the exentisions (ONLY TO THE ENDS or it gets clumpy), then you seal it again with the mascara. I also like to curl my lashes when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached a photo of my eyes with and without the Physicians Formula Lash Exentision Mascara.</li>
            <li> Like the product but with three applications involved, it takes a little more time than I usually spend on my mascara -- and it did clump slightly.  It definitely gives you the extra length.  I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
            <li> Jury is still out on this product...not good for people who wear contact lens</li>
            <li> This product does what it says...my eyelashes were thicker and longer. It doesn&#x27;t look clumpy either. Highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> what they fail to tell you is that you need long lashes to begin with. they give the impression that you can beautiful lashes just by using this product.  Not true</li>
            <li> I would not say this product is any different than any other mascara/extension product on the market. Tended to clump when applied. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very interesting concept and I liked the results ok, but the lash extension fluff gets everywhere and made it difficult to apply after makeup in my routine. I&#x27;ll be waiting for the technology to improve before exploring again.</li>
            <li> I used this item today and was very pleased with the results...</li>
            <li> First, this set is under $13 at walmart. 2nd,  careful opening the extension bottle- the fibers go everywhere! I&#x27;ll use them on special occasion but there&#x27;s no way to do this on a daily basis. They should add an extra step for having to wipe away all the extra fibers off your face &amp; from your eye. They should have kept the wand separate from the fibers so you can control how many you grab. Only giving it 2 stars. I&#x27;ve tried several of these mascars/fiber sets &amp; this was by far more messy &amp; irritating than the others.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product, would buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Length aviene good ,expected maybe more but is okay</li>
            <li> ok, i didn&#x27;t buy it here but had to leave a review. i wear contacts, daily diposable and almost all mascaras aggravate my eyes. clumps fall into my eyes or i must rub them and somehow mascara residue ends up on my contacts, driving me crazy all day. knowing this, i was very, very apprehensive about this product. i have used it regularly and as long as i stick to one coat of both the mascara and the fibers, no irritation. however, my lashes look amazing!!!!! i normally use lancome or tarte mascara with so so results. one coat of this was amazing enough that even my wonderful husband who doesn&#x27;t notice anything(and i mean anything) said \\&quot;wow your eyelashes look great!\\&quot;  i thought it was easy to use and i don&#x27;t spend more than 5 minutes total on makeup on routine basis. i also don&#x27;t consider myself a makeup maven so ease was really important to me. easy and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product through Amazon but I wanted to put a review out here as I do a lot of shopping on Amazon.  This product is not what I expected.  The fibers are a mess to work with.  Little black fibers end up everywhere just opening the container.  After putting them over the mascara it is really hard to get the ones that fall onto your cheek area off especially if you have already put on your face makeup. The results were also not as dramatic as I had hoped.  I get the same effect with Loreal False Fiber Mascara for a lot less money.  Oh well it was worth the try I guess.  May use for special occasions as I doubt I can take it back.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and only couple of times, my eyes looks longer when i applied it. But hasnt seen improvement on the eyelashes yet (longer natural eyelashes). One think, the top part of the tube (ring) is cut off and stick to the brush which is make it more difficult to use now. I use the brush gentle as always but the tube is cheap made. Well even the grocery store one isnt like this..</li>
            <li> Terrible item, it goes all over the face!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kit!  At first when I bought it, the fibers fell in my eyes and I wasn&#x27;t going to use it anymore. I don&#x27;t wear contacts however I made adjustments.  When applying the fibers, tap the applicator on a tissue or something to get off the access.  I only do steps 1 and 2 once and that is sufficient and my lashes look great.  While applying the fibers, look down a little and try not to blink.  These steps work great for me and I no longer have any problems.  Also, you can purchase this product at Target for less money.  It&#x27;s about $15 in the store.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!! I can&#x27;t believe the results.  It literally looks like your own natural lashes are as flawless as false lashes.  I&#x27;ll continue to use a thin coat of a conditioning mascara first so my own lashes grow, bit other than that, I think the search for the best mascara is over! I found removal was simple using Garnier&#x27;s facial cleansing oil...it simply wiped the mascara and fibers off with no rubbing or issue.  AND you should buy it at CVS, Harmon&#x27;s ($12.59!), Target, etc...anything over $15 is insanity....  THAT BEING SAID, I feel there&#x27;s a bizarre number of negative comments that are not unlike those that resulted in coffee being labeled &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34;...ie basically people who obviously need to be protected because they lack all common sense and personal responsibility....  TO ALL THE CRITICS: learn how to apply makeup!  Simply put, logic suggests that if you take a moment to understand the product you&#x27;re using, at least half the dramatic mishaps people complain about would not happen!  As for eye irritation: ANY product, including moisturizers and even some eye drops, can cause eye irritation.  Haven&#x27;t we all accidentally tapped a mascara wand to our eye and instantly blinked so hard we looked like sobbing raccoons??? SOFT CONTACT USERS: wake up!  I wear soft contacts...so I know if you get moisturizer on your fingers and then put in a lens...or get eyeshadow in your eye...or a hair from a make brush comes loose, etc...you&#x27;ll end up with it somehow caught in a lens!  Keep your lenses out until your makeup is in if possible (if not necessary to apply makeup) or simple realize the nature of working with fine, dry, micro particles and act accordingly.  Sorry to sound harsh, but this is an amazing product that delivers exactly what it promises and doesn&#x27;t deserve the type of negative comments it&#x27;s receiving.  ***I am NOT A PAID REVIEWER, I have NO ASSOCIATION TO PHYSICIANS FORMULA and I have NEVER RECEIVED ANY FREE PRODUCTS FOR A REVIEW.  I just don&#x27;t like nonsense!</li>
            <li> Too flaky for me. The powder went everywhere but on my eyelashes. Big mess.......lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Interesting product.  The smaller tube is full of tiny little hair like pieces.  First apply the mascara, then swipe on some of the little micro fibers that stick to your lashes and mascara.  Then swipe the mascara again.  The video I watched said to do that twice so I did.  I ended up with way too much on my lashes.  Weird thing was at the end of the day when I looked in the mirror I had a bunch of the little fibers under my eyes as if I&#x27;d been shedding all day!  Kinda weird.  Next time I used it I only applied the fibers once and I didn&#x27;t get the shedding affect.  I would say the product works but you need a little trial and error to get good at the application and see what works best for you.  Me personally, I don&#x27;t like a really fake look so one application suits me.  Someone else might like more.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a product worth trying.  I&#x27;m using it more for date night and not an every day application.</li>
            <li> This product flaked off everywhere and irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I would use false eyelashes when I needed to look like I had eyelashes.  My lashes are short and don&#x27;t stay curled.  I have tried all different types and brands of mascara.  Some of them pretty expensive.  Since buying this product, I love, love, love my own eyelashes!  I actually had a friend make a comment this weekend about me wearing false eyelashes.  I told her that these were mine, Thank you very much!  She could not believe the difference.  Another review recommended using a handheld mirror and look down into it while applying step 2.  This works great and I don&#x27;t have any problem with small black fibers settling under eyes or on cheek area.  You need to do this....very important.  Another bonus is my eyelashes stay curled after using this product I would recommend this to anyone, even those of you already have pretty eyelashes.  This product can only make them better.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Powder-like fibers ended up all over my eyelids and down my cheeks. It was a mess. I get better results reapplying my mascara several times. I hope Target will refund my money.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff soooo much!!!! i hate when the little fibers get in my eye, so make sure you tap the wand with the fibers to get any fly aways off.</li>
            <li> Bought it at Wal-Mart three days ago for $12.93 and love it. So first, do your homework; the ladies concerned about the fibers most likley are suffering from user error. They are fibers, not powder, and they will go everywhere if you don&#x27;t tap the fiber wand first like the directions specifically outline as a necessary step. I read all the one stars and except the girl whose tube broke and the contacts lady, those complaints sound like they stem from first time, inexperienced users. Heres my experience; 1) my lashes are non existent at best, i mean i wear false almost daily to not look like i have some weird eyelash disorder and this mascara worked. 2) The application: first coat lashes with the mascara like you would normally, immediatly follow up with fibers. So fiber; yes, the feathery little fibers were EVERYWHERE; my eye, my cheeck, on my nose, up my nose, all over-the first time, and i didnt tap the wand that well.You have to play with it a bit and figure it out, i like to pull out the fiber wand 3/4 and tap the top firmly a few times, then pull it out slowley while continuing to lightly tap the flat top of the fiber wand. 3) Immediatly follow up with another application of the mascara. Repeat 2-3 times. You have to play with the mascara after the fibers a bit to get your lashes how you want, it comes out a bit spidery and clumpy at first, just wiggle the mascara wand while gingerly dragging up your lashes. Some pointers: precurl, don&#x27;t post curl, putting a compact on the sink and leaning over it is a decent idea, don&#x27;t post coat with your regular mascara, it takes the fibers off, precoating your lashes is a good booster, but not necessary for an instant, damatic difference, it washes off with no issues- I oil clense and have had no issue with my lashes coming 100% clean-and finally, when applied properly, these babies have staying power! You wont wake up with mascara smudged up your forhead, on your pillow, your arm or under your eye.&lt;br /&gt;I got nothing for this review, I don&#x27;t work for the sellar, didn&#x27;t buy it from the seller, I just wanted to see if it was cheaper on Amazon.com, then i read all the one stars and literally, out loud, said these holy crap, these(one star) people are so miss leading!!! I HAVE to leave a real review. I hope this helps!his review, I don&#x27;t work for the sellar, didn&#x27;t buy it from the seller, I just wanted to see if it was cheaper on Amazon.com, then i read all the one stars and literally, out loud, said these holy crap, these(one star) people are so miss leading!!!

            <li> I would not recommend this for contact lens wearers. I had to remove it in just a couple of hours after applying as an occasional fiber would fall into my eye and irritate my contacts.</li>
            <li> I love the product! You can get it for $14.99 at the drug store so anything more than that is a rip-off. I found the secret to using this product successfully so it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. Apply the first coat of mascara to one eye. Take a mirror and look down into it to apply the lash extensions. Continue to look down into the mirror and apply a few swipes of mascara before straightening up to fix your eye lashes the way you want them to look. You should only need do this process twice to get the best effect. I never get anything in my eyes or have irritation this way. I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Love it, does what it says. My lashes look thick and much longer without looking like spiders.  Easy to apply too and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It does work in making the lashes appear thicker and longer.  When applying the lengthening fibers, just be sure to flick the brush after removing it from the container in order to get rid of excess fibers.  The produce does as advertised.</li>
            <li> I paid $15.00 at Ulta. I am a fan of pf fake out masacara and this one is Fabulous. It does what it says lengthens lashes and makes them look fuller instantly. I Didn&#x27;t get clumping or eye irritation. The fibers do have a lot of fall out and go everywhere but that&#x27;s why you have to tap the brush before applying it.. I Think it works great and better than Loreal&#x27;s voluminous false fiber mascara. I use this on date night&amp;special occasions. My go to mascara for great fake looking lashes but are REAL!.</li>
            <li> The product was used and mascara was dry not a NEW item. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This product really works and the look is even better than the YouTube demo. However, and this is a big however, the fibers fall into your eyes. You can feel them when you apply and all day long. It drove me insane and I cannot wear it. $27 down the drain.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really make my lashes look thicker and very messy, little powder lashes end up all over your face.  I was disappointed!</li>
            <li> Makes lashes really thick</li>
            <li> Makes a difference in your eyes and face looks fabulous. I&#x27;m very satisfied...</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product at first, however giving it a second try and I really like it now .... It does make my lashes look full and think as promised. I didn&#x27;t like how the extension wand left black dust under your eyes when you apply it to your lashes it it wipes clean with just a brush .</li>
            <li> This product works well in concept - in fact, for me, it even worked well in practice! The fibers don&#x27;t instantly migrate to your eyes and the mascara itself isn&#x27;t too clumpy. The big problem I had was that it left me with raccoon eyes after a few hours, but with some shellac, no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER! After maybe a week of use, the inner ring on the mascara just snapped off - so the brush didn&#x27;t have a little ring to wipe off the excess or keep the product protected from air or contamination. Pretty much a waste. I tried to use it carefully but realized that the mascara was drying out (and putting on huge globs because the brush didn&#x27;t get wiped off is a waste that also looks terrible). I wrote customer service and they were passive-aggressive dicks who didn&#x27;t really try to resolve the problem. I will never buy anything from this company again and hope they enjoy my money since clearly my money was more valuable to them than keeping me as a customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product IF IT WORKED! Great customer service if you like condescension and unhelpfulness!</li>
            <li> I found out that the smaller container (the extension) is a fluffy material that flies all over the place.  Then, throughout the day it gets into your eyes from blinking.  Not good for contact wearers.  The commercial implies that putting the mascara and extension is quick, as each has to be applied twice.  Not so fast.  If you want a darker and longer look - apply three times.  Needs a bit of focus time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this product.</li>
            <li> OMG! I love this lash booster.  I&#x27;ve tried others, some very expensive, and ended up throwing them all away for one reason or another.  This one goes on easy and quick, and REALLY extends lashes dramatically.  Also washes off easily, something that is very important to me. Also, my eyes are very sensitive and allergy prone but this lash booster doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.  I do suggest holding off on your under eye concealer until AFTER using the lash booster. During application some of the little fibers might fall onto your under eye area, and they&#x27;re easy to brush away from clean, dry skin, but a little more difficult if you have makeup on the skin.</li>
            <li> They definitely extend your lashes but they&#x27;re terribly irritating. The extension tube is filled with powder that goes everywhere. Including all over your face and into your eyes when you&#x27;re trying to put it on. Plus you can buy this at any drug store for about 16$. Not worth it but it&#x27;s definitely not worth the 30 on here. Just saying.</li>
