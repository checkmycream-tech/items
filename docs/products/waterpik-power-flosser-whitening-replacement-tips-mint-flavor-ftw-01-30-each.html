            <li>These are perfect for anyone with braces.  </li>
            <li>It is very good for the gums.</li>
            <li>These replacement tips were very good.</li>
            <li>This product works great for me as I dislike utilizing string style floss between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>They are great for cleaning the gums and between the teeth gum area.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, easy to use and a good price.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still as good as or better than the water pik</li>
            <li>Good service and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>-- I got these flosser tips out of curiosity mostly, but get so much more flossing time with these tips that it more than makes up for the price</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re certainly much more durable thn</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable in my opinion and again the product works great.</li>
            <li>There is nothing more to say beside these floossers do their job</li>
            <li>I feel better using the string floss and a water pik.</li>
            <li>I have used easyer to use than floss that for sure.</li>
            <li>But more portable.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with Plackers and it has helped keep my gums healthy now that I have braces.</li>
            <li>; Clean yes, but &amp;#34;whiter?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Right!</li>
            <li>I love the whole battery flosser for that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got braces as an older person having never had braces and freaked about how to dental floss and keep my gums and teeth healthy during the brace period.</li>
            <li>Well worth a try for the savings</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be any difference between these and the cheaper tips as far as fitting onto the flosser is concerned.</li>
            <li>They clean really well, dislodge food particles and stimulate the gums.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Really none!</li>
            <li>the shiny blue tips -- I can go over my whole mouth many times before the tips bend into unusability.&lt;br /&gt;Seems</li>
            <li>And safe yourself some money and buy the blue system to begin with the flosser as you can then purchase these tips if you really want to.</li>
            <li>received in a timely and positive fashion</li>
            <li>Not a fan of flossing, but this makes it easy, especially around the permanent retainer that is bonded to my teeth by my orthodontist.</li>
            <li>I really like this system.</li>
            <li>Both the whitening tips and regular tips fit the unit.</li>
            <li>really is there anything to it?</li>
            <li>Really 5 stars for portablity for the whole system.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone whose particular about their dental care.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s blue tips get a big 5 stars for coming to my aid and effective in cleaning between my gums right past the braces.</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday - it really helps keep my teeth clean (especially after eating corn-on-the-cob and some meats.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They also seem clean better, with an ever so slightly roughened surface and possibly a bit more thickness at the base.  </li>
            <li>pretty darn silly to try to sell something that&#x27;s supposed to clean BETWEEN my teeth as &amp;#34;whitening.&amp;#34</li>

Doesn&#x27;t seem to be any difference between these and the cheaper tips as far as fitting onto the flosser is concerned.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, easy to use and a good price.  Watch out for shipping costs!!!  I use this product everyday - it really helps keep my teeth clean (especially after eating corn-on-the-cob and some meats.  Thank you very much.</li>

            <li> This is whast I ordered for my flosser. it fits. There is nothing more to say beside these floossers do their job&lt;br /&gt;..</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002NPB8F6 Waterpik Replacement Jet Tips - JT-100E - 2 Pack]]  These are perfect for anyone with braces.  They clean really well, dislodge food particles and stimulate the gums.  I would recommend these to anyone whose particular about their dental care.</li>
            <li> I feel better using the string floss and a water pik. This gadget just did not work for me and my schedule.</li>
            <li> A necessity if you have the flosser that these go with!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Just what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I have used easyer to use than floss that for sure. Tips go prettty fast if you use everyday so stock up.</li>
            <li> Good service and shipped quickly.  Would do business again if and when I need it.  Both the whitening tips and regular tips fit the unit.</li>
            <li> THough it works in either of the flossers they sell...I have seen no advantage to these whitening tips. I bought them both together with an order for the regular ones. I may think they are a bit stronger as they seem to hold up a day or two use. I&#x27;ve got braces as an older person having never had braces and freaked about how to dental floss and keep my gums and teeth healthy during the brace period. So led me to try these out. They are great for cleaning the gums and between the teeth gum area. I love the whole battery flosser for that. BUT I can&#x27;t see the more expensive of these white tips verses the blue ones. And I see no whitening effect at all. I have my doubts about it at all frankly as in really is there anything to it? No scent no notice of any detergent effect or taste release from these compared to the blue tips. Nothing at all. And no difference in atual performance of one over the other. So I&#x27;ll just buy the blue tips from now on. And safe yourself some money and buy the blue system to begin with the flosser as you can then purchase these tips if you really want to. I do wish I could pick a color as I hate blue but they are selected for you...pink or greenish or blue. Right! It works so no problem. So these are ditched only because there is no evidence as to whitening effectiveness at all. Really none! Overall however the little battery flosser and it&#x27;s blue tips get a big 5 stars for coming to my aid and effective in cleaning between my gums right past the braces. They do not clean the upper teeth...I do a faux sort of half measure with floss still there. These also do not fit well in my farthest back molars and back teeth but it&#x27;s still as good as or better than the water pik I also use. But more portable. Really 5 stars for portablity for the whole system.</li>
            <li> thank you, it is just what I needed and hard to find at the stores...</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Plackers and it has helped keep my gums healthy now that I have braces.</li>
