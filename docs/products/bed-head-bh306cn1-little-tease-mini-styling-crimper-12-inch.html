            <li>This is great for doing pieces of your hair.</li>
            <li>Crimpers are great for adding volume to your hair without teasing it...</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s a great started item for her.</li>
            <li>Great value, for great price.</li>
            <li>This was great..</li>
            <li>You are supposed to turn it off before unplugging, but the location of the switch doesn&#x27;t make that seem like a good idea.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However that all being said, my daughter loved it</li>
            <li>love this mini crimper!</li>
            <li>It does not have a temperature control, but it&#x27;s a great hot tool.</li>
            <li>It takes two hands to shut it if you want to crimp more than a wisp of hair.</li>
            <li>Which, most of the time, is probably all you are doing.</li>
            <li>you are getting and don&#x27;t expect it to do more than that.</li>
            <li>I bought this one for touchup and roots for more volume and body.  </li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok price.</li>
            <li>I find it more time consuming than just tease my hair</li>
            <li>, 400 degree does way more damage</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a lot more precise than rollers!).</li>
            <li>I feel like that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t love this tool.  </li>
            <li>and you dont want to crimp more then one peice of hair</li>
            <li>Bed head is a great, sturdy product and since it is so great, I ended up ordering the larger size like I wanted originally.</li>
            <li>completely adore this product and would recommend to all, plus it was super cheap and from a great name!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much:) just love it:)</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, avoid this product.  </li>
            <li>It crimps fantastically and adds great texture, but makes me very nervous about how unnecessarily hot it gets.</li>
            <li>but it serves it purpose just fine and fast&lt;</li>
            <li>Cheap product.</li>
            <li>I even got free shipping on Prime.</li>
            <li>Just like the size it work great on short hair..</li>
            <li>then I recommend you tease your hair the good old way and save $.</li>
            <li>This is a massive and welcome change as my hair does not hold height under hot, humid conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t even good enough for my hair for one night.</li>
            <li>With this, I am able to boost my hair upwards of anywhere from 1-6 inches depending on how much I choose to crimp underneath.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get that it was a super mini</li>
            <li>This is a great little crimper for adding volume at the root...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned (or operated) a crimper before, but I thought it might be fun to try one out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having fun with it.  </li>
            <li>Then, I leave the top sections free and fold the hair back over to</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, and decent for the price, but of you are using it for fullness or volume, I would spend more money on a different crimper.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It heats up quickly and adds as much volume as backcombing would&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the time I can just shut it and the open it right up again and the hair is crimped.</li>
            <li>And fast!</li>
            <li>The product works great, but it really is just too small.</li>
            <li>omg really hot</li>
            <li>It heats up extremely fast and I was surprised how quick it was to &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
            <li>Great little tiny crimper...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crimper heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>I reviewed the 2\\&quot; crimper which I really like.  </li>
            <li>heat up fast and it works so well,</li>
            <li>Very compact.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>tool really needs a heat regulator.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;*I would not recommend if you are wanting to do you whole head in crimps</li>
            <li>Especially when it&#x27;s so hot, outside part of the metal plant gets super hot.</li>
            <li>No temperature control, it only has one setting, super</li>
            <li>This is a cute little tool that does crimped the hair like described.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional hair stylist and was looking at buying a much more expensive one, but this one will do the trick just fine for me.</li>
            <li>The funny thing is I was the same age when the crimper was a required bathroom accessory for girls.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and crimps small amounts of hair, then you cover the crimped section with straight hair and vualia!!!</li>
            <li>Spend a little more money and get a larger crimper.</li>
            <li>the old fashion way to get the volume I want.</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural place</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I really wanted a mini crimper and didn&#x27;t want to wait until this seasons regular crimpers to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it being so small it is easy to have the plate touch the scape</li>
            <li>The idea is not to &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; your hair with this tool (Bed Head make a wider barrel for that very reason), but to use it as a longer term solution to flat, lackluster hair.</li>
            <li>The tool is small for a reason -- you want to be able to get it as close to the roots as possible without burning yourself.</li>
            <li>All I do is start from the half way down my head (tying off the top layers), and working up line by line to add new layers into the roots all the way around the crown.</li>
            <li>crimp is super tiny (which I love when you&#x27;re traveling) but it also makes it hard to hold and crimp it down.</li>
            <li>It is small, it heats up really fast, and it crimps small chunks of hair nicely.</li>
            <li>But my little sister wanted me to crimp all of her foot long hair with this tiny crimper, so I&#x27;ve used this device far more in that one time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly large crimp actually, for people who probably want to crimp on the outside.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use hairspray, as it lasts a long time -- I use a heat protector and the tool for the shortest time possible -- even instant gives the right effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really get hot enough to do anything in my experience, and it&#x27;s a bit too small.</li>
            <li>first I was upset because it is a lot smaller than expected</li>
            <li>simply because when I close the crimper sometimes it doesn&#x27;t line up just perfect, but it&#x27;s only mildly annoying and not a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li>This is not what I thought it was, it was my bad not the sellers, my little ones sure enjoy it!</li>
            <li>In addition to being too darn small to do all of your hair (unless it is very short I guess), it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>This product is great for side bangs or small sections of hair but not intended to crip all the hair as you hand gets tired and it takes too long.</li>
            <li>And because it is so small, it can only fit a small amount of hair, so it also works really fast.</li>
            <li>Its mini in size about half the size of a regular crimper, but no one crimps their whole head anyway.</li>

            <li> Good for thin and thick hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;I would be careful using this on small children because it very hot on the outside&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;</li>
            <li> My complaint would be that the handle gets really hot.</li>
            <li> But the crimped sections are too small to really add any volume to my hair.</li>

            <li> hair won&#x27;t go flat (even after sleeping on it) until I wash it out</li>
            <li> I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be very big, but I was still surprised at how small it is.</li>
            <li> The cord is maybe 3 feet long.</li>
            <li> You basically want to touch your hair with it for as close to half a second as possible.  </li>
            <li> The plates are maybe 2 inches long (and of course, 1/2  inch wide).</li>
            <li> A few strips around the face and such.</li>
            <li> Would not really recommend this item.</li>
            <li> i spent 20$.</li>
            <li> Plus it takes too long to make little sections in the crown of my head to crimp them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit useless really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and my hair is fine/medium but thick.</li>
            <li> I almost burned my finger when I was holding the crimp down.</li>
            <li> I am writing this reviews in the hopes that others won&#x27;t be mislead by previous comments...</li>
            <li> It also heats up to over 400 degrees and crimps hair within 3 seconds or less.</li>
            <li> so the crimped sections are hidden underneath.</li>
            <li> This little guy is for accent.</li>
            <li> little crimper does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Crimping my roots with this little gadget and then blow drying it out gives my hair</li>
            <li> Also I expected it to be small, but this is like size of my hand small with a two finger width.</li>
            <li> I also add a few extras on the sides or where my parting is to add to the finished shape of the volume</li>
            <li> little crimper is indeed very little.</li>
            <li> This crimper was the hilight of my little girl&#x27;s Christmas!  </li>
            <li> I read that it was small, but small doesn&#x27;t begin to describe this.</li>
            <li> I would say this one is a limitless too small of a crimp to serve that purpose.</li>
            <li> however I did not realize it would be so small.</li>
            <li> Way too small.</li>
            <li> , this is a small crimping tool.</li>
            <li> it is to small</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a normal size crimper and was somewhat disappointed that it was so small.</li>
            <li> Let me clarify that this product is not intended to crimp all your hair, the reason it is small and thin, so it can get close to the roots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li> Even for travel, I&#x27;d probably leave this behind.</li>
            <li> Unless you hair is EXTREMLY  thin</li>
            <li> and it looks like crap.</li>
            <li> it is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a crimper for my girls and was very disappointed to get this.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned (or operated) a crimper before, but I thought it might be fun to try one out. So I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little crimper is indeed very little. I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be very big, but I was still surprised at how small it is. It is about the length of a pencil. The plates are maybe 2 inches long (and of course, 1/2  inch wide). The cord is maybe 3 feet long. There are no temperature settings (it just heats up to 400º). The on/off switch is located below the bottom plate on the inside of the crimper. You are supposed to turn it off before unplugging, but the location of the switch doesn&#x27;t make that seem like a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crimper heats up really fast. And because it is so small, it can only fit a small amount of hair, so it also works really fast. Most of the time I can just shut it and the open it right up again and the hair is crimped. The problem is that the crimper doesn&#x27;t have a lot of closing power. It takes two hands to shut it if you want to crimp more than a wisp of hair. Which, most of the time, is probably all you are doing. But my little sister wanted me to crimp all of her foot long hair with this tiny crimper, so I&#x27;ve used this device far more in that one time then I will probably ever use ever again. I&#x27;d advise against this crimper if that is the sort of use you have in mind. This little guy is for accent. A few strips around the face and such. In addition to being too darn small to do all of your hair (unless it is very short I guess), it gets very hot. I had to wear heat protectant gloves and had to take breaks because it was still too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little crimper does what it claims to do. It is small, it heats up really fast, and it crimps small chunks of hair nicely. Just know what it is you are getting and don&#x27;t expect it to do more than that.</li>
            <li> I reviewed the 2\\&quot; crimper which I really like.  I bought this one for touchup and roots for more volume and body.  I&#x27;m having fun with it.  It does not have a temperature control, but it&#x27;s a great hot tool.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I can use that for my Barbie&#x27;s\\&quot; is what my child said. I read that it was small, but small doesn&#x27;t begin to describe this. It is literally the size of a marker. Not just the length, the entire size.</li>
            <li> Crimping my roots with this little gadget and then blow drying it out gives my hair the extra volume I was looking for. I took away one star simply because when I close the crimper sometimes it doesn&#x27;t line up just perfect, but it&#x27;s only mildly annoying and not a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. We both love it. Works great! And fast! Good for thin and thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is great for doing pieces of your hair. The product works great, but it really is just too small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok price. the travel size is perfect for me. heat up fast and it works so well, love this mini crimper!</li>
            <li> Crimpers are great for adding volume to your hair without teasing it... I would say this one is a limitless too small of a crimp to serve that purpose. Also I expected it to be small, but this is like size of my hand small with a two finger width. It&#x27;s cute, and decent for the price, but of you are using it for fullness or volume, I would spend more money on a different crimper.</li>
            <li> Works as stated. Very compact. Heats up quickly. My complaint would be that the handle gets really hot. I use it to crimp my roots for some volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a crimper for volume purposes--crimping underneath layers of hair--and this just wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for. It&#x27;s a fairly large crimp actually, for people who probably want to crimp on the outside. But even for that, this just doesn&#x27;t quite cut it. It doesn&#x27;t really get hot enough to do anything in my experience, and it&#x27;s a bit too small. Even for travel, I&#x27;d probably leave this behind. It&#x27;s a bit useless really.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a normal size crimper and was somewhat disappointed that it was so small. This product is great for side bangs or small sections of hair but not intended to crip all the hair as you hand gets tired and it takes too long. Bed head is a great, sturdy product and since it is so great, I ended up ordering the larger size like I wanted originally.</li>
            <li> This is not what I thought it was, it was my bad not the sellers, my little ones sure enjoy it!</li>
            <li> This is a neat item however I did not realize it would be so small. I realized that it was a 1/2 crimper but I thought that would be the width, the length is pretty small also. However that all being said, my daughter loved it and I think it&#x27;s a great started item for her.</li>
            <li> This crimper was the hilight of my little girl&#x27;s Christmas!  The funny thing is I was the same age when the crimper was a required bathroom accessory for girls.</li>
            <li> I like the size of the tool for smaller sections of hair.  Would not work if you wanted to do lots of your hair or entire hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great little crimper for adding volume at the root...  I am a professional hair stylist and was looking at buying a much more expensive one, but this one will do the trick just fine for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and my hair is fine/medium but thick. This is a cute little tool that does crimped the hair like described.  But the crimped sections are too small to really add any volume to my hair. Plus it takes too long to make little sections in the crown of my head to crimp them. I find it more time consuming than just tease my hair the old fashion way to get the volume I want. If you are buying this to add volume to your hair then I recommend you tease your hair the good old way and save $. Hope this helps those who are looking to buy this tool.</li>
            <li> The product only has an on/off button, you either get 400 degree or nothing. I don&#x27;t usually need that hot, 400 degree does way more damage than it should to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crimp is super tiny (which I love when you&#x27;re traveling) but it also makes it hard to hold and crimp it down. Especially when it&#x27;s so hot, outside part of the metal plant gets super hot. I almost burned my finger when I was holding the crimp down. I had to returned them.</li>
            <li> Let me clarify that this product is not intended to crimp all your hair, the reason it is small and thin, so it can get close to the roots. It heats up fast and crimps small amounts of hair, then you cover the crimped section with straight hair and vualia!!! you have fuller hair in only 2 min. Do not overdue it, because it gets fuller when you comb. Great value, for great price.</li>
            <li> Great little tiny crimper...but only if you are scattering thru the hairstyle . Too small for doing whole head unless you&#x27;ve got a lot of time and patience....</li>
            <li> No coating at all on the metal &#x3D; massive hair damage.  No temperature control, it only has one setting, super omg really hot wow.  If you have fine hair, avoid this product.  You basically want to touch your hair with it for as close to half a second as possible.  If you leave it in your hair for a count of 8 or 10, guaranteed you&#x27;ll be causing massive damage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small. Frays hair and makes your hair frizzy and damaged. Would not really recommend this item. Get a wave maker not a crisper.</li>
            <li> Way too small. Cheap product. Didn&#x27;t really do anything. Spend a little more money and get a larger crimper. I just bought it for Halloween but it wasn&#x27;t even good enough for my hair for one night.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced for the size and ability. I was looking for a crimper for my girls and was very disappointed to get this. I didn&#x27;t get that it was a super mini and it looks like crap. It went in the trash...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece for christmas and it is the perfect size for her. Its mini in size about half the size of a regular crimper, but no one crimps their whole head anyway.</li>
            <li> I am writing this reviews in the hopes that others won&#x27;t be mislead by previous comments...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is a small crimping tool. It also heats up to over 400 degrees and crimps hair within 3 seconds or less. It heats up extremely fast and I was surprised how quick it was to &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; my hair. The tool is small for a reason -- you want to be able to get it as close to the roots as possible without burning yourself. The idea is not to &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; your hair with this tool (Bed Head make a wider barrel for that very reason), but to use it as a longer term solution to flat, lackluster hair. With this, I am able to boost my hair upwards of anywhere from 1-6 inches depending on how much I choose to crimp underneath. This is a massive and welcome change as my hair does not hold height under hot, humid conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair won&#x27;t go flat (even after sleeping on it) until I wash it out and it saves me hair spray, time, rollers, curlers etc. All I do is start from the half way down my head (tying off the top layers), and working up line by line to add new layers into the roots all the way around the crown. I also add a few extras on the sides or where my parting is to add to the finished shape of the volume (it&#x27;s a lot more precise than rollers!). Then, I leave the top sections free and fold the hair back over to it&#x27;s natural place so the crimped sections are hidden underneath. I don&#x27;t use hairspray, as it lasts a long time -- I use a heat protector and the tool for the shortest time possible -- even instant gives the right effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely adore this product and would recommend to all, plus it was super cheap and from a great name! I even got free shipping on Prime. So, so happy!</li>
            <li> I use heat protections and add moisture back in to my hair every time I use this because this tool makes my hair feel like it is damaged.  I know my hair isn&#x27;t damaged because I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and use the proper tools and products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I really wanted a mini crimper and didn&#x27;t want to wait until this seasons regular crimpers to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool really needs a heat regulator.  I feel like that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t love this tool.  It crimps fantastically and adds great texture, but makes me very nervous about how unnecessarily hot it gets.</li>
            <li> I thought it was bigger. I have never seen one of these before and didn&#x27;t know it was so mini.</li>
            <li> PRO:&lt;br /&gt;I use it only at my roots&lt;br /&gt;at first I was upset because it is a lot smaller than expected but it serves it purpose just fine and fast&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and adds as much volume as backcombing would&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;I would be careful using this on small children because it very hot on the outside&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;with it being so small it is easy to have the plate touch the scape&lt;br /&gt;*I would not recommend if you are wanting to do you whole head in crimps it is to small</li>
            <li> This was great.. Just like the size it work great on short hair.. Thank you so much:) just love it:)</li>
            <li> i spent 20$. it is a piece of crap.Unless you hair is EXTREMLY  thin and you dont want to crimp more then one peice of hair i wouldnt bother to get it.</li>
