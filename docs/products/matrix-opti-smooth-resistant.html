            <li>It smells great and it really lasts forever!!</li>
            <li>so it mostly tamed my curls and removed some of the frizz.</li>
            <li>It will damage it even more if you color your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still so much better than it was before though</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels healthy even after the treatment.</li>
            <li>but I understand that is only for professionals, I had to get certified so that it can work, it is excellent!!!</li>
            <li>I have try many</li>
            <li>Sure there was fumes and it made my eyes watery</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but it is okay</li>
            <li>Follow instructions perfectly and look up instructions in other reviews.  </li>
            <li>but so far truly amazing!</li>
            <li>My hair was a frizzy mess and now its gorgeous!</li>
            <li>It was so easy even for first timers.</li>
            <li>This product is great for people whose hair is curly or extremely wavy with lots of frizz.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super curly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because smoothed hair takes much less energy to manage.  </li>
            <li>my hair is smooth and super straight.</li>

            <li>I struggle to find a good salon/product that will actually keep my hair straight</li>
            <li>I showed it to my husband and he went right to work, since he would otherwise be picking up a $500 tab at a salon.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t damage hair, actually the hair is super smooth for MONTHS!</li>
            <li>I have super curly frizzy hair and this leaves it pin straight.</li>
            <li>You do need a good flat iron if you want it super straight or not for slight waves.</li>
            <li>my hairdresser has been using this on my hair and is the only thing that makes my hair silky smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>As we did this, my friends were complaining that the solution is really stinky...</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and worked well for me even though my hair did get damaged a bit.</li>
            <li>This product worked very well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is absolutely straight and very shiny after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I would rather go with the Keratin Complex to be honest.</li>
            <li>I still have to quickly run a flat iron through my hair, but that is only for styling purposes.</li>
            <li>I used to pay over $200 to get a japanese straight perm at a salon.</li>
            <li>but I think I should have left one of the products on closer to the end of the recommended time because my hair isn&#x27;t pin straight</li>
            <li>It requires trained professional.</li>
            <li>I used to paid over 300 hundred dollars to get it done by a professional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t do yourself, so I got my 14 year old daughter to do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only way to undo the damage it to cut it and let the hair grow in its natural hair.</li>
            <li>and only takes me about 5-10 minutes to straighten it completely (before I was looking at about 45 minutes to straighten).</li>
            <li>Silky soft and smooth and my hair is color treated with a dark dark brown.</li>
            <li>Should not be sold to general public</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry it or nothing.  </li>
            <li> and I have always gone to salons and spent $250-350 to get my hair straighthened the way I wanted</li>

            <li> I have very thick black hair, and one application (the entire box) lasts about 2-3 months.  </li>

            <li> ( it&#x27;s long and very thick).  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> It smell awful for at least 3 days, but its worth it if you ask me.</li>

            <li> Amazing product. I have super curly frizzy hair and this leaves it pin straight. Be warned that it does change the texture of your hair. But unlike other products it does little damage and the smell doesn&#x27;t make you think your brain cells are dying. My hair is super curly so it mostly tamed my curls and removed some of the frizz. I have done the treatments twice already (since there was enough for two applications). I can&#x27;t wait to use it again. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used to pay over $200 to get a japanese straight perm at a salon. I bought this to save money and because no salon in my are would charge less than $500. I went on youtube and found a video on how to apply this. I showed it to my husband and he went right to work, since he would otherwise be picking up a $500 tab at a salon. It was so easy even for first timers. It does take a really long time and there is no way you can do this yourself. It smell awful for at least 3 days, but its worth it if you ask me. Also, this kit contains 2 applications or 1 for really long hair. I did not realize this until after I was 3/4 of the way through the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone with unruly unmanageable hair that not even a keratin smoothing treatment can tame. I still have to quickly run a flat iron through my hair, but that is only for styling purposes.</li>
            <li> If you have the patience to do it yourself, this works.  I have very thick black hair, and one application (the entire box) lasts about 2-3 months.  It&#x27;s great because smoothed hair takes much less energy to manage.  As we did this, my friends were complaining that the solution is really stinky... but what do you expect?</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and worked well for me even though my hair did get damaged a bit.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a very long time over a few years. While it works great at smoothing. In the long run it will damage your hair a lot. The only way to undo the damage it to cut it and let the hair grow in its natural hair. It will also make your hair prone to split ends. It will damage it even more if you color your hair.  So beware. I would rather go with the Keratin Complex to be honest.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well but I have pretty thick rough hair and it took about 5 and a half hours to complete. Next time I will ask another person to help and hopefully it will go a bit faster. This did work well but I think I should have left one of the products on closer to the end of the recommended time because my hair isn&#x27;t pin straight, it still has a bit of wave to it. It&#x27;s still so much better than it was before though and only takes me about 5-10 minutes to straighten it completely (before I was looking at about 45 minutes to straighten). My hair looks and feels healthy even after the treatment. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working this product, do not get it in PR but I understand that is only for professionals, I had to get certified so that it can work, it is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Could not use this product.  It requires trained professional. Should not be sold to general public</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a decade. I think they changed the formula a bit recently, but I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No formaldehyde in this product.</li>
            <li> Best hair relaxer I have Ever used won&#x27;t dry your hair out  kerton  keeps a hair conditioned  I have try many this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> So I have always had curly hair and I have always gone to salons and spent $250-350 to get my hair straighthened the way I wanted but even then it only lasted a few weeks. I struggle to find a good salon/product that will actually keep my hair straight and this one did just that then exceeeded my expectations. Sure there was fumes and it made my eyes watery but we can all move past that given that I have straight hair now.</li>
            <li> does any one knp if it bring 2 aplication or just one?? thank you for the help..</li>
            <li> this product always works well. I love it. perfect for people that have curly hair but want straight. just know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> I guess I didnt leave it on long enough but it is okay</li>
            <li> totally messed up my hair. followed instructions step by step, didn&#x27;t work at all and damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> this is the BEST straightener ever! it doesn&#x27;t damage hair, actually the hair is super smooth for MONTHS! It smells great and it really lasts forever!! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This product is great for people whose hair is curly or extremely wavy with lots of frizz.  I have for years tried to control my hair with deep conditions, straightener (you name it, I tried it) and flat ironing. Where all have done the trick but none can hold up against humid weather, rain or sweat. I don&#x27;t have the time to fool around with my hair every day nor do I have the time to constantly take care of it properly. Tell you the truth, I used to keep my hair long so that I can just put it up in a bun or ponytail. But with this product I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair until about six months from the time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used to paid over 300 hundred dollars to get it done by a professional. Until one day the person that used to straighten my hair left town and I found myself stuck because everyone who do the Japanese straightener wanted to charge me over 500 dollars. Well that was just too steep for me. So I looked into possibly doing it my self. I bought the product for resistant hair because I remember my hairdresser said that&#x27;s the one she used on me ( there are 3 types). It&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t do yourself, so I got my 14 year old daughter to do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took 5 hours to do my hair ( it&#x27;s long and very thick).  It&#x27;s not that difficult to do and the directions are easy to follow. You do need a good flat iron if you want it super straight or not for slight waves. You can even go on line to see a video on how to do the Opti Smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once done,  my hair is smooth and super straight. You can&#x27;t  wash or put your hair up for 3 days. But that&#x27;s a small price to pay. I virtually do nothing to my hair but wash and condition it. I don&#x27;t blow dry it or nothing.  It looks and feels well control even on bad weather; something I couldn&#x27;t say before. I only have to start flat iron my hair about 4 or 5 months after having straighten it. But it only takes me 1/3 the time to totally flat iron my hair then it did before.&lt;br /&gt;This is about the time when I will get it done again. Also, when I do want my hair curly, I just put hair spray and use a curly iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product for any one who wants to smooth out and control fizz hair, just get a friend to help out and save lots of money. Maybe you can get your friend a nice gift or take her out for dinner with the money you save.the time when I will get it done again.

            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is absolutely straight and very shiny after using this product.  Follow instructions perfectly and look up instructions in other reviews.  Put extra conditioners as suggested 2 weeks in advance and get the flat iron recommended.</li>
            <li> just did it took 3 hours on long hair. Haven&#x27;t washed it yet but so far truly amazing! My hair was a frizzy mess and now its gorgeous! Silky soft and smooth and my hair is color treated with a dark dark brown.</li>
