            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>and I am  not disappointed with my purchase!</li>
            <li>so I wanted it to fade fast and clarifying shampoos are good for that but can be drying</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, my hair feels supper clean and bouncy with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I needed a clarifying shampoo for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s Paraben free for those who care...</li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel strong n clean</li>

            <li>and it does exactly what it says and would gladly say for any of my friends or family to order.</li>
            <li>It is a 2-in-1 type of shampoo/conditioner that leaves your hair slippery and your scalp not feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Amazing I was so surprised (</li>
            <li>Pantene has the only good Clarifying Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This new Pantene Pro-V Clarifying shampoo is better than the others on the market.</li>
            <li>Not as good as their old formula but still pretty good - please go back to your old formula</li>
            <li>Love it on my natural hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too nourishing/oily for a clarifying shampoo, but works fine as a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo very much.</li>
            <li>most shampoos have an effect very similar to pouring corn oil on my head.  </li>
            <li>i love pantene... especially the smell.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo, deep conditioner and the Defining Curls Styling Custard.  </li>
            <li>When I first applied this shampoo to my hair, there was an immediate lather.</li>
            <li>This shampp is so good to the hair because it really cleans your hair and brings back its natural hair pattern.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip the hair like other clarifying shampoos, after I use this it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; feeling, more like a moisturized clean.</li>
            <li>I normally never have static electricity in my hair.  </li>
            <li>the leaves my hair light and fluffy and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>this is a shampoo which works very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>it cleans my hair really well and doesn&#x27;t feel like there is no build up.</li>
            <li>and I bought this item to wash my Malaysian weave with because it gets really oily</li>
            <li>I really like this clarifier.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really cleaned my hair well.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro V. It really cleans your hair with out leaving it looking striped.</li>
            <li>It really cleans your hair.</li>
            <li>His hair used to look greasy 9 hrs after a shower but now his hair is grease free till his next shower!</li>
            <li>I find it too be real quality.</li>
            <li>It really brought out my curl pattern.</li>
            <li>When I wrote this I was referring to  the original formula however, for my next order I received the &amp;#34;Moisturizing Shampoo&amp;#34; instead.  </li>
            <li>3c hair) left it so soft and clean .</li>
            <li>To keep my thin hair from being too stripped, I follow it up with a deep conditioner which works great.</li>
            <li>so far i love the product have gotten to try a few times here</li>
            <li>My first clue that it was not going to  clarify was the fact that it is white and gooey.</li>
            <li>I have used the Pantene Clarifying Shampoo clear formula in the clear bottle for years and loved it only to find that it has been discontinued and replaced with this white gooey mess of a shampoo called truly natural clarifying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d thought I would try this shampoo after I wanted an alternative to Dark and Lovely&#x27;s Au Naturale line especially when it comes to price.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE your money on this product.</li>
            <li>The truly natural clarifying shampoo has dimethicone in it which had I taken time to read the label I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li>I have switched to all of Pantene Natural hair products.  </li>
            <li>After I washed my hair, I noticed my hair was really soft.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>Not harsh at all</li>
            <li>I wash it regularly to keep it fresh, but I also use various products on my hair for added volume, body, detangling, etc.</li>
            <li>High quality product and specialty type not found locally.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the shampoo, deep conditioner and the Defining Curls Styling Custard.</li>
            <li>Since I can always trust Pantene to make a product that&#x27;s gentle, I was not surprised that their clarifying shampoo did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I have very thick straight hair and use styling products and the clear clarifying shampoo used to get my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Nothing was ruined (except the return/packing slip), but I paid for a full bottle of shampoo and only ended up with half.</li>
            <li>and if they don&#x27;t bring back the clear clarifying shampoo formula Pantene has lost a customer.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Hair Clarifying Shampoo because the one I used to use switched formula to what seems like dish-washing detergent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I clarifying only every two months this large bottle is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li>Pantene clarifying shampoo gets the gunk out of my hair without over-cleaning, and my scalp feels really refreshed without having to endlessly scrub at it.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way really.</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> Every few weeks, my hair gets overwhelmed by all that I&#x27;ve used, and beauty products can&#x27;t be washed out by normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> Because this listed as a clarifying shampoo, I expected it to be a deep cleansing, &amp;#34;for oily hair&amp;#34; type of shampoo.  </li>
            <li> (BTW, my hair is long, curly/wavy and color treated.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands since then and none worked for me.  </li>
            <li> And of course, it was in a box with several other items, so</li>
            <li> It seems to re-energize and refresh my locks without stripping them out and making my hair overly dry.  </li>
            <li> And I can use this shampoo whenever, it does not strip my hair or make it dry.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and it makes it dry after I washed it.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling coated and limp even in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have silver hair that changes colors due to sun</li>
            <li> The point of clarifying is to remove silicone based build up and other residues not add to it.  </li>
            <li> the shampoo got all over the other items.  </li>
            <li> Only have to apply a small amount.</li>
            <li> Some other brands can over-clean and leave hair feeling like hay but not this.</li>
            <li> However, the lid was open on one of the bottles and at least half spilled out.  </li>
            <li> I had recently bleached my hair and dyed it a crazy color.  </li>
            <li> Tired of buying the expensive stuff</li>
            <li> It may work well for some but over time that dimethicone is going to build up on your hair, it is very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed</li>
            <li> With the Au Naturale Anti-Brakeage line, I felt like I had a lot of shrinkage which I absolutely hate.</li>

            <li> I like this shampoo very much. When I wrote this I was referring to  the original formula however, for my next order I received the &amp;#34;Moisturizing Shampoo&amp;#34; instead.  I have silver hair that changes colors due to sun and I use clarifying shampoo to keep it silver. Now that they have changed the formula I guess I&#x27;ll have to find another shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too nourishing/oily for a clarifying shampoo, but works fine as a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> this is a shampoo which works very well on my hair.  most shampoos have an effect very similar to pouring corn oil on my head.  the leaves my hair light and fluffy and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> it cleans my hair really well and doesn&#x27;t feel like there is no build up.</li>
            <li> I was able to get 3 botles at $1.99 each when they  are like $5 a bottle in store! I love Pantene  and I bought this item to wash my Malaysian weave with because it gets really oily and I am  not disappointed with my purchase! It has SLS but  it&#x27;s Paraben free for those who care...</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel strong n clean</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Love it works great! I bought it for my daughter and her hair looks great and started using it for my oily hair and is fabulous! !</li>
            <li> I had recently bleached my hair and dyed it a crazy color.  I didn&#x27;t like the color so I wanted it to fade fast and clarifying shampoos are good for that but can be drying so I chose this and it is PERFECT!  Cleans hair thoroughly without drying it, amazing!</li>
            <li> The original clarifying shampoo was absolutely excellent and I can&#x27;t find it any more.  I&#x27;ve tried several other brands since then and none worked for me.  This new Pantene Pro-V Clarifying shampoo is better than the others on the market.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it leaves my hair feeling really clean.  No residue like many shampoo&#x27;s.  I have tried many times to find a really good &amp;#34;Clarifying&amp;#34; shampoo and I definitely will keep buying this one.</li>
            <li> Really good for oily hair</li>
            <li> I really like this clarifier.  I use it once or twice a week to remove all the gunk off my hair from styling products, hairspray etc.  It seems to re-energize and refresh my locks without stripping them out and making my hair overly dry.  This makes my hair respond to my favorite shampoos again.</li>
            <li> Because this listed as a clarifying shampoo, I expected it to be a deep cleansing, &amp;#34;for oily hair&amp;#34; type of shampoo.  It is not.  It is a 2-in-1 type of shampoo/conditioner that leaves your hair slippery and your scalp not feeling clean.  However, this is not noted in the product description and is somewhat deceiving.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re looking for a deep cleansing type of shampoo.</li>
            <li> i love pantene... especially the smell. this works okay however, i tried paul mitchell and it was better... good price though.</li>
            <li> I use this when I notice product build-up on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t strip the hair like other clarifying shampoos, after I use this it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; feeling, more like a moisturized clean. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Pantene has the only good Clarifying Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried some others, but Pantene works the best on my hair.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE your money on this product. I have used the Pantene Clarifying Shampoo clear formula in the clear bottle for years and loved it only to find that it has been discontinued and replaced with this white gooey mess of a shampoo called truly natural clarifying. My first clue that it was not going to  clarify was the fact that it is white and gooey. It left my hair feeling coated and limp even in the shower. I have very thick straight hair and use styling products and the clear clarifying shampoo used to get my hair squeaky clean. The truly natural clarifying shampoo has dimethicone in it which had I taken time to read the label I would not have purchased it. The point of clarifying is to remove silicone based build up and other residues not add to it.  I am so disappointed and if they don&#x27;t bring back the clear clarifying shampoo formula Pantene has lost a customer. The only reason I have it one star is because it smells nice. I see there are a lot of postive reviews for this product. It may work well for some but over time that dimethicone is going to build up on your hair, it is very difficult to remove. This is not a clarifying shampoo. Beware!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo really cleaned my hair well. I had a weird oily patch on top of my head and read that clarifying shampoo would get rid of it. And it did! And I can use this shampoo whenever, it does not strip my hair or make it dry. I really love it.</li>
            <li> Love your coupons and subscribe and save option for products like this. High quality product and specialty type not found locally.</li>
            <li> The product is good and I am happy with that.  However, the lid was open on one of the bottles and at least half spilled out.  And of course, it was in a box with several other items, so the shampoo got all over the other items.  Nothing was ruined (except the return/packing slip), but I paid for a full bottle of shampoo and only ended up with half.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Pantene Pro V. It really cleans your hair with out leaving it looking striped. Will continue to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Feels good after washing .</li>
            <li> My hair can be somewhat oily. I wash it regularly to keep it fresh, but I also use various products on my hair for added volume, body, detangling, etc. Every few weeks, my hair gets overwhelmed by all that I&#x27;ve used, and beauty products can&#x27;t be washed out by normal shampoo. I recently switched to Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Hair Clarifying Shampoo because the one I used to use switched formula to what seems like dish-washing detergent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Pantene clarifying shampoo gets the gunk out of my hair without over-cleaning, and my scalp feels really refreshed without having to endlessly scrub at it. I follow it with whatever my conditioner of the moment is, and the results are excellent! If you have a problem with product build-up, Pantene will cure it and still leave your hair feeling great. (BTW, my hair is long, curly/wavy and color treated.)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I had looked all over for it, with no luck.&lt;br /&gt;So happy I could order it from Amazon...it really removes&lt;br /&gt;all residue from your hair!!!</li>
            <li> excellentttttttttt...use it and nothing else</li>
            <li> This bottle was received in great condition and in great shape.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for Pantene Pro-V clarifying shampoo in stores and had no luck. Amazon.com had it though! Works great really cleans your hair and leaves it shiny and smelling great!</li>
            <li> Tired of buying the expensive stuff so I tried this and it works as well as any of the $15+ product s I use</li>
            <li> I have switched to all of Pantene Natural hair products.  I love the shampoo, deep conditioner and the Defining Curls Styling Custard.  I would highly recommend the shampoo, deep conditioner and the Defining Curls Styling Custard.</li>
            <li> This is nice. It really cleans your hair. Last a long time. Only have to apply a small amount.</li>
            <li> I needed a clarifying shampoo for my fine hair. I have to use a lot of conditioner on it to keep it from being fly away. And every 10 days or so I&#x27;m going to use a clarifying shampoo so I can start from ground zero. it seemed to work great and a good price too.</li>
            <li> I have VERY fragile hair. I use this once a week to get the gunk out before I use a deep conditioning mask. This shampoo is gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly for my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Helps with my pre teen sons greasy hair! His hair used to look greasy 9 hrs after a shower but now his hair is grease free till his next shower!</li>
            <li> Love it on my natural hair</li>
            <li> This is the first clarifying shampoo I have purchased and I am very happy with it.  I use it about once a week or so and it is very effective at removing product build-up.  To keep my thin hair from being too stripped, I follow it up with a deep conditioner which works great.</li>
            <li> This shampp is so good to the hair because it really cleans your hair and brings back its natural hair pattern. I love it. I find it too be real quality. Pantene has grown my hair out too its shoulders.</li>
            <li> Woah, get&#x27;s all the build up out without stripping my hair. Since I can always trust Pantene to make a product that&#x27;s gentle, I was not surprised that their clarifying shampoo did not disappoint. Some other brands can over-clean and leave hair feeling like hay but not this. Since I clarifying only every two months this large bottle is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great! Works perfect to get all the gunk build up out of your hair but doesn&#x27;t destroy it</li>
            <li> It smells great and my hair feels fresh whenever I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d thought I would try this shampoo after I wanted an alternative to Dark and Lovely&#x27;s Au Naturale line especially when it comes to price. When I first applied this shampoo to my hair, there was an immediate lather. A little goes a long way really. Also there is a light fragrance. After I washed my hair, I noticed my hair was really soft. It didn&#x27;t feel stripped or anything. It really brought out my curl pattern. With the Au Naturale Anti-Brakeage line, I felt like I had a lot of shrinkage which I absolutely hate. I did not see that with this shampoo. No complaints so far. I plan on trying the deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> so far i love the product have gotten to try a few times here and it does exactly what it says and would gladly say for any of my friends or family to order.</li>
            <li> Not as good as their old formula but still pretty good - please go back to your old formula it was wonderful!</li>
            <li> Everyone should use a clarifying shampoo once and week.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and it makes it dry after I washed it. But if I used serum after wash, it turns out to be good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my hair feels supper clean and bouncy with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. It does take care of some of buildup on  my hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing I was so surprised (3c hair) left it so soft and clean . Not harsh at all</li>
            <li> Years ago I used a clarifying shampoo that was excellent for my hair, but I couldn&#x27;t remember what brand it was and thought it might have been Pantene, but after one use of this Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Hair Clarifying Shampoo, my hair was uncontrollable with static electricity.  I normally never have static electricity in my hair.  It took 2 shampoos using my regular brand of shampoo to finally remove the flyaway effect caused by this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t plan to use this shampoo again.</li>
