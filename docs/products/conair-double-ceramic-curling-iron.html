            <li>However, it was nice to find that it works by dual voltage 110 and 220v!</li>
            <li>Location of the heat control setting not the best design as it&#x27;s to easy to accidentally change settings while using it</li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but surprisingly with this curling iron it did not hold its curl.</li>

            <li>But I am not so talented.</li>
            <li>Its light weight and perfect!!!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it curls more than the curling iron!  </li>
            <li>The ceramic barrel is great for no-frizz results, and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>It works great on my fine hair since my hair does not slip through while im trying to curl.</li>
            <li>Great curler at a fabulous price.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have the option to lock the curling iron on.</li>
            <li>Honestly, dials should go from 1-10 and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>I can do variety of hairstyles and I am loving the versatility of it.</li>
            <li>This newer model has a kind of wheel around the handle that can be spun to set the temperature.  </li>
            <li>Another nice feature is a heat protective sleeve is provided that covers the iron and lets you put it away while it cools.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable and comes with a nice sleeve to keep it protected.</li>

            <li>Recommend for anyone who wants wonderful curls.</li>
            <li>It was a nice curling iron for the price.  </li>
            <li>thing I liked about the Revlon one was it had a stand built in.  </li>
            <li>The curling iron comes with a sheath so you don&#x27;t have to worry about packing it in your suitcase if it&#x27;s still warm.</li>
            <li>Sturdy curling iron that is reliable and effective.  </li>

            <li>Heats up quickly, very smooth through the hair.  </li>
            <li>The barrel is very smooth and slippery.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I can use it as a straightening iron more so than a curling iron, but my hair is shorter.  </li>

            <li>I love having a bag to put over it when i need to put it away.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll return to write a better review once I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>

            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>It makes nice smooth curls</li>
            <li>Overall great product though!</li>
            <li>the price is so cheap too!</li>
            <li>I was prepared to love this product.</li>
            <li>It broke after many years</li>
            <li>Love it and for the price as well.</li>
            <li>Love this item a lot.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I get better curls by using my straitener.</li>
            <li>Love the curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love this iron, BUT I dont like the on/off switch location.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something about the staying power of the curls that I don&#x27;t love.  </li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I love the loop for the tip.</li>
            <li>I love the many settings it has.</li>
            <li>I recommend this iron for sure</li>
            <li>The best thing about it, from what she told me, is the double ceramic coating on the iron.</li>
            <li>its ok the curler</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Great for people who really don&#x27;t like for a hair curler to curl their hair.</li>
            <li>The dial just seems to roll while you are gripping the handle.</li>
            <li>glad this curling iron is so reliable.</li>
            <li>literally PERFECT is the only word to describe this curling iron...</li>
            <li>but I love this one more than my friend&#x27;s $250 curler</li>
            <li>it works much better for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m impressed on how it curls :)).</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I use this as a curling wand I love the look of the curls this creates</li>
            <li>and I find myself touching up the curls if I use it in the morning and then do something again that evening.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find I got any better curl or wave than I did with the rollers.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic results!  </li>
            <li>thing that I love about this version is the ring at the end of the barrel.</li>
            <li>I love the grip on the end; it helps avoid burning your fingers.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I have turned it off many times by mistake.</li>
            <li>That button is simply not in the best place.  </li>
            <li>plus is that I can maneuver the iron without accidently touching the on-off buttons.</li>
            <li>I was sure this was a keeper and tossed out the packaging when I got home.</li>
            <li>quick heating, easy to use, good results.</li>
            <li>This was a first, one that doesn&#x27;t curl!!!</li>
            <li>had one of the old gold Conair curling irons and loved it to death (literally!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been years since I buy a new curling iron am so happy it came on time</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and curls my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and nice balance.  </li>
            <li>Heats quick and makes nice waves</li>
            <li>This definitely smooth&#x27;s away frizz and leaves my hair shiny with nice, bouncy, smooth curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to give you that loose, tosseled look.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly and ceramic barrel smooths out my frizzy hair nicely and easily.  </li>
            <li>Back to the product, it&#x27;s a very good price</li>
            <li>Has a tip that is cool to the touch for more elaborate styling needs or to hang it.</li>
            <li>Read all the reviews, but the most important feature was the tip that allows you to hold the iron with your fingers to control the way the iron is curling.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that my hair slides smoothly like a straightener and curling iron all in one.</li>
            <li>this is a really good curling for long hair, it gives good volume to it .</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much I had to buy one.</li>
            <li>However, I was shopping for a good product at a very competative price and hopefully speedy delivery</li>
            <li>But I own two of these now (one I leave at the in-laws&#x27;), because the grip is good, it heats up fast, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I honestly have no idea why this curling iron has so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>the wheel easily moves out of the setting you have selected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>It makes curling your hair so easy because you can support the barrel end of the curling iron without burning yourself.</li>
            <li>This arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it so much during my visit That I ordered one for my own home.</li>
            <li>As a lady with ultra fine hair - hair that could easily be curled by a lukewarm iron stick - this product didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, for some nice waves</li>
            <li>Thought it would be different from others but the curls are beautiful..</li>
            <li>It heats up super quick and gives a nice curl.</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair about earlobe length.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>I really like this curling iron and think that it works really well on my hair and creates beautiful and even curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not because of the texture of my hair (somewhat fine and color treated)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairdresser but was looking for something cheap and easy to use for my MIL.</li>
            <li>I have had many curling irons and this is the first one that&#x27;s ripped out so many of my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li>Another reviewer commented that they don&#x27;t like the design of the stand; it works fine for me.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does the job!</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, intuitive, safe to use.</li>
            <li>this curling iron heats fairly quickly and once I re-acquainted my self with using a curling iron I am pleased.</li>
            <li>, I researched this iron on Amazon and was impressed with all of the positive reviews as well as the low cost.</li>
            <li>Works great, gets SUPER hot and is gentle on my hair!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a large barrel curling iron, this one is amazing for the price.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron has a nice large barrel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I came across this product, Conair never fails me!</li>
            <li>However, the heat is accurate.  </li>
            <li>managed to get a HUGE chunk of hair in and those curls came out with bumps/ridges where the edge of the movable plate isnt&#x27; quite flush with the rest of the barrel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heats up nicely and fast.</li>
            <li>plus the fact that is light weight is a plus.</li>
            <li>I like how cheap this curling iron is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like my ahir to be smooth and this iron delivers that look.  </li>
            <li>Great curling iron for big wavey hair/loose curls.</li>
            <li>It smoothly curls or straighten my hair without over heating.</li>
            <li>This is such an affordable price for a great product.</li>
            <li>Non - tangling cord, light weight.</li>
            <li>love this curling iron so much I purchased more than one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this as a backup, because I have another that I loved that is getting old.  </li>
            <li>and I had really loved my old Conair, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I need a good quality iron to not destroy the hair fibers.  </li>
            <li>I love this curler, better than the wands thanks to the clip part.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s super easy and quick to curl your hair!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and creates large luscious curls just what i wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is also sold by amazon, also has prime shipping, and the area above the thumb clip is also made of the ceramic material of the curler, making sure that it doesn&#x27;t catch and tear your hear, and also gives you more surface area!</li>
            <li>Works great with long hair.  </li>
            <li>First I would like to say I love the color of this curling</li>
            <li>this was better then the first one that lasted years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I love that it comes with a sleeve so you can pack it in your bag while it&#x27;s still hot.</li>
            <li>super cheap.</li>
            <li>very nice curls that hold all day long</li>
            <li>or I have a special occasion to attend to.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Good price, and gives me nice big soft curls!</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and use and the barrel makes my wild hair very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot fast, which is nice but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re just looking for very loose waves</li>
            <li>Love the curls I get and heats up fast</li>
            <li>it really doesnt hold curls, but its ok if u put rollers in your hair after using it and go to bed</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron, it really brings the heat.</li>
            <li>It works ok, but it really shouldn&#x27;t come to that.</li>
            <li>Love that this iron heats up fast.</li>
            <li>2nd, the plates feels smooth and the curls comes out pretty nice and shiny!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The first is that you can easily change the temperature control with your thumb while you are holding the curling iron handle.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipment came really quick which is what I paid for</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, heats up quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>i super recomend</li>
            <li>I can get the frizz out quickly and it stays!&lt;br /&gt;I have course hair.</li>
            <li>however for my medium length hair i would prefer 1 inch one in the same brand better....:)</li>
            <li>Heats quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and I like the swivel cord.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and comes with a heat proof case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that you can pick it up at any pharmacy or local store, and at such a cheap cost!</li>
            <li>So overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>That one was a Revlon, but since the recent Revlon curling irons aren&#x27;t getting great reviews, I thought it would be better to try a different product.</li>
            <li>another flaw (in my opinion) was the light wasnt bright enough to see when its ready or heating up.</li>
            <li>but I have to hold my hair around the iron for a long time to achieve a good curl.  </li>
            <li>Before I had a hot tools curling iron, and it was great, until it got jammed with hair spray (oops).</li>
            <li>And the heat has many options and gets hot very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This diameter is too large for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>If you look at the Infinit curler (which is only $3.00 more!)</li>
            <li>Everything came exactly how it was supposed to!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This curling iron heats up fast, gets to 300 I believe and is super light.</li>
            <li>I actually liked the previous model better.  </li>
            <li>The heat setting is very simple to use, however your fingers also keep touching the rotating disk and easily change the settings, again have to release a curl to see what the setting changed to.</li>
            <li>This curling iron creates the perfect loose big curls in my hair.</li>
            <li>Takes a few minutes to heat up but it works great.</li>
            <li>It gives beautiful curls and the small &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; on the tip helps you to hold the iron without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li>I use a thin curling wand that curls and waves wonderfully at 410 degrees</li>
            <li>It was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and it&#x27;s barely shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>: heats up quickly, has multiple heat settings, cool top allows two handed use; shiny curls that last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get super hot, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>It works well, gets hot quickly, has varying degrees to set for heat,  and also  has a tip that prevents finger burn.</li>
            <li>It gets SUPER hot.  </li>
            <li>Heats really quickly, but overly hot.  </li>
            <li>Price is right</li>
            <li>The curls fall right out even at max heat.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy and gives it just the right amount of lift.  </li>
            <li>, my thumb rolls right over it.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>They are place right where you place your thumb while curling your hair.</li>
            <li>The on/off buttons are right where you may place your thumb</li>
            <li>When I read about the tip at the end to hold onto more easily, I didn&#x27;t really see how that could be such a plus</li>
            <li>first, the curl looks really good- a pretty loose spiral.</li>
            <li>The one star I did give it is for the fast warm up time and the little kick stand to keep it from touching your counter or night</li>
            <li>I have used many curling irons over the years, and have paid more for less quality.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool if you don&#x27;t use too much heat.</li>
            <li>I like my curling iron to get hot real fast</li>
            <li>My hair is just not long enough for this curling iron, but great for shoulder length hair.  .</li>
            <li>However, the handle itself is very smooth also, so be careful to grasp it securely so it doesnt get away from you.</li>
            <li>Also the part that holds the hair snug to the iron itself is not very tight fitting, so you can not use this to first straighten the hair or if you try to go to the end of your hair &amp; roll up</li>
            <li>The tip is also very easy to hold while curling which makes it extremely user friendly.</li>
            <li>I really like the heat proof sleeve and how quickly it heats up.</li>
            <li>if u compared it with the price.. that&#x27;s definitely worth enough to purchase :)</li>
            <li>curling iron gives you nice loose and shiny curls that I&#x27;ve dreamed of having.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is easy to click the button to turn it off as they are pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and because it&#x27;s barrel size is 1 and 1/2 in diameter</li>
            <li>up very fast,</li>
            <li>Although the safety turn off is very nice (having left an curling iron on one or two times), but it should be set to last a bit longer.</li>
            <li>My one complaint about this curling iron is that while it puts the perfect bend in my long, straight, fine, thickish hair, my right thumb keeps clicking the power button and turning it off.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price and works just as effective as any other iron.  </li>
            <li>I looked around a lot for a new iron, and I was so excited when I settled on this one.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>can not say any more, especially if you know my wife</li>
            <li>The plastic piece on the end of the hot iron is convenient if you want or need to hold both ends.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like it should.  </li>
            <li>Fast as lightning!</li>
            <li>Fast!</li>
            <li>Gets hot fast!</li>
            <li>I really like how my curls come out when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li>The iron takes about 5 mins to get really hot too.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>oh well, you are aware when it happens and can re adjust, by all means not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>My hair will hold curls pretty well but not with this.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>No no no, do not buy this if you want the curls will last more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>iron gets hot within 1 minute.</li>
            <li>this is my first stuff from Conair and i like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i have a really straight hair and this does nothing to my hair!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Has way more settings than I anticipated, but was still simple to use.</li>
            <li>First, my hair keeps getting caught and pulled out in the plastic clamp (used to hold the hair in place on the barrel).</li>
            <li>and I thought the bigger the barrel the better.  </li>
            <li>so be sure to use smaller swatches of hair if you don&#x27;t want it caught in the clip.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the tip does not get hot and is large enough to keep your fingers safe.  </li>
            <li>Great size for big loose curls too.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it work more like a flat iron</li>
            <li>I tried SO hard to love this curling iron because I love Conair product.</li>
            <li>Very nice curling iron and quite big barrel for smoothing or loose shapes.</li>
            <li>its good but the curls only last for 1-2h</li>
            <li>It takes way too long to get not even an okay curl-</li>
            <li>but I liked the little hook on the end that makes holding the hot wand easier</li>
            <li>A red light tells you that it is heating or hot.  </li>
            <li>The handle is about 4 inches long enough to get a good grip and not to accidentally turn the curler off.</li>
            <li>However, though it did make beautiful curls, they only lasted a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>the barrel is a little short for longer hair, but it heats up super quick and gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li>The barrel was too large for my hair to hold the curl.</li>
            <li>It does make the hair nice and shiny with out a tight curl.</li>
            <li>the most part, I would highly suggest this item and believe that it is very similar to the older version.</li>
            <li>She got a nice little burn across her forehead from it though..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t snag as much as my hot tools curling iron, which is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It did heat up quickly and was pretty easy to handle, but I sent it back and may try one with a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li>Works well, heats up fast, and keeps the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>it was very upset about it</li>
            <li>Wife absolutely loves this IRON.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand....</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>Really saves me time in the morning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats relatively fast and you can adjust the heat</li>
            <li>but once you get used to where the button is it gets much easier to avoid hitting it.</li>
            <li>The next time I tried to turn it on, the light flashed but the iron did not heat up.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to curl)</li>
            <li>Really like this item.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>and i didnt want to spend too much</li>
            <li>My hair was very shiny and curled up like a spring.</li>
            <li>I have thinner, straight hair.</li>
            <li>This has never happened before, since I have very wavy hair that holds a curl</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong about those crystals -- they are like waving a magic wand over your hair and suddenly having smooth and shiny curls!  </li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>, it will not hold it in place very well.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and the gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This iron works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>It heats up incredibly fast - in 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>But that doesn&#x27;t happen very often</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I like this because it heats up fast.</li>
            <li>This is really important to me because I have a routine and like to know exactly how long it&#x27;ll take to get my hair looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product works well with thick hair, not thin hair</li>
            <li>Heats quick, thick or fine hair, 30 adjustable heat settings, swivel and long cord, double ceramic, and the most important, the non stick coating is really non stick, hair glides right through (no snagging) and hair product does NOT get stuck on the iron.</li>
            <li>This allows for easy grip and turn without slipping your fingers onto the hot area -</li>
            <li>Long, very curly/wavy, frizzy, fine strands but a LOT of them</li>
            <li>The other feature that sets it apart is the plastic loop hole at the top.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just new to the whole hair curling world, but it was a lot more difficult than I&#x27;d thought it would be to make nice curls.</li>
            <li>naturally have dry frizzy hair but after using this curler I&#x27;ve received so many compliments when out and about.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, big iron that heats up quickly with an extra long cord.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve accidentally turned it off many times while curling up, and have to release the curl to check if it&#x27;s indeed still on and the red power light is so tiny and dim its barely noticeable on the mirror.</li>
            <li>it only really curls the bottom of your section of hair (so the top and middle</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think this one works just as well if not better</li>
            <li>kick-stand that most curling irons have, including this one, because it&#x27;s a pain to fold it up and down every time I handle it.  </li>
            <li>At first it would sometimes slip off the barrel while I was curling it because the clamp isn&#x27;t that strong or tight.  </li>
            <li>it should be built in instead of having to move it back and forth every time and the top should be solid</li>
            <li>a quest to find a decent one for under $50.</li>
            <li>Bought this as an extra to travel with but after the first use has become my first choice.</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy another one that is slightly smaller.</li>
            <li>Heated up quickly, worked well even on a very low setting.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that I&#x27;m getting my hair cut short for summer and won&#x27;t be able to use it until winter.  </li>
            <li>I will splurge on a better iron than deal with the frustration that comes with trying to use this mess.</li>
            <li>I love it but the only reason it got 4 stars was because the plug didn&#x27;t fit in the socket :/</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love the little stand.</li>
            <li>The clamp also does not grip the hair as firmly as the older version, after some getting accustomed to it, I was ok with that.</li>
            <li>Get super hot though so be careful!</li>
            <li>I generally use the larger iron to smooth my hair and give it body and shape.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron received a normal amount of use but just didn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s still fairly new, I am still experimenting with different products and processes to get it right.  </li>
            <li>I have an earlier model and liked using it on my long hair, so when I needed a second one, I decided on a conair.</li>
            <li>would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new curling iron.</li>
            <li>Brand new, never been opened.  </li>
            <li>and I am shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li>I needed a new curling iron</li>
            <li>I do not like the new way that temperature is set.</li>
            <li>I purchased this site unseen for my daughter in another state who needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>but I believe its new so no reviews for this yet.</li>
            <li>(I use them for years until they no longer work!), but look forward to new improvements with excitement...</li>
            <li>It creates big loose waves that look really natural, which I love.</li>
            <li>I got the 1 1/2 inch because I wanted nice loose, big curls, but I think I should have gotten a smaller size.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was defective at first &amp; Amazon actually sent me a new one with hopes that it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets so hot that my hair can actually burn me</li>
            <li>If you want curls; buy a small hair straightener and it will curl 100% better than this one.</li>
            <li>The pro&#x27;s by far out weigh my 1 con!  </li>
            <li>Not frizzy after I complete, even though the humidity in the south sometimes nothing works!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant when purchasing this since the price was pretty low.  </li>
            <li>My hair used to get caught every once in a while in my old one but this barrel just glides over your hair -- in fact, it&#x27;s so smooth that you may need to adjust your technique a bit as you curl because it doesn&#x27;t pull and tangle or catch as you use it like other curling irons do.  </li>
            <li>It stays hot the entire time I curl my hair.</li>
            <li>love the double ceramic as it allows my hair to glide easily down the barrel.</li>
            <li>The size is okay, but the clip doesn&#x27;t hold my hair tight enough and it just doesn&#x27;t curl!</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous since its so cheap</li>
            <li>For years I have used a flat iron to style it into shape - more or less a bob.  </li>
            <li>You can clearly see when it is on and and you can manually set the curler&#x27;s temp.</li>
            <li>I bought it from Amazon to replace her old Conair iron that burned out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues as far as pulling my hair or not grabbing it</li>
            <li>so I always wear an old pair of glasses to keep the iron from getting too close.  </li>
            <li>I used to use a curling a lot, but haven&#x27;t much in the last 5-10 years.</li>
            <li>Im liking the results so far.</li>
            <li>So far, this iron has done nothing for me.</li>
            <li>After deciding to give my hair a break and switch to curling (my hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a professional hair stylist for 20+ yrs.</li>
            <li>Would use this in a professional setting.</li>
            <li>My old lady hates this thing.</li>
            <li>I am use to Conairs with the round smooth cords.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy, so I like using this curling iron for controlled waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Does not work nearly as well as any curling iron I have had.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this only because it&#x27;s fast and makes my hair look shiny.</li>
            <li>only thing i don&#x27;t like that much is its holder cause it&#x27;s made from low-quality material (in my eyesight)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but  </li>
            <li>I already have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>It does fall a lot throughout the day, unlike when I use my professional brand curling wand.  </li>
            <li>and it would go back to straight.</li>
            <li>I really like the open loop on the head&#x27;s end for keeping hold of the iron.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to have 3 identical ones, but the styling of this one is just slightly different.  </li>
            <li>The only real problem I had with this curling iron is the heat setting is a wheel on the handle that spins.  </li>
            <li>Also, this model has the shortest cord I&#x27;ve ever had, unless your power outlet is directly in-front of the mirror that you use, get an extension.</li>
            <li>How can you go wrong on a curling iron with good reviews?</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d be a good deal, since it wasn&#x27;t expensive, if I could get what it advertises...</li>
            <li>This is a good curling iron but not perfect.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick and long but waves easily and curls with the right amount of heat.</li>
            <li>Works well but even with the wide heat range, I don&#x27;t always think it gets hot enough for my hair (but I have very stubborn hair).</li>
            <li>I tried small, medium and large sections and they all slip right out.</li>
            <li>This curling iron does not get hot enough to actually put any shape in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have an older slightly larger barrel curling iron I was trying to replace because it is falling apart.  </li>
            <li>This model has a useful wire stand to hold the iron off of a surface when it is set down.  </li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s clip is much looser, so it is difficult to hold the hair long enough to get a good curl.</li>
            <li>I like my new Conair Double Ceramic Curling Iron.  </li>
            <li>, I get the big curls that will last for the whole day with the help of a hair spray.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that the grip of the clamp could do a better job of holding on to the hair.  </li>
            <li>The main caution is one has to be careful with this and any other hot tool near the eyes</li>
            <li>Plus, the heat makes fast long lasting curls to my mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li>I have the setting barely turned on for my hair.  </li>
            <li>This morning my hair did get caught in the plastic near the middle of the barrel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a minor annoyance I&#x27;ll have to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I picked It up at Walmart came home and tried it in my hair :) it heats up fast, I use between 10-15 settings and I got loose soft curls on my wavy thick hair&lt;3 I gave it a 4 out of 5 because the only problem I have is the cord isn&#x27;t long enough, I do my hair on the floor next to an outlet and that isn&#x27;t the problem</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s MUCH MUCH cheaper than other curling irons.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see Conair have such a quality product at such a low price.</li>
            <li>Barely curls and if it does the curl doesn&#x27;t last even with holding spray.</li>
            <li>My hair gets silkier, which is not a bad thing, but it&#x27;s like it loses all texture and doesn&#x27;t hold anything, almost like when I flat-iron my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tough to curl hair, so the heat settings on the curling iron makes it easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>But if you have medium to thick hair you won&#x27;t have any problem, and if your hair is fine like mine, it might be a minor problem.  </li>
            <li>I have long medium thickness  red hair with a bit of natural wave.  </li>
            <li>(but my hair is much too long to not use the whole barrel), flip it up and down when you pick up/set down, or just not use it at all.  </li>
            <li>This sucker gets hot!  </li>
            <li>I find it little pit heavy and difficult to manage but the results are very good</li>

            <li> :o)  </li>
            <li> However, it was nice to find that it works by dual voltage 110 and 220v!</li>
            <li> Location of the heat control setting not the best design as it&#x27;s to easy to accidentally change settings while using it</li>
            <li> This one heats very quickly, about 5 seconds and it is the perfect size for my chin length bob!</li>
            <li> Excellent for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> but surprisingly with this curling iron it did not hold its curl.</li>
            <li> It is a good size for my toddler&#x27;s hair and also my hair.</li>
            <li> But I am not so talented.</li>
            <li> Its light weight and perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the reviews on this are so good-</li>
            <li> dont regret buying, it´s a good styling tool and it´s</li>
            <li> The size and shape of the curler ia good</li>
            <li> was looking for some cheap curling iron in this size and this thing looks perfect for</li>

            <li> A super great deal!</li>
            <li> Very pleased and would recommend.</li>
            <li> However, I will say that I am very satisfied with this curling iron.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m even more happy</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was impressed how quickly it heats up and how nicely it glides through the hair.</li>

            <li> Gotta love those curls!</li>
            <li> Love this iron!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!</li>
            <li> but it sure does make using the iron easier to roll on and off of my hair!</li>
            <li> I love how my hair looks after using this iron!</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron!</li>

            <li> Love this curling iron!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> it curls more than the curling iron!  </li>
            <li> The ceramic barrel is great for no-frizz results, and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> It works great on my fine hair since my hair does not slip through while im trying to curl.</li>
            <li> Great curler at a fabulous price.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have the option to lock the curling iron on.</li>
            <li> Honestly, dials should go from 1-10 and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> I can do variety of hairstyles and I am loving the versatility of it.</li>
            <li> This newer model has a kind of wheel around the handle that can be spun to set the temperature.  </li>
            <li> Another nice feature is a heat protective sleeve is provided that covers the iron and lets you put it away while it cools.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable and comes with a nice sleeve to keep it protected.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and the heat cover is nice, too.</li>
            <li> My 13 y/o loves to do her own hair, so I got this for her.</li>
            <li> The design is nice.  </li>
            <li> Recommend for anyone who wants wonderful curls.</li>
            <li> It was a nice curling iron for the price.  </li>
            <li> thing I liked about the Revlon one was it had a stand built in.  </li>
            <li> The curling iron comes with a sheath so you don&#x27;t have to worry about packing it in your suitcase if it&#x27;s still warm.</li>
            <li> Sturdy curling iron that is reliable and effective.  </li>
            <li> Good value + timely delivery + quality product &#x3D; satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, leaved beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li> is that the heat setting is very easily manipulated while I am releasing the curl</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It gives wonderful soft curls!</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly!</li>
            <li> Also, love the 1.5 in because it makes perfect natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted and works great.  </li>
            <li> Works fine though!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and there&#x27;s no pulling on the hair even after using product.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, very smooth through the hair.  </li>
            <li> The barrel is very smooth and slippery.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I can use it as a straightening iron more so than a curling iron, but my hair is shorter.  </li>
            <li> She likes this one better.</li>
            <li> I love having a bag to put over it when i need to put it away.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many curling irons in my life.  </li>
            <li> love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll return to write a better review once I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> The tip is also a hook so your fingers stay safe.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> It makes nice smooth curls</li>
            <li> Overall great product though!</li>
            <li> the price is so cheap too!</li>
            <li> I was prepared to love this product.</li>
            <li> It broke after many years</li>
            <li> Love it and for the price as well.</li>
            <li> Love this item a lot.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I get better curls by using my straitener.</li>
            <li> Love the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love this iron, BUT I dont like the on/off switch location.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something about the staying power of the curls that I don&#x27;t love.  </li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I love the loop for the tip.</li>
            <li> I love the many settings it has.</li>
            <li> I recommend this iron for sure</li>
            <li> The best thing about it, from what she told me, is the double ceramic coating on the iron.</li>
            <li> its ok the curler</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Great for people who really don&#x27;t like for a hair curler to curl their hair.</li>
            <li> The dial just seems to roll while you are gripping the handle.</li>
            <li> glad this curling iron is so reliable.</li>
            <li> literally PERFECT is the only word to describe this curling iron...</li>
            <li> but I love this one more than my friend&#x27;s $250 curler</li>
            <li> it works much better for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m impressed on how it curls :)).</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I use this as a curling wand I love the look of the curls this creates</li>
            <li> and I find myself touching up the curls if I use it in the morning and then do something again that evening.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find I got any better curl or wave than I did with the rollers.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic results!  </li>
            <li> thing that I love about this version is the ring at the end of the barrel.</li>
            <li> I love the grip on the end; it helps avoid burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have turned it off many times by mistake.</li>
            <li> That button is simply not in the best place.  </li>
            <li> plus is that I can maneuver the iron without accidently touching the on-off buttons.</li>
            <li> I was sure this was a keeper and tossed out the packaging when I got home.</li>
            <li> quick heating, easy to use, good results.</li>
            <li> This was a first, one that doesn&#x27;t curl!!!</li>
            <li> had one of the old gold Conair curling irons and loved it to death (literally!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I buy a new curling iron am so happy it came on time</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and curls my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and nice balance.  </li>
            <li> Heats quick and makes nice waves</li>
            <li> This definitely smooth&#x27;s away frizz and leaves my hair shiny with nice, bouncy, smooth curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to give you that loose, tosseled look.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly and ceramic barrel smooths out my frizzy hair nicely and easily.  </li>
            <li> Back to the product, it&#x27;s a very good price</li>
            <li> Has a tip that is cool to the touch for more elaborate styling needs or to hang it.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews, but the most important feature was the tip that allows you to hold the iron with your fingers to control the way the iron is curling.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that my hair slides smoothly like a straightener and curling iron all in one.</li>
            <li> this is a really good curling for long hair, it gives good volume to it .</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much I had to buy one.</li>
            <li> However, I was shopping for a good product at a very competative price and hopefully speedy delivery</li>
            <li> But I own two of these now (one I leave at the in-laws&#x27;), because the grip is good, it heats up fast, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I honestly have no idea why this curling iron has so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> the wheel easily moves out of the setting you have selected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> It makes curling your hair so easy because you can support the barrel end of the curling iron without burning yourself.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it so much during my visit That I ordered one for my own home.</li>
            <li> As a lady with ultra fine hair - hair that could easily be curled by a lukewarm iron stick - this product didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, for some nice waves</li>
            <li> Thought it would be different from others but the curls are beautiful..</li>
            <li> It heats up super quick and gives a nice curl.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair about earlobe length.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron and think that it works really well on my hair and creates beautiful and even curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not because of the texture of my hair (somewhat fine and color treated)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser but was looking for something cheap and easy to use for my MIL.</li>
            <li> I have had many curling irons and this is the first one that&#x27;s ripped out so many of my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li> Another reviewer commented that they don&#x27;t like the design of the stand; it works fine for me.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does the job!</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, intuitive, safe to use.</li>
            <li> this curling iron heats fairly quickly and once I re-acquainted my self with using a curling iron I am pleased.</li>
            <li> , I researched this iron on Amazon and was impressed with all of the positive reviews as well as the low cost.</li>
            <li> Works great, gets SUPER hot and is gentle on my hair!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a large barrel curling iron, this one is amazing for the price.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron has a nice large barrel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I came across this product, Conair never fails me!</li>
            <li> However, the heat is accurate.  </li>
            <li> managed to get a HUGE chunk of hair in and those curls came out with bumps/ridges where the edge of the movable plate isnt&#x27; quite flush with the rest of the barrel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heats up nicely and fast.</li>
            <li> plus the fact that is light weight is a plus.</li>
            <li> I like how cheap this curling iron is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like my ahir to be smooth and this iron delivers that look.  </li>
            <li> Great curling iron for big wavey hair/loose curls.</li>
            <li> It smoothly curls or straighten my hair without over heating.</li>
            <li> This is such an affordable price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Non - tangling cord, light weight.</li>
            <li> love this curling iron so much I purchased more than one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this as a backup, because I have another that I loved that is getting old.  </li>
            <li> and I had really loved my old Conair, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I need a good quality iron to not destroy the hair fibers.  </li>
            <li> I love this curler, better than the wands thanks to the clip part.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s super easy and quick to curl your hair!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and creates large luscious curls just what i wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is also sold by amazon, also has prime shipping, and the area above the thumb clip is also made of the ceramic material of the curler, making sure that it doesn&#x27;t catch and tear your hear, and also gives you more surface area!</li>
            <li> Works great with long hair.  </li>
            <li> First I would like to say I love the color of this curling</li>
            <li> this was better then the first one that lasted years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I love that it comes with a sleeve so you can pack it in your bag while it&#x27;s still hot.</li>
            <li> super cheap.</li>
            <li> very nice curls that hold all day long</li>
            <li> or I have a special occasion to attend to.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Good price, and gives me nice big soft curls!</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and use and the barrel makes my wild hair very smooth.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot fast, which is nice but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re just looking for very loose waves</li>
            <li> Love the curls I get and heats up fast</li>
            <li> it really doesnt hold curls, but its ok if u put rollers in your hair after using it and go to bed</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, it really brings the heat.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but it really shouldn&#x27;t come to that.</li>
            <li> Love that this iron heats up fast.</li>
            <li> 2nd, the plates feels smooth and the curls comes out pretty nice and shiny!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The first is that you can easily change the temperature control with your thumb while you are holding the curling iron handle.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipment came really quick which is what I paid for</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, heats up quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> i super recomend</li>
            <li> I can get the frizz out quickly and it stays!&lt;br /&gt;I have course hair.</li>
            <li> however for my medium length hair i would prefer 1 inch one in the same brand better....:)</li>
            <li> Heats quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and I like the swivel cord.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and comes with a heat proof case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that you can pick it up at any pharmacy or local store, and at such a cheap cost!</li>
            <li> So overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> That one was a Revlon, but since the recent Revlon curling irons aren&#x27;t getting great reviews, I thought it would be better to try a different product.</li>
            <li> another flaw (in my opinion) was the light wasnt bright enough to see when its ready or heating up.</li>
            <li> but I have to hold my hair around the iron for a long time to achieve a good curl.  </li>
            <li> Before I had a hot tools curling iron, and it was great, until it got jammed with hair spray (oops).</li>
            <li> And the heat has many options and gets hot very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This diameter is too large for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> If you look at the Infinit curler (which is only $3.00 more!)</li>
            <li> Everything came exactly how it was supposed to!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This curling iron heats up fast, gets to 300 I believe and is super light.</li>
            <li> I actually liked the previous model better.  </li>
            <li> The heat setting is very simple to use, however your fingers also keep touching the rotating disk and easily change the settings, again have to release a curl to see what the setting changed to.</li>
            <li> This curling iron creates the perfect loose big curls in my hair.</li>
            <li> Takes a few minutes to heat up but it works great.</li>
            <li> It gives beautiful curls and the small &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; on the tip helps you to hold the iron without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> I use a thin curling wand that curls and waves wonderfully at 410 degrees</li>
            <li> It was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and it&#x27;s barely shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> : heats up quickly, has multiple heat settings, cool top allows two handed use; shiny curls that last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get super hot, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> It works well, gets hot quickly, has varying degrees to set for heat,  and also  has a tip that prevents finger burn.</li>
            <li> It gets SUPER hot.  </li>
            <li> Heats really quickly, but overly hot.  </li>
            <li> Price is right</li>
            <li> The curls fall right out even at max heat.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy and gives it just the right amount of lift.  </li>
            <li> , my thumb rolls right over it.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> They are place right where you place your thumb while curling your hair.</li>
            <li> The on/off buttons are right where you may place your thumb</li>
            <li> When I read about the tip at the end to hold onto more easily, I didn&#x27;t really see how that could be such a plus</li>
            <li> first, the curl looks really good- a pretty loose spiral.</li>
            <li> The one star I did give it is for the fast warm up time and the little kick stand to keep it from touching your counter or night</li>
            <li> I have used many curling irons over the years, and have paid more for less quality.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool if you don&#x27;t use too much heat.</li>
            <li> I like my curling iron to get hot real fast</li>
            <li> My hair is just not long enough for this curling iron, but great for shoulder length hair.  .</li>
            <li> However, the handle itself is very smooth also, so be careful to grasp it securely so it doesnt get away from you.</li>
            <li> Also the part that holds the hair snug to the iron itself is not very tight fitting, so you can not use this to first straighten the hair or if you try to go to the end of your hair &amp; roll up</li>
            <li> The tip is also very easy to hold while curling which makes it extremely user friendly.</li>
            <li> I really like the heat proof sleeve and how quickly it heats up.</li>
            <li> if u compared it with the price.. that&#x27;s definitely worth enough to purchase :)</li>
            <li> curling iron gives you nice loose and shiny curls that I&#x27;ve dreamed of having.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is easy to click the button to turn it off as they are pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and because it&#x27;s barrel size is 1 and 1/2 in diameter</li>
            <li> up very fast,</li>
            <li> Although the safety turn off is very nice (having left an curling iron on one or two times), but it should be set to last a bit longer.</li>
            <li> My one complaint about this curling iron is that while it puts the perfect bend in my long, straight, fine, thickish hair, my right thumb keeps clicking the power button and turning it off.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price and works just as effective as any other iron.  </li>
            <li> I looked around a lot for a new iron, and I was so excited when I settled on this one.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> can not say any more, especially if you know my wife</li>
            <li> The plastic piece on the end of the hot iron is convenient if you want or need to hold both ends.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like it should.  </li>
            <li> Fast as lightning!</li>
            <li> Fast!</li>
            <li> Gets hot fast!</li>
            <li> I really like how my curls come out when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> The iron takes about 5 mins to get really hot too.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> oh well, you are aware when it happens and can re adjust, by all means not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> My hair will hold curls pretty well but not with this.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> No no no, do not buy this if you want the curls will last more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> iron gets hot within 1 minute.</li>
            <li> this is my first stuff from Conair and i like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i have a really straight hair and this does nothing to my hair!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Has way more settings than I anticipated, but was still simple to use.</li>
            <li> First, my hair keeps getting caught and pulled out in the plastic clamp (used to hold the hair in place on the barrel).</li>
            <li> and I thought the bigger the barrel the better.  </li>
            <li> so be sure to use smaller swatches of hair if you don&#x27;t want it caught in the clip.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the tip does not get hot and is large enough to keep your fingers safe.  </li>
            <li> Great size for big loose curls too.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it work more like a flat iron</li>
            <li> I tried SO hard to love this curling iron because I love Conair product.</li>
            <li> Very nice curling iron and quite big barrel for smoothing or loose shapes.</li>
            <li> its good but the curls only last for 1-2h</li>
            <li> It takes way too long to get not even an okay curl-</li>
            <li> but I liked the little hook on the end that makes holding the hot wand easier</li>
            <li> A red light tells you that it is heating or hot.  </li>
            <li> The handle is about 4 inches long enough to get a good grip and not to accidentally turn the curler off.</li>
            <li> However, though it did make beautiful curls, they only lasted a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> the barrel is a little short for longer hair, but it heats up super quick and gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li> The barrel was too large for my hair to hold the curl.</li>
            <li> It does make the hair nice and shiny with out a tight curl.</li>
            <li> the most part, I would highly suggest this item and believe that it is very similar to the older version.</li>
            <li> She got a nice little burn across her forehead from it though..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t snag as much as my hot tools curling iron, which is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It did heat up quickly and was pretty easy to handle, but I sent it back and may try one with a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li> Works well, heats up fast, and keeps the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> it was very upset about it</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely loves this IRON.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand....</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really saves me time in the morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats relatively fast and you can adjust the heat</li>
            <li> but once you get used to where the button is it gets much easier to avoid hitting it.</li>
            <li> The next time I tried to turn it on, the light flashed but the iron did not heat up.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to curl)</li>
            <li> Really like this item.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> and i didnt want to spend too much</li>
            <li> My hair was very shiny and curled up like a spring.</li>
            <li> I have thinner, straight hair.</li>
            <li> This has never happened before, since I have very wavy hair that holds a curl</li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong about those crystals -- they are like waving a magic wand over your hair and suddenly having smooth and shiny curls!  </li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> , it will not hold it in place very well.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and the gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This iron works really well for me.  </li>
            <li> It heats up incredibly fast - in 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t happen very often</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like this because it heats up fast.</li>
            <li> This is really important to me because I have a routine and like to know exactly how long it&#x27;ll take to get my hair looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product works well with thick hair, not thin hair</li>
            <li> Heats quick, thick or fine hair, 30 adjustable heat settings, swivel and long cord, double ceramic, and the most important, the non stick coating is really non stick, hair glides right through (no snagging) and hair product does NOT get stuck on the iron.</li>
            <li> This allows for easy grip and turn without slipping your fingers onto the hot area -</li>
            <li> Long, very curly/wavy, frizzy, fine strands but a LOT of them</li>
            <li> The other feature that sets it apart is the plastic loop hole at the top.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just new to the whole hair curling world, but it was a lot more difficult than I&#x27;d thought it would be to make nice curls.</li>
            <li> naturally have dry frizzy hair but after using this curler I&#x27;ve received so many compliments when out and about.</li>
            <li> It is a nice, big iron that heats up quickly with an extra long cord.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve accidentally turned it off many times while curling up, and have to release the curl to check if it&#x27;s indeed still on and the red power light is so tiny and dim its barely noticeable on the mirror.</li>
            <li> it only really curls the bottom of your section of hair (so the top and middle</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think this one works just as well if not better</li>
            <li> kick-stand that most curling irons have, including this one, because it&#x27;s a pain to fold it up and down every time I handle it.  </li>
            <li> At first it would sometimes slip off the barrel while I was curling it because the clamp isn&#x27;t that strong or tight.  </li>
            <li> it should be built in instead of having to move it back and forth every time and the top should be solid</li>
            <li> a quest to find a decent one for under $50.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an extra to travel with but after the first use has become my first choice.</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy another one that is slightly smaller.</li>
            <li> Heated up quickly, worked well even on a very low setting.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that I&#x27;m getting my hair cut short for summer and won&#x27;t be able to use it until winter.  </li>
            <li> I will splurge on a better iron than deal with the frustration that comes with trying to use this mess.</li>
            <li> I love it but the only reason it got 4 stars was because the plug didn&#x27;t fit in the socket :/</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the little stand.</li>
            <li> The clamp also does not grip the hair as firmly as the older version, after some getting accustomed to it, I was ok with that.</li>
            <li> Get super hot though so be careful!</li>
            <li> I generally use the larger iron to smooth my hair and give it body and shape.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron received a normal amount of use but just didn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s still fairly new, I am still experimenting with different products and processes to get it right.  </li>
            <li> I have an earlier model and liked using it on my long hair, so when I needed a second one, I decided on a conair.</li>
            <li> would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new curling iron.</li>
            <li> Brand new, never been opened.  </li>
            <li> and I am shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li> I needed a new curling iron</li>
            <li> I do not like the new way that temperature is set.</li>
            <li> I purchased this site unseen for my daughter in another state who needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> but I believe its new so no reviews for this yet.</li>
            <li> (I use them for years until they no longer work!), but look forward to new improvements with excitement...</li>
            <li> It creates big loose waves that look really natural, which I love.</li>
            <li> I got the 1 1/2 inch because I wanted nice loose, big curls, but I think I should have gotten a smaller size.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was defective at first &amp; Amazon actually sent me a new one with hopes that it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets so hot that my hair can actually burn me</li>
            <li> If you want curls; buy a small hair straightener and it will curl 100% better than this one.</li>
            <li> The pro&#x27;s by far out weigh my 1 con!  </li>
            <li> Not frizzy after I complete, even though the humidity in the south sometimes nothing works!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant when purchasing this since the price was pretty low.  </li>
            <li> My hair used to get caught every once in a while in my old one but this barrel just glides over your hair -- in fact, it&#x27;s so smooth that you may need to adjust your technique a bit as you curl because it doesn&#x27;t pull and tangle or catch as you use it like other curling irons do.  </li>
            <li> It stays hot the entire time I curl my hair.</li>
            <li> love the double ceramic as it allows my hair to glide easily down the barrel.</li>
            <li> The size is okay, but the clip doesn&#x27;t hold my hair tight enough and it just doesn&#x27;t curl!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous since its so cheap</li>
            <li> For years I have used a flat iron to style it into shape - more or less a bob.  </li>
            <li> You can clearly see when it is on and and you can manually set the curler&#x27;s temp.</li>
            <li> I bought it from Amazon to replace her old Conair iron that burned out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues as far as pulling my hair or not grabbing it</li>
            <li> so I always wear an old pair of glasses to keep the iron from getting too close.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a curling a lot, but haven&#x27;t much in the last 5-10 years.</li>
            <li> Im liking the results so far.</li>
            <li> So far, this iron has done nothing for me.</li>
            <li> After deciding to give my hair a break and switch to curling (my hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a professional hair stylist for 20+ yrs.</li>
            <li> Would use this in a professional setting.</li>
            <li> My old lady hates this thing.</li>
            <li> I am use to Conairs with the round smooth cords.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, so I like using this curling iron for controlled waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Does not work nearly as well as any curling iron I have had.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this only because it&#x27;s fast and makes my hair look shiny.</li>
            <li> only thing i don&#x27;t like that much is its holder cause it&#x27;s made from low-quality material (in my eyesight)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but  </li>
            <li> I already have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> It does fall a lot throughout the day, unlike when I use my professional brand curling wand.  </li>
            <li> and it would go back to straight.</li>
            <li> I really like the open loop on the head&#x27;s end for keeping hold of the iron.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to have 3 identical ones, but the styling of this one is just slightly different.  </li>
            <li> The only real problem I had with this curling iron is the heat setting is a wheel on the handle that spins.  </li>
            <li> Also, this model has the shortest cord I&#x27;ve ever had, unless your power outlet is directly in-front of the mirror that you use, get an extension.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong on a curling iron with good reviews?</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;d be a good deal, since it wasn&#x27;t expensive, if I could get what it advertises...</li>
            <li> This is a good curling iron but not perfect.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and long but waves easily and curls with the right amount of heat.</li>
            <li> Works well but even with the wide heat range, I don&#x27;t always think it gets hot enough for my hair (but I have very stubborn hair).</li>
            <li> I tried small, medium and large sections and they all slip right out.</li>
            <li> This curling iron does not get hot enough to actually put any shape in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have an older slightly larger barrel curling iron I was trying to replace because it is falling apart.  </li>
            <li> This model has a useful wire stand to hold the iron off of a surface when it is set down.  </li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s clip is much looser, so it is difficult to hold the hair long enough to get a good curl.</li>
            <li> I like my new Conair Double Ceramic Curling Iron.  </li>
            <li> , I get the big curls that will last for the whole day with the help of a hair spray.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the grip of the clamp could do a better job of holding on to the hair.  </li>
            <li> The main caution is one has to be careful with this and any other hot tool near the eyes</li>
            <li> Plus, the heat makes fast long lasting curls to my mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li> I have the setting barely turned on for my hair.  </li>
            <li> This morning my hair did get caught in the plastic near the middle of the barrel.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a minor annoyance I&#x27;ll have to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I picked It up at Walmart came home and tried it in my hair :) it heats up fast, I use between 10-15 settings and I got loose soft curls on my wavy thick hair&lt;3 I gave it a 4 out of 5 because the only problem I have is the cord isn&#x27;t long enough, I do my hair on the floor next to an outlet and that isn&#x27;t the problem</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s MUCH MUCH cheaper than other curling irons.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see Conair have such a quality product at such a low price.</li>
            <li> Barely curls and if it does the curl doesn&#x27;t last even with holding spray.</li>
            <li> My hair gets silkier, which is not a bad thing, but it&#x27;s like it loses all texture and doesn&#x27;t hold anything, almost like when I flat-iron my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tough to curl hair, so the heat settings on the curling iron makes it easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> But if you have medium to thick hair you won&#x27;t have any problem, and if your hair is fine like mine, it might be a minor problem.  </li>
            <li> I have long medium thickness  red hair with a bit of natural wave.  </li>
            <li> (but my hair is much too long to not use the whole barrel), flip it up and down when you pick up/set down, or just not use it at all.  </li>
            <li> This sucker gets hot!  </li>
            <li> I find it little pit heavy and difficult to manage but the results are very good</li>
            <li> , it heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell burned, like other curling irons I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Yes, it can snag my hair at times at the base, but for the small amount of money I paid, it does a great job!!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how evenly it heats, but I have purchased several Conair hair products in the past and don&#x27;t doubt this will work fine.</li>
            <li> The other problem is that you can easily burn the tips of your fingers when you are holding the base with one hand and the top with the other.</li>
            <li> the curling iron just made it look flat, not even wavy.</li>
            <li> but I find that the curls do not last long.</li>
            <li> I had moved to flat irons.</li>
            <li> has long hair and wanted a larger barrel.  </li>
            <li> have long hair that reaches my lower back, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> She has so much hair that it&#x27;s hard to do it with anything smaller than 1 1/2 inches.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a total waste as it do curl your hair, such as bumping it but not definite curls that will last.</li>
            <li> but it only went up to 375 degrees which I now know is not hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> Did not have any of these issues with the much much older models from the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> The Barrel is Big but dont take long to do all of your Hair !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always sad that the model I&#x27;m replacing is no longer available</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the curls hold well all day.</li>
            <li> This one is too short and harder maneuver.</li>
            <li> while this does get hot, it does poor job actually curling the hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick and medium length hair and this curler gives me very pretty waves vs tight curls.</li>
            <li> Other than that I definitely recommend this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Purchased it when my hair was very long</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> The stand is quite clumsy as you really need to close it for winding long hair around the barrel and then put it down again while you resection hair.</li>
            <li> Creates loose beachy waves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I get loose curls on my medium length layered hair.  </li>
            <li> I just flip it back and forth when I need to set it down or pick it up.</li>
            <li> It has to be flipped back into position before you can put the unit down.</li>
            <li> Does as expected but u should have went with an inch to an in a half smaller.</li>
            <li> My experience with curling irons is limited, but you cannot beat the value of this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the fact that it&#x27;s made of ceramic; the clip to hold your hair isn&#x27;t tight enough.</li>
            <li> Only drawback the wand length could be a little longer to accomodate longer hair.  </li>
            <li> Cord is a little short for me though.</li>
            <li> I bought this in late November and although it did the job while it was working, it ended up not heating up at ALL by early January.</li>
            <li> the curls I get are very loose and not defined.</li>
            <li> If it wouldn&#x27;t be for the trouble; I would send it back.</li>
            <li> However, you must be careful.  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t careful holding the handle</li>
            <li> It works as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> but I do have to constantly be careful not to let my hair get too close to that joint.</li>
            <li> It has adjustable heat settings and even my coarse thick hair only needs about medium heat.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the wire &amp;#34;support&amp;#34; gets tangled in my long hair at times.</li>
            <li> Just got this curling iron the other day</li>
            <li> Conair isn&#x27;t known for being top in hair products and it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that it&#x27;s disappointed, yet again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my current curling iron has a small barrel and makes too-tight curls.  </li>
            <li> This was just not hot</li>
            <li> Other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers concerning the cord and the barrel length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used only Conair brand curling irons for the past 15 years or so.</li>
            <li> but it does not give you tight curls really loose waves</li>
            <li> Yes, my hair gets caught in the little crevice between the clamp and the barrel, but that&#x27;s somewhat expected with curling irons.</li>
            <li> I would like to see something that makes turning it off a little harder.</li>
            <li> The other complaint, the old version had a small plastic stand that held the barrel up while it was resting on a level surface.</li>
            <li> It takes me at least 10 minutes to fully blow dry my hair, and using this iron, I can get loose beachy waves within 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Makes me really sad because I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> The only thing negative</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the hassell of returning</li>
            <li> I keep it at 30 as I have thick, coarse</li>
            <li> I usually flaunt my long black hair</li>
            <li> The way the kick stand thing is designed causes your hair to get stuck and ripped out even when you fold it down.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a dud, but the thumb lever doesn&#x27;t hold the hairs down and they just slip out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I took a chance on this iron which is one and one half inches in diam.  </li>
            <li> I had bought this curling iron at Walmart about two and a half years ago.</li>
            <li> The on off button  is in and odd place</li>
            <li> On this curler, the black thumb clip has this plastic part that goes up onto the ceramic curler barrel.</li>
            <li> If you try to curl your hair, it is basically GUARANTEED that 5-10 strands of your hair will be caught between the barrel and the black part and burn them to a crisp/pull them out.</li>
            <li> She went out and bought another one less than a week after getting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had conair for a year and a half</li>
            <li> so you need less pressure and pull as you</li>
            <li> and I had the heat setting on half way.  </li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron to replace the previous gold version.</li>
            <li> The ON/OFF buttons are slightly recessed so you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally turning it off while using it.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve owned other curling irons like this, but they were not nearly as nice and did not clamp onto the hair enough for my liking.</li>
            <li> Also, the &amp;#34;kickstand&amp;#34; takes up about an inch of the iron leaving less room when using on long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> There are these little screws that you can&#x27;t keep your hair from getting wrapped around.</li>
            <li> I almost purchased one at twice the price and decided to be a little frugal</li>
            <li> but I think if you need tight curls then you should get the half inch!</li>
            <li> Had a couple of mishaps before getting my method down!  </li>
            <li> the curling iron is on the heavy  side</li>
            <li> so one might find it difficult especially if you have a thick hair to work with like mine but its definitely bearable.</li>
            <li> I have used this curling iron everyday since I received it.</li>
            <li> I recommend you save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> but, it may hurt ur hair of u use everyday.</li>
            <li> There are also a few design flaws.</li>
            <li> I curl my hair everyday and this tool does the job.</li>
            <li> I had owned the gold version for approximately 8 years with nearly daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that it seems to take a very long time to heat up and still does not seen to produce much of a curl or body.  </li>
            <li> I usually use just  a few Velcro rollers for a little volume at the roots.  </li>
            <li> The metal stand gets a bit annoying, careful as that piece may get hot.</li>
            <li> I think the dial of little numbers is excessive.  </li>
            <li> This is super annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using think curling irons for years and bought a few that were not very good in the past.  </li>
            <li> Usually I do Revlonproducts but couldn&#x27;t find what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and I have no issues with it accidentally turning off while I am doing my hair-which usually happens when I do my hair.</li>
            <li> am not sure to what temperature it heats up though.</li>
            <li> and it usually takes styling well.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> I usually wear sew ins</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Personal thing, but the metal stand piece is a annoying to push back and forth</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my curls were so loose, that before I&lt;br</li>
            <li> have fairly thick and hard to curl hair</li>
            <li> and it just sucks.</li>
            <li> I honestly do not understand why people buy this -_- including me</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would spend at least an hour curling my hair for it to fall</li>
            <li> It is at least $20 cheaper than what you buy at Sallys.</li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve been at least 3 inches longer for optimal functionality.</li>
            <li> My complaint with this one is it keeps ripping my hair out if it slides too close to where the clamp and barrel meet.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick</li>
            <li> Even with the highest temp setting, doesn&#x27;t seem to curl my daughter&#x27;s thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> its too thick, cannot curl my hair with this,</li>
            <li> i waste of time and money!!</li>
            <li> No more burned fingers!</li>
            <li> I purchased the product in July, and it&#x27;s already broken and past the return date.</li>
            <li> Conair has put some serious thought and technology into this line of curling irons and they&#x27;ve made a customer for life out of me.</li>
            <li> Not a crappy tool, just not exceptional in design or function.</li>
            <li> Not a good Curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have used curling irons in the past and this is absolutely the worst one.</li>
            <li> but I realized my hair style has been pretty boring so why not curl it for a change.</li>
            <li> In comparison to you curl curling wands ( I got both sizes), the heat levels on the double ceramic curler are very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I have very thick hair...</li>
            <li> I spend 45 minutes trying to curl my hair only to put it in a messy bun at the end because it looks horrible.  </li>
            <li> and I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> The two things I don&#x27;t like are that the stand can be frustrating</li>
            <li> I have to constantly touch up through the day which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I had to replace mine because the electrical was broken (wire).</li>
            <li> it was really frustrating.</li>
            <li> The cord is a bit irritating in that</li>
            <li> Bought this curling iron about 1 month ago and use it approximately 5 days out of the week.</li>
            <li> Not good at all for kids!  </li>
            <li> I hate how the other ones that has gold plates.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Total waste of money, so disappointed.</li>
            <li> But a fail.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one does not perform for me and I will be returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe the problem is my sraight hair idk, but i was really sad.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It turns off randomly while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> But after about 10-20 mins it&#x27;s flat and boring.</li>
            <li> I use premium quality hair and would hate to destroy it with bad heating irons.  </li>
            <li> it can be annoying trying to grab the thin piece of plastic to curl your hair and not burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comparing this to my Babyliss Pro Porcelain curling iron which was horrible and couldn&#x27;t hold a curl for less than 5min.!</li>
            <li> No need to spend your money on the expensive ones!</li>
            <li> Jeez, what a bad purchase...</li>
            <li> On, Off buttons in a bad position as when your rolling your hair you accidently hit the off button so you have to check its still on with each curl.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> And this listing said it comes with a bonus heat shield, no bonus :(</li>
            <li> and I am disappointed with the electrical cord.  </li>
            <li> A bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This version has a metal stand that folds against the base of the curling iron while in use.</li>
            <li> My hair gets stuck in the base and rips out.</li>
            <li> I hate the wire</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very disappointed it doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hate this!</li>
            <li> My hair gets caught at the base of the barrel, it pulls some hair out and breaks the others!</li>
            <li> Very annoying.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a dozen times, and the result is horrible every time.  </li>
            <li> Terrible mistake.  </li>

            <li> Just got this curling iron the other day and I love it. Exactly what I was looking for, for some nice waves</li>
            <li> This sucker gets hot!  I can use it as a straightening iron more so than a curling iron, but my hair is shorter.  It gets so hot that my hair can actually burn me but my hair is so shiny after use and its benefits last all day.</li>
            <li> quick heating, easy to use, good results.</li>
            <li> Works great for my wife&#x27;s hair.  I bought it from Amazon to replace her old Conair iron that burned out.  She likes this one better.</li>
            <li> The barrel was too large for my hair to hold the curl. Works fine though! Heats up very quickly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool if you don&#x27;t use too much heat. I like my curling iron to get hot real fast and this doesn&#x27;t do it for me. It&#x27;s not a total waste as it do curl your hair, such as bumping it but not definite curls that will last.</li>
            <li> Gotta love those curls!</li>
            <li> I know have this curling iron in 2 sizes and they are the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this iron! Purchased it when my hair was very long and it always did the job.</li>
            <li> Great iron for the price. I love having a bag to put over it when i need to put it away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!  I love this curling iron!</li>
            <li> Great price perfect size, my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Good product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works great and for this price? Very happy.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted and works great.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this curling iron. Works well, heats up fast, and keeps the frizz at bay. Great size for big loose curls too.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully.  Keeps the style for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> It grabs &amp; pulls my hair out! Ouch! Have tried several times positioning differently? Nope. Looking at where curling iron meets the handle and all around lever? My hair samples</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and curls my hair nicely. When I read about the tip at the end to hold onto more easily, I didn&#x27;t really see how that could be such a plus but it sure does make using the iron easier to roll on and off of my hair!</li>
            <li> this is a really good curling for long hair, it gives good volume to it .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I buy a new curling iron am so happy it came on time I can not wait to use my technique</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed with this product.  I have purchased many curling irons in my life.  This was a first, one that doesn&#x27;t curl!!!</li>
            <li> The way the kick stand thing is designed causes your hair to get stuck and ripped out even when you fold it down. There are these little screws that you can&#x27;t keep your hair from getting wrapped around.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get my hair to curl</li>
            <li> my hair is curly. but surprisingly with this curling iron it did not hold its curl. the curling iron just made it look flat, not even wavy.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a curling irom.....hmmm it does the trick.</li>
            <li> I really like it. Usually I do Revlonproducts but couldn&#x27;t find what I was looking for. I&#x27;ve had no issues as far as pulling my hair or not grabbing it and I have thin hair. The two things I don&#x27;t like are that the stand can be frustrating it should be built in instead of having to move it back and forth every time and the top should be solid it can be annoying trying to grab the thin piece of plastic to curl your hair and not burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> I comes damage, cuz dont warn up !!!the people i ibougth it was very upset about it i was  i waste of time and money!!</li>
            <li> I had ordered this to be delivered to my son&#x27;s home for when I visited. I enjoyed it so much during my visit That I ordered one for my own home. Nothing fancy it just takes care of business!</li>
            <li> love this curling iron. doesn&#x27;t burn or make my hair smell burt. very nice curls that hold all day long</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just new to the whole hair curling world, but it was a lot more difficult than I&#x27;d thought it would be to make nice curls. It gets hot fast, which is nice but the curls I get are very loose and not defined. I should have probably gotten the 1&amp;#34; barrel instead of 1-1/2&amp;#34; but for now I will keep trying until I figure out how to properly curl hair. I&#x27;ll return to write a better review once I&#x27;ve learned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have learned to curl hair now but I find that the curls do not last long. I have to constantly touch up through the day which is annoying.</li>
            <li> This product is Great. I love how my hair looks after using this iron!</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely loves this IRON. can not say any more, especially if you know my wife</li>
            <li> My niece requested this curler on her Christmas list. It hasn&#x27;t been used yet so I&#x27;m not sure how evenly it heats, but I have purchased several Conair hair products in the past and don&#x27;t doubt this will work fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron in kmart for $14.99 and I just had to review it. It works really well, it heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell burned, like other curling irons I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s great that you can pick it up at any pharmacy or local store, and at such a cheap cost! It&#x27;s a must have! If your thinking about getting it, don&#x27;t think anymore...JUST GET IT! You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get super hot, but it does the job. The metal stand gets a bit annoying, careful as that piece may get hot.</li>
            <li> Love the curls I get and heats up fast</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> it really doesnt hold curls, but its ok if u put rollers in your hair after using it and go to bed</li>
            <li> DOES NOT CURL YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> The double ceramic plates are key. This curling iron is the best I&#x27;ve had, and at a great price. I was surprised to see Conair have such a quality product at such a low price.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair about earlobe length.  For years I have used a flat iron to style it into shape - more or less a bob.  I found that my hair was lacking some fullness so I took a chance on this iron which is one and one half inches in diam.  It works well, gets hot quickly, has varying degrees to set for heat,  and also  has a tip that prevents finger burn. It&#x27;s very smooth and there&#x27;s no pulling on the hair even after using product. The main caution is one has to be careful with this and any other hot tool near the eyes so I always wear an old pair of glasses to keep the iron from getting too close.  Back to the product, it&#x27;s a very good price and it does what I want it to do.  Very pleased and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This curling iron creates the perfect loose big curls in my hair. I have tough to curl hair, so the heat settings on the curling iron makes it easy to adjust. It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changes I would make: One is to the stand that it has to hold the curling iron when standing. It doesn&#x27;t sit well on the counter. Another thing that would make this curling iron perfect is if it came with a lock to keep the heat from turning off. Occasionally I hit the off button while using it. It would be nice to have the option to lock the curling iron on.</li>
            <li> Jeez, what a bad purchase...How can you go wrong on a curling iron with good reviews? The size is okay, but the clip doesn&#x27;t hold my hair tight enough and it just doesn&#x27;t curl! I had to replace mine because the electrical was broken (wire). My hair is fine but I have a lot. I tried to curl all the ways...and it just sucks. It must be my hair, I guess. It&#x27;s not the fact that it&#x27;s made of ceramic; the clip to hold your hair isn&#x27;t tight enough. If it wouldn&#x27;t be for the trouble; I would send it back. A future garage sale item! If you want curls; buy a small hair straightener and it will curl 100% better than this one. I really don&#x27;t understand....and I really don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used to use a curling a lot, but haven&#x27;t much in the last 5-10 years. I had moved to flat irons. However, I will say that I am very satisfied with this curling iron. It&#x27;s super easy to use. The settings are great. The hair doesn&#x27;t get caught when you&#x27;re curling it up. The plastic piece on the end of the hot iron is convenient if you want or need to hold both ends. And the heat has many options and gets hot very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new curling iron.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for her birthday and picked one up for myself as well.. It is a great curling iron!</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like it should.  Still in the package.  Brand new, never been opened.  Shipped and received undamaged.  Product is great.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the tip does not get hot and is large enough to keep your fingers safe.  The tip is also a hook so your fingers stay safe.  I think the dial of little numbers is excessive.  Honestly, dials should go from 1-10 and that&#x27;s it.  However, the heat is accurate.  It is a good size for my toddler&#x27;s hair and also my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. It works great on my fine hair since my hair does not slip through while im trying to curl. The tip is also very easy to hold while curling which makes it extremely user friendly. Makes big curls. Price is right</li>
            <li> This is a great iron. I had one before this--same model--left it in Seattle after a trip, and had to get another. The price made it easier to deal with the loss and replacement.</li>
            <li> Heats up nicely and fast. Only drawback the wand length could be a little longer to accomodate longer hair.  Would be a great buy for someone with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I like this iron. It works well and has about 30 temperature settings, so you can tailor the temperature to your needs. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, it really brings the heat. It makes nice smooth curls and I have no issues with it accidentally turning off while I am doing my hair-which usually happens when I do my hair. I really like the heat proof sleeve and how quickly it heats up. Really saves me time in the morning. Plus, the heat makes fast long lasting curls to my mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li> I had bought this curling iron at Walmart about two and a half years ago. It recently went out on me and they no longer carry it at Walmart. Was very happy to find it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I love the double ceramic as it allows my hair to glide easily down the barrel. The other feature that sets it apart is the plastic loop hole at the top. This allows for easy grip and turn without slipping your fingers onto the hot area - others just have a knob at the tip and it does not prevent your fingers from slipping.&lt;br /&gt;I love this curling iron so much I purchased more than one.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure to what temperature it heats up though. It has a dial that you turn, levels 1 through 30.  I keep it at 30 as I have thick, coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would but it again.</li>
            <li> I thought it would hold a curl on my hair. But a fail. My hair is really thick so I kinda figured that would happen. Oh well I am stuck with it now.</li>
            <li> This is the BOMB!  However, you must be careful.  It gets SUPER hot.  Not good at all for kids!  Had a couple of mishaps before getting my method down!  :o)  Great buy for the money!</li>
            <li> The on off button  is in and odd place and I have to work around it each time I pick up the iron to do a section of hair. Also, the &amp;#34;kickstand&amp;#34; takes up about an inch of the iron leaving less room when using on long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> A super great deal! I really like this curling iron and think that it works really well on my hair and creates beautiful and even curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats relatively fast and you can adjust the heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;- The cord rotates so that you don&#x27;t get it all bunched up when you twist it.&lt;br /&gt;- Creates loose beachy waves.&lt;br /&gt;- Holds the hair well, I have had no problems getting an even curl all the way through the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Personal thing, but the metal stand piece is a annoying to push back and forth, I have to use the corner of the counter.&lt;br /&gt;- If you aren&#x27;t careful holding the handle it is easy to click the button to turn it off as they are pretty sensitive but once you get used to where the button is it gets much easier to avoid hitting it.</li>
            <li> This curling iron lasted for a year, with daily use. But then it overheated, frying my hair (and breaking it off). The next time I tried to turn it on, the light flashed but the iron did not heat up. It is now in the trash and I am shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, leaved beautiful curls.  My only complaint is that the wire &amp;#34;support&amp;#34; gets tangled in my long hair at times. It also gets stuck in the barrel from time to time.  Overall great product though!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it says it works great n she looks great</li>
            <li> Works perfect...Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the 1 1/2 inch curling iron and Omg I love this product!!! I ordered it on Wednesday and it&#x27;s delivered to me on Friday...Fast as lightning! Plus, it&#x27;s super easy and quick to curl your hair! It only takes me 15 mins to do all my hair...the price is so cheap too! Definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I was prepared to love this product. My room mate has a the Infiniti Conair curler and she recommended the brand, but I saw that this product was cheaper than that one. I figured what the heck, and bought it. Big mistake. If you look at the Infinit curler (which is only $3.00 more!) you will immediately see the difference. On this curler, the black thumb clip has this plastic part that goes up onto the ceramic curler barrel. If you try to curl your hair, it is basically GUARANTEED that 5-10 strands of your hair will be caught between the barrel and the black part and burn them to a crisp/pull them out. Check out the infiniti by comparison: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5AG5E/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 . It is also sold by amazon, also has prime shipping, and the area above the thumb clip is also made of the ceramic material of the curler, making sure that it doesn&#x27;t catch and tear your hear, and also gives you more surface area! I am returning this product and definitely buying the Infiniti</li>
            <li> I bought this because I need to spice up my hair routine. I usually flaunt my long black hair but I realized my hair style has been pretty boring so why not curl it for a change. However I don&#x27;t want a permanent curl and this conair ceramic curling iron does the job! I have been using it for months now and I use it whenever I have a lot of extra time or I have a special occasion to attend to. Im liking the results so far. It heats up very fast and because it&#x27;s barrel size is 1 and 1/2 in diameter, I get the big curls that will last for the whole day with the help of a hair spray.  The handle is about 4 inches long enough to get a good grip and not to accidentally turn the curler off. You can clearly see when it is on and and you can manually set the curler&#x27;s temp. When you&#x27;re done using it, you can use its thermo bag  storage. the curling iron is on the heavy  side so one might find it difficult especially if you have a thick hair to work with like mine but its definitely bearable. So overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used curling irons in the past and this is absolutely the worst one. The one star I did give it is for the fast warm up time and the little kick stand to keep it from touching your counter or night stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair slips out of the hold plate. I tried small, medium and large sections and they all slip right out. Maybe I got a dud, but the thumb lever doesn&#x27;t hold the hairs down and they just slip out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to get a HUGE chunk of hair in and those curls came out with bumps/ridges where the edge of the movable plate isnt&#x27; quite flush with the rest of the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money, so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats this. It broke after many years and I replaced it with something else. What a piece of junk that one is. Need to get the Conair again. Fast!</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and ceramic barrel smooths out my frizzy hair nicely and easily.  Location of the heat control setting not the best design as it&#x27;s to easy to accidentally change settings while using it so I had to tape it to keep it on the setting I want.</li>
            <li> Great for adding body or smoothing out hair texture.  Gets hot fast!</li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 stars of weren&#x27;t for the fact that the curls don&#x27;t last in my stubborn hair... Thought it would be different from others but the curls are beautiful..</li>
            <li> while this does get hot, it does poor job actually curling the hair. I bought a larger barrel, hoping for looser curls, but there&#x27;s a difference between *no curl* and *looser curl*. So far, this iron has done nothing for me. if i grab a smaller section, the hair slips from under the grip. if I grab a larger section, the outer curls don&#x27;t get set at all. very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a straightener on my hair for years. After deciding to give my hair a break and switch to curling (my hair is naturally wavy so it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to curl), I researched this iron on Amazon and was impressed with all of the positive reviews as well as the low cost. As soon as I received it I started practicing on my hair and I absolutely love the results!! It gives beautiful curls and the small &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; on the tip helps you to hold the iron without burning your fingers. In the past I&#x27;ve owned other curling irons like this, but they were not nearly as nice and did not clamp onto the hair enough for my liking. I would recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have used this curling iron everyday since I received it. Easy to use and works like a charm. It has adjustable heat settings and even my coarse thick hair only needs about medium heat. Good purchase!</li>
            <li> Love it and for the price as well. It&#x27;s just what I needed. I really like how my curls come out when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curler!! I have thick and medium length hair and this curler gives me very pretty waves vs tight curls. I can do variety of hairstyles and I am loving the versatility of it. Comes with a heat protective pouch I wish it came with a glove as well but hey for the price it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> Works well with my frizzy hair which resists styling and it helps get it straightened out.  My hair dresser turned me onto this product.</li>
            <li> *I did not buy this through Amazon but at Bartell Drugs*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only writing this review because I am in search of a curling iron that actually holds curls for longer than 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair dresser curls my hair, she uses a straightening iron that will keep curls in my hair for days. But I am not so talented. I have troubles curling my hair with my straightening iron so I needed to find an actual curling iron. The Conair does NOT hold up. I know it&#x27;s not because of the texture of my hair (somewhat fine and color treated) because as I mentioned above, my hairdresser curls my hair every time I go in to get a dye job and it holds for days... Unfortunately this one does not perform for me and I will be returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the curl looks really good- a pretty loose spiral. But after about 10-20 mins it&#x27;s flat and boring. The iron takes about 5 mins to get really hot too. No Bueno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a quest to find a decent one for under $50. If anyone has any suggestions, please comment!!</li>
            <li> This curling iron has a nice large barrel. It heats up quickly and does the job!</li>
            <li> All in all it has proven to do what it says I do like the curl and waves it gives me.  I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really like this item.  Shipment came really quick which is what I paid for but it was awesome. It works great. Love this item a lot.</li>
            <li> Really! I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;ve been a professional hair stylist for 20+ yrs. and purchased this iron for personal use. I have used a lot of products, and this iron is really great. Would use this in a professional setting. Heats quick, thick or fine hair, 30 adjustable heat settings, swivel and long cord, double ceramic, and the most important, the non stick coating is really non stick, hair glides right through (no snagging) and hair product does NOT get stuck on the iron. So my only criticism is that my fingers sometimes change the heat settings, but oh well, you are aware when it happens and can re adjust, by all means not a deal breaker. The pro&#x27;s by far out weigh my 1 con!  And this listing said it comes with a bonus heat shield, no bonus :(</li>
            <li> I cant wait to try this wand out i just received it and the size is great. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> Love it. Heats up quickly.  One draw back is the heat adjustment sometimes turns during use. Has a tip that is cool to the touch for more elaborate styling needs or to hang it.</li>
            <li> I am sooo happy!!! Its light weight and perfect!!! I needed a new curling iron and i didnt want to spend too much and this was soooo amazing!!! i curled my hair today to try it out and it came out lovely!!!! plus the fact that is light weight is a plus. It also has heat settings so you can control the temperature!!!!</li>
            <li> Even with the highest temp setting, doesn&#x27;t seem to curl my daughter&#x27;s thick wavy hair. She got a nice little burn across her forehead from it though..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the reviews on this are so good- I get better curls by using my straitener. It takes way too long to get not even an okay curl- it only really curls the bottom of your section of hair (so the top and middle aren&#x27;t curled, just curls at the bottom- even on the highest heat setting). Heat applied for longer than 30 seconds damages your hair and it just didn&#x27;t produce the big waviness that I was looking for with this size of an iron. I thought it&#x27;d be a good deal, since it wasn&#x27;t expensive, if I could get what it advertises... but it&#x27;s not, at all. Conair isn&#x27;t known for being top in hair products and it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that it&#x27;s disappointed, yet again. I will splurge on a better iron than deal with the frustration that comes with trying to use this mess. I recommend you save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> Just the size I wanted.</li>
            <li> No problems as of yet. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, heats up quickly and evenly.  I only need it on the 20 setting and I have very thick hair... I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d try any hotter setting! Yikes!</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! Read all the reviews, but the most important feature was the tip that allows you to hold the iron with your fingers to control the way the iron is curling. No more burned fingers! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have hair that&#x27;s almost uncurl-able, but this curling iron did the job! My hair was very shiny and curled up like a spring. Yes, my hair gets caught in the little crevice between the clamp and the barrel, but that&#x27;s somewhat expected with curling irons.</li>
            <li> Great, barrell gets nice and lot, and i love the ceramic coating. It doesn&#x27;t snag as much as my hot tools curling iron, which is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a good curling iron but not perfect.  I have an earlier model and liked using it on my long hair, so when I needed a second one, I decided on a conair. I could tell by the photo that this one would be different. This model has a useful wire stand to hold the iron off of a surface when it is set down.  The on-off buttons are well located and have functioned well. A red light tells you that it is heating or hot.  I do not like the new way that temperature is set. The earlier model had a button-touch setting for temperature; you set it and it stayed set.  This newer model has a kind of wheel around the handle that can be spun to set the temperature.  The problem is that the wheel moves with almost no pressure and it is located where you hold the iron.  So every time your raise the iron. the wheel easily moves out of the setting you have selected.  Another nice feature is a heat protective sleeve is provided that covers the iron and lets you put it away while it cools.  I would not purchase this model again, but I continue to use it with care.</li>
            <li> My old lady hates this thing. She went out and bought another one less than a week after getting it.</li>
            <li> Hate this! My hair will hold curls pretty well but not with this. I have tried everything. Makes me really sad because I really wanted this to work but they fall as soon as I curl them.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is a pain! My hair gets caught at the base of the barrel, it pulls some hair out and breaks the others! The curls never hold! On, Off buttons in a bad position as when your rolling your hair you accidently hit the off button so you have to check its still on with each curl.</li>
            <li> Bought in England and did not come with adapter plug. Good product works well with thick hair, not thin hair</li>
            <li> Love the curling iron. Does just what I need it to do. Not frizzy after I complete, even though the humidity in the south sometimes nothing works!</li>
            <li> I love it but the only reason it got 4 stars was because the plug didn&#x27;t fit in the socket :/ maybe it&#x27;s just the way the socket is, but otherwise it&#x27;s a great curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love this iron, BUT I dont like the on/off switch location. You can cut it off while curling your hair without knowledge. I have human hair extensions in my hair, within seconds.my hair is curled.</li>
            <li> Wish I could do 3.5  It&#x27;s ok...it does the job, but I don&#x27;t like it as well as the one that I have had for years that I replaced it with.  That one was a Revlon, but since the recent Revlon curling irons aren&#x27;t getting great reviews, I thought it would be better to try a different product. There&#x27;s something about the staying power of the curls that I don&#x27;t love.  My hair gets silkier, which is not a bad thing, but it&#x27;s like it loses all texture and doesn&#x27;t hold anything, almost like when I flat-iron my hair.  I have had similar results with another ceramic product, so maybe it&#x27;s the ceramic factor?  Because it&#x27;s still fairly new, I am still experimenting with different products and processes to get it right.  Another thing about this one is that the stand comes up 1/4 of the barrel when it&#x27;s extended, so when you try to wrap your hair around the wand, it gets caught on the stand.  Very annoying.  So either you can work around it (but my hair is much too long to not use the whole barrel), flip it up and down when you pick up/set down, or just not use it at all.  I just use my curling iron without the stand and I rest it in the bowl of the sink.  It works ok, but it really shouldn&#x27;t come to that.</li>
            <li> tried to use it once&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t hold curls,doesn&#x27;t make curls actually&lt;br /&gt;it work more like a flat iron</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair i have a raid hair no volume i&#x27;m very disappointed it doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I like how cheap this curling iron is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep accidentally pressing the on/off button while using this. It creates big loose waves that look really natural, which I love. But they dont hold for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont regret buying, it´s a good styling tool and it´s super cheap.</li>
            <li> very good item i super recomend</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron for a trip to the UK and France. It worked perfectly with the adapters and I never had any issues with lack of heat. I love the fact that my hair slides smoothly like a straightener and curling iron all in one. I have long hair and the curls hold well all day.</li>
            <li> This is a one of my best purchases. I can get the frizz out quickly and it stays!&lt;br /&gt;I have course hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> No no no, do not buy this if you want the curls will last more than 30 minutes. I honestly do not understand why people buy this -_- including me</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love the little stand.</li>
            <li> Good for this price! Like this big curve!&lt;br /&gt;Heat up very fast, but, it may hurt ur hair of u use everyday.</li>
            <li> I honestly have no idea why this curling iron has so many positive reviews.  I looked around a lot for a new iron, and I was so excited when I settled on this one.  I have used it a dozen times, and the result is horrible every time.  It definitely makes your hair &#x27;shiny&#x27; - to the point where mine looks greasy.  The curls fall right out even at max heat.  I tried  to make this iron work, but it&#x27;s just not possible.  I spend 45 minutes trying to curl my hair only to put it in a messy bun at the end because it looks horrible.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works well but even with the wide heat range, I don&#x27;t always think it gets hot enough for my hair (but I have very stubborn hair).</li>
            <li> Barely curls and if it does the curl doesn&#x27;t last even with holding spray.</li>
            <li> I got the 1 1/2 inch because I wanted nice loose, big curls, but I think I should have gotten a smaller size. I have thinner, straight hair. If you have a similar hair type I recommend the 1 inch or 1 1/4 inch. Other than that I definitely recommend this curling iron. It&#x27;s durable and comes with a nice sleeve to keep it protected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser but was looking for something cheap and easy to use for my MIL. This curling iron heats up fast, gets to 300 I believe and is super light. Which is exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;ve been thinking of getting her the 1in. So yeah. I&#x27;ll be ordering get this product again.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, very smooth through the hair.  Heat setting control is great.  Price is excellent.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice curling iron.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy and gives it just the right amount of lift.  I like my ahir to be smooth and this iron delivers that look.  Glad I got it. Oh, and the heat cover is nice, too.</li>
            <li> the curl does not hold with this iron</li>
            <li> The size and shape of the curler ia good but it doen&#x27;t do a very good job curling the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a backup, because I have another that I loved that is getting old.  This one&#x27;s clip is much looser, so it is difficult to hold the hair long enough to get a good curl.</li>
            <li> That Curling Iron is the best! It does its job very nicely! I hight recommend it ! You will love it too!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my current curling iron has a small barrel and makes too-tight curls.  I wanted bigger, looser curls.  However, though it did make beautiful curls, they only lasted a few seconds.  This has never happened before, since I have very wavy hair that holds a curl well.  Perhaps the barrel was just too big.  It did heat up quickly and was pretty easy to handle, but I sent it back and may try one with a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li> I had planned to gift this purchase. Well, I forgot all about it. I accidently found it recently. At the same time, I grew my hair out. So I opened the package and started to use this curling iron. I love the loop for the tip. It works great. Heats up well. Now for the downside. The bracket it sits on get in the way and I am disappointed with the electrical cord.  I am use to Conairs with the round smooth cords.  This one is too short and harder maneuver.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter  because she kept borrowing my wife&#x27;s.  We don&#x27;t have to worry about her remembering to unplug it.</li>
            <li> My hair just keeps getting stuck to the clamp! Oh the horror!!!</li>
            <li> I find it little pit heavy and difficult to manage but the results are very good</li>
            <li> Good quality fir the price!</li>
            <li> Works great and just what I was after. I love the many settings it has. Great item at a great price</li>
            <li> Love that this iron heats up fast. The curls come out shiny and they last.  I&#x27;m using the 1 1/2 inch barrel and I get loose curls on my medium length layered hair.  My hair is naturally wavy, so I like using this curling iron for controlled waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: heats up quickly, has multiple heat settings, cool top allows two handed use; shiny curls that last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: barrel too short</li>
            <li> Heats really quickly, but overly hot.  I have the setting barely turned on for my hair.  The stand is quite clumsy as you really need to close it for winding long hair around the barrel and then put it down again while you resection hair.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron!  Good price, and gives me nice big soft curls!</li>
            <li> Definitely a well made product but it only went up to 375 degrees which I now know is not hot enough for my hair. I use a thin curling wand that curls and waves wonderfully at 410 degrees and I needed something thicker. My hair is thick and long but waves easily and curls with the right amount of heat. This was just not hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I kept hitting the off button with my finger. I would like to see something that makes turning it off a little harder.</li>
            <li> I bought this in late November and although it did the job while it was working, it ended up not heating up at ALL by early January.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant when purchasing this since the price was pretty low.  I took a shot anyway an bought the iron.  I&#x27;ve been using think curling irons for years and bought a few that were not very good in the past.  This one is GREAT.  Well worth the price and works just as effective as any other iron.  I really like and I&#x27;m even more happy I found it.  I recommend this iron for sure</li>
            <li> Used to buy revlon twice a year. Would always stop working. I&#x27;ve had conair for a year and a half and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron for big wavey hair/loose curls. ALso great price!</li>
            <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t fry my hair and it&#x27;s the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Does not work nearly as well as any curling iron I have had.  Curls do not hold at all</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one of the old gold Conair curling irons and loved it to death (literally!).  When I went to the store to get a replacement, they no longer made it and were out of Conair altogether so I bought a Revlon.  Terrible mistake.  It wouldn&#x27;t curl my hair.  Just left it frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to a different store and picked this product instead.  I didn&#x27;t think the polishing crystals embedded in the wand would actually do anything but I liked the little hook on the end that makes holding the hot wand easier and I had really loved my old Conair, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong about those crystals -- they are like waving a magic wand over your hair and suddenly having smooth and shiny curls!  My hair used to get caught every once in a while in my old one but this barrel just glides over your hair -- in fact, it&#x27;s so smooth that you may need to adjust your technique a bit as you curl because it doesn&#x27;t pull and tangle or catch as you use it like other curling irons do.  There is almost no resistance so you need less pressure and pull as you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly thick and hard to curl hair and I had the heat setting on half way.  It did an amazing job!  Conair has put some serious thought and technology into this line of curling irons and they&#x27;ve made a customer for life out of me.</li>
            <li> Your hair will get caught and pulled out if you clamp it low on the barrel. This is super annoying. I have had many curling irons and this is the first one that&#x27;s ripped out so many of my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I adjust the way I curl my hair so I don&#x27;t have hair caught in the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron gets hot within 1 minute. It stays hot the entire time I curl my hair. I have thick long hair. It takes me at least 10 minutes to fully blow dry my hair, and using this iron, I can get loose beachy waves within 15 minutes. This is really important to me because I have a routine and like to know exactly how long it&#x27;ll take to get my hair looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this only because it&#x27;s fast and makes my hair look shiny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this site unseen for my daughter in another state who needed a new one.  She said she likes it and is very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;She has long hair and wanted a larger barrel.  The best thing about it, from what she told me, is the double ceramic coating on the iron.</li>
            <li> the barrel is a little short for longer hair, but it heats up super quick and gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li> its ok the curler it works ok but it does not give you tight curls really loose waves</li>
            <li> This iron is great! Heats up fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Everything came exactly how it was supposed to! No complaints at all!!</li>
            <li> this is my first stuff from Conair and i like it.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for some cheap curling iron in this size and this thing looks perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it works really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i don&#x27;t like that much is its holder cause it&#x27;s made from low-quality material (in my eyesight)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but  if u compared it with the price.. that&#x27;s definitely worth enough to purchase :)</li>
            <li> JUST AS IN THE PICTURE, awesome</li>
            <li> I already have naturally wavy hair and it usually takes styling well. This curling iron does not get hot enough to actually put any shape in my hair. I have resigned myself to using it as a straightener since I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I like my new Conair Double Ceramic Curling Iron.  It smoothly curls or straighten my hair without over heating.</li>
            <li> Works great with long hair.  Another reviewer commented that they don&#x27;t like the design of the stand; it works fine for me.  I just flip it back and forth when I need to set it down or pick it up.</li>
            <li> My hair is just not long enough for this curling iron, but great for shoulder length hair.  .</li>
            <li> My daughter has been asking for a curling iron for a while now and after reading the reviews I knew that I just had to order this one for her! I am very glad that I did, she loves it! It gives wonderful soft curls!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product at a Target and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!!&lt;br /&gt;I pair it up with my Morrocan Argan Oil and my hair is flawless!&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair that reaches my lower back, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4.&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron gives you nice loose and shiny curls that I&#x27;ve dreamed of having.&lt;br /&gt;I naturally have dry frizzy hair but after using this curler I&#x27;ve received so many compliments when out and about.</li>
            <li> As a lady with ultra fine hair - hair that could easily be curled by a lukewarm iron stick - this product didn&#x27;t do a thing. Great for people who really don&#x27;t like for a hair curler to curl their hair.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron for the price. Yes, it can snag my hair at times at the base, but for the small amount of money I paid, it does a great job!!</li>
            <li> I just picked this up at a local Target for $18 and I was looking for reviews on this but I believe its new so no reviews for this yet. I think this is an upgrade from the Conair Satin Ceramic Curling Iron. First I would like to say I love the color of this curling iron its not ALL gold looking. I hate how the other ones that has gold plates. 2nd, the plates feels smooth and the curls comes out pretty nice and shiny! I&#x27;m comparing this to my Babyliss Pro Porcelain curling iron which was horrible and couldn&#x27;t hold a curl for less than 5min.! I&#x27;m glad I came across this product, Conair never fails me!</li>
            <li> its too thick, cannot curl my hair with this,</li>
            <li> I purchased the product in July, and it&#x27;s already broken and past the return date. This curling iron received a normal amount of use but just didn&#x27;t hold up. There are also a few design flaws. The first is that you can easily change the temperature control with your thumb while you are holding the curling iron handle. The dial just seems to roll while you are gripping the handle. The other problem is that you can easily burn the tips of your fingers when you are holding the base with one hand and the top with the other. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I tried SO hard to love this curling iron because I love Conair product. I thought this product was defective at first &amp; Amazon actually sent me a new one with hopes that it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would spend at least an hour curling my hair for it to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have great hair for curling, and have never had a problem curling it.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron. It does make the hair nice and shiny with out a tight curl.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Love it!</li>
            <li> Not a good Curling iron.  Didn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> A good curling iron. Good price.</li>
            <li> Had to replace my curling Iron this was better then the first one that lasted years.&lt;br /&gt;So glad this curling iron is so reliable. With several girls in the house this makes mornings easier.</li>
            <li> I always buy Conair! Best hairdryers and curling irons on the market! This one heats very quickly, about 5 seconds and it is the perfect size for my chin length bob! The only downside (and it may just be me) is that the heat setting is very easily manipulated while I am releasing the curl, my thumb rolls right over it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an extra to travel with but after the first use has become my first choice. Love how well my curls stay and no frizz!!</li>
            <li> This diameter is too large for my fine hair. I will most likely buy another one that is slightly smaller. Other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li> The heat level is very low. The styling stays for a maximum of 30 minuteson my hair. Very dissatisfied. In comparison to you curl curling wands ( I got both sizes), the heat levels on the double ceramic curler are very disappointing.</li>
            <li> literally PERFECT is the only word to describe this curling iron...I was a little nervous since its so cheap but I love this one more than my friend&#x27;s $250 curler it works much better for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> Reliable curling iron.  Heats quickly and nice balance.  Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> no complaints....liked it...it does the job well....however for my medium length hair i would prefer 1 inch one in the same brand better....:)</li>
            <li> I picked It up at Walmart came home and tried it in my hair :) it heats up fast, I use between 10-15 settings and I got loose soft curls on my wavy thick hair&lt;3 I gave it a 4 out of 5 because the only problem I have is the cord isn&#x27;t long enough, I do my hair on the floor next to an outlet and that isn&#x27;t the problem but if i take it somewhere where the outlet isn&#x27;t that convient then I guess I&#x27;ll have to bring an extra cord to attach. another flaw (in my opinion) was the light wasnt bright enough to see when its ready or heating up. i dont know maybe thats just me. overall I&#x27;m impressed on how it curls :)).</li>
            <li> i have a really straight hair and this does nothing to my hair! maybe the problem is my sraight hair idk, but i was really sad. i tried to let my hair on the curling iron longer but it didn&#x27;t work and my hair smelled like burn</li>
            <li> The plastic is not attached well to the metal. There is a gap which snags a clump of my hair and rips it out each time I use it.</li>
            <li> works great. I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t have a heat settings dial, but it does and I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron. I curl my hair everyday and this tool does the job. I owned it about a year now and it still works great. It heats up super quick and gives a nice curl. This is such an affordable price for a great product. No need to spend your money on the expensive ones!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this curling iron.  I use it as a spare in my gym/overnight bag.  This is the best curling iron I have ever owned.  It is easy to hold and use and the barrel makes my wild hair very smooth.  The style lasts for two days.  And I love that it comes with a sleeve so you can pack it in your bag while it&#x27;s still hot.</li>
            <li> My 13 y/o loves to do her own hair, so I got this for her. She has so much hair that it&#x27;s hard to do it with anything smaller than 1 1/2 inches. She curls her hair in the morning and by the time I pick her up after work at 5:30 pm, her hair is STILL curly. Love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted something to give me the Sheryl Crow waves and not a kinky 80&#x27;s curl. Heats quick and makes nice waves</li>
            <li> This  is a great iron for the price. I have used many curling irons over the years, and have paid more for less quality.&lt;br /&gt; it does not snag the hair, and curls come out beautifully. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this as a curling wand I love the look of the curls this creates but I have to hold my hair around the iron for a long time to achieve a good curl.  It does fall a lot throughout the day, unlike when I use my professional brand curling wand.  It doesn&#x27;t last all day and I find myself touching up the curls if I use it in the morning and then do something again that evening.  It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re just looking for very loose waves though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type: Long, very curly/wavy, frizzy, fine strands but a LOT of them</li>
            <li> I have long medium thickness  red hair with a bit of natural wave.  I usually use just  a few Velcro rollers for a little volume at the roots.  It doesn&#x27;t last all day so I thought I would give the iron a try to get longer hold.  I didn&#x27;t find I got any better curl or wave than I did with the rollers.  The design is nice.  I think it just depends on your hair.  I did like that my hair did not stick to the barrel.</li>
            <li> It works as I expected it to. I have medium length hair and I am happy with it.  My hair did not get burned (the temperature is adjustable)</li>
            <li> My roommate has this curling iron and I loved it so much I had to buy one. Before I had a hot tools curling iron, and it was great, until it got jammed with hair spray (oops). Honestly, I think this one works just as well if not better and it&#x27;s MUCH MUCH cheaper than other curling irons. Also, love the 1.5 in because it makes perfect natural looking curls. My roommate bought this curling iron at Target, but it&#x27;s a couple $ cheaper on Amazon. What a steal!</li>
            <li> Works great. Exactly what I was looking for! I wished they sold it in two sizes as a package. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very nice curling iron and quite big barrel for smoothing or loose shapes. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works great.  It is a nice, big iron that heats up quickly with an extra long cord.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so Easy to use.  Easy to handle.  Fantastic results!  The best my hair has looked in years!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like  this product at all. Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, very inexpensive. It is at least $20 cheaper than what you buy at Sallys.</li>
            <li> Works great, gets SUPER hot and is gentle on my hair! Would recommend to anyone looking for a ceramic curling iron.  Great bargain price too!</li>
            <li> its good but the curls only last for 1-2h</li>
            <li> My experience with curling irons is limited, but you cannot beat the value of this one! Has way more settings than I anticipated, but was still simple to use. Heated up quickly, worked well even on a very low setting. Looks nice, and seems to be a great investment. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for what I needed it for. Heats quickly, intuitive, safe to use. Non - tangling cord, light weight.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron to replace the previous gold version. I had owned the gold version for approximately 8 years with nearly daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, I would highly suggest this item and believe that it is very similar to the older version. There are two &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; features that I did not care for. First, my hair keeps getting caught and pulled out in the plastic clamp (used to hold the hair in place on the barrel). The clamp also does not grip the hair as firmly as the older version, after some getting accustomed to it, I was ok with that. The other complaint, the old version had a small plastic stand that held the barrel up while it was resting on a level surface. This version has a metal stand that folds against the base of the curling iron while in use. It has to be flipped back into position before you can put the unit down. I feel that this metal piece also gets in the way when you are trying to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I love about this version is the ring at the end of the barrel. It makes curling your hair so easy because you can support the barrel end of the curling iron without burning yourself. That is definitely a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; feature that I would keep in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product. When this one breaks, hopefully after another 8 years, I will definitely look for it again!</li>
            <li> I have an older slightly larger barrel curling iron I was trying to replace because it is falling apart.  This was the closest I could find.  I am disappointed that it seems to take a very long time to heat up and still does not seen to produce much of a curl or body.  I generally use the larger iron to smooth my hair and give it body and shape.  A bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent for fine hair. Very easy to use. I love the grip on the end; it helps avoid burning your fingers. I used an earlier version of this curling iron for years until it conked out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a large barrel curling iron, this one is amazing for the price.  I almost purchased one at twice the price and decided to be a little frugal and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Although the safety turn off is very nice (having left an curling iron on one or two times), but it should be set to last a bit longer. Also the part that holds the hair snug to the iron itself is not very tight fitting, so you can not use this to first straighten the hair or if you try to go to the end of your hair &amp; roll up, it will not hold it in place very well.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. It heats up fast and the gets the job done. The only thing negative I have to say about this product is where they places the on off buttons. They are place right where you place your thumb while curling your hair. I have turned it off many times by mistake. Conair, please redesign this curiling iron with the buttons somewhere else!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandaughter for Christmas...she LOVES it!  and that&#x27;s all I have to say!!!!!  OH FOR HEAVENS SAKE!!!</li>
            <li> curls hair the way I like.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me. I don&#x27;t know if I got a dud but it didn&#x27;t curl unless I left my hair on the barrel for a minute. I had it on the highest setting and whenever I had it on there I could see the steam. I was scared my hair would burn off. Even when I did manage to curl it, all I did was pull it and it would go back to straight. it was really frustrating.</li>
            <li> My hair gets stuck in the base and rips out. It turns off randomly while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works great.  It&#x27;s perfect to give you that loose, tosseled look.  Takes a few minutes to heat up but it works great.</li>
            <li> This iron is iiiiight. It does the job, but nothing special. I agree with other reviewers concerning the cord and the barrel length. Both come up short - especially the cord. Should&#x27;ve been at least 3 inches longer for optimal functionality. Not a crappy tool, just not exceptional in design or function. I&#x27;ll continue to use it, nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I bought the one inch! It does very good curls but I think if you need tight curls then you should get the half inch! However, it was nice to find that it works by dual voltage 110 and 220v!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the one I&#x27;ve had for years. My complaint with this one is it keeps ripping my hair out if it slides too close to where the clamp and barrel meet. It could be just one defective product or a manufacturing flaw. I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s not worth the hassell of returning but I do have to constantly be careful not to let my hair get too close to that joint.</li>
            <li> this curling iron heats fairly quickly and once I re-acquainted my self with using a curling iron I am pleased.</li>
            <li> My one complaint about this curling iron is that while it puts the perfect bend in my long, straight, fine, thickish hair, my right thumb keeps clicking the power button and turning it off.  That button is simply not in the best place.  But I own two of these now (one I leave at the in-laws&#x27;), because the grip is good, it heats up fast, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> This iron works really well for me.  I usually wear sew ins and I need a good quality iron to not destroy the hair fibers.  I use premium quality hair and would hate to destroy it with bad heating irons.  Does well. Heats quickly. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I really like the open loop on the head&#x27;s end for keeping hold of the iron. It has allowed the burns on my fingers to heal from the last curling iron I had.  It heats up quickly and I like the swivel cord. My only complaint would be that the grip of the clamp could do a better job of holding on to the hair.  A plus is that I can maneuver the iron without accidently touching the on-off buttons.</li>
            <li> Wife is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this curler, better than the wands thanks to the clip part. It heats quickly and comes with a heat proof case. Very easy to use and creates large luscious curls just what i wanted. Recommend for anyone who wants wonderful curls.</li>
            <li> I already owned 2 of these but wanted a 3rd for traveling.  I really wanted to have 3 identical ones, but the styling of this one is just slightly different.  Guess Conair decided to update their design. That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars.  I actually liked the previous model better.  But still a great product!</li>
            <li> It was a nice curling iron for the price.  I tend to change the settings some when I curl my hair, but no big deal.  It has nice heat adjustments, and the barrel is very nice.  Cord is a little short for me though.</li>
            <li> The Barrel is Big but dont take long to do all of your Hair !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my CONAIR curling iron for a couple of months now.  I bought it at Target for about the same price as Amazon because I needed it immediately and couldn&#x27;t wait a day or two for Amazon to ship one.  It replaced a Revlon one that stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I liked about the Revlon one was it had a stand built in.  I hate the wire kick-stand that most curling irons have, including this one, because it&#x27;s a pain to fold it up and down every time I handle it.  But I couldn&#x27;t find any 1 1/2 inch curling irons that didn&#x27;t have the kick-stand, so it&#x27;s a minor annoyance I&#x27;ll have to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron works well.  It heats up incredibly fast - in 30 seconds.  The ON/OFF buttons are slightly recessed so you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally turning it off while using it.  The barrel is very smooth and slippery.  I have very fine hair, and it&#x27;s barely shoulder length.  At first it would sometimes slip off the barrel while I was curling it because the clamp isn&#x27;t that strong or tight.  But that doesn&#x27;t happen very often - maybe I&#x27;ve learned to adjust my technique.  But if you have medium to thick hair you won&#x27;t have any problem, and if your hair is fine like mine, it might be a minor problem.  I&#x27;d rather it like that than have my hair stick to the barrel or clamp, like with some curling irons.  The only real problem I had with this curling iron is the heat setting is a wheel on the handle that spins.  Being on the handle, my thumb kept accidentally changing the setting whenever I picked it up or used it.  Since I like to keep the heat setting at 5, I placed a piece of tape on the wheel to keep it from turning and I no longer have a problem.  The curling iron comes with a sheath so you don&#x27;t have to worry about packing it in your suitcase if it&#x27;s still warm.</li>
            <li> Sturdy curling iron that is reliable and effective.  The cord is a bit irritating in that it curls more than the curling iron!  However, I was shopping for a good product at a very competative price and hopefully speedy delivery and I received both.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money.  Only problem is that I&#x27;m getting my hair cut short for summer and won&#x27;t be able to use it until winter.  Such is life.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and I thought the bigger the barrel the better.  Unfortunately, my curls were so loose, that before I&lt;br /&gt;could go out, they were gone.  Tried making them tighter, but with no luck.  Maybe, it&#x27;s my hair?  Anyway, I use it for shorter areas in front of my head.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly. I was impressed how quickly it heats up and how nicely it glides through the hair. I am very happy and would recommend this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Bought this curling iron about 1 month ago and use it approximately 5 days out of the week. I&#x27;ve used only Conair brand curling irons for the past 15 years or so. I&#x27;m always sad that the model I&#x27;m replacing is no longer available (I use them for years until they no longer work!), but look forward to new improvements with excitement...I was a bit disappointed with this one. The ceramic barrel is great for no-frizz results, and heats up very quickly. However, the handle itself is very smooth also, so be careful to grasp it securely so it doesnt get away from you. The on/off buttons are right where you may place your thumb, I&#x27;ve accidentally turned it off many times while curling up, and have to release the curl to check if it&#x27;s indeed still on and the red power light is so tiny and dim its barely noticeable on the mirror. The heat setting is very simple to use, however your fingers also keep touching the rotating disk and easily change the settings, again have to release a curl to see what the setting changed to. Also, this model has the shortest cord I&#x27;ve ever had, unless your power outlet is directly in-front of the mirror that you use, get an extension. Did not have any of these issues with the much much older models from the past 15 years. I would have returned it, but being a Conair fan I was sure this was a keeper and tossed out the packaging when I got home.</li>
            <li> Works awesome!!! Get super hot though so be careful!</li>
            <li> It is just what I needed.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great curler at a fabulous price. This definitely smooth&#x27;s away frizz and leaves my hair shiny with nice, bouncy, smooth curls. Great brand that lives up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> I like this because it heats up fast. This morning my hair did get caught in the plastic near the middle of the barrel. I did not like that. so be sure to use smaller swatches of hair if you don&#x27;t want it caught in the clip.</li>
            <li> Does as expected but u should have went with an inch to an in a half smaller. I wanted big curls but all this is, is to give you volume.</li>
            <li> Good value + timely delivery + quality product &#x3D; satisfied customer.</li>
