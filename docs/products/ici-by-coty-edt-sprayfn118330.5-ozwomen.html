I always get compliments when I wear it, some say it smells like Vanilla Fields or Exclamation.</li>

            <li> This was my go-to scent back in the 90s. I forgot exactly how it smelled but was feeling nostalgic so I ordered it. Guess what? I still like it. Not my favorite of all time, but a nice casual scent for day.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. This scent has been a staple for me for years, and still impresses. Great buy and seller was great. Will purchase again from this seller.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this perfume, I have used it for years. When it arrived I was so excited I opened it and went to instantly spray it and nothing. Since I live in Illinois and the temp is freezing right now I figured maybe it&#x27;s just cause it&#x27;s cold. So I put it on my dresser until the next day and went to try it again, still nothing. Wish I could use it.</li>

            <li> My favorite!  So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and is hard to find. The shipping was quick and was in time for valentine&#x27;s day. The price is good but more important is I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> We cannot find in Ici any store so we were VERY happy we can still order this favorite product online.</li>
            <li> It is a great scent but it is really small, I could&#x27;t tell from the pictures but if you look at the fluid ounces they are correct.</li>
            <li> This perfume was one of my favorites when I was younger. It has a nice smell, but if you are buying this size, please be aware that the bottle is REALLY small.</li>
            <li> One of my all-time favourite perfumes.  First bought it around 12 years ago and still love the smell.  It has really lovely notes of vanilla.  Really hard to find in any shop now.  Really recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the softest scent I&#x27;ve ever bought. I love how pretty and light it is. The price is right and it&#x27;s perfect for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne.  Every time I&#x27;m wearing it I get compliments galore.  However I never seem to get compliments when I wear the &amp;#34;expensive stuff&amp;#34;.  Wonder why.  Try it.....you&#x27;ll be amazed at people&#x27;s comments.</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume for more than a decade! It has such a sweet smell and I always get compliments when wearing. The price seems very reasonable, although I don&#x27;t know what it goes for elsewhere.</li>
