            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m trying different products to find what works best with my skin.</li>

            <li>I will be using it more during the winter, because my skin dries out then</li>
            <li>It is more like a runny honey.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for 1 week</li>
            <li>Now I have been trying it for more than 1 month.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it for some more time&lt;br /&gt;until</li>

            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it , until I saw the result few days later.</li>
            <li> , that is why it usually comes in a tube or pump bottle.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really reduces the appearance of brown spots</li>
            <li> I have used this for 3 days and can already see a difference on the dark spots on my hand. When I opened the jar the liquid was brown and runny. It is a very thin liquid not a cream, and I have been told that Hydroquinone turns brown when oxygen gets to it, and that makes it lose it&#x27;s effectiveness, that is why it usually comes in a tube or pump bottle. To tell the truth I am surprised by this product and how well it is working, but Because it is exposed to the air and light I wonder now that it is open how long will it work. I guess time will tell.</li>
            <li> same strength as the prescription strength and works as well. It is a gel and not a cream though.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely horrid. It literally turned my skin YELLOW.&lt;br /&gt;I would use the tiniest amount at night, literally a drop. I mixed it into my moisturizer and applied it to my face. Any of the smallest grooves in my skin caught extra and by morning time I would have yellow skin. Especially under my eyebrows and by my hairline. I tried applying the product more evenly and using less product overall, but it still turned me yellow. I threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, this product is so liquidy, I think it should be sold in a pump bottle. The first time I opened it I spilled half of it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  But packaging is not done right.  It has a liquid consistency and shd be in a bottle not in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine putting a thin Keri lotion in a jar!  not great to take on travels bec you end up with spills:(</li>
            <li> The cream was well put together and did not have any odor.</li>
            <li> it came in a totaly different bottle that been dispayed</li>
            <li> This is the best skin treatment I have used for clearing dark spots from acne &amp; pcos caused dark spots on chin. I have used this for 20 days so far my skin has improved by 50%. My complexion is brown (med-dark) and all acne is gone. Scarring is much lighter. Skin feels smooth and less oily. I will continue to use twice daily until all marks have faded. Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see any difference yet,but only been a couple weeks</li>
            <li> In progress.  Looks like a great cream for my skin</li>
            <li> I USED FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS, BUT DIDN&#x27;T NOTICE A DIFFERENT IN MY SCARS.</li>
            <li> This product was just what the doctor ordered. It faded some sun spots and made short work dark patches.</li>
            <li> I have been trying medication after medication for 11 years and nothing has worked. I had doubts about this product since it was so affordable I didn&#x27;t think it would work. Well I have melasma all over my cheeks and to my surprise one week using this product it has gone 3-4 shades lighter. I am so impressed never will I use anything else. Very very happy I haven&#x27;t seen a clear face in yearsðŸ˜„.</li>
            <li> This product was not even a cream but a thin runny gro that wad sticky. And left my skin feeling nasty and clogged</li>
            <li> This product seems to work better than other products with Hydroquinone. I have used this to lighten scars that have a dark tint to them. I recommend this product. It takes a while to get the best results. I use it every day and notice a gradual lightening of the areas.</li>
            <li> Wow great product, saw results in a week! Really glad I have it a try. You get allot for the money. Don&#x27;t really need to use much.</li>
            <li> Bought it and it did nothing! False statements didn&#x27;t work at all. It&#x27;s sticky and it smells nasty. Waste of ment very disappointed.</li>
            <li> still using it, it&#x27;s hard to tell if its working or not...i&#x27;ll give it another month</li>
            <li> Made sores within just a couple of days, threw it out</li>
            <li> Just purchased this product started using it today 20 DEC 2014...I will report back with results by late January 2015. I am sure thats how long it will take me to see results. i  am using it on my face, neck and upper shoulders.  So far the product is a bit different from other items. Its runny and looks like a watered down version of honey. It doesnt have much of a small and you dont have to use alot jsut a little will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I am trusting, but not seeing visible results.</li>
            <li> The best cream ever! I was skeptical about it , until I saw the result few days later. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other lightening creams I&#x27;ve used, I saw NO difference in my complexion while using this one. I used it over a period of two weeks. Normally, within the first 2-3 days I can see results (like when I used AHA lightening gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying different products to find what works best with my skin. This one did not make the cut.</li>
            <li> Great product! Worked better than I had hoped...spots have faded, skin looks terrific. Definitely worth the money. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product professionally packaged,arrived three days later.Used it for 2days and coworkers already think I&#x27;m seeing a cosmetic dermatologist.Just add some sun screen and avoid direct sunlight,then your are in for smooth glowing skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter experienced a terrible reaction to this product. Upon researching beyond Amazon&#x27;s reviews, we found that contact dermatitis is not uncommon with this stuff. Wish we had known before she used it.</li>
            <li> hydroquinone is wonderful!!! I began to see improvement in my skin three weeks of me using it. I will continue to user it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any reduction in the redness above the upper eyelid, where I was hoping for some color change.  I do not react to it negatively, as some people do.</li>
            <li> I rated it a 3 because I like it, but because of my skin being so oily, I can barely use it. I will be using it more during the winter, because my skin dries out then and hopefully it will make my skin an even tone. Other than that small issue, it was shipped and arrived on time, and in perfect condition. If you do not have very oily skin I would recommend it for you, but if you do, don&#x27;t use it. :)</li>
            <li> This is an effective and safe product. With daily use of over a couple of months, the affected areas on my face have considerably lightened.  I have experienced no adverse effects. I apply the product in the evening after cleansing. Needs a little time to dry/soak in. A little goes a long way. This is a great alternative to higher-priced lighteners on the market. Why pay more?!</li>
            <li> This works very well, better than the other cream I have tried. It is not cream, though. It is more like a runny honey.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for 1 week, I have begun to see the effects. Now I have been trying it for more than 1 month. The dark skin&lt;br /&gt;on my face due to a scar left when I fell and landing on my face is almost gone. I will continue using it for some more time&lt;br /&gt;until the dark skin completely change the color to my normal skin color.</li>
