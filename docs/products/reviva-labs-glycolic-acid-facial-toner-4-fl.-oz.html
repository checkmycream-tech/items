            <li> I&#x27;ve used glycolic acid toners before and they work really well at clearing your pores and exfoliating dead skin. You usually can tell because your skin feels clean and a little tingly. It also has a clean scent to it. This product did not do what I was expecting it to do. Sure it took care of the excess dirt I missed after washing my face, but my pores are still very clogged, there was no slight tingle, and like another reviewer said it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. It very well could be water. There isn&#x27;t even any label that says how much glycolic acid is in this product.</li>
            <li> I recently changed my beauty routine and since then, my face has never been clearer. It&#x27;s been several weeks since I&#x27;ve had a real zit. One tried to come up and it never made it. It just disappeared in less than a day. I&#x27;m over 30 and still dealing with breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that this is the miracle product, but I&#x27;m sure it is helping. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and doesn&#x27;t burn. I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I use Obagi Toner for 3 years but it is an expensive toner. So I want to try Reviva toner but it didn&#x27;t feel the same. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I looked long and hard for cruelty free products that worked for my skin.  I had several instances of buying a product only for it to severely irritate my skin, or make me break out.  The line of Reviva glycolic acid products are now my very favorite.  I use the toner, the cleanser, and the cream, on a daily basis and I break out much less than I used to.  I really love this line of products.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial toner. Since reading how glycolic acid is good for the skin I decided to try some and selected Reviva when making my purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It cleans well and softens my skin so nice. I been using this for about a year now and my skin looks so smooth and I&#x27;m 47.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy at a very reasonable price. My skin has a definite glow from daily use of this toner.</li>
            <li> I am writing a review because other people&#x27;s reviews helped me a lot! This product is great! I started using Reviva Glycolic Acid 5% cream. It was so dry and I was not sure it was working or not. I saw a review about this product. this product  was recommended to be used with 5% cream so I purchased it. I certainly saw the difference in this combination.  They do work beautifully together!  My skin looks very moisturized and shiny. I have gotten many compliments on my skin lately. I am moving to 10% cream now!</li>
            <li> Use as a toner at night and helps to clear blemishes. Does not burn or sting as some creams with similiar ingredients tend to.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Light fragrance. It&#x27;s to soon to tell but I&#x27;m already seeing results on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this toner so far, and would reorder. I&#x27;m using it in the winter, when my skin gets dry and more irritable than usual. Typically speaking I have combination skin, fighting both dryness and oily/acne. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and do have some sun damage. I&#x27;ve experienced absolutely no burning, irritation, or uncomfortable tightness. My skin feels nice and clean, but not stripped. The toner does have the typical scent that accompanies a glycolic acid product, but it&#x27;s pretty light.  I like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good for deep cleansing without drying face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help with evening my skin tone.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s exactly like water. It smells and looks like water and does nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it does anything or not</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years. Makes my makeup go on much smoother.</li>
            <li> Excellent glycolic product at a very reasonable price.  I have mature, dry and sensitive skin but I still had a problem with uneven skin tone and blackheads.  Using this glycolic toner has made my skin very smooth and even  without anymore blackheads.  This is a great product and so inexpensive compared to other brands.  I will definitely buy this again....</li>
            <li> Light feeling and doesnt sying lime other glycolic toner. Great to pair with glycolic acid 10% cream.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for years and keeps asking for more.  Guess she likes it.</li>
            <li> I am definitely seeing major improvement in my skin tone. This is working its magic and my skin is not irritated or sensitive to this product. Great addition to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> This product combined with the Glycoloic 10% cream nightly has totally changed my face. This has cleared up my acne tremendously! Love this!!!</li>
