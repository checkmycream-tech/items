            <li>It Starts out really good</li>
            <li>Great product top of the line.  </li>
            <li>I got this machine to try it out as one of my shaders, it does a great job, but I found out that it is better suited to be used as a liner.</li>
            <li>I love the weight of this machine, It makes a great liner, you can use it as a shader.</li>
            <li>Be grateful 4 what u have and own.</li>
            <li>Even if you think its just junk buy it for the frame &amp; build your own custom machine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll build a nice liner out of it.</li>
            <li>liked the box it came in ...love the gun</li>
            <li>You may have to make some of your own adjustments.</li>
            <li>It does good as a shader if the voltage is turned up on your power supply, but is better as a liner on lower voltage.</li>
            <li>But it really &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; and the weight is really perfect.</li>
            <li>Sweet tattoo machine the motors work so good really Good machine at a nice price</li>
            <li>Thanks, very friendly and excellent product.</li>
            <li>Good thing it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>mailed right on time pakaging was great</li>
            <li>the front coil is shimmed up already, the vice wing nut is very cheap (looks almost plastic like)  </li>
            <li>as liner and or shader, runs very smooth.</li>
            <li>runs super smooth great all around gun</li>
            <li>Good quality craftsmanship, light weight, easy to use,  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>As is it is probably better suited to keep your papers from blowing off your desk.</li>
            <li>For the most part, this machine does the trick.</li>
            <li>Dimensions and specs are okay.</li>
            <li>okay and</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>Not the top machine but works just as well as a top dollar machine .only</li>
            <li>the money on better machines....</li>
            <li>pretty dang good.</li>
            <li>cuz all in all its pretty good for outlines.</li>
            <li>The price of this machine is Super nice for someone on a budget.</li>
            <li>It was easy to set up and tune.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m thinking is not cast iron, it was really easy to scratch) ...</li>
            <li>Stylish and really sweet design</li>
            <li>And it works really smooth.</li>
            <li>It is cheap made and it looks like they painted and tumbled the frame.</li>
            <li>Its cheap in cost.</li>
            <li>cheap and worked for 20 minutes before dying.&lt;br /&gt;spend</li>
            <li>Was good for first two tattoos then started to act up and not work consistently.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just that it gets hot kind of quick.</li>
            <li>tho this machine is really intended for a shader it tunes up pretty good as a liner if u put the contact screq at about the one oclock position.</li>
            <li>simple machine for the price is good</li>
            <li>It works good though... ,the lose motor, the wrapping, and the constant pain of tuning it is bothersome though...</li>
            <li>not a bad product, but not what i wanted.</li>
            <li>Idk about all the other posts but this machine is great.</li>
            <li>Fantastic machine, nice and solid.  </li>
            <li>I use this machine as a liner because it is really compact and light weight.</li>
            <li>and when u do that the speed is just too fast and really adjusting the points or voltage doesn&#x27;t really help it sounds like totall garbage it clinks and clanks against the top of the coil and won&#x27;t run smooth.</li>
            <li>Bought it thinking maybe I could replace the cheap Chinese hardware with top line stuff.</li>
            <li>Works good for a liner would not recommend as a shader due to the fact that this machine cant handle the increased voltage from your supply.  </li>
            <li>The frame, being cast, is solid and straight and will provide a good platform to build something with higher quality parts.  </li>
            <li>There is no way these machines would function properly right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>coils are iffy, but with the right parts it will be a useable machine.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t work right &amp;</li>
            <li>I have been building tattoo machines for 45 years and these machines have a nice frame but are put together by people with out machine experience but after a few tweaks it is a fine machine and worth every penny</li>
            <li>; , I am very fast at tuning tattoo machines and this machine was a pain to tune.</li>
            <li>Shoulder washers were brittle and need to be replaced first thing.</li>
            <li>Anyone who would buy this shouldn&#x27;t be tattooing in the first place - get an apprenticeship and stop tattooing out of your garages</li>
            <li>not so sure it&#x27;s actual cast iron tho, i did scratch the front by mistake and under that foe finish</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty shiny</li>
            <li>i took the armature bar off and ground the slot in the back spring a lil more so</li>
            <li>I ended up taking the whole thing apart and readjusting everything.  </li>
            <li>It came fast in the mail on Amazon time.</li>
            <li>holy smokes that was fast</li>
            <li>So there isn&#x27;t to much to say about it.</li>
            <li>It is super light compared to my nicer more expensive guns.  </li>
            <li>seller: &amp;#34;the new times&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>Will not work on a steady basis.</li>
            <li>I think with some tweaking and a little love</li>
            <li>it will heat up on you, but for smaller tattoos or basic lettering this machine will work just fine.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other review about this being a cheap knock off</li>
            <li>It is a cheap knock off, and everything is smaller than standard tattoo machines.</li>
            <li>Complete s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very basic in design but very practical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping this will fix it and allow me to use it, but so far It won&#x27;t even push a 3rs into the skin...</li>
            <li>It took a while to get the machine first of all and second its not even the same machine in the pic</li>
            <li>Does not handle long tattoo periods very well</li>
            <li>I have it set up as a liner as the machine is small and light.</li>
            <li>I didnt even get the correct gun i got a total different one i am very upset i paid 9 bucks for this and ended up getting a 4.74 gun</li>
            <li>It bogs down to much</li>
            <li>Used it once for about an hour and half or so straight and can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li>Seller was quick, but I am going to try and take this gun apart and change out the spring, the spring was very very small.</li>

            <li> Seller was quick, but I am going to try and take this gun apart and change out the spring, the spring was very very small.</li>
            <li> I have to run it at ten volts just to get the armature bar moving a little bit</li>
            <li> In turn I spent about two hours rebuilding the machine including rewrapping the coils with &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; copper wire</li>
            <li> the pic shows the design painted mostly grey with black in the dimples, its just a nicer machine than the one i got in the mail.</li>
            <li> Tuning it took a little longer than expected, but it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem if you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> however turning it down to a liner a 1 mm and the machine runs</li>
            <li> There is a lot less detail</li>
            <li> but after a little while it heats up and starts to cut out.</li>
            <li> I had to chase a short to get it to run and discovered the broken washer that was allowing the front lead of the coils to touch the frame.  </li>
            <li> not a useable machine was disappointed to see it will not hold tubes looks damn cool</li>
            <li> This macine handles well and its not too heavy</li>
            <li> maybe the springs are to stiff for shadinng?</li>
            <li> thing that sucks that it as a plastic wing nut breaks ez</li>
            <li> a poorly made inexpensive machine.</li>
            <li> this thing deserves negative stars if anything I took it apart &amp; just kept the frame besides that it sucks really bad</li>
            <li> I want my money back👍 this thing sucks soo bad</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> It had bad reviews</li>
            <li> I did some tuning and it ran like garbage and sparked like crazy!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the machine alot. Good price and cast iron. I tuned mine up and works great. Be grateful 4 what u have and own.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get the machine first of all and second its not even the same machine in the pic it looks like it but the one in the pick has the desighn painted on as well as thhe dimples casted into it. the pic shows the design painted mostly grey with black in the dimples, its just a nicer machine than the one i got in the mail. okay performance,,,even tho this machine is really intended for a shader it tunes up pretty good as a liner if u put the contact screq at about the one oclock position. when i try to tune it for shadinng the 2mm space i need between contact points just don&#x27;t work out. it doesn&#x27;t even want to run at this distance without the voltage turned way up and when u do that the speed is just too fast and really adjusting the points or voltage doesn&#x27;t really help it sounds like totall garbage it clinks and clanks against the top of the coil and won&#x27;t run smooth. however turning it down to a liner a 1 mm and the machine runs pretty dang good. maybe the springs are to stiff for shadinng? when i get some spare springs I&#x27;m gonna try it out but i just ordered a good shader so thay can wait. if ur lookinng for a liner go ahead get it cuz all in all its pretty good for outlines.</li>
            <li> Works great, been using it a lot.</li>
            <li> Idk about all the other posts but this machine is great. I have two of them. My coils never burnt out or anything. I did have to tune it for a minute, but all in all who doesnt have to tune a machine to their comfort.? If you ask me, its a good deal. Even if you think its just junk buy it for the frame &amp; build your own custom machine.</li>
            <li> would make a great rebuild machine...</li>
            <li> simple machine for the price is good</li>
            <li> I agree with the other review about this being a cheap knock off but you are buying a 20 dollar tattoo machine not an Aaron Cain custom machine.  It is super light compared to my nicer more expensive guns.  It will take you a while to get it tuned properly I ended up taking the whole thing apart and readjusting everything.  Works good for a liner would not recommend as a shader due to the fact that this machine cant handle the increased voltage from your supply.  Does not handle long tattoo periods very well it will heat up on you, but for smaller tattoos or basic lettering this machine will work just fine.</li>
            <li> Will not work on a steady basis. Cuts in and out. Tried it on two diffetent power supplies. Not impressed</li>
            <li> The coils are 1\\&quot;, not 1.25\\&quot; as advertised.  Shoulder washers were brittle and need to be replaced first thing. I had to chase a short to get it to run and discovered the broken washer that was allowing the front lead of the coils to touch the frame.  It is what it is...a poorly made inexpensive machine. The frame, being cast, is solid and straight and will provide a good platform to build something with higher quality parts.  As is it is probably better suited to keep your papers from blowing off your desk. I think with some tweaking and a little love I&#x27;ll build a nice liner out of it.</li>
            <li> Complete s***. Bought it thinking maybe I could replace the cheap Chinese hardware with top line stuff. And it still runs like garbage. Good thing it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Sweet tattoo machine the motors work so good really Good machine at a nice price Stylish and really sweet design</li>
            <li> Any manufacturer that would call a tattoo machine a \\&quot;gun\\&quot; is definitely not a qualified machine crafter. There is no way these machines would function properly right out of the box. Anyone who would buy this shouldn&#x27;t be tattooing in the first place - get an apprenticeship and stop tattooing out of your garages</li>
            <li> runs super smooth great all around gun my only problem is with the plastic set screw i broke it off hand tightening but the best there is for the price i paid</li>
            <li> The gun works really good it&#x27;s just that it gets hot kind of quick. It came fast in the mail on Amazon time. And it works really smooth. It was a really great deal I wouldn&#x27;t pass it up</li>
            <li> Was good for first two tattoos then started to act up and not work consistently. It bogs down to much</li>
            <li> mailed right on time pakaging was great liked the box it came in ...love the gun</li>
            <li> Machine didnt work when I took it out of the package. I did some tuning and it ran like garbage and sparked like crazy! In turn I spent about two hours rebuilding the machine including rewrapping the coils with &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; copper wire and now it runs amazing! Awesome frame for the price though!</li>
            <li> You may have to make some of your own adjustments. For the most part, this machine does the trick. I was surprise at the quality of speed and power. It&#x27;s very basic in design but very practical.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for(the frame). It is cheap made and it looks like they painted and tumbled the frame. There is a lot less detail that what it shows on here.</li>
            <li> It was easy to set up and tune. I like the way it runs. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap knock off, and everything is smaller than standard tattoo machines. however it does work and will do the job. I have it set up as a liner as the machine is small and light. I bought it out of curiosity and cant complain considering the price.</li>
            <li> I have been building tattoo machines for 45 years and these machines have a nice frame but are put together by people with out machine experience but after a few tweaks it is a fine machine and worth every penny</li>
            <li> not the gun in the picture. not a bad product, but not what i wanted. i ended up just giving it away</li>
            <li> Frame is aluminum. Armature is steel. Dimensions and specs are okay. Price was right. Works okay and coils are iffy, but with the right parts it will be a useable machine.</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of c*** I want my money back👍 this thing sucks soo bad I have to run it at ten volts just to get the armature bar moving a little bit this thing deserves negative stars if anything I took it apart &amp; just kept the frame besides that it sucks really bad</li>
            <li> Amazing deal great swing and parts. had to tweak a lil but it isn&#x27;t mine if I don&#x27;t. All around awesome machine defiantly great buy</li>
            <li> Thanks, very friendly and excellent product.</li>
            <li> This machine is more than perfect for the price listed. I use this machine as a liner because it is really compact and light weight. Tuning it took a little longer than expected, but it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem if you know what you&#x27;re doing. All in all, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase and I would and have bought from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Item is grate for the money Product is as described and a great price. Great product top of the line.  I would reccomend this item to others.</li>
            <li> seller: &amp;#34;the new times&amp;#34;! holy smokes that was fast I definitely buy again...so the tattoo machine: they replaced a lot of parts with substandard ones...the coil cover generic looking, replaced washers with plastic, armature bar looks like it was made of aluminum&lt;br /&gt;...going to have to replace parts..to make it a awesome shader...</li>
            <li> Not the top machine but works just as well as a top dollar machine .only thing that sucks that it as a plastic wing nut breaks ez</li>
            <li> my daughter&#x27;s bf asked if i could order this for him. he does tattoos and he either looks thru ebay or here on amazon. he fell in love with this machine and it was at an awesome price. got within couple of days he checked it out and now is using it. will buy from the company again</li>
            <li> Its cheap in cost. So there isn&#x27;t to much to say about it. It Starts out really good but after a little while it heats up and starts to cut out.</li>
            <li> I got this machine to try it out as one of my shaders, it does a great job, but I found out that it is better suited to be used as a liner. It does good as a shader if the voltage is turned up on your power supply, but is better as a liner on lower voltage. The price of this machine is Super nice for someone on a budget.</li>
            <li> It had bad reviews but it did the job</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; for the 10 bucks i paid for it i guess...not so sure it&#x27;s actual cast iron tho, i did scratch the front by mistake and under that foe finish it&#x27;s pretty shiny (I&#x27;m thinking is not cast iron, it was really easy to scratch) ... i took the armature bar off and ground the slot in the back spring a lil more so the needle nipple would be in the correct spot over the needle tube... the front coil is shimmed up already, the vice wing nut is very cheap (looks almost plastic like)  haven&#x27;t run it yet so i will up date accordingly.</li>
            <li> I love the weight of this machine, It makes a great liner, you can use it as a shader. But it really &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; and the weight is really perfect. I recommend this machine and the seller.</li>
            <li> Seller was quick, but I am going to try and take this gun apart and change out the spring, the spring was very very small. I&#x27;m hoping this will fix it and allow me to use it, but so far It won&#x27;t even push a 3rs into the skin...</li>
            <li> I didnt even get the correct gun i got a total different one i am very upset i paid 9 bucks for this and ended up getting a 4.74 gun</li>
            <li> Tattoo gun does not work well or meet expectation. I would not recommend buying</li>
            <li> Fantastic machine, nice and solid.  Used it once for about an hour and half or so straight and can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> This tattoo machine works wonderful ,&amp;#34;After its been tuned&amp;#34; , I am very fast at tuning tattoo machines and this machine was a pain to tune. it took forever and the wrapping that is around the motors fell off the second time i used it. I tried to tighten the motors so the compression between the 2 motors would hold the wrapping around it together........but it didn&#x27;t work right &amp;#34;after I got it to turn on that is&amp;#34; ,when i tightened the motors. It works good though... ,the lose motor, the wrapping, and the constant pain of tuning it is bothersome though...</li>
            <li> Never buy again.....cheap and worked for 20 minutes before dying.&lt;br /&gt;spend the money on better machines....</li>
            <li> not a useable machine was disappointed to see it will not hold tubes looks damn cool but thats it would not but again</li>
            <li> This macine handles well and its not too heavy</li>
            <li> Good quality craftsmanship, light weight, easy to use,  as liner and or shader, runs very smooth. I would recommend this gun anyone starting off or someone who&#x27;s done this for years</li>
