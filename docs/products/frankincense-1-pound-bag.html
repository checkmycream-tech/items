            <li>great price!</li>
            <li>Great smell.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good prouct.</li>
            <li>Bag seem to be a mixture of Frankinsense and polymer to increase size of the bag...not good.  </li>
            <li>This product maybe good, but one has to buy charcoal with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>But without a doubt I am very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>quick service good quality and great product...</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and strong.</li>
            <li>distilling to get your own oil, to mix with shea butter and make nice and creamy, Thank you from Brother Paul</li>
            <li>It came quickly, intact in the packaging, and works beautifully in my incense burner.</li>
            <li>spend the additional $10 and order online somewhere else, or better in person.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it effective but smells great.</li>
            <li>It fills my entire temple space with amazing aromas!  </li>
            <li>enjoy very much!</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the scent of myrhh, very much.</li>
            <li>I am not an expert on frankincense, but I read that pure frankincense should be light golden in color?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered frnkinsense before and it&#x27;s supposed to be a golden amber color.</li>
            <li>I had to use the SKU label to be sure which was which because they came in the same box.  </li>
            <li>only kings used to be able to get this stuff</li>
            <li>I was suspicious and should have taken the reviews on here more seriously before purchasing, but it was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Nice item but with very little fragrance.</li>
            <li>I thought it would &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; with a distinct aroma - similar burning method as sage...</li>
            <li>Also, found a new smell in the mix.</li>
            <li>and we have a bit of a moth problem where I live.    </li>
            <li>The other one was pure frankincense exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>It looks like the large \\&quot;frankincense\\&quot; clusters are actually a lighter substance that is coated in actual frankincense dust.</li>
            <li>Im concerned because im not sure of what it actually is and its possible that there are health implications to filling a room with mystery smoke and breathing possibly toxic fumes, since the seller is not being honest about their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had heard on a BBC program the frankincense (the real stuff not the scented sticks or oils) is used to keep away moths and other flying pests ...</li>
            <li>If this is true, then I can&#x27;t give this a five-star rating, because there were several dark (almost black) pieces in the product which I purchased.</li>

            <li> I tried to burn it and the smell was nothing like any of the frankinsense I&#x27;ve ordered in the past.</li>
            <li> The charcoal will not stay lit, therefore the resin is no good to us.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a place to put the incense</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> Now i have a bag of fake incense to get rid of :(</li>
            <li> When this was lit it smelled nasty....</li>

            <li> I Like this product a lot. Two granules of this frankincense are sufficient to fill my living room with its divine aroma. The packing, however, is not commendable. The plastic bag was torn at places on arrival. Hope they will improve the packing.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was suspicious and should have taken the reviews on here more seriously before purchasing, but it was pretty cheap. Now i have a bag of fake incense to get rid of :( It looks like the large \\&quot;frankincense\\&quot; clusters are actually a lighter substance that is coated in actual frankincense dust. i burnt the resin with some actual known frankincense and it burned differently. Im concerned because im not sure of what it actually is and its possible that there are health implications to filling a room with mystery smoke and breathing possibly toxic fumes, since the seller is not being honest about their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just spend the additional $10 and order online somewhere else, or better in person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally reached the part of the bag where I&#x27;m finding strangely shaped residual glass beads, or plastic, after burning. Also, found a new smell in the mix. Seems the other negative reviews were right. The individual making this should be arrested as a domestic terrorist.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Great smell.  It is difficult to find a place to put the incense</li>
            <li> I had heard on a BBC program the frankincense (the real stuff not the scented sticks or oils) is used to keep away moths and other flying pests ... and we have a bit of a moth problem where I live.    Never having used this before I bought the one pound bag expecting to need a lot of it ... boy was I wrong.  Not only is it effective but smells great.</li>
            <li> I am not an expert on frankincense, but I read that pure frankincense should be light golden in color? If this is true, then I can&#x27;t give this a five-star rating, because there were several dark (almost black) pieces in the product which I purchased. The scent is very nice and strong. I also enjoy the scent of myrhh, very much.</li>
            <li> When this was lit it smelled nasty.... nothing like the package my friend gave me ....  Will never buy this item online again...</li>
            <li> Wonderful for the holidays, puts you in the Christmas Spirit. The burning frankincense represents the power of Christ Savior Jesus, Lord of Lords.</li>
            <li> This incense is wonderful.  It fills my entire temple space with amazing aromas!  Beautiful!</li>
            <li> It came quickly, intact in the packaging, and works beautifully in my incense burner. I would recommend this to all who dhoop.</li>
            <li> The product is as shown on site. It will last me 1 to 2 months, since I use 1 tsp twice a week to burn incense in my home.  Definitely a good prouct.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from two different vendors.  I had to use the SKU label to be sure which was which because they came in the same box.  The other one was pure frankincense exactly as pictured.  This one is a multi-colored product.  Not sure what to make of it.  The whole operation seems a little shady since there are at least three different names for this vendor.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but it worked.</li>
            <li> only kings used to be able to get this stuff and now anyone with a few bucks can get a pound... quick service good quality and great product...thanks</li>
            <li> Bag seem to be a mixture of Frankinsense and polymer to increase size of the bag...not good.  When incensed it smelled like rubber burning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered frnkinsense before and it&#x27;s supposed to be a golden amber color. What I got in the mail was a whitish, scent-less sap. I tried to burn it and the smell was nothing like any of the frankinsense I&#x27;ve ordered in the past. I would never order from this company again. It was a waste of $13.</li>
            <li> Nice item but with very little fragrance. Perhaps because there were no instructions enclosed, I did not know how to use it. I thought it would &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; with a distinct aroma - similar burning method as sage...but it did not.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and the bag was tiny. They said it was a pound though I don&#x27;t have a scale to weigh it. It didn&#x27;t last long at all. I found a bigger one for me to smoke. Thank ya!</li>
            <li> great resin! enjoy very much! great price!</li>
            <li> distilling to get your own oil, to mix with shea butter and make nice and creamy, Thank you from Brother Paul</li>
            <li> This product maybe good, but one has to buy charcoal with it.  The charcoal will not stay lit, therefore the resin is no good to us.  We cannot get it to burn at all.  Have considered BBQ charcoal.</li>
            <li> The chunks would have to be bigger to get a 5 star rating from me.  But without a doubt I am very pleased with the quality.</li>
