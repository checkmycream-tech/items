    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They are the best dryer sheets ever made.</li>
            <li>These are the BEST fabric softener sheets I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Great Job!</li>
            <li>They work great as dust cloths after use in the dryer.</li>
            <li>So happy ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I hoped, but great product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, but it looks like A&amp;H stopped production</li>
            <li>I washed Polartec with towels - the most static-producing thing</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many brands.</li>
            <li>Love the idea; works most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE these.  </li>
            <li>I so love the smell of these and no grocery store in our area carries them.  </li>
            <li>Picked up this for my Mother-in-law who has used many Arm &amp; Hammer products for decades.</li>
            <li>These are awesome, the scent lasts in the clothes for a long time.</li>
            <li>There are ok, good even,but nothing like the old Fab brand ones.</li>
            <li>You have a Loyal Customer for Life!</li>
            <li>I liked the lavender scent of the old style but that is no longer offered.  </li>
            <li>Will still search to find these at a more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Super product, the fresh and soft fragrance is so refreshing, just love it.</li>
            <li>Less static and better smelling.</li>
            <li>I will start by saying this first:</li>
            <li>They eliminate the static electricity and you can save the durable sheets and if you have staff electricity in your hair you can use it to smooth your hair down!</li>
            <li>This Product also creates such a warm Fragrance in the air that it captures the attention of People outside the House pulling in and out of the Driveway, where the Dryer&#x27;s Exhaust Hose just happens to be at, and believe Me when I tell You, They miss that Scent so much, as do I!</li>
            <li>I will gladly buy thus Product more if it came back onto Local Store Shelves, and this is probably the only Fault that I can l find with Arm &amp; Hammer</li>
            <li>That Scent is unlike anything else from a typical Dryer Sheet, and Clothes don&#x27;t wrinkle as much any more.</li>
            <li>so far she&#x27;s used these for only a few loads &amp; appears to be happy.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that they are damp cloths and are not stiff and dry!</li>
            <li>Not simply because of the respect accompanying the brand, but as Arm &amp; Hammer has branched out into many other fields &amp; they&#x27;ve kept their high standards.&lt;br /&gt;The scent she told us, is light, not heavy</li>
            <li>My Skin can rest easy now Thanks to this &#x27;Wet&#x27; Dryer Sheet!</li>
            <li>I miss the fresh smell that actually stays with the laundry.</li>
            <li>Nothing was clinging and everything was very soft.  </li>
            <li>Hey, Folks, You clearly have anOutstanding Product, now its time to let rest of the World know it too!</li>
            <li>I love a wet dryer sheet as to a dry.  </li>
            <li>(You may have heard of this weather phenomenon by now, called &#x27;The Polar Vortex&#x27;), and all of the things that it brought along with it, like incredibly Dry Air, which quickly leads to Dry Skin, Inflamed Nasal Passages (which will cause Bleeding when simply blowing One&#x27;s Nose), and, let&#x27;s not forget, the dreaded Static Electricity.</li>
            <li>This is where the Arm &amp; Hammer* &#x27;Fresh n&#x27; Soft&#x27; Wet Dryer Sheets come into play.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for HE dryer machines if you haven&#x27;t noticed yet the machines have a sensor in the front to tell when the clothes are dry so if you put in a regular dryer sheet it will keep cutting off as if the clothes are dry (reading dryer sheet instead of clothes) if you do want to chance it use your regular sheet but put wet clothes on top or wet it then dry</li>
            <li>* &#x27;Fresh n&#x27; Soft&#x27; Wet Dryer Sheets has such a Luxurious Feel to them that a Person would swear that they came from a Dry Cleaner Service</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have a bad scent, I just really loved the lavender.  </li>

            <li> I liked the lavender scent of the old style but that is no longer offered.  Lost a star for cutting the choices. This doesn&#x27;t have a bad scent, I just really loved the lavender.  I washed Polartec with towels - the most static-producing thing and this is A plus!  Nothing was clinging and everything was very soft.  Expensive compared to other similar products, but worth it to not get repeatedly zapped while folding the clothes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. They are the best dryer sheets ever made.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for HE dryer machines if you haven&#x27;t noticed yet the machines have a sensor in the front to tell when the clothes are dry so if you put in a regular dryer sheet it will keep cutting off as if the clothes are dry (reading dryer sheet instead of clothes) if you do want to chance it use your regular sheet but put wet clothes on top or wet it then dry</li>
            <li> These are the BEST fabric softener sheets I&#x27;ve ever used and I have tried many brands.These are moist and that makes a difference. They work great as dust cloths after use in the dryer.</li>
            <li> So happy ðŸ˜€ I found it! Super product, the fresh and soft fragrance is so refreshing, just love it. They eliminate the static electricity and you can save the durable sheets and if you have staff electricity in your hair you can use it to smooth your hair down! It works.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, but it looks like A&amp;H stopped production and now it&#x27;s out of stock.  What a bummer!!!</li>
            <li> They stopped making the less expensive version. The wife demands a wet style fabric softener that doesn&#x27;t smell like a Whore house. These do the trick. Just a bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Be prepared people.&amp;#34; CSM Clark</li>
            <li> Love the idea; works most of the time.  Not as strong as I hoped, but great product!</li>
            <li> accidental purchase! product works though</li>
            <li> Looking for a replacement for the Fab fabric refreshers that were dis continued years ago. There are ok, good even,but nothing like the old Fab brand ones.</li>
            <li> I have used these for several years.  I like them because you can use them over and over.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that they are damp cloths and are not stiff and dry!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these.  Bought them at Walmart a couple of months ago and when I went back to buy more...they no longer carry them!!  And...they were only $5 not the expense of what is shown here on amazon!  Crazy expensive here!  Will still search to find these at a more reasonable price.  I miss the fresh smell that actually stays with the laundry.</li>
            <li> I so love the smell of these and no grocery store in our area carries them.  Thank you, thank you and I will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t stop carrying this item.  I love a wet dryer sheet as to a dry.  Less static and better smelling.</li>
            <li> Picked up this for my Mother-in-law who has used many Arm &amp; Hammer products for decades. She is, with all respects, quite fastidious about her cleaning &amp; household products. (Understandable at her age!) so far she&#x27;s used these for only a few loads &amp; appears to be happy. Not simply because of the respect accompanying the brand, but as Arm &amp; Hammer has branched out into many other fields &amp; they&#x27;ve kept their high standards.&lt;br /&gt;The scent she told us, is light, not heavy &amp; they do the expected job in her laundry room!&lt;br /&gt;One note, they are a bit pricier, but as she explained, &amp;#34;If they do the job, she&#x27;ll keep buying from this company!&amp;#34; Cost kept them at 4 &amp; 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cloyd</li>
            <li> overpriced!!! cant find in stores</li>
            <li> I will start by saying this first: After 49 Years of living in Michigan, I have never witnessed a Winter of such Coldness (You may have heard of this weather phenomenon by now, called &#x27;The Polar Vortex&#x27;), and all of the things that it brought along with it, like incredibly Dry Air, which quickly leads to Dry Skin, Inflamed Nasal Passages (which will cause Bleeding when simply blowing One&#x27;s Nose), and, let&#x27;s not forget, the dreaded Static Electricity. This is where the Arm &amp; Hammer* &#x27;Fresh n&#x27; Soft&#x27; Wet Dryer Sheets come into play. I have been waiting patiently for a product like this to come along to do what a regular Dryer Sheet cannot do, such as completely removing that awful Static Cling when removing Clothes from the Dryer. With regular Dryer Sheets You would have to suffer the very painful shocks that it left behind, like watching-in bright, direct light-Blue and Orange Electrical &#x27;Jolts&#x27; jump off of the Clothing onto Your Skin (made even worst for Me because I have Scally-Like Skin created from years of washing Other People&#x27;s Dishes, one part from Me being a former Dishwasher, the other from My Sister&#x27;s Family whom I stay with...for now). My Skin can rest easy now Thanks to this &#x27;Wet&#x27; Dryer Sheet! This Product also creates such a warm Fragrance in the air that it captures the attention of People outside the House pulling in and out of the Driveway, where the Dryer&#x27;s Exhaust Hose just happens to be at, and believe Me when I tell You, They miss that Scent so much, as do I! The Clothing that comes out of the Dryer with these A &amp; H* &#x27;Fresh n&#x27; Soft&#x27; Wet Dryer Sheets has such a Luxurious Feel to them that a Person would swear that they came from a Dry Cleaner Service....SERIOUSLY! That Scent is unlike anything else from a typical Dryer Sheet, and Clothes don&#x27;t wrinkle as much any more. I will gladly buy thus Product more if it came back onto Local Store Shelves, and this is probably the only Fault that I can l find with Arm &amp; Hammer*. Hey, Folks, You clearly have anOutstanding Product, now its time to let rest of the World know it too! Great Job! You have a Loyal Customer for Life!</li>
            <li> These are awesome, the scent lasts in the clothes for a long time.</li>
