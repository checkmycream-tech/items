            <li>Otherwise, the pump and bottle is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I found this foundation to go on easily and has great coverage.</li>
            <li>This may be a very good product for someone with oily skin because the natural oils in the skin would resolve the challenges I experienced with blending and dryness.  </li>
            <li>but this one is amazing</li>
            <li>However, this CoverGirl product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is also great for light coverage since it is oily.  </li>

            <li>but the opinions are all my own.</li>

            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love it for that reason as well as its illuminating property and the pump of course.  </li>
            <li>I did test this foundation for free, however this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>it made my face more oily and just didn&#x27;t have the coverage that I like.</li>
            <li>Works better than some experience brand</li>
            <li>I tested this product for free but all thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li>The pump is very convenient for use and packaging is attractive.</li>

            <li>I tested this COVERGIRL products for free, but my opinion is my own.</li>
            <li>For more coverage, it can be applied with a foundation brush or buffing brush.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging/pump style bottle.</li>
            <li>I look forward to picking up more after I go through this bottle.</li>
            <li>Disclaimer: I received CoverGirl&#x27;s Outlast Stay Luminous foundation free to test and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I received this foundation in my #IDoVoxBox from Influenster to test it out for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>It felt as if it was just sitting on top of my skin rather then blending and working with my skin.</li>
            <li>Easy application and nice smooth coverage.</li>
            <li>It was very smooth and it did not have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>The coverage was full, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>However, my opinions are all honest and true.</li>
            <li>so if you have dry skin it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I love how light it feels after application, and the coverage is pretty good.</li>
            <li>, I was excited to try this out when I was offered to test this product for free, (but all opinions are my own).</li>
            <li>Covergirl Outlast Luminous foundation offers great coverage and color without the &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product as part of a free trial but I will continue to use this for many bottles to come.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty nice and there are many to choose from so</li>
            <li>I received a free bottle of this foundation to sample and review for free from Influenster!</li>
            <li>This is my own opinion regardless of receiving it complimentary.</li>
            <li>Fabulous 3-in-1 foundation, so I was very excited when I saw the Stay Luminous version.</li>
            <li>very much appreciate the lock and unlock top as well!</li>
            <li>Full but lightweight coverage that lasts!</li>
            <li>Once you apply powder over top, it does looks more matte at first, but gets more &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and apply.  </li>
            <li>It applies easy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It applies easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sometimes sensitive skin, the container is very easy to pump out the desired amount at any given time, and it goes on very easily.</li>
            <li>I am usually a huge fan of Covergirl products, but this one was just not for me.</li>
            <li>I got to try the Cover Girl Outlast Stay Luminous foundation, for free, in the &amp;#34;I Do&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It applied smooth, and it blended well, with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>This is my opinion, and I received the product for free.</li>
            <li>I keep my makeup in my purse and the safety of that lock ensures that everything in my purse stays makeup free.</li>
            <li>It is also scent free so there is no annoying smell.</li>
            <li>While the color was spot on, and the coverage felt light, I didn&#x27;t like the way it looked after I applied it.</li>
            <li>I tested this CoverGirl product for free through Influenster</li>
            <li>And the color was to light for me.  </li>
            <li>It gives me light - medium coverage which suits me.  </li>
            <li>I received this product free from Influenster for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>I received this foundation free from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I would say it was a light weight and light coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>but since I got this foundation for free to sample</li>
            <li>I recieved this product to try for free from influenster.</li>
            <li>For some reason I thought the light shimmer in it would come off as greasy on my oily skin after awhile, or that the coverage would go away quicky, but it didnt.</li>
            <li>I am probably going to go buy some in a darker color because my sample was a bit light for my skin during summer months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Stay Luminous foundation for free to test.</li>
            <li>I tested this COVERGIRL product for free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product free through the</li>
            <li>I have enlarged pores and I was using FIT Matte before</li>
            <li>received this free as a sample for testing purposes from Influsenster.</li>
            <li>It is far better than the kind I was using before.</li>
            <li>The foundation will emphasize dry patches on skin, fine lines, and any enlarged pores if no primer is used, and if you want that &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; effect advertised I had great results by mixing the foundation with my Chanel luminizer.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer a matte finish, which this does not have, but for a summer glow it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Something really worth to try!</li>
            <li>, I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>have never used this kind before, but I have to say that I will more than likely be buying</li>
            <li>I was lucky and got to try the product for free</li>
            <li>I really liked this product, it gave an air brushed look for sure.</li>
            <li>but if you want to stay luminous this is your foundation right here!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation doesn&#x27;t fade throughout the day, true to its claims.</li>
            <li>I got this Outlast Stay Luminous foundation for free in my complimentary</li>
            <li>I was happy with the formula as well, it applied smoothly and evenly, the slight shimmer in the foundation just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited that I received this complimentary for review purposes via Influenster.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, finishes in a natural look, and it is light weight!</li>
            <li>First of all, I did receive this product free for testing in the #idovoxbox from influenster.</li>
            <li>but when you put it on it creates beautiful coverage without feeling heavy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Love it so far!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li>Also, i&#x27;m happy that it does not feel too heavy for summer wearing.</li>
            <li>I do not wear a ton of make up simply because I do not enjoy the look of an over done face, however after receiving this product free from influenster for testing purposes, I have found that this product is really great!</li>
            <li>received this product complimentary, for testing purposes, from Influenster.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.</li>
            <li>I really liked the shading and the overall coverage.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t come across on the face, and actually the foundation does provide a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the value and the fresh look</li>
            <li>It went on easily and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has a very very lightweight formula and pretty good coverage and at the same time it will give you a natural look.</li>
            <li>I should clarify that I do use foundations atypically by mixing it with moisturizer for a very light coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color matched my skin tone very well!</li>
            <li>If Covergirl has a BB or CC Creme, I would try that first for my wedding day, before buying this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When the light hit my cheek bone it looked so gleamy and natural.</li>
            <li>so I tried it on during one of my busiest, mid-week, ultra-humid, hot summer days.</li>
            <li>reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li>This foundation left my skin looking more uniform and smoother.</li>
            <li>It makes my face look smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I think is a really good everyday Foundation.</li>
            <li>I like the way it shines on my skin leaving me the right tone of my skin super Natural</li>
            <li>There are fewer shades available in this line, but I liked the finish and long wear time enough that I plan on repurchasing the foundation in a shade that will match</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Influenster and Covergirl for such opportunity! :)</li>
            <li>Good product, although I received a shade slightly off of my normal skin tone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a big foundation girl and this product didn&#x27;t sell me on becoming one.</li>
            <li>It proved me wrong,  it lasted all day and gives very good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the regular Covergirl Outlast Stay</li>
            <li>I recently signed up for VoxBox and got this product for free.</li>
            <li>This foundation is REALLY moist.</li>
            <li>so I probably won&#x27;t be using it very often.</li>
            <li>I was offered a chance to try the covergirl outlast stay luminous foundation thanks to my friends at Influenster</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this foundation</li>
            <li>I really like how it feels because you forget you have anything on 😀</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this product to any one!</li>
            <li>there will definitely be a correct fit.</li>
            <li>Really though, what else do you want in a foundation?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very lightweight and silky, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>After receiving Covergirl&#x27;s Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation for testing I decide to really test its mettle--</li>
            <li>Even though I have a very oily skin type it lasted for about 6 hrs.</li>
            <li>I  really like a dewy look because it just looks like you&#x27;re glowing</li>
            <li>the foundation made it very visible.</li>
            <li>I really wished this foundation worked for me</li>
            <li>It took me so much pulling of my skin to get this foundation blended and the result?</li>
            <li>When first applied it looks a little dewy, but once it sets it&#x27;s more of a satin finish, which I sometimes prefer.  </li>
            <li>This on the other hand, is incredibly light!</li>
            <li>I received the Covergirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation from Influenster, and it is actually the first product I received from them that I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
            <li>However I just received this as a sample in my #voxbox and have to say it is a lot lighter than foundations I have used in the past and really gives my skin a nice even glow.</li>
            <li>I tried the product because I got a sample for free from Influenster, and it actually worked way better than the more expensive foundation I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many foundations (drugstore and high end) and I must say that drugstore foundations are really stepping up their game!</li>
            <li>so I am also comparing this product to what my personal expectations are in a foundation and that may be very different than someone who is more accustomed to drug store make up brands.  </li>
            <li>day to day I tend to use drugstore finds layered with high end concealer, and for dressier or more hectic days I rely on my more expensive foundations.</li>
            <li>I am accustomed to using high end department store foundations</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>really wished this foundation would&#x27;ve worked for me, cause I was in the market for a new and great drugstore foundation, but sadly it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>and I had success with this particular product and will be purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li>I does sink into your pores, so a primer is a must (something I don&#x27;t need to do with my normal foundation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think the texture is actually really nice, not runny or too thick.</li>
            <li>This foundation is light weight and matches my skin really well, it hasn&#x27;t caused my face to break out, and it hides all my little imperfections.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this one at a more cost effective price point but found it thick and difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breakouts, and gives me a nice even skin tone and subtle glow.</li>
            <li>and I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>In Covergirl Outlast 3-in-1 I use Classic Ivory (810) or Creamy Natural (820), and in the Outlast Luminous I received Buff Beige 825.</li>
            <li>Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation’s oil-free, non-greasy formula gives your skin a natural luminosity that lasts all day!</li>
            <li>I also liked that a little went a long way.  </li>
            <li>Having used mineral foundation happily for years, I was afraid of this breaking out my skin.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised-- not only did it hold up even after one very stressful presentation, three meetings and rush-hour insanity, BUT it managed to still give me that &amp;#34;glowing from the inside out&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I had no trouble putting it on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks completely natural, with no shine or glitter.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised that it held up throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I had difficulty blending and getting a natural looking finish.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ve been kissed by the sun, I received Soft Sable via my #idoVoxBox from @influenster</li>
            <li>I love that this feels thick</li>
            <li>It is often difficult to find a luminous foundation for oily skin types but this could be a good option.  </li>
            <li>If you contour or want the highlight look of a contour this is a wonderful base for it.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than other packaging on other foundations I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I also highly suggest using a primer and applying to well moisturized skin if you have normal to dry skin, as I</li>
            <li>This foundation gave good coverage but is a little too thick for my taste.  </li>
            <li>And it actually does give it that natural glow look!</li>
            <li>I still prefer a few of Covergirls other formulations if foundation, but wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use this product more.</li>
            <li>I barely know it&#x27;s on my face, which is a delight.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try as I typically use MAC products but the coverage (and much lower price!)</li>
            <li>I am prone to extremly oily skin and break out often, due to this I usually use powder foundation as most liquid foundations cause a break out.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and this foundation was too dry of a formula for me.  </li>
            <li>I have a little bit of peach fuzz on my cheeks, (you normally can not tell or see the fuzz when bare skinned)</li>
            <li>I typically aim for a very natural face and want something that&#x27;s not too heavy, especially in the hot summer months.  </li>

            <li> and I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> The packaging with pump was amazing, the colour matched me perfectly....</li>
            <li> Omg I love this foundation,, I have to mix two colors to get my perfect shade,but I love it!!</li>
            <li> I just received a sample of this in a VoxBox and really liked it!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free and this product leaves my skin flawless radiant</li>
            <li> The light texture and buildable coverage are perfect for the summer weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it; and loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it had a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; highlighting effect too.</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 because it covered my blemishes and gave good coverage</li>
            <li> Great product for those in need of cover up or those who just enjoy wearing it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the pump and bottle is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found this foundation to go on easily and has great coverage.</li>
            <li> This may be a very good product for someone with oily skin because the natural oils in the skin would resolve the challenges I experienced with blending and dryness.  </li>
            <li> but this one is amazing</li>
            <li> However, this CoverGirl product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is also great for light coverage since it is oily.  </li>
            <li> I Do VoxBox, but all reviews and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> received this as a part of an influenster box for review purposes, but the opinions are my honest views.</li>
            <li> but the opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li> It has been so good to my skin, many of the foundations I&#x27;ve tried tend to make me break out</li>
            <li> I received this product for review purposes and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I really liked the coverage on this foundation.</li>

            <li> It goes on very easily as well.</li>
            <li> However I did test the product and it went on very easily.  </li>
            <li> I think Covergirl has a good selection of colors available that would suit most skin tones.  </li>
            <li> This review is entirely my own, honest and true.</li>

            <li> and I love that result</li>
            <li> I tested my COVERGIRL product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>

            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love it for that reason as well as its illuminating property and the pump of course.  </li>
            <li> I did test this foundation for free, however this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> it made my face more oily and just didn&#x27;t have the coverage that I like.</li>
            <li> Works better than some experience brand</li>
            <li> I tested this product for free but all thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> The pump is very convenient for use and packaging is attractive.</li>

            <li> I tested this COVERGIRL products for free, but my opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> For more coverage, it can be applied with a foundation brush or buffing brush.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging/pump style bottle.</li>
            <li> I look forward to picking up more after I go through this bottle.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received CoverGirl&#x27;s Outlast Stay Luminous foundation free to test and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received this foundation in my #IDoVoxBox from Influenster to test it out for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It felt as if it was just sitting on top of my skin rather then blending and working with my skin.</li>
            <li> Easy application and nice smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> It was very smooth and it did not have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> The coverage was full, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> However, my opinions are all honest and true.</li>
            <li> so if you have dry skin it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I love how light it feels after application, and the coverage is pretty good.</li>
            <li> , I was excited to try this out when I was offered to test this product for free, (but all opinions are my own).</li>
            <li> Covergirl Outlast Luminous foundation offers great coverage and color without the &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product as part of a free trial but I will continue to use this for many bottles to come.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty nice and there are many to choose from so</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of this foundation to sample and review for free from Influenster!</li>
            <li> This is my own opinion regardless of receiving it complimentary.</li>
            <li> Fabulous 3-in-1 foundation, so I was very excited when I saw the Stay Luminous version.</li>
            <li> very much appreciate the lock and unlock top as well!</li>
            <li> Full but lightweight coverage that lasts!</li>
            <li> Once you apply powder over top, it does looks more matte at first, but gets more &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and apply.  </li>
            <li> It applies easy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It applies easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sometimes sensitive skin, the container is very easy to pump out the desired amount at any given time, and it goes on very easily.</li>
            <li> I am usually a huge fan of Covergirl products, but this one was just not for me.</li>
            <li> I got to try the Cover Girl Outlast Stay Luminous foundation, for free, in the &amp;#34;I Do&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It applied smooth, and it blended well, with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is my opinion, and I received the product for free.</li>
            <li> I keep my makeup in my purse and the safety of that lock ensures that everything in my purse stays makeup free.</li>
            <li> It is also scent free so there is no annoying smell.</li>
            <li> While the color was spot on, and the coverage felt light, I didn&#x27;t like the way it looked after I applied it.</li>
            <li> I tested this CoverGirl product for free through Influenster</li>
            <li> And the color was to light for me.  </li>
            <li> It gives me light - medium coverage which suits me.  </li>
            <li> I received this product free from Influenster for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> I received this foundation free from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I would say it was a light weight and light coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> but since I got this foundation for free to sample</li>
            <li> I recieved this product to try for free from influenster.</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought the light shimmer in it would come off as greasy on my oily skin after awhile, or that the coverage would go away quicky, but it didnt.</li>
            <li> I am probably going to go buy some in a darker color because my sample was a bit light for my skin during summer months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Stay Luminous foundation for free to test.</li>
            <li> I tested this COVERGIRL product for free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product free through the</li>
            <li> I have enlarged pores and I was using FIT Matte before</li>
            <li> received this free as a sample for testing purposes from Influsenster.</li>
            <li> It is far better than the kind I was using before.</li>
            <li> The foundation will emphasize dry patches on skin, fine lines, and any enlarged pores if no primer is used, and if you want that &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; effect advertised I had great results by mixing the foundation with my Chanel luminizer.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a matte finish, which this does not have, but for a summer glow it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Something really worth to try!</li>
            <li> , I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> have never used this kind before, but I have to say that I will more than likely be buying</li>
            <li> I was lucky and got to try the product for free</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, it gave an air brushed look for sure.</li>
            <li> but if you want to stay luminous this is your foundation right here!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation doesn&#x27;t fade throughout the day, true to its claims.</li>
            <li> I got this Outlast Stay Luminous foundation for free in my complimentary</li>
            <li> I was happy with the formula as well, it applied smoothly and evenly, the slight shimmer in the foundation just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m excited that I received this complimentary for review purposes via Influenster.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, finishes in a natural look, and it is light weight!</li>
            <li> First of all, I did receive this product free for testing in the #idovoxbox from influenster.</li>
            <li> but when you put it on it creates beautiful coverage without feeling heavy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Love it so far!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> Also, i&#x27;m happy that it does not feel too heavy for summer wearing.</li>
            <li> I do not wear a ton of make up simply because I do not enjoy the look of an over done face, however after receiving this product free from influenster for testing purposes, I have found that this product is really great!</li>
            <li> received this product complimentary, for testing purposes, from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I really liked the shading and the overall coverage.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t come across on the face, and actually the foundation does provide a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the value and the fresh look</li>
            <li> It went on easily and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has a very very lightweight formula and pretty good coverage and at the same time it will give you a natural look.</li>
            <li> I should clarify that I do use foundations atypically by mixing it with moisturizer for a very light coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color matched my skin tone very well!</li>
            <li> If Covergirl has a BB or CC Creme, I would try that first for my wedding day, before buying this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the light hit my cheek bone it looked so gleamy and natural.</li>
            <li> so I tried it on during one of my busiest, mid-week, ultra-humid, hot summer days.</li>
            <li> reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li> This foundation left my skin looking more uniform and smoother.</li>
            <li> It makes my face look smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I think is a really good everyday Foundation.</li>
            <li> I like the way it shines on my skin leaving me the right tone of my skin super Natural</li>
            <li> There are fewer shades available in this line, but I liked the finish and long wear time enough that I plan on repurchasing the foundation in a shade that will match</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Influenster and Covergirl for such opportunity! :)</li>
            <li> Good product, although I received a shade slightly off of my normal skin tone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big foundation girl and this product didn&#x27;t sell me on becoming one.</li>
            <li> It proved me wrong,  it lasted all day and gives very good coverage.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the regular Covergirl Outlast Stay</li>
            <li> I recently signed up for VoxBox and got this product for free.</li>
            <li> This foundation is REALLY moist.</li>
            <li> so I probably won&#x27;t be using it very often.</li>
            <li> I was offered a chance to try the covergirl outlast stay luminous foundation thanks to my friends at Influenster</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this foundation</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels because you forget you have anything on 😀</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest this product to any one!</li>
            <li> there will definitely be a correct fit.</li>
            <li> Really though, what else do you want in a foundation?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very lightweight and silky, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> After receiving Covergirl&#x27;s Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation for testing I decide to really test its mettle--</li>
            <li> Even though I have a very oily skin type it lasted for about 6 hrs.</li>
            <li> I  really like a dewy look because it just looks like you&#x27;re glowing</li>
            <li> the foundation made it very visible.</li>
            <li> I really wished this foundation worked for me</li>
            <li> It took me so much pulling of my skin to get this foundation blended and the result?</li>
            <li> When first applied it looks a little dewy, but once it sets it&#x27;s more of a satin finish, which I sometimes prefer.  </li>
            <li> This on the other hand, is incredibly light!</li>
            <li> I received the Covergirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation from Influenster, and it is actually the first product I received from them that I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
            <li> However I just received this as a sample in my #voxbox and have to say it is a lot lighter than foundations I have used in the past and really gives my skin a nice even glow.</li>
            <li> I tried the product because I got a sample for free from Influenster, and it actually worked way better than the more expensive foundation I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many foundations (drugstore and high end) and I must say that drugstore foundations are really stepping up their game!</li>
            <li> so I am also comparing this product to what my personal expectations are in a foundation and that may be very different than someone who is more accustomed to drug store make up brands.  </li>
            <li> day to day I tend to use drugstore finds layered with high end concealer, and for dressier or more hectic days I rely on my more expensive foundations.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to using high end department store foundations</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> really wished this foundation would&#x27;ve worked for me, cause I was in the market for a new and great drugstore foundation, but sadly it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> and I had success with this particular product and will be purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> I does sink into your pores, so a primer is a must (something I don&#x27;t need to do with my normal foundation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think the texture is actually really nice, not runny or too thick.</li>
            <li> This foundation is light weight and matches my skin really well, it hasn&#x27;t caused my face to break out, and it hides all my little imperfections.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this one at a more cost effective price point but found it thick and difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breakouts, and gives me a nice even skin tone and subtle glow.</li>
            <li> and I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> In Covergirl Outlast 3-in-1 I use Classic Ivory (810) or Creamy Natural (820), and in the Outlast Luminous I received Buff Beige 825.</li>
            <li> Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation’s oil-free, non-greasy formula gives your skin a natural luminosity that lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I also liked that a little went a long way.  </li>
            <li> Having used mineral foundation happily for years, I was afraid of this breaking out my skin.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised-- not only did it hold up even after one very stressful presentation, three meetings and rush-hour insanity, BUT it managed to still give me that &amp;#34;glowing from the inside out&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I had no trouble putting it on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks completely natural, with no shine or glitter.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised that it held up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I had difficulty blending and getting a natural looking finish.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve been kissed by the sun, I received Soft Sable via my #idoVoxBox from @influenster</li>
            <li> I love that this feels thick</li>
            <li> It is often difficult to find a luminous foundation for oily skin types but this could be a good option.  </li>
            <li> If you contour or want the highlight look of a contour this is a wonderful base for it.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than other packaging on other foundations I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I also highly suggest using a primer and applying to well moisturized skin if you have normal to dry skin, as I</li>
            <li> This foundation gave good coverage but is a little too thick for my taste.  </li>
            <li> And it actually does give it that natural glow look!</li>
            <li> I still prefer a few of Covergirls other formulations if foundation, but wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use this product more.</li>
            <li> I barely know it&#x27;s on my face, which is a delight.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try as I typically use MAC products but the coverage (and much lower price!)</li>
            <li> I am prone to extremly oily skin and break out often, due to this I usually use powder foundation as most liquid foundations cause a break out.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin and this foundation was too dry of a formula for me.  </li>
            <li> I have a little bit of peach fuzz on my cheeks, (you normally can not tell or see the fuzz when bare skinned)</li>
            <li> I typically aim for a very natural face and want something that&#x27;s not too heavy, especially in the hot summer months.  </li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need much when using.</li>
            <li> vox box, so naturally I wore it to my friends wedding less than a week later.</li>
            <li> It did also last a long time without reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually use other foundations and this is my first time trying the outlast stay luminous foundation; I like the product, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it again.</li>
            <li> I have dry/normal skin with some dry patches and this is probably one of the only foundations that doesn&#x27;t cling onto my dry patches!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and does have a natural look.</li>
            <li> it gives your face all day long.</li>
            <li> But it made any dry skin on my face stand out like a sore thumb.</li>
            <li> but....it was soooo dry.</li>
            <li> Dry to the extent that it would not blend into my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as with most drug store products, it is hard to find anything with a yellow undertone.</li>
            <li> I do not normally wear liquid makeup</li>
            <li> Not normally a cover girl fan</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a foundation that doesn&#x27;t blend properly or look &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; especially for drugstore brand products.</li>
            <li> Everything has a pink undertone which I can&#x27;t pull off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another issue I had was that it was not very pigmented; you are not going to get coverage at all out of this.</li>
            <li> I applied it using a wet blending sponge.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that the shade is darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> The Buff Beige is slightly dark for my skin, but I can mix it with a lighter foundation and make it work.</li>
            <li> I typically use foundations thast cost between $25- $40</li>
            <li> /&gt;Covergirl&#x27;s Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation provides natural-looking medium coverage and dries to a slightly dewy finish, but it does NOT add any luminosity or radiance to skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this product for free and this product leaves my skin flawless radiant I like the way it shines on my skin leaving me the right tone of my skin super Natural and I love that result I wish I knew this before</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very thick.  I typically use foundations thast cost between $25- $40 so I was excited to try this one at a more cost effective price point but found it thick and difficult to apply.  I typically aim for a very natural face and want something that&#x27;s not too heavy, especially in the hot summer months.  This foundation gave good coverage but is a little too thick for my taste.  I tested my COVERGIRL product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I got to try the Cover Girl Outlast Stay Luminous foundation, for free, in the &amp;#34;I Do&amp;#34; Vox Box. I usually wear mineral powder foundation, due to having skin sensitivity , so I was a little nervous about it.  I wore the foundation, for one day. It applied smooth, and it blended well, with my skin tone. It lasted all day, and my skin was not irritated.  This is my opinion, and I received the product for free.</li>
            <li> I do not wear a ton of make up simply because I do not enjoy the look of an over done face, however after receiving this product free from influenster for testing purposes, I have found that this product is really great! Goes on smooth, finishes in a natural look, and it is light weight! Great product for those in need of cover up or those who just enjoy wearing it!</li>
            <li> Covergirl Outlast Luminous foundation offers great coverage and color without the &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; feel. The light texture and buildable coverage are perfect for the summer weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need to reapply it at all either! I layered it with some spf, powder and primer and it didn&#x27;t weigh anything on top of that. It goes on very easily as well. I had no trouble putting it on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much appreciate the lock and unlock top as well! I keep my makeup in my purse and the safety of that lock ensures that everything in my purse stays makeup free. It is also scent free so there is no annoying smell. The color matched my skin tone very well!</li>
            <li> I received the Covergirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation from Influenster, and it is actually the first product I received from them that I&#x27;m not crazy about. I received it in the &amp;#34;I Do&amp;#34; vox box, so naturally I wore it to my friends wedding less than a week later. While the color was spot on, and the coverage felt light, I didn&#x27;t like the way it looked after I applied it. I&#x27;ve never been a big foundation girl and this product didn&#x27;t sell me on becoming one. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase this product again. I&#x27;ll stick to my concealer and banana powder.</li>
            <li> I absolutely *love* this product! I was hesitant to try as I typically use MAC products but the coverage (and much lower price!) make this a no-brainer. I did receive this product as part of a free trial but I will continue to use this for many bottles to come. Thank you Covergirl!!</li>
            <li> I recently signed up for VoxBox and got this product for free. I have tried many, many foundations (drugstore and high end) and I must say that drugstore foundations are really stepping up their game! I love that this feels thick but when you put it on it creates beautiful coverage without feeling heavy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this product is the shading. Unfortunately, as with most drug store products, it is hard to find anything with a yellow undertone. Everything has a pink undertone which I can&#x27;t pull off.&lt;br /&gt;It is &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; because it has tiny, tiny gold flecks in it.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency almostttt reminds me of MAC Studio Fix Fluid but not as high-coverage.</li>
            <li> This foundation is REALLY moist. I understand that it is the intention of CoverGirl to make it that way but I found that it was just too moist. I have dry skin and for me it is hard to find a foundation that is too moist. Another issue I had was that it was not very pigmented; you are not going to get coverage at all out of this. As someone that does not need a lot of coverage this is not an issue but it is something I needed to share with you. I tested this CoverGirl product for free through Influenster I Do VoxBox, but all reviews and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used CoverGirl foundation in years and was very skeptical about it. Having used mineral foundation happily for years, I was afraid of this breaking out my skin. It proved me wrong,  it lasted all day and gives very good coverage.  I would recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free,  but the opinions are all my own!</li>
            <li> Omg I love this foundation,, I have to mix two colors to get my perfect shade,but I love it!! Its light weight, buildable, smooth!!</li>
            <li> I got this product free in my VoxBox and my options are my own.  I do not normally wear liquid makeup so it was a very different feeling for me.  And the color was to light for me.  However I did test the product and it went on very easily.  It was very smooth and it did not have a strong smell.  I also liked that a little went a long way.  As I had said the color was not the perfect match for me so I gave it to a girl I work with and she is using it and loves it.  So for her it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Good product, although I received a shade slightly off of my normal skin tone so I probably won&#x27;t be using it very often. I does sink into your pores, so a primer is a must (something I don&#x27;t need to do with my normal foundation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a part of an influenster box for review purposes, but the opinions are my honest views.</li>
            <li> I am prone to extremly oily skin and break out often, due to this I usually use powder foundation as most liquid foundations cause a break out. However I just received this as a sample in my #voxbox and have to say it is a lot lighter than foundations I have used in the past and really gives my skin a nice even glow. Love it so far!  Even though I tested this for free, these opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This lightweight foundation feels great on my face. It lasts all day and isn&#x27;t sticky or too thick. I received it as a sample but the opinions are all my own. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> I love this. I have dry/normal skin with some dry patches and this is probably one of the only foundations that doesn&#x27;t cling onto my dry patches! I love it for that reason as well as its illuminating property and the pump of course.  It hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breakouts, and gives me a nice even skin tone and subtle glow. It looks completely natural, with no shine or glitter. It gives me light - medium coverage which suits me.  It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing foundation. It applies easy and smooth.  I will definitely be recommending this to others.  I received this product free from Influenster for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> This product has great coverage. I applied it using a wet blending sponge. Iwould not use this as a night out foundation as it is a bit watery. I would use this for a summer day! I did test this foundation for free, however this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foundation as it has a tendency to be heavy feeling and sticky, so I wasn&#x27;t suprised when this product had those characteristics. The coverage was full, so that&#x27;s nice. But it made any dry skin on my face stand out like a sore thumb. I had to apply moisturizer afterwards to get it to blend together. And it was shinier than I prefer, so I put some Clinique powder on over it. I doubt I will buy this item. If Covergirl has a BB or CC Creme, I would try that first for my wedding day, before buying this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary, for testing purposes, from Influenster. I was not compensated, in any way, for my opinion.</li>
            <li> I usually use other foundations and this is my first time trying the outlast stay luminous foundation; I like the product, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it again. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the shimmer that&#x27;s in the foundation. It&#x27;s subtle, but I&#x27;m just not a fan. Otherwise, the pump and bottle is great and easy to use. Definitely better than other packaging on other foundations I&#x27;ve tried. I was happy with the formula as well, it applied smoothly and evenly, the slight shimmer in the foundation just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me. I do recommend it for people who want to try it though! *I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.*</li>
            <li> I was offered a chance to try the covergirl outlast stay luminous foundation thanks to my friends at Influenster and I am so happy I did. It has been so good to my skin, many of the foundations I&#x27;ve tried tend to make me break out and I have super dry skin so sometimes I&#x27;d flake but this one is amazing Its my go to for everyday wear it&#x27;s light but with really good coverage! I think I&#x27;ve found the one for me!</li>
            <li> I received this foundation free from Influenster for testing purposes. I didn&#x27;t really like this foundation it made my face more oily and just didn&#x27;t have the coverage that I like. I would say it was a light weight and light coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> I used this foundation before I contoured and I was pleasantly surprised that it held up throughout the day. My face did not get greasy which is always my concern. Also, i&#x27;m happy that it does not feel too heavy for summer wearing. I&#x27;ve used CoverGirl foundations before but I&#x27;m excited that I received this complimentary for review purposes via Influenster. This is my own opinion regardless of receiving it complimentary.</li>
            <li> Never tried drug store make up before but since I got this foundation for free to sample I tried it; and loved it. Works better than some experience brand so why not go with the less expensive one. I really like how it feels because you forget you have anything on 😀you should give it a try and see for yourself😉</li>
            <li> I found this foundation to go on easily and has great coverage. I think the texture is actually really nice, not runny or too thick. I tested this product for free but all thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product to try for free from influenster. I had been using a much more expensive brand of foundation up until this point. In my opinion this product is of equivalent quality for a fraction of the cost. I would highly suggest this product to any one!</li>
            <li> I think Covergirl has a good selection of colors available that would suit most skin tones.  I have normal to dry skin and this foundation was too dry of a formula for me.  I had difficulty blending and getting a natural looking finish.  Instead it looked patchy and as if it was sitting on the surface of my skin.  The formula is tacky so it&#x27;s difficult to blend out.  This may be a very good product for someone with oily skin because the natural oils in the skin would resolve the challenges I experienced with blending and dryness.  It is often difficult to find a luminous foundation for oily skin types but this could be a good option.  I am accustomed to using high end department store foundations so I am also comparing this product to what my personal expectations are in a foundation and that may be very different than someone who is more accustomed to drug store make up brands.  The pump is very convenient for use and packaging is attractive.</li>
            <li> This foundation is great! I love how light it feels after application, and the coverage is pretty good. The color is pretty nice and there are many to choose from so there will definitely be a correct fit. It&#x27;s a great value for such a large bottle. I would definitely buy. I received this product for review purposes and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Full but lightweight coverage that lasts! Really though, what else do you want in a foundation? Not someone who usually wears foundation, I was excited to try this out when I was offered to test this product for free, (but all opinions are my own). I am a convert. It does not look like there is makeup on my face, it not not feel like there is, but my skin looks even and great!</li>
            <li> I really liked the coverage on this foundation. For some reason I thought the light shimmer in it would come off as greasy on my oily skin after awhile, or that the coverage would go away quicky, but it didnt. I loved the way it had a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; highlighting effect too. When the light hit my cheek bone it looked so gleamy and natural. If you contour or want the highlight look of a contour this is a wonderful base for it. I highly recommend! Courtesy of influenster for testing purposes!</li>
            <li> This foundation is light weight and matches my skin really well, it hasn&#x27;t caused my face to break out, and it hides all my little imperfections. I received this for free but my opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to work as well as it does. I tried the product because I got a sample for free from Influenster, and it actually worked way better than the more expensive foundation I&#x27;ve been using. I usually prefer a matte finish, which this does not have, but for a summer glow it&#x27;s great! I tested this CoverGirl product for free, but my opinions are my own :)</li>
            <li> I received this foundation compliments of #influenster and all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used this kind before, but I have to say that I will more than likely be buying&lt;br /&gt;every couple of months, as I&#x27;ve used it everyday since receiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very lightweight and silky, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t wear liquid foundation because it feels to heavy on my face. However, this CoverGirl product is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing foundation. It applies easy and smooth. I tested this COVERGIRL products for free, but my opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> I often play between my more expensive and drugstore foundations-- day to day I tend to use drugstore finds layered with high end concealer, and for dressier or more hectic days I rely on my more expensive foundations. I have combination/dry skin, and require only lightweight coverage. After receiving Covergirl&#x27;s Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation for testing I decide to really test its mettle-- so I tried it on during one of my busiest, mid-week, ultra-humid, hot summer days. I was pleasantly surprised-- not only did it hold up even after one very stressful presentation, three meetings and rush-hour insanity, BUT it managed to still give me that &amp;#34;glowing from the inside out&amp;#34; halo effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Covergirl&#x27;s Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation provides natural-looking medium coverage and dries to a slightly dewy finish, but it does NOT add any luminosity or radiance to skin. I also highly suggest using a primer and applying to well moisturized skin if you have normal to dry skin, as I do.&lt;br /&gt;Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation doesn&#x27;t fade throughout the day, true to its claims. The foundation will emphasize dry patches on skin, fine lines, and any enlarged pores if no primer is used, and if you want that &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; effect advertised I had great results by mixing the foundation with my Chanel luminizer.</li>
            <li> Not normally a cover girl fan but if you want to stay luminous this is your foundation right here! I was lucky and got to try the product for free so this is just my opinion .</li>
            <li> I love this product! It actually matched my tone.  This product is a little oily so if you have dry skin it is perfect.  It is easy to use and apply.  I would recommend this to friends and family. This is also great for light coverage since it is oily.  I would recommend​ using this with powder or during the winter.</li>
            <li> I just received a sample of this in a VoxBox and really liked it! I really liked the shading and the overall coverage. I have a hard time finding a foundation that doesn&#x27;t blend properly or look &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; especially for drugstore brand products.</li>
            <li> I received my sample for testing purposes through influenster. I really liked this product, it gave an air brushed look for sure. I am probably going to go buy some in a darker color because my sample was a bit light for my skin during summer months. It isn&#x27;t heavy and does have a natural look. reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the regular Covergirl Outlast Stay Fabulous 3-in-1 foundation, so I was very excited when I saw the Stay Luminous version. I have normal/dry skin and gravitate towards dewy/satin finish foundations. I also like a solid medium coverage that can be built up. I like to apply this foundation with a damp beauty sponge to get an even finish. For more coverage, it can be applied with a foundation brush or buffing brush. I love the packaging/pump style bottle. If I pump this on my hand and blend it out, then look closely, I can see very small sparkles. This doesn&#x27;t come across on the face, and actually the foundation does provide a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; effect. Unfortunately, the shade I received is too dark for my skintone. I wouldn&#x27;t say that the shade is darker than I expected. In Covergirl Outlast 3-in-1 I use Classic Ivory (810) or Creamy Natural (820), and in the Outlast Luminous I received Buff Beige 825. The Buff Beige is slightly dark for my skin, but I can mix it with a lighter foundation and make it work. There are fewer shades available in this line, but I liked the finish and long wear time enough that I plan on repurchasing the foundation in a shade that will match better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Stay Luminous foundation for free to test. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I got this Outlast Stay Luminous foundation for free in my complimentary I Do VOX BOX from influenster. It has a very very lightweight formula and pretty good coverage and at the same time it will give you a natural look. Even though I have a very oily skin type it lasted for about 6 hrs. I think is a really good everyday Foundation. Something really worth to try! Recommended</li>
            <li> Covergirl Stay Luminous foundation has medium coverage in  my opinion, and can be built to medium/full with 2 layers.  When first applied it looks a little dewy, but once it sets it&#x27;s more of a satin finish, which I sometimes prefer.  Once you apply powder over top, it does looks more matte at first, but gets more &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; as the day goes on. I  really like a dewy look because it just looks like you&#x27;re glowing and you&#x27;ve been kissed by the sun, I received Soft Sable via my #idoVoxBox from @influenster and I am now a fan and have checked out the rest of the line which is equally impressive.</li>
            <li> I wear foundation and BB cream quite often as it helps cover up any blemishes and any dark circles under my eyes, however, I&#x27;ve found them all in the past to be a bit too heavy. This on the other hand, is incredibly light! I barely know it&#x27;s on my face, which is a delight. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sometimes sensitive skin, the container is very easy to pump out the desired amount at any given time, and it goes on very easily. I apply it once and it lasts all day which I&#x27;m a fan of. I look forward to picking up more after I go through this bottle. Totally worth the value and the fresh look it gives your face all day long. Disclaimer: I received CoverGirl&#x27;s Outlast Stay Luminous foundation free to test and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation’s oil-free, non-greasy formula gives your skin a natural luminosity that lasts all day! Perfect for achieving radiant skin, this all day foundation hydrates skin while providing flawless coverage. I tested this COVERGIRL product for free.</li>
            <li> This product works great as a base layer for foundation. Easy application and nice smooth coverage. Highly recommend it and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Also a little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need much when using. This was a product given to me for testing purposes and I had success with this particular product and will be purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> This foundation left my skin looking more uniform and smoother. It went on easily and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It stayed on rather well and I&#x27;ve been using it quite regularly. I still prefer a few of Covergirls other formulations if foundation, but wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use this product more. I should clarify that I do use foundations atypically by mixing it with moisturizer for a very light coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product free through the I Do VoxBox from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this foundation! It makes my face look smooth and soft. And it actually does give it that natural glow look! I received this foundation in my #IDoVoxBox from Influenster to test it out for free, but all opinions are my own. Thank you so much Influenster and Covergirl for such opportunity! :)</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of this foundation to sample and review for free from Influenster! I love it! I have been using it every day since I received it! It is far better than the kind I was using before. I have enlarged pores and I was using FIT Matte before and I felt it enhanced the appearance of my pores. I love this product! It matches my skin tone well and provides great coverage! I will continue to use it and purchase it in the future!</li>
            <li> I am usually a huge fan of Covergirl products, but this one was just not for me. When applying, it didn&#x27;t seem to blend well with my skin. It felt as if it was just sitting on top of my skin rather then blending and working with my skin. I have a little bit of peach fuzz on my cheeks, (you normally can not tell or see the fuzz when bare skinned) the foundation made it very visible. I give it a 3 because it covered my blemishes and gave good coverage, it just didn&#x27;t work with my skin. It did also last a long time without reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;I received this free as a sample for testing purposes from Influsenster. This review is entirely my own, honest and true.</li>
            <li> First of all, I did receive this product free for testing in the #idovoxbox from influenster. However, my opinions are all honest and true. I really wished this foundation worked for me, I was so excited to try it out. The packaging with pump was amazing, the colour matched me perfectly....but....it was soooo dry. Dry to the extent that it would not blend into my skin. And I did start off with moisturizer and primer. It took me so much pulling of my skin to get this foundation blended and the result? It was blotchy, showed all the hairs on my face and emphasized my pores.&lt;br /&gt;I really wished this foundation would&#x27;ve worked for me, cause I was in the market for a new and great drugstore foundation, but sadly it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
