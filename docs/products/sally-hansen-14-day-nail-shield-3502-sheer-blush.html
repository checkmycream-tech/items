            <li>and they look perfect.  </li>
            <li>These nail shields were great!  </li>
            <li>If you apply them correctly, they are wonderful and will not peel off.  </li>
            <li>I just started using the nail shields and am impressed.</li>
            <li>I buy the best polishes on the market and still have peeling issues.</li>
            <li>and they look great!</li>
            <li>and I was so impressed</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCTS AND SERVICE !</li>
            <li>ABLE TO POST FYI !!!!!</li>
            <li>I think my nails look great</li>
            <li>For now though, I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Because I can&#x27;t tolerate the fumes from nail polishes or removers, this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>The  product worked great.  </li>
            <li>Great for growing out winter brittle nails.  </li>
            <li>Saw an ad for this in a magazine and thought it would be great to try.  </li>
            <li>They give a \\&quot;hint\\&quot; of color which is great.  </li>
            <li>Great for protecting nails&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>The shields now on my nails have been there for 2 weeks and still look very nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>The first set was not the best but practice does make perfect!  </li>
            <li>Tried to redo the ends but had no luck getting it to look nice!  </li>
            <li>As a sales rep, my hands are visible at all times, and I thought this was a good option for a manicure-free manicure.  </li>
            <li>although good idea - it just doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>The nail looked good, except for the side edges of my nails, which didn&#x27;t seem to adhere correctly.</li>
            <li>Good protection - after application</li>
            <li>This is a great idea, and I wish it worked better.  </li>
            <li>Now I am able to keep my nails protected and looking great all the time.</li>
            <li>Happy girl was I for sure to not do without.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these!    </li>
            <li>Now that they are on, I am so pleased!</li>
            <li>I would have had better results if I had just put on polish, even while balancing a toddler in my lap!</li>
            <li>I am completely in love with all of the Sally Hansen nail strips and these are one of my favorites!  </li>
            <li>I bought these with great anticipation of having nice strong nails for a change.</li>
            <li>The shine is amazing, however they crack instead of peeling or chipping.  </li>
            <li>Amazing these were even tested.</li>
            <li>also don&#x27;t have the problem of chipping anymore which is amazing to me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-They make my nails look nice for 7 day..</li>
            <li>Cut your own using packing tape</li>
            <li>Rub the strip between your hands to warm it up</li>
            <li>and they look nice, plus</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply, and fairly durable.</li>
            <li>These are a bit more durable and the gloss is nice.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I have beautiful nails that I have manicured</li>
            <li>I have used many products to try and grow my peeling nails, and I am hopeful that this may be the answer.  </li>
            <li>but I have not tried it, but I am expecting to like it better than the Nude.  </li>
            <li>and I love the color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably get better each and every time.</li>
            <li>It took no time, no nasty smell and no drying time.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and cannot wait to get more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the no-dry time and the lack of odor.</li>
            <li>Faster than a salon manicure, sure, but they don&#x27;t look like one either.  </li>
            <li>Then you file the top of the nail to file off the excess.  </li>
            <li>These do last fourteen days, but they won&#x27;t be perfect.  </li>
            <li>I might actually be able to grow my nails.</li>
            <li>I also hope that Sally Hansen will offer them in more colors.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these strips.</li>
            <li>they are MUCH better though.</li>
            <li>So glad I discovered this item.</li>
            <li>I love the look of acrylic and gel</li>
            <li>I was able to cover two nails from one strip.</li>
            <li>Edited to say that ESSIE is a better product.</li>
            <li>Okay, I have to give this product a 4 out of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I put a top coat on mine and I am on day three</li>
            <li>Also,I think once another week or two passes, I will paint over them w/regular polish instead of removing them. :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>If you have a problem with them staying on, you need to be more diligent when applying them.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>on for the two weeks or more</li>
            <li>I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF HOW &amp;#34;WORDY&amp;#34; I WANT TO BE IN</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea, but need to be improved much.</li>
            <li>If you want to do it right and get the nail shield on good, it will take some time.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to hear about this product and was eager to try it.    </li>
            <li>There is a pretty good selection of sizes</li>
            <li>Tip: I&#x27;ve found that washing/drying my hands and then lightly sanding the top of your nails with make the strips adhere even better.</li>
            <li>clean and buffed smooth with the included buffer for effective adherence.</li>
            <li>The 14 Day shield does exactly what its supposed to do and more!</li>
            <li>so I chose to replace at 10 days, but a non-hand-fiddler could easily get 2 weeks.    </li>
            <li>Either your nail wasn&#x27;t clean, or maybe you were touching the adhesive side of the nail strip.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so easy</li>
            <li>They split and crack easily.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how strong my nails felt until I took them off.  </li>
            <li>I think they look just fantastic and my nails feel so strong.</li>
            <li>Hansen 14 Day Nail Shield has made a huge difference for me.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t works, I couldn&#x27;t use, it doesn&#x27;t fit in the nails, I threw out without using it.</li>
            <li>They also get folds and ripples on the sides when you try to smooth them out.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for problem nails.  </li>
            <li>They only last for 7 but 7 days of nice looking nails is great for me!</li>
            <li>I think this is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>You have to drop it on your nail in one motion and then smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>also use a soft cloth (t-shirt tail works good) and smooth the nail strip onto your nail bed with light pressure, then file edges off.</li>
            <li>claimed it&#x27;s quick and easy for people who don&#x27;t have time for manicures.</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>I saw these in a magazine and was excited to try them out.</li>
            <li>I can actually have nice nails!</li>
            <li>They sheer color is very pretty and great for work.</li>
            <li>I think you have to make sure your nails are absolutely clean, and use the buffer side of the nail file first.</li>
            <li>You do need clean, buffed nails for them to stick.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing good I can say about them, and I wish I would have spent my money on a bottle of nail polish that I&#x27;d get more than one use out of.</li>
            <li>Pay special attention to the sides.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I have long beautiful nails</li>
            <li>They might be ok after a shower for a night out, but it would be so much easier (and cheaper)to just polish.</li>
            <li>but they stood up to a sink full of dishes without any problem.</li>
            <li>I add a couple coats of Seche Vite fast drying top coat</li>
            <li>These nail shields protect fragile split prone nails, as well as looking good.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s true of any manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m lucky if it lasts 2 days let alone two weeks.  </li>
            <li>The nude color I used was very pretty</li>
            <li>I will have to see how many days they last before being able to fully decide if they were worth the money and effort.</li>
            <li>These were so easy and fast to put on.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I first saw this product advertised in a magazine.</li>
            <li>These are great--I am on week 2 of my 2nd set and my nails have never looked better!</li>
            <li>First,  you must have clean nails.  </li>
            <li>Maybe with a little refining it will be a great product.</li>
            <li>and it did look much better than the nail jobs I usually do on my own, but they started peeling around the edges a few days after I&#x27;d put them on.</li>
            <li>Love the \\&quot;Sheer Blush\\&quot; shade for a nice natural look.  </li>
            <li>No nics, creases, and more durable than using clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I do a lot with my hands and these keep my nails looking freshly painted for longer.  </li>
            <li>I just stock up on these and then do whatever fun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that a couple coats of clear top coat will keep them looking nice as long as 3 weeks after application.  </li>
            <li>I found that applying the polish right after application made the nails look bubbly, but that went away after a day.  </li>
            <li>My nails are nice and long</li>
            <li>I found them to be fairly simple to apply, but it did take a bit of time and a lot of effort to get them on straight and looking nice.</li>
            <li>Make sure your nails are clean and dry</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll stick with nail polish, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Sit back and admire your gorgeous nails that last many days longer than even a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>I love the Sheer Shell color and there is even a bit of iridescence to it.  </li>
            <li>I like my nails to look nice but have absolutely no time for manicures.  </li>
            <li>I recommend buffing your nails first and sorting out the sizes before you start</li>
            <li>Overall I was pleased, and would use them again.  </li>
            <li>However, even after a less-than-perfect first application, my nails were well-protected and did not peel or rip.     </li>
            <li>I did the first nail and realized it would be easier to take the paper off,  but leave the clear layer on until you get the nail aligned and stuck on the nail,  then peel and smooth.</li>
            <li>These tape-like strips do exactly what they are advertised to do; strengthen nails against peeling and splitting - immediately, with no drying time required.     </li>
            <li>It will look a bit crinkly at first, but it smooths out.  </li>
            <li>I  get some moderate chipping, but still they are growing better than before.       </li>
            <li>The shields last for more than two weeks - even through house cleaning, dishes, etc.</li>
            <li>My nails were supported and nourished, and I noticed that the surface had improved after the first two week application.</li>
            <li>, I went back and got three more boxes.  </li>
            <li>not going to send back would cost more to send back&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excluding the prep, the first time it&#x27;s applied, it will probably take 20-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>for some reason the 14 day shield really grips the nail surface much better and creates a stronger nail overall.     </li>
            <li>The strips are very flimsy and will tear easily if you are not very, very careful.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to grow my nails, they&#x27;re weak and break very easily.  </li>
            <li>(they came off easily, although the instructions say to remove them with polish remover - perhaps they adhere more tightly after more time has elapsed) and went back to my clear nail hardener/conditioner.</li>
            <li>The strips adhere to your nails, and peeling them off takes the top layer(s) of your nails with them, making your nails weaker in the long run.</li>
            <li>The Nude color is sort of yellowish, which make my nails almost look dirty or like a smoker&#x27;s, but I am also very fair skinned with cool undertones.  </li>
            <li>For a product with what seems like such light adhesive,  it stays pretty well.</li>
            <li>Had to use a wash cloth and my own finger nails to scrub this mess off.  </li>
            <li>use clear (European Secrets Rock Top Coat) over it because my nails split so easily, but this isn&#x27;t really necessary.</li>
            <li>I like a neutral nail,  but a little more pink would be nice.     </li>
            <li>The strips are much thinner than they look to be in the ads.</li>
            <li>14 days would really be pushing it because of growth and cracking&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next,  you must lightly buff the surface of the nail.</li>
            <li>I plan to use this product again hoping my fingernails will continue to grow to a reasonable length.  </li>
            <li>I really like the look, and will update my review after I have had these on for a while.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted these to work.</li>
            <li>with the strips they are so much stronger.</li>
            <li>And to trim, just gently brush the edges with a nail file.  </li>
            <li>I have found that the 14 day nail shield really works.</li>
            <li>You can make them last there longest by putting a clear coat of polish on top.   </li>
            <li>The Nail Shields stay on and look good for at least 14 days or maybe longer.  </li>
            <li>nails are long and strong</li>
            <li>First, the smell of the shield is too strong, like sharp odor.</li>
            <li>They are nothing more than thin decals and peel off much too easily.</li>
            <li>I even wash dishes and clean in them and they still last.  </li>
            <li>If the clear needs to be refreshed, I can use nail polish remover to smooth it out and skim a little off just the top coat, then polish with clear again.  </li>
            <li>Push back your cuticles, file the ends and buff the surface of your nails, wipe them down with a good nail polish remover to get any lotion or oils off and let them dry.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>They stay on without chipping like nail polish, last two weeks or longer (though grow-out does encourage occasional re-application), add a nice gloss to nails with just a hint of natural color.</li>
            <li>They were easy to put on - I had to cut a few of the strips to get the right width.</li>
            <li>Application in less than 15 minutes with zero dry time (aka go to bed or take a shower immediately after - amazing!).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Loved them and am surprised at the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>They easily last for more than a week when regular polish would start to chip within two days for</li>
            <li>I think that if you need an emergency manicure that only needs to look good for a few hours, the Nail Shield strips will do the trick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The price is a little steep ($7.99 at Wallgreens, I&#x27;m sure I can find a cheaper price else where), but I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine as long as you seal it with clear polish.  </li>
            <li>What I received was clearly very old and there was discoloration on the part of the product that could be seen through the window of the box where it had been exposed to light for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Much shinier finish for longer than clear nail polish.    </li>
            <li>Old strips can be removed by gently scraping them off with a fingernail, though the mfgr.</li>
            <li>They have just enough adhesive for you to get the right positioning on your natural nail, then they adhere really well over a day.  </li>
            <li>I could do it with nail scissors on the left hand (using the right hand to cut),</li>
            <li>I am wearing the sheer blush one right now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I wasn&#x27;t so active they would last much longer.  </li>
            <li>I kept them on for 14 days, and I did not have one break (and my nails grow quickly, so they got quite long).  </li>
            <li>I have very moist (tear super easy) thin nails.</li>
            <li>These nail shields have a subtle appearance, but give a beautiful finish to my nails with minimal effort and clean-up.</li>
            <li>With time, they will rub off a little at the ends, but honestly, wearing Sheer Shell, I can&#x27;t even tell unless I hold my nails up to my face.</li>
            <li>I had acrylic nails for 15 years and now have decent natural nails,  </li>
            <li>I now wait a few hours before applying the clear polish on top.  </li>
            <li>First, I think I have relatively normal-sized nails, but the strips are so big that I could only find a match to fit three of my nails on each hand.</li>
            <li>Second, after polishing 5 minutes later, the surface of the shield is not flat any more.</li>
            <li>You have to trim each shield to fit, peel the very stubborn tape off, carefully apply and rub your nails for several minutes each to move the air bubbles out-</li>
            <li>I did break a nail,  but it was a pretty solid impact.  </li>
            <li>By the time I got six of them on, thereby starting to use the first hand to apply and shape the second hand, the nails on the first hand (now being used as tools) started lumping up and peeling around the edges.  </li>
            <li>The one positive aspect to this product is that the finish is nearly instant.</li>
            <li>I only wish they had a little more color.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Hard As Wraps lasts longer, protects my nails better, and is far easier to remove.  </li>
            <li>First, the hard work is in the preparation, but that is true for any manicure.  </li>
            <li>---they will be much heavier and you won&#x27;t care when they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Mine are all chipped and peeling and so far these are sticking.</li>
            <li>without nail polish  my nails are constantly tearing on the sides because they bend so much.</li>
            <li>I have had very weak/thin problem nails my entire life.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by how many negative reviews there were.  </li>
            <li>What I really like about them is no more smearing, and I travel a lot, so these will be easy to take with me on personal and business trips...</li>
            <li>takes a little practice but worth it for the price of these babies!    </li>
            <li>I think water is their enemy until they&#x27;re fully dry and water doesn&#x27;t seem to bother them after the first day.</li>
            <li>There is some synthetic smell for the first few hours, but much milder than polish.</li>
            <li>I have very short nails and narrow and all the excess strip is easily filed away with the file they provide.  </li>
            <li>They are either too skinny to fit exactly or too wide and leave small gaps when you try to cut them to size.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, despite following direction exactly, the shields just would not stick on till I blow dried them and applied 2 coats of polish on top and blow dried again.</li>
            <li>I think people are getting bad results because they lift it up and try to smooth it more.  </li>
            <li>I have very brittle, dry nails and working at a restaurant waitressing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a very busy working mom with fragile nails.  </li>
            <li>Hard to apply and didn&#x27;t fit the nails.  </li>
            <li>Seemed like a cool idea but was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li>but since I can&#x27;t make scissors work with my left hand (at least on such an intricate operation), I was stuck with ragged edges on the sixth nail (first one on the right hand).  </li>
            <li>My nails have always split and broken easily and these stop that completely.  </li>
            <li>Luckily they include a few extra pieces in the kit.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy if you go slow and take your time, but 45 minutes later mine was peeling off.</li>
            <li>If it is on right, all you have to do is apply pressure and then wait a few minutes and the crinkly look is gone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very tired of this kind of thing.</li>
            <li>&quot; did not last even one entire day before the tips were completely chipped off all my nails.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have time for salon manicures (think 3-4 times a year) and don&#x27;t usually even bother with nail polish at all since, thanks to my preschooler, my hands take a beating and polish chips almost immediately.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t marked in the second store I went in but rang up the same clearance price.  </li>
            <li>They took maybe 15 minutes to apply, but then there was no dry time</li>
            <li>My nails are actually growing without any major breaks.  </li>
            <li>Could have been my error, but I&#x27;m not willing to try again because it was difficult to get the product on in the first place and more expensive than a regular sheer cover that I can do on my own.</li>
            <li>They did make my nails stronger for the first few days, but then I noticed some peeling along the edge of the nails.</li>
            <li>If you prefer to lose the gloss, that&#x27;s easily accomplished by slightly roughing the surface with the buffer to leave a matte finish.</li>
            <li>These last slightly longer, with less chipping and better gloss than the other polish strips.  </li>

            <li> If you apply them correctly, they are wonderful and will not peel off.  </li>
            <li> I just started using the nail shields and am impressed.</li>

            <li> GREAT PRODUCTS AND SERVICE !</li>
            <li> ABLE TO POST FYI !!!!!</li>
            <li> I think my nails look great</li>
            <li> For now though, I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Because I can&#x27;t tolerate the fumes from nail polishes or removers, this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> The  product worked great.  </li>
            <li> Great for growing out winter brittle nails.  </li>
            <li> Saw an ad for this in a magazine and thought it would be great to try.  </li>
            <li> They give a \\&quot;hint\\&quot; of color which is great.  </li>
            <li> Great for protecting nails&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> The shields now on my nails have been there for 2 weeks and still look very nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.</li>
            <li> The first set was not the best but practice does make perfect!  </li>
            <li> Tried to redo the ends but had no luck getting it to look nice!  </li>
            <li> As a sales rep, my hands are visible at all times, and I thought this was a good option for a manicure-free manicure.  </li>
            <li> although good idea - it just doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The nail looked good, except for the side edges of my nails, which didn&#x27;t seem to adhere correctly.</li>
            <li> Good protection - after application</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, and I wish it worked better.  </li>
            <li> Now I am able to keep my nails protected and looking great all the time.</li>
            <li> Happy girl was I for sure to not do without.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of these!    </li>
            <li> Now that they are on, I am so pleased!</li>
            <li> I would have had better results if I had just put on polish, even while balancing a toddler in my lap!</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with all of the Sally Hansen nail strips and these are one of my favorites!  </li>
            <li> I bought these with great anticipation of having nice strong nails for a change.</li>
            <li> The shine is amazing, however they crack instead of peeling or chipping.  </li>
            <li> Amazing these were even tested.</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t have the problem of chipping anymore which is amazing to me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-They make my nails look nice for 7 day..</li>
            <li> Cut your own using packing tape</li>
            <li> Rub the strip between your hands to warm it up</li>
            <li> and they look nice, plus</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply, and fairly durable.</li>
            <li> These are a bit more durable and the gloss is nice.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I have beautiful nails that I have manicured</li>
            <li> I have used many products to try and grow my peeling nails, and I am hopeful that this may be the answer.  </li>
            <li> but I have not tried it, but I am expecting to like it better than the Nude.  </li>
            <li> and I love the color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get better each and every time.</li>
            <li> It took no time, no nasty smell and no drying time.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and cannot wait to get more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the no-dry time and the lack of odor.</li>
            <li> Faster than a salon manicure, sure, but they don&#x27;t look like one either.  </li>
            <li> Then you file the top of the nail to file off the excess.  </li>
            <li> These do last fourteen days, but they won&#x27;t be perfect.  </li>
            <li> I might actually be able to grow my nails.</li>
            <li> I also hope that Sally Hansen will offer them in more colors.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these strips.</li>
            <li> they are MUCH better though.</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered this item.</li>
            <li> I love the look of acrylic and gel</li>
            <li> I was able to cover two nails from one strip.</li>
            <li> Edited to say that ESSIE is a better product.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have to give this product a 4 out of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I put a top coat on mine and I am on day three</li>
            <li> Also,I think once another week or two passes, I will paint over them w/regular polish instead of removing them. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with them staying on, you need to be more diligent when applying them.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> on for the two weeks or more</li>
            <li> I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF HOW &amp;#34;WORDY&amp;#34; I WANT TO BE IN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea, but need to be improved much.</li>
            <li> If you want to do it right and get the nail shield on good, it will take some time.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to hear about this product and was eager to try it.    </li>
            <li> There is a pretty good selection of sizes</li>
            <li> Tip: I&#x27;ve found that washing/drying my hands and then lightly sanding the top of your nails with make the strips adhere even better.</li>
            <li> clean and buffed smooth with the included buffer for effective adherence.</li>
            <li> The 14 Day shield does exactly what its supposed to do and more!</li>
            <li> so I chose to replace at 10 days, but a non-hand-fiddler could easily get 2 weeks.    </li>
            <li> Either your nail wasn&#x27;t clean, or maybe you were touching the adhesive side of the nail strip.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so easy</li>
            <li> They split and crack easily.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how strong my nails felt until I took them off.  </li>
            <li> I think they look just fantastic and my nails feel so strong.</li>
            <li> Hansen 14 Day Nail Shield has made a huge difference for me.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t works, I couldn&#x27;t use, it doesn&#x27;t fit in the nails, I threw out without using it.</li>
            <li> They also get folds and ripples on the sides when you try to smooth them out.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for problem nails.  </li>
            <li> They only last for 7 but 7 days of nice looking nails is great for me!</li>
            <li> I think this is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> You have to drop it on your nail in one motion and then smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> also use a soft cloth (t-shirt tail works good) and smooth the nail strip onto your nail bed with light pressure, then file edges off.</li>
            <li> claimed it&#x27;s quick and easy for people who don&#x27;t have time for manicures.</li>
            <li> Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I saw these in a magazine and was excited to try them out.</li>
            <li> I can actually have nice nails!</li>
            <li> They sheer color is very pretty and great for work.</li>
            <li> I think you have to make sure your nails are absolutely clean, and use the buffer side of the nail file first.</li>
            <li> You do need clean, buffed nails for them to stick.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing good I can say about them, and I wish I would have spent my money on a bottle of nail polish that I&#x27;d get more than one use out of.</li>
            <li> Pay special attention to the sides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I have long beautiful nails</li>
            <li> They might be ok after a shower for a night out, but it would be so much easier (and cheaper)to just polish.</li>
            <li> but they stood up to a sink full of dishes without any problem.</li>
            <li> I add a couple coats of Seche Vite fast drying top coat</li>
            <li> These nail shields protect fragile split prone nails, as well as looking good.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s true of any manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m lucky if it lasts 2 days let alone two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The nude color I used was very pretty</li>
            <li> I will have to see how many days they last before being able to fully decide if they were worth the money and effort.</li>
            <li> These were so easy and fast to put on.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I first saw this product advertised in a magazine.</li>
            <li> These are great--I am on week 2 of my 2nd set and my nails have never looked better!</li>
            <li> First,  you must have clean nails.  </li>
            <li> Maybe with a little refining it will be a great product.</li>
            <li> and it did look much better than the nail jobs I usually do on my own, but they started peeling around the edges a few days after I&#x27;d put them on.</li>
            <li> Love the \\&quot;Sheer Blush\\&quot; shade for a nice natural look.  </li>
            <li> No nics, creases, and more durable than using clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I do a lot with my hands and these keep my nails looking freshly painted for longer.  </li>
            <li> I just stock up on these and then do whatever fun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that a couple coats of clear top coat will keep them looking nice as long as 3 weeks after application.  </li>
            <li> I found that applying the polish right after application made the nails look bubbly, but that went away after a day.  </li>
            <li> My nails are nice and long</li>
            <li> I found them to be fairly simple to apply, but it did take a bit of time and a lot of effort to get them on straight and looking nice.</li>
            <li> Make sure your nails are clean and dry</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll stick with nail polish, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Sit back and admire your gorgeous nails that last many days longer than even a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> I love the Sheer Shell color and there is even a bit of iridescence to it.  </li>
            <li> I like my nails to look nice but have absolutely no time for manicures.  </li>
            <li> I recommend buffing your nails first and sorting out the sizes before you start</li>
            <li> Overall I was pleased, and would use them again.  </li>
            <li> However, even after a less-than-perfect first application, my nails were well-protected and did not peel or rip.     </li>
            <li> I did the first nail and realized it would be easier to take the paper off,  but leave the clear layer on until you get the nail aligned and stuck on the nail,  then peel and smooth.</li>
            <li> These tape-like strips do exactly what they are advertised to do; strengthen nails against peeling and splitting - immediately, with no drying time required.     </li>
            <li> It will look a bit crinkly at first, but it smooths out.  </li>
            <li> I  get some moderate chipping, but still they are growing better than before.       </li>
            <li> The shields last for more than two weeks - even through house cleaning, dishes, etc.</li>
            <li> My nails were supported and nourished, and I noticed that the surface had improved after the first two week application.</li>
            <li> , I went back and got three more boxes.  </li>
            <li> not going to send back would cost more to send back&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excluding the prep, the first time it&#x27;s applied, it will probably take 20-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> for some reason the 14 day shield really grips the nail surface much better and creates a stronger nail overall.     </li>
            <li> The strips are very flimsy and will tear easily if you are not very, very careful.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow my nails, they&#x27;re weak and break very easily.  </li>
            <li> (they came off easily, although the instructions say to remove them with polish remover - perhaps they adhere more tightly after more time has elapsed) and went back to my clear nail hardener/conditioner.</li>
            <li> The strips adhere to your nails, and peeling them off takes the top layer(s) of your nails with them, making your nails weaker in the long run.</li>
            <li> The Nude color is sort of yellowish, which make my nails almost look dirty or like a smoker&#x27;s, but I am also very fair skinned with cool undertones.  </li>
            <li> For a product with what seems like such light adhesive,  it stays pretty well.</li>
            <li> Had to use a wash cloth and my own finger nails to scrub this mess off.  </li>
            <li> use clear (European Secrets Rock Top Coat) over it because my nails split so easily, but this isn&#x27;t really necessary.</li>
            <li> I like a neutral nail,  but a little more pink would be nice.     </li>
            <li> The strips are much thinner than they look to be in the ads.</li>
            <li> 14 days would really be pushing it because of growth and cracking&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next,  you must lightly buff the surface of the nail.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this product again hoping my fingernails will continue to grow to a reasonable length.  </li>
            <li> I really like the look, and will update my review after I have had these on for a while.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work.</li>
            <li> with the strips they are so much stronger.</li>
            <li> And to trim, just gently brush the edges with a nail file.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the 14 day nail shield really works.</li>
            <li> You can make them last there longest by putting a clear coat of polish on top.   </li>
            <li> The Nail Shields stay on and look good for at least 14 days or maybe longer.  </li>
            <li> nails are long and strong</li>
            <li> First, the smell of the shield is too strong, like sharp odor.</li>
            <li> They are nothing more than thin decals and peel off much too easily.</li>
            <li> I even wash dishes and clean in them and they still last.  </li>
            <li> If the clear needs to be refreshed, I can use nail polish remover to smooth it out and skim a little off just the top coat, then polish with clear again.  </li>
            <li> Push back your cuticles, file the ends and buff the surface of your nails, wipe them down with a good nail polish remover to get any lotion or oils off and let them dry.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> They stay on without chipping like nail polish, last two weeks or longer (though grow-out does encourage occasional re-application), add a nice gloss to nails with just a hint of natural color.</li>
            <li> They were easy to put on - I had to cut a few of the strips to get the right width.</li>
            <li> Application in less than 15 minutes with zero dry time (aka go to bed or take a shower immediately after - amazing!).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was not fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Loved them and am surprised at the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> They easily last for more than a week when regular polish would start to chip within two days for</li>
            <li> I think that if you need an emergency manicure that only needs to look good for a few hours, the Nail Shield strips will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep ($7.99 at Wallgreens, I&#x27;m sure I can find a cheaper price else where), but I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine as long as you seal it with clear polish.  </li>
            <li> What I received was clearly very old and there was discoloration on the part of the product that could be seen through the window of the box where it had been exposed to light for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Much shinier finish for longer than clear nail polish.    </li>
            <li> Old strips can be removed by gently scraping them off with a fingernail, though the mfgr.</li>
            <li> They have just enough adhesive for you to get the right positioning on your natural nail, then they adhere really well over a day.  </li>
            <li> I could do it with nail scissors on the left hand (using the right hand to cut),</li>
            <li> I am wearing the sheer blush one right now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I wasn&#x27;t so active they would last much longer.  </li>
            <li> I kept them on for 14 days, and I did not have one break (and my nails grow quickly, so they got quite long).  </li>
            <li> I have very moist (tear super easy) thin nails.</li>
            <li> These nail shields have a subtle appearance, but give a beautiful finish to my nails with minimal effort and clean-up.</li>
            <li> With time, they will rub off a little at the ends, but honestly, wearing Sheer Shell, I can&#x27;t even tell unless I hold my nails up to my face.</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for 15 years and now have decent natural nails,  </li>
            <li> I now wait a few hours before applying the clear polish on top.  </li>
            <li> First, I think I have relatively normal-sized nails, but the strips are so big that I could only find a match to fit three of my nails on each hand.</li>
            <li> Second, after polishing 5 minutes later, the surface of the shield is not flat any more.</li>
            <li> You have to trim each shield to fit, peel the very stubborn tape off, carefully apply and rub your nails for several minutes each to move the air bubbles out-</li>
            <li> I did break a nail,  but it was a pretty solid impact.  </li>
            <li> By the time I got six of them on, thereby starting to use the first hand to apply and shape the second hand, the nails on the first hand (now being used as tools) started lumping up and peeling around the edges.  </li>
            <li> The one positive aspect to this product is that the finish is nearly instant.</li>
            <li> I only wish they had a little more color.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Hard As Wraps lasts longer, protects my nails better, and is far easier to remove.  </li>
            <li> First, the hard work is in the preparation, but that is true for any manicure.  </li>
            <li> ---they will be much heavier and you won&#x27;t care when they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Mine are all chipped and peeling and so far these are sticking.</li>
            <li> without nail polish  my nails are constantly tearing on the sides because they bend so much.</li>
            <li> I have had very weak/thin problem nails my entire life.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by how many negative reviews there were.  </li>
            <li> What I really like about them is no more smearing, and I travel a lot, so these will be easy to take with me on personal and business trips...</li>
            <li> takes a little practice but worth it for the price of these babies!    </li>
            <li> I think water is their enemy until they&#x27;re fully dry and water doesn&#x27;t seem to bother them after the first day.</li>
            <li> There is some synthetic smell for the first few hours, but much milder than polish.</li>
            <li> I have very short nails and narrow and all the excess strip is easily filed away with the file they provide.  </li>
            <li> They are either too skinny to fit exactly or too wide and leave small gaps when you try to cut them to size.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, despite following direction exactly, the shields just would not stick on till I blow dried them and applied 2 coats of polish on top and blow dried again.</li>
            <li> I think people are getting bad results because they lift it up and try to smooth it more.  </li>
            <li> I have very brittle, dry nails and working at a restaurant waitressing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a very busy working mom with fragile nails.  </li>
            <li> Hard to apply and didn&#x27;t fit the nails.  </li>
            <li> Seemed like a cool idea but was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> but since I can&#x27;t make scissors work with my left hand (at least on such an intricate operation), I was stuck with ragged edges on the sixth nail (first one on the right hand).  </li>
            <li> My nails have always split and broken easily and these stop that completely.  </li>
            <li> Luckily they include a few extra pieces in the kit.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy if you go slow and take your time, but 45 minutes later mine was peeling off.</li>
            <li> If it is on right, all you have to do is apply pressure and then wait a few minutes and the crinkly look is gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very tired of this kind of thing.</li>
            <li> &quot; did not last even one entire day before the tips were completely chipped off all my nails.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t have time for salon manicures (think 3-4 times a year) and don&#x27;t usually even bother with nail polish at all since, thanks to my preschooler, my hands take a beating and polish chips almost immediately.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t marked in the second store I went in but rang up the same clearance price.  </li>
            <li> They took maybe 15 minutes to apply, but then there was no dry time</li>
            <li> My nails are actually growing without any major breaks.  </li>
            <li> Could have been my error, but I&#x27;m not willing to try again because it was difficult to get the product on in the first place and more expensive than a regular sheer cover that I can do on my own.</li>
            <li> They did make my nails stronger for the first few days, but then I noticed some peeling along the edge of the nails.</li>
            <li> If you prefer to lose the gloss, that&#x27;s easily accomplished by slightly roughing the surface with the buffer to leave a matte finish.</li>
            <li> These last slightly longer, with less chipping and better gloss than the other polish strips.  </li>
            <li> The strips are less thick and opaque than I thought they&#x27;d be; they are still strong, but quite transparent.  </li>
            <li> I put these on 2 days ago and so far no chips or peeling as mentioned by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> flat</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long they&#x27;ll last</li>
            <li> I especially do not want to soak my fingers in acetone for a long period of time to get the nail polish off (which is needed for some types of nail</li>
            <li> I had to hold my nail down for about a minute or 2 and then add clear nail hardener over</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t get bed sheet indents like regular polish, but they are somewhat soft for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible to economize if your nails are short: shields are long enough to cut in half.    </li>
            <li> (Side note: the strips were really long</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t get a manicure every week, they peel and rip and never get terribly long.</li>
            <li> I could see how this product could protect against minor cracks and splits.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get them to grow as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> Its been a long time since I&#x27;ve  had fingernails without all of them chipping and peeling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter at all that it&#x27;s too long or even if it&#x27;s too</li>
            <li> Try not to get your hands too wet for several hours after you apply them.  </li>
            <li> I tend to keep my nails short and like minimal color.  </li>
            <li> Followed directions carefully and still would not stick properly.</li>
            <li> I may never have long nails</li>
            <li> but I hate that nail polish chips so easily with natural nails,  and when I leave them bare,  they peel and split.     </li>
            <li> For me, they were no faster than painting myself and waiting for the paint to dry.  </li>
            <li> So many tiny bubbles appear on it made my nails so ugly.</li>
            <li> Then the whole thing peeled off in a few hours but not before I went to my party with uneven, crackly looking nails.</li>
            <li> Place the strip on your nail lining up the bottom first and pull a little over the end so that you give it a little stretch as you lay it down.  </li>
            <li> By the second application, I had the technique down, and have had to file my nails TWICE because they&#x27;ve gotten too long!</li>
            <li> I could hardly get one on my nail using my right hand; I can&#x27;t imagine how hard it would be if I had gotten to the left (gave up after three nails).</li>
            <li> I will be curious to see how long my nails grow using the shields.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product was actually TESTED before it was sent sailing down the stream of commerce to take our money.</li>
            <li> The strips are very thin and you can see right through them, and the color I got (sheer shell) was shimmery, which I didn&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li> After taking the strips off my nails have grown longer than I have had them grown in a very long time and have protected them from chipping and splitting!</li>
            <li> so I cut them in half so that I can have extra ones when I messed</li>
            <li> so they lasted about a week before starting to peel a bit which beats regular nails polish that usually lasts 2-3 days before chipping.  </li>
            <li> I use one end for one nail and the other end for the same nail on the other hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan on sheer shell because it&#x27;s a little to shimmery for me.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey for 1 manicure, that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Press the entire strip down firmly with your fingers and rub it with the flat part of the stick.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised by all the reviews that said these were so hard to apply.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this product, I found them a little difficult to apply - the strips are very delicate and can rip easily, so it does take a little practice.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t get wet?</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just have unusually wide nails.</li>
            <li> I have very strong nails that grow well, but when the tips grow to about half inch, my nails begin to painfully break below the nail line.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about drying time at all, though there is an strong, unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Not enough small sizes and too wide for my nails.</li>
            <li> These also don&#x27;t chip (like every other nail polish does on my nails, no matter what I try).</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED,  AND FOUND IT WITH OTHER ITEMS I WANTED.  </li>
            <li> While I did not have the application problems that many other negative reviewers had, I found the performance results of this product to be extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> For any other purpose, they just are not worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Fold the end down and tuck it under the tip of your nail with your other nail or the orange wood</li>
            <li> They always last at least 1 1/2 to 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few days with sinks of dishes, and work</li>
            <li> did* apply a base coat, two coats of color and a top coat over the shields.</li>
            <li> The sanitizer we use to wipe down tables decimates my nails.  </li>
            <li> i do wish that the strips could be folded down over the edges of the nails, but they just didn&#x27;t stick to the undersides of my nails.</li>
            <li> I just wish they were easier to find in stores and that they came in other colors!</li>
            <li> It took me about half an hour to apply all 10.      </li>
            <li> They are less than half the cost of the sephora.  </li>
            <li> If I am not using the strips under my liquid nail polish then the liquid stuff comes off in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I work with my hands and a typical manicure lasts about three days before the tips start to chip.</li>
            <li> They are not super sticky, but I don&#x27;t think they are supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> But once you&#x27;re used to the product, it can take 10 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like having a salon manicure for a number of reasons and don&#x27;t care for the look of fake nails.  </li>
            <li> The other drawback is that they are not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I am very active</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, once the strips were removed because they looked tacky, (after only 8 days) there was no improvement in my nails in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> (I wipe mine off with an alcohol pad before applying) and use the orange stick that comes with them to press them down firmly along the sides and cuticle.  </li>
            <li> They are just like little stickers.</li>
            <li> Little scraps of plastic and paper everywhere.</li>
            <li> I am hoping the shields will protect my nails and allow them to grow a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> but now I may at least have nails that I don&#x27;t have to file down to the bed due to</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for around $6, a little costly for a one-time use product, but I have such thin, peely nails I decided to give it a try anyway.       </li>
            <li> not particularly easy to apply, nearly impossible to get the right size.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> but instead of being disabled and waiting for your nails to try for 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Took it off after a few days with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> &quot;  Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy from this seller&lt;br /&gt;Was not even in the packaging like it should have been pieces missing</li>
            <li> By the second day any bubbles/kinks had worked out of the sheilds, and I had a hard, tough, shiny coating on my nails.</li>
            <li> sometimes in as little as an hour!</li>
            <li> The can be a little tricky to apply, but they aren&#x27;t THAT hard.  </li>
            <li> Usually my nails chip the day after I polish.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I usually try to keep them painted to protect them while working</li>
            <li> The cracks are small but dirt collects in the cracks and you have to focus on scrubbing it off.  </li>
            <li> I had a small tear in my thumb nail that I covered with one of these</li>
            <li> The adhesive was so weak, the product was peeling off one nail even as I was attaching them to other nails.    </li>
            <li> you wore\\&quot; which usually means</li>
            <li> got these to help reinforce my weak nails, but they were so thin and &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34; hard to control, do not last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t stick on, feels like saran wrap on your nails and peeled off within hours!  </li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t that hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Now is been over a week and my fingernails remain protected despite some hard use of them gardening.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on nail polish</li>
            <li> I never write negative reviews but had to for this one.</li>
            <li> I keep my hands out of water for at least 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Manual labor usually means no nails..not with these!  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to place them on your nails without getting little ridges.  </li>
            <li> I only put on two, and I was fed up and frustrated.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like what its done to my thin nails.</li>
            <li> While it takes some getting used to for the application, once you get that down you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Expensive for what you get.  </li>
            <li> I also found them difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> I eagerly read the directions....very vague, and proceeded to attempt to put them on my nails.</li>
            <li> If they are peeling off, then you are doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I used to get acrylic overlays but they are so expensive to keep up, the longer your nails get, that it wasn&#x27;t practical to get them anymore.  </li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> The strips are very awkward to put on, and very messy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent $6.50 on this horrible product.</li>
            <li> I think a lot of people might have given bad reviews because they applied them wrong, if you apply them correctly they will be very difficult to peel off.  </li>
            <li> and I am going to be so sad when they are gone. :(  </li>
            <li> I found it impossible to shape them at the edges with a file.  </li>
            <li> My thumbs have painful splits that travel into my nail bed.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> On the no chip color however, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am thoroughly disappointed in this product and will continue my search for a product that will give the nails I desire.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> i found them to be totally worthless.  </li>
            <li> I hate this product</li>
            <li> I was imagining friends looking at my nails and thinking \\&quot;What is that crap on her nails?\\</li>
            <li> People were talking about trimming and blow drying, very weird!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are terrible!  </li>
            <li> It is the worst product I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> I have terrible nail problems, bought this product hoping to protect my nails so they can grow without chipping.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t works, I couldn&#x27;t use, it doesn&#x27;t fit in the nails, I threw out without using it.</li>
            <li> I have used many products to try and grow my peeling nails, and I am hopeful that this may be the answer.  I put these on 2 days ago and so far no chips or peeling as mentioned by other reviewers.  Usually my nails chip the day after I polish.  If these stay on the way they are, this will allow me to grow my nails.  They do take some prep....I bought a nail buffer and buffed my nails well.  I had no problem applying and smoothing them out.  Worth a try!</li>
            <li> Pros:  Application in less than 15 minutes with zero dry time (aka go to bed or take a shower immediately after - amazing!).  No nics, creases, and more durable than using clear nail polish.  Keep my nails stronger so that they grow out.  I do a lot with my hands and these keep my nails looking freshly painted for longer.  Much shinier finish for longer than clear nail polish.    Cons:  The strips are less thick and opaque than I thought they&#x27;d be; they are still strong, but quite transparent.  The Nude color is sort of yellowish, which make my nails almost look dirty or like a smoker&#x27;s, but I am also very fair skinned with cool undertones.  I love the Sheer Shell color and there is even a bit of iridescence to it.  I bought the Sheer Blush but I have not tried it, but I am expecting to like it better than the Nude.  I pick at my nails a lot so I chose to replace at 10 days, but a non-hand-fiddler could easily get 2 weeks.    Conclusion:  I think my nails look great and they are growing out so I&#x27;m going to keep the routine up!</li>
            <li> When I saw this in the drug store I thought this was the coolest thing. I could not wait to get home and try it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not fast and easy. If you want to do it right and get the nail shield on good, it will take some time. I kept messing up and the 16 strips are not enough. (Side note: the strips were really long so I cut them in half so that I can have extra ones when I messed up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied the nail shield,it kept peeling off the edges and would not stay on. I had to hold my nail down for about a minute or 2 and then add clear nail hardener over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought the sheer shell and I love the color, it has a shimmery shine to it. The price is a little steep ($7.99 at Wallgreens, I&#x27;m sure I can find a cheaper price else where), but I will buy it again. I&#x27;ll probably get better each and every time.</li>
            <li> The strips are much thinner than they look to be in the ads. They are either too skinny to fit exactly or too wide and leave small gaps when you try to cut them to size. They are nothing more than thin decals and peel off much too easily. They also get folds and ripples on the sides when you try to smooth them out. My nails are nice and long and I have had all kinds of manicures. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I saw these in a magazine and was excited to try them out. What a waste of money! First, I think I have relatively normal-sized nails, but the strips are so big that I could only find a match to fit three of my nails on each hand. When you remove the strips, they are flimsy and flap all over the place . . . I could hardly get one on my nail using my right hand; I can&#x27;t imagine how hard it would be if I had gotten to the left (gave up after three nails). The only color the store had was sheer nude, and in my opinion it looks like plastic wrap on my finger nails. I can&#x27;t wait to take it off!</li>
            <li> These are terrible!  Hard to apply and didn&#x27;t fit the nails.  Expensive for what you get.  Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> I think people that rate this low are not reading the instructions are all.  These were so easy and fast to put on. I have very short nails and narrow and all the excess strip is easily filed away with the file they provide.  I had no problems placing them on my left hand either.  It took no time, no nasty smell and no drying time.  I love this product and cannot wait to get more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have very brittle, dry nails and working at a restaurant waitressing.  The sanitizer we use to wipe down tables decimates my nails.  I usually try to keep them painted to protect them while working but my nails still crack and chip off through the polish.  With these strips my nails stay intact and are protected during work.  I am very active so they lasted about a week before starting to peel a bit which beats regular nails polish that usually lasts 2-3 days before chipping.  I&#x27;m sure if I wasn&#x27;t so active they would last much longer.  After taking the strips off my nails have grown longer than I have had them grown in a very long time and have protected them from chipping and splitting! Fantastic for problem nails.  I will be buying more of these!    I think a lot of people might have given bad reviews because they applied them wrong, if you apply them correctly they will be very difficult to peel off.  Also it does take some time to apply them but instead of being disabled and waiting for your nails to try for 10 minutes you can stop at anytime and use your hands without worrying about smudging the polish. A++ in my book!</li>
            <li> I love the no-dry time and the lack of odor. These also don&#x27;t chip (like every other nail polish does on my nails, no matter what I try). The nude color I used was very pretty and it did look much better than the nail jobs I usually do on my own, but they started peeling around the edges a few days after I&#x27;d put them on. Could have been my error, but I&#x27;m not willing to try again because it was difficult to get the product on in the first place and more expensive than a regular sheer cover that I can do on my own.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on these because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t have the time for manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-They make my nails look nice for 7 day..14 days would really be pushing it because of growth and cracking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-They protect my nails from breaking and spliting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a very busy working mom with fragile nails.  I like my nails to look nice but have absolutely no time for manicures.  This product is great!  I can apply them in 10 minutes flat but I&#x27;m on my 4th set.  The first set was not the best but practice does make perfect!  I recommend buffing your nails first and sorting out the sizes before you start so you can just apply and file off the edges.  My favorites are sheer blush and sheer nude.  I&#x27;m not the biggest fan on sheer shell because it&#x27;s a little to shimmery for me.  The shine is amazing, however they crack instead of peeling or chipping.  The cracks are small but dirt collects in the cracks and you have to focus on scrubbing it off.  They don&#x27;t last for 14 days for me.  They only last for 7 but 7 days of nice looking nails is great for me!</li>
            <li> like others, i saw the ad for these &amp; thought i&#x27;d give them a try.  i found them to be totally worthless.  not particularly easy to apply, nearly impossible to get the right size.  i&#x27;ll stick with nail polish, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This product advertised 2 benefits..instant protection and no chip color for up to 14 days.  I believe it does deliver on protection.  I kept them on for 14 days, and I did not have one break (and my nails grow quickly, so they got quite long).  I didn&#x27;t realize how strong my nails felt until I took them off.  On the no chip color however, I was disappointed.  When doing dishes, etc, the ends wore off, just like chipping polish.  I also had pieces flake off where they had grown out by my cuticles.    The other drawback is that they are not easy to use.  It is difficult to place them on your nails without getting little ridges.  Faster than a salon manicure, sure, but they don&#x27;t look like one either.  For me, they were no faster than painting myself and waiting for the paint to dry.  I also found them difficult to remove.  They say to remove with polish remover, but doing so left a sticky residue that took a while to get off.    Overall I was pleased, and would use them again.  Just don&#x27;t expect to be chip-free for 14 days.</li>
            <li> My nails are finicky. If I don&#x27;t get a manicure every week, they peel and rip and never get terribly long. I was very excited to hear about this product and was eager to try it.    The first time I purchased this product, I found them a little difficult to apply - the strips are very delicate and can rip easily, so it does take a little practice. However, even after a less-than-perfect first application, my nails were well-protected and did not peel or rip.     By the second application, I had the technique down, and have had to file my nails TWICE because they&#x27;ve gotten too long! I think this is a fabulous product. While it takes some getting used to for the application, once you get that down you will not be disappointed. No drying time, no smell either!    I just wish they were easier to find in stores and that they came in other colors!</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to last up to 14 days, but it didn&#x27;t make it past my first shower (on the same day I applied them.)  I can&#x27;t believe this product was actually TESTED before it was sent sailing down the stream of commerce to take our money. I&#x27;m very tired of this kind of thing.</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for 15 years and now have decent natural nails,  but I hate that nail polish chips so easily with natural nails,  and when I leave them bare,  they peel and split.     This product works well.  First,  you must have clean nails.  No moisturizers or softening soaps-nothing that will leave a residue.  I did mine after a soak in the tub.  Next,  you must lightly buff the surface of the nail. I rinsed my hands again after buffing (same stuff you do to ensure maximum adhesion of nail polish.      I did the first nail and realized it would be easier to take the paper off,  but leave the clear layer on until you get the nail aligned and stuck on the nail,  then peel and smooth. It took me about 10 minutes.     File the ends well.  Any extra material will lift.     For a product with what seems like such light adhesive,  it stays pretty well. It&#x27;s been a few days with sinks of dishes, and work and they look perfect.  I only wish they had a little more color. I like a neutral nail,  but a little more pink would be nice.     I did break a nail,  but it was a pretty solid impact.  I could see how this product could protect against minor cracks and splits.</li>
            <li> Lasted until I showered (about 2 hours). Who doesn&#x27;t get wet? Very thin. Cut your own using packing tape ---they will be much heavier and you won&#x27;t care when they don&#x27;t last. Amazing these were even tested. They might be ok after a shower for a night out, but it would be so much easier (and cheaper)to just polish. Not to mention it would last through a shower.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for around $6, a little costly for a one-time use product, but I have such thin, peely nails I decided to give it a try anyway.       I found them to be fairly simple to apply, but it did take a bit of time and a lot of effort to get them on straight and looking nice. There is a pretty good selection of sizes but I didn&#x27;t think there were quite enough for me. Perhaps I just have unusually wide nails. It took me about half an hour to apply all 10.      Now that they are on, I am so pleased! I think they look just fantastic and my nails feel so strong. I had a small tear in my thumb nail that I covered with one of these and it has sealed it from peeling farther. i do wish that the strips could be folded down over the edges of the nails, but they just didn&#x27;t stick to the undersides of my nails. I have only been wearing the strips for about three days but I don&#x27;t see any peeling up on the edges, despite washing dishes and gardening without gloves. I will have to see how many days they last before being able to fully decide if they were worth the money and effort. For now though, I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by all the reviews that said these were so hard to apply. They are just like little stickers. You don&#x27;t have to trim them, just put them on and file off the excess. I did mine this morning so I don&#x27;t know how long they&#x27;ll last but they stood up to a sink full of dishes without any problem. You do need to read the very simple directions. People were talking about trimming and blow drying, very weird! Can&#x27;t be the same product. They took maybe 15 minutes to apply, but then there was no dry time and I could use the bathroom in the middle of my manicure without ruining my nails. You do need clean, buffed nails for them to stick. Mine are all chipped and peeling and so far these are sticking. It is a little pricey for 1 manicure, that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have wished for years for a product like this. These tape-like strips do exactly what they are advertised to do; strengthen nails against peeling and splitting - immediately, with no drying time required.     They stay on without chipping like nail polish, last two weeks or longer (though grow-out does encourage occasional re-application), add a nice gloss to nails with just a hint of natural color. If you prefer to lose the gloss, that&#x27;s easily accomplished by slightly roughing the surface with the buffer to leave a matte finish. When de-glossed, grow-out is virtually invisible.    It&#x27;s possible to economize if your nails are short: shields are long enough to cut in half.    These shields are almost instant. The nail does need to be \\&quot;prepped\\&quot;: clean and buffed smooth with the included buffer for effective adherence. Because I can&#x27;t tolerate the fumes from nail polishes or removers, this is a great alternative. There is some synthetic smell for the first few hours, but much milder than polish. Old strips can be removed by gently scraping them off with a fingernail, though the mfgr. does suggest using polish remover.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my nails are always peeling and I can&#x27;t get them to grow as long as I would like. I was excited when I first saw this product advertised in a magazine. I bought these with great anticipation of having nice strong nails for a change. I eagerly read the directions....very vague, and proceeded to attempt to put them on my nails. The strips are very flimsy and will tear easily if you are not very, very careful. Luckily they include a few extra pieces in the kit. I finally had them applied to all the nails......filing off the excess can also  be a bit tricky. They did make my nails stronger for the first few days, but then I noticed some peeling along the edge of the nails. Unfortunately, once the strips were removed because they looked tacky, (after only 8 days) there was no improvement in my nails in the next few weeks. I am thoroughly disappointed in this product and will continue my search for a product that will give the nails I desire.</li>
            <li> I never write negative reviews but had to for this one. It is the worst product I have ever bought! It&#x27;s not easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t stick on, feels like saran wrap on your nails and peeled off within hours!  I bought it because I have a toddler and the package claimed it&#x27;s quick and easy for people who don&#x27;t have time for manicures. What a joke! You have to trim each shield to fit, peel the very stubborn tape off, carefully apply and rub your nails for several minutes each to move the air bubbles out- all after already having filed, buffed and pushed back the cuticles. Furthermore, despite following direction exactly, the shields just would not stick on till I blow dried them and applied 2 coats of polish on top and blow dried again. Then the whole thing peeled off in a few hours but not before I went to my party with uneven, crackly looking nails. Total time invested to get nails that were done by a child- 1 hour 20 minutes!  I would have had better results if I had just put on polish, even while balancing a toddler in my lap!</li>
            <li> These nail shields were great!  The can be a little tricky to apply, but they aren&#x27;t THAT hard.  I was surprised by how many negative reviews there were.  If you apply them correctly, they are wonderful and will not peel off.  If they are peeling off, then you are doing something wrong.  Either your nail wasn&#x27;t clean, or maybe you were touching the adhesive side of the nail strip.  If you touch it, or put it on your nail and then lift it off to reposition it, it won&#x27;t adhere properly.  You have to drop it on your nail in one motion and then smooth it out.  It will look a bit crinkly at first, but it smooths out.  It&#x27;s like the adhesive has to set.  I think people are getting bad results because they lift it up and try to smooth it more.  That isn&#x27;t necessary.  If it is on right, all you have to do is apply pressure and then wait a few minutes and the crinkly look is gone and it will not peel off.    Then you file the top of the nail to file off the excess.  If you have some excess on the edges of your nail, you can go around the edges with the nail stick very gently several times and it will remove it.  These do last fourteen days, but they won&#x27;t be perfect.  For one thing, there is a space at the cuticle where your nail has grown out, and also the edges do wear off.  You can make them last there longest by putting a clear coat of polish on top.   I found that applying the polish right after application made the nails look bubbly, but that went away after a day.  I now wait a few hours before applying the clear polish on top.  Sometimes I use the Sally Hansen french manicure pen to apply white tips to them.  It seems to work fine as long as you seal it with clear polish.  I even wash dishes and clean in them and they still last.  I just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, and I wish it worked better.  By the time I got six of them on, thereby starting to use the first hand to apply and shape the second hand, the nails on the first hand (now being used as tools) started lumping up and peeling around the edges.  I found it impossible to shape them at the edges with a file.  I could do it with nail scissors on the left hand (using the right hand to cut), but since I can&#x27;t make scissors work with my left hand (at least on such an intricate operation), I was stuck with ragged edges on the sixth nail (first one on the right hand).  I peeled them all off (they came off easily, although the instructions say to remove them with polish remover - perhaps they adhere more tightly after more time has elapsed) and went back to my clear nail hardener/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  It goes on easy if you go slow and take your time, but 45 minutes later mine was peeling off.</li>
            <li> Manual labor usually means no nails..not with these!  I can actually have nice nails!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent $6.50 on this horrible product. The strips are very awkward to put on, and very messy. Little scraps of plastic and paper everywhere. I only put on two, and I was fed up and frustrated. The strips are very thin and you can see right through them, and the color I got (sheer shell) was shimmery, which I didn&#x27;t like at all. The strips started to peel at the corners almost immediately after I put them on. I hate this product and I&#x27;m very disappointed. There&#x27;s nothing good I can say about them, and I wish I would have spent my money on a bottle of nail polish that I&#x27;d get more than one use out of.</li>
            <li> Loved them and am surprised at the negative reviews. The product wasn&#x27;t that hard to put on. By the second day any bubbles/kinks had worked out of the sheilds, and I had a hard, tough, shiny coating on my nails. It looks just like a polish but doesn&#x27;t chip. I might actually be able to grow my nails.</li>
            <li> I have terrible nail problems, bought this product hoping to protect my nails so they can grow without chipping.  The adhesive was so weak, the product was peeling off one nail even as I was attaching them to other nails.    The edges and corners  all kept lifting off.    So I washed my hands thoroughly and used the remnants and they stuck.  I guess I had lotion on my fingernails.  The  product worked great.  Now is been over a week and my fingernails remain protected despite some hard use of them gardening.  And the are actually starting to grow.  I  get some moderate chipping, but still they are growing better than before.       I plan to use this product again hoping my fingernails will continue to grow to a reasonable length.  Its been a long time since I&#x27;ve  had fingernails without all of them chipping and peeling.</li>
            <li> I just started using the nail shields and am impressed. The shields now on my nails have been there for 2 weeks and still look very nice. What I really like about them is no more smearing, and I travel a lot, so these will be easy to take with me on personal and business trips...no hassles with TSA at the airport. I will be curious to see how long my nails grow using the shields. I have very strong nails that grow well, but when the tips grow to about half inch, my nails begin to painfully break below the nail line. I am hoping the shields will protect my nails and allow them to grow a little bit longer. I also hope that Sally Hansen will offer them in more colors.</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with all of the Sally Hansen nail strips and these are one of my favorites!  They sheer color is very pretty and great for work. My nails have always split and broken easily and these stop that completely.  They easily last for more than a week when regular polish would start to chip within two days for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my tips for making them work for you:&lt;br /&gt;1. Push back your cuticles, file the ends and buff the surface of your nails, wipe them down with a good nail polish remover to get any lotion or oils off and let them dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. Select a strip for the nail.  It doesn&#x27;t matter at all that it&#x27;s too long or even if it&#x27;s too wide.&lt;br /&gt;3. Rub the strip between your hands to warm it up (this makes it softer and easier to apply)&lt;br /&gt;4. Peel off the plastic, then peel the polish strip off the paper.&lt;br /&gt;5. Place the strip on your nail lining up the bottom first and pull a little over the end so that you give it a little stretch as you lay it down.  Fold the end down and tuck it under the tip of your nail with your other nail or the orange wood stick.&lt;br /&gt;6. Press the entire strip down firmly with your fingers and rub it with the flat part of the stick.  Pay special attention to the sides.&lt;br /&gt;7. File along the tip of your nail and press the orange stick into any side pieces so you can separate it from the nail before peeling it off your skin.&lt;br /&gt;8. Try not to get your hands too wet for several hours after you apply them.  I think water is their enemy until they&#x27;re fully dry and water doesn&#x27;t seem to bother them after the first day. Otherwise, you can go about your regular business and they won&#x27;t smudge or chip.&lt;br /&gt;9. Sit back and admire your gorgeous nails that last many days longer than even a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after seeing the Sephora chic print for nails by opi. They are less than half the cost of the sephora.  As a sales rep, my hands are visible at all times, and I thought this was a good option for a manicure-free manicure.  I tend to keep my nails short and like minimal color.  I purchased the sheer shell.  I really like the look, and will update my review after I have had these on for a while.  I think I will buy a couple extra next time!!</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this product. Took over an hour to apply. Not enough small sizes and too wide for my nails. Followed directions carefully and still would not stick properly. Left ragged edges. had to remove soon after applying. Waste of money although good idea - it just doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work. I think you have to make sure your nails are absolutely clean, and use the buffer side of the nail file first. Maybe that will help. They were easy to put on - I had to cut a few of the strips to get the right width. The nail looked good, except for the side edges of my nails, which didn&#x27;t seem to adhere correctly. Also, try to avoid the cuticle area when you put them on. Maybe with a little refining it will be a great product.</li>
            <li> These last slightly longer, with less chipping and better gloss than the other polish strips.  Great for growing out winter brittle nails.  Please note, 1 - these are very sheer, 2 - apply before bed so the strips fully harden overnight.  These won&#x27;t get bed sheet indents like regular polish, but they are somewhat soft for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish this line had a french manicure version like Incoco.  These are a bit more durable and the gloss is nice.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these strips. I used to buy another brand (Incoco) and these seem to be made by the same manufacturer. they are MUCH better though. for some reason the 14 day shield really grips the nail surface much better and creates a stronger nail overall.     I buy the best polishes on the market and still have peeling issues. If I am not using the strips under my liquid nail polish then the liquid stuff comes off in less than 24 hours. sometimes in as little as an hour! and that&#x27;s another thing. I just stock up on these and then do whatever fun polish painting I was to do OVER it.     I have very moist (tear super easy) thin nails. without nail polish  my nails are constantly tearing on the sides because they bend so much. with the strips they are so much stronger. I add a couple coats of Seche Vite fast drying top coat and they are even stronger. For the first time in my life I have long beautiful nails even the nail techs (when I got in for a pedicure only now) are jealous of!    I can also get two applications out of one package. I use one end for one nail and the other end for the same nail on the other hand. takes a little practice but worth it for the price of these babies!    Tip: I&#x27;ve found that washing/drying my hands and then lightly sanding the top of your nails with make the strips adhere even better. it gets rid of ALL oils on your nails. also use a soft cloth (t-shirt tail works good) and smooth the nail strip onto your nail bed with light pressure, then file edges off. resmooth if needed.</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered this item. Now I am able to keep my nails protected and looking great all the time.</li>
            <li> These nail shields have a subtle appearance, but give a beautiful finish to my nails with minimal effort and clean-up.</li>
            <li> While I did not have the application problems that many other negative reviewers had, I found the performance results of this product to be extremely disappointing. I work with my hands and a typical manicure lasts about three days before the tips start to chip. The \\&quot;14 Day Nail Shield\\&quot; did not last even one entire day before the tips were completely chipped off all my nails. Sally Hansen Hard As Wraps lasts longer, protects my nails better, and is far easier to remove.  The one positive aspect to this product is that the finish is nearly instant. You don&#x27;t have to worry about drying time at all, though there is an strong, unpleasant odor. I think that if you need an emergency manicure that only needs to look good for a few hours, the Nail Shield strips will do the trick. For any other purpose, they just are not worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Saw an ad for this in a magazine and thought it would be great to try.  Got it at Target.  Took me 30 minutes to apply.  The end of nail edges would not stay put even though I followed the directions.  Tried to redo the ends but had no luck getting it to look nice!  Ends started peeling off within the hour.  The nail section stayed on well but the edges would not.  Took it off after a few days with nail polish remover.  That would not get them off.  Had to use a wash cloth and my own finger nails to scrub this mess off.  Sooo....I would NOT try this again!!  Seemed like a cool idea but was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are great--I am on week 2 of my 2nd set and my nails have never looked better! I normally don&#x27;t have time for salon manicures (think 3-4 times a year) and don&#x27;t usually even bother with nail polish at all since, thanks to my preschooler, my hands take a beating and polish chips almost immediately. Guess what, these strips don&#x27;t chip! With time, they will rub off a little at the ends, but honestly, wearing Sheer Shell, I can&#x27;t even tell unless I hold my nails up to my face. When it&#x27;s time to remove, DO NOT peel them off--use regular polish remover like the instructions recommend. The strips adhere to your nails, and peeling them off takes the top layer(s) of your nails with them, making your nails weaker in the long run.</li>
            <li> The strips didnt adhere to the nail well at all.  I was imagining friends looking at my nails and thinking \\&quot;What is that crap on her nails?\\&quot;  Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I was away from home and so I found it on amazon.  Happy girl was I for sure to not do without.</li>
            <li> Good protection - after application I keep my hands out of water for at least 30 minutes.  The shields last for more than two weeks - even through house cleaning, dishes, etc.</li>
            <li> I love the look of acrylic and gel but I don&#x27;t like what its done to my thin nails. :-( The 14 Day shield does exactly what its supposed to do and more! My nails were supported and nourished, and I noticed that the surface had improved after the first two week application. And YES, it did last two weeks. I was able to cover two nails from one strip. I *did* apply a base coat, two coats of color and a top coat over the shields. Nail enamel lasts longer, too! Hint: if your nails split like mine, a double shield works. My thumbs have painful splits that travel into my nail bed. By doubling the application, I&#x27;ve arrested the chronic splitting! Edited to say that ESSIE is a better product.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have to give this product a 4 out of 5 stars.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get five is because I think it&#x27;s been discontinued or something.  I went to Sally Hansen&#x27;s website and it&#x27;s listed under \\&quot;if you wore\\&quot; which usually means discontinued.:( So anyway, on to the review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips are the truth.  They are like an instant nail wrap. They are not super sticky, but I don&#x27;t think they are supposed to be.  They have just enough adhesive for you to get the right positioning on your natural nail, then they adhere really well over a day.  I put a top coat on mine and I am on day three and they look great! I used to get acrylic overlays but they are so expensive to keep up, the longer your nails get, that it wasn&#x27;t practical to get them anymore.  Plus, that acrylic smell is just ugh.  Anyway, I bought two packs of these at a dept store on clearance and I was so impressed, I went back and got three more boxes.  They weren&#x27;t marked in the second store I went in but rang up the same clearance price.  I now have four boxes and I am going to be so sad when they are gone. :(  I hope Amazon still has them when I run out.  I am wearing the sheer blush one right now but I bought two of the sheer nude as well.  They give a \\&quot;hint\\&quot; of color which is great.  Also,I think once another week or two passes, I will paint over them w/regular polish instead of removing them. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s taken my nails from horrid to presentable. I recently got a job in a jewelry store, and this product made it possible. I use a non-Acetone product to remove every 10 days of so, before I reapply.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow my nails, they&#x27;re weak and break very easily.  I&#x27;ve tried multiple products and nail polishes to try to strengthen them but nothing has worked.  I also have a problem with keeping any type of polish on my nails.  It always chips off within a day or two leaving my nails looking messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen 14 Day Nail Shield has made a huge difference for me.  My nails are actually growing without any major breaks.  I may never have long nails but now I may at least have nails that I don&#x27;t have to file down to the bed due to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t have the problem of chipping anymore which is amazing to me.  The Nail Shields stay on and look good for at least 14 days or maybe longer.  If you have a problem with them staying on, you need to be more diligent when applying them.  Make sure your nails are clean and dry (I wipe mine off with an alcohol pad before applying) and use the orange stick that comes with them to press them down firmly along the sides and cuticle.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have a blast using these.  They&#x27;re so easy and they look nice, plus they don&#x27;t damage the nail the way acrylic nail products do.  And to trim, just gently brush the edges with a nail file.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great for protecting nails&lt;br /&gt;Will get more&lt;br /&gt;My nails are long and strong&lt;br /&gt;Stay on for the two weeks or more</li>
            <li> These nail shields protect fragile split prone nails, as well as looking good.  They are easy to apply, and fairly durable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy from this seller&lt;br /&gt;Was not even in the packaging like it should have been pieces missing&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stick to the nail at all had to just throw away not going to send back would cost more to send back&lt;br /&gt;Looked lie it was something someone else sent back</li>
            <li> I have found that the 14 day nail shield really works. For the first time in my life, I have beautiful nails that I have manicured myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my nails. They split and crack easily.  I&#x27;m hard on nail polish so I&#x27;m lucky if it lasts 2 days let alone two weeks.  I don&#x27;t particularly like having a salon manicure for a number of reasons and don&#x27;t care for the look of fake nails.  I especially do not want to soak my fingers in acetone for a long period of time to get the nail polish off (which is needed for some types of nail treatments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found out about using this product.  First, the hard work is in the preparation, but that is true for any manicure.  Excluding the prep, the first time it&#x27;s applied, it will probably take 20-30 minutes.  But once you&#x27;re used to the product, it can take 10 minutes or less. I trim the edges with my fingernail and the wooden gadget provided with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use clear (European Secrets Rock Top Coat) over it because my nails split so easily, but this isn&#x27;t really necessary. If the clear needs to be refreshed, I can use nail polish remover to smooth it out and skim a little off just the top coat, then polish with clear again.  It lasts well and can last up to two weeks, the only problem being that the nails grow and there&#x27;s a gap between the cuticle and nail - but that&#x27;s true of any manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, Sally Hansen.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED,  AND FOUND IT WITH OTHER ITEMS I WANTED.  GREAT PRODUCTS AND SERVICE ! I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF HOW &amp;#34;WORDY&amp;#34; I WANT TO BE IN ABLE TO POST FYI !!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had very weak/thin problem nails my entire life.  I love the look of well-manicured nails and it can be so expensive to maintain them.  I have found these shields to be an answer to my prayers.  It takes a bit of patience to apply, but becomes easier with each application.  They always last at least 1 1/2 to 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ve found that a couple coats of clear top coat will keep them looking nice as long as 3 weeks after application.  Love the \\&quot;Sheer Blush\\&quot; shade for a nice natural look.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> got these to help reinforce my weak nails, but they were so thin and &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34; hard to control, do not last.</li>
            <li> What I received was clearly very old and there was discoloration on the part of the product that could be seen through the window of the box where it had been exposed to light for a very long time. Returned and got my money back.</li>
            <li> I bought this shield to protect my nails from polish. First, the smell of the shield is too strong, like sharp odor. Second, after polishing 5 minutes later, the surface of the shield is not flat any more. So many tiny bubbles appear on it made my nails so ugly. It&#x27;s a great idea, but need to be improved much. I won&#x27;t buy second time.</li>
