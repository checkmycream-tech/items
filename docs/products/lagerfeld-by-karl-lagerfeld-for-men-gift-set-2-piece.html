            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon , you made my search easy and my husband happy.</li>

            <li>Favorite men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this before and my husband and I both love</li>
            <li>My husband and I love the fragance.  </li>
            <li>Glad to know I can get it online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lagerfeld for many years.</li>
            <li>Love my Lagrefeld.  </li>
            <li>Ladies want to hug me so they can get a better smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this smells on my husband.</li>
            <li>It is not as rich in the scent when you put it on compared to bottles I had 10-15 years ago, but is still a very satisfying fragrance that keeps its original aroma.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After receiving this, my husband now uses this as his primary go-to cologne &amp; has received many compliments on its scent.  </li>
            <li>Still, this set was very affordable and met my expectations for a good price.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I have been able to find it on Amazon, as my local department stores no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li>This men&#x27;s fragrance is refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The kit was not only a great bargain, but arrived before the estimated time.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy its fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great traditional scent for men in original box.  </li>
            <li>Not the original item.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pleasant enough for his taste.  </li>
            <li>I remember how sweet my father smelled every time he wore this</li>
            <li>I use Lagerfeld AfterShave consistantly for many years and hope to continue to do so at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with this product :-).</li>
            <li>color is much lighter (a bright orange compared to the original dark brownish-red hue), and the bottle made of a more lightweight glass than it used to be.</li>
            <li>This is the only cologne my dad wears and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available online because it is not found in any stores that I could find.</li>
            <li>Well worth its value.  </li>
            <li>I’ve always felt that the classic versions of all designer fragrances tend to be much better than their modern incarnations.</li>
            <li>A real win-win here!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>We have been married for 53 years, and this is one of the \\&quot;little\\&quot; things that count.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance for my significant other.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery, still high price,</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or overpowering but instead draws you in with its refined, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s pretty much off the market.</li>
            <li>The bottles are large and generous.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all that really matters.</li>
            <li>Got here fast.</li>
            <li>This woodsey scent is deep with soft notes that are refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have been using Karl Lagerfeld Classic fragrance for years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I feel that the aftershave and maybe even the cologne were older stock, I&#x27;ve been wearing Lagerfeld for over 20years</li>
            <li>I am an old fan of Lagerfeld,this really met my needs.</li>
            <li>A terrific present for a father or older brother, this classic scent is light and powdery but in a masculine way.  </li>
            <li>I order this for my brother  in New Orleans.  </li>
            <li>It will last all day long and regardless of the temperature around you it will never be too strong or too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only caveat I have about it is that even though it maintains its original essence, it has been diluted a bit from the way it used to be back in the 80’s when I started to wear it then.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I can find it at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>This is the only fragerance that is highly recognized by individuals and I have never found anyone that did not compliment me on the fragerance.</li>
            <li>but if it is the only way I can get the AfterShave at such a reasonable price then I will take both.</li>
            <li>I have been using Lagerfield since the  first year of introduction in the late 70&#x27;s and have continued using it even though today it is becoming more difficult to obtain, especially the after shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I do recommend it versus so many other similar versions from other designers.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve only (and only very occasionally) used &#x27;after shave&#x27; after dragging a real razor across my face every morning.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Been using it for years and have always purchased locally. Will purchase again and advise other to do the same.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Lagerfeld for Men when my husband was in need of replacement Obsession for Men cologne.  I remember how sweet my father smelled every time he wore this &amp; I remembered how wonderful my husband smelled when he used it after my dad passed.  After receiving this, my husband now uses this as his primary go-to cologne &amp; has received many compliments on its scent.  Will definitely be reordering shortly.</li>
            <li> I use Lagerfeld AfterShave consistantly for many years and hope to continue to do so at a reasonable price.  I do not need the spray but if it is the only way I can get the AfterShave at such a reasonable price then I will take both.</li>
            <li> The smell of the Lagerfeld last longer and I bought for my relatives and friends. I am sure they too will love.</li>
            <li> This is a one of a kind smell and has been for years.</li>
            <li> karl lagerfeild is one of my favourite perfumes,the last time i used it was like ten years ago when my brother bought it for me from france</li>
            <li> A terrific present for a father or older brother, this classic scent is light and powdery but in a masculine way.  It is not heavy or overpowering but instead draws you in with its refined, clean scent.  The duo comes with a hefty 4.2 ounce spray cologne and 4.2 ounce aftershave.  A real win-win here!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong when it comes to Karl Lagerfeld!</li>
            <li> I feel that the aftershave and maybe even the cologne were older stock, I&#x27;ve been wearing Lagerfeld for over 20years and I feel the scent was weak on both.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve only (and only very occasionally) used &#x27;after shave&#x27; after dragging a real razor across my face every morning. I never use actual cologne.  The concept of men always dragging a razor across skin and then slathering alcohol onto the raw skin has always struck me as approaching self-mutilation...etc.  Well I have found Lagerfeld&#x27;s After Shave tolerable years ago, and finally run out (after probably 7-8 years using the same bottle), and looking for replacement discovered they want $80 or so!  Saw this 2-pack - of which I will never use the actual spray cologne squirter - for half that price and I bought it.  Quick delivery, still high price, but it&#x27;s a &#x27;name&#x27; product. And the $40 price was OK.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice set.  The bottles are large and generous.  It smells really good on my man too.  Love it!</li>
            <li> LIKE THE LONG LASTING FRAGANCE WITH THESE AFTER SHAVE GIFT SET. VERY HAPPY WITH THIS QUALITY PRODUCT AND WILL BUY AGAIN FROM THIS SELER.</li>
            <li> Lagerfeld has been one of my favorites for years. However, it&#x27;s pretty much off the market. Still, this set was very affordable and met my expectations for a good price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lagerfield since the  first year of introduction in the late 70&#x27;s and have continued using it even though today it is becoming more difficult to obtain, especially the after shave. This is the only fragerance that is highly recognized by individuals and I have never found anyone that did not compliment me on the fragerance. Thank you for providing these gift packs for me to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Glenn Irelan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lagerfeld for years.  Amazon is the only place I can find it at a decent price.  You cant beat this.</li>
            <li> Favorite men&#x27;s cologne.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> I’ve always felt that the classic versions of all designer fragrances tend to be much better than their modern incarnations. Lagerfeld is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is a very unique and subtle scent that may be used for both dressy or casual wear. The only caveat I have about it is that even though it maintains its original essence, it has been diluted a bit from the way it used to be back in the 80’s when I started to wear it then. Unfortunately it seems to be something very common these days, be it fragrances, beverages, sauces, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The color is much lighter (a bright orange compared to the original dark brownish-red hue), and the bottle made of a more lightweight glass than it used to be. It is not as rich in the scent when you put it on compared to bottles I had 10-15 years ago, but is still a very satisfying fragrance that keeps its original aroma.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I do recommend it versus so many other similar versions from other designers. It will last all day long and regardless of the temperature around you it will never be too strong or too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether as a final touch while wearing a nice suit, or just as a casual scent in your polo and jeans, you won’t go wrong with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me the Lagerfeld. I like it and will buy again. (Maybe I will encourage her to buy again!)</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband birthday, who stated that he would like to find one of the best men cologne he has worn but haven&#x27;t seen on the market for sometime. Thank you Amazon , you made my search easy and my husband happy. (great price for the gift set.)</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner.  Smells great on my man!</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne my dad wears and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available online because it is not found in any stores that I could find.</li>
            <li> I thought the after shave in this set was the Lagerfeld Balm.  But for the great price was happy with my purchase...the product is one of my favorites!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my order, it&#x27;s still one of the best.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and my husband and I both love it.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again when he runs out.</li>
            <li> Not the original item.The ingredients have been changed</li>
            <li> This cologne has been difficult to find in department stores for some time.  My husband and I love the fragance.  Glad to know I can get it online.</li>
            <li> I thought the price for the purchase was great. I am an old fan of Lagerfeld,this really met my needs.</li>
            <li> I order this for my brother  in New Orleans.  This is the only fragrance that agrees with his sensitivity to odors that&#x27;s pleasant enough for his taste.  He would not wear any fragrance that would repel women!  That said, The women seem to like it on him.  It works for him.  He won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I still get compliments on the fragrence. I&#x27;ve been using Lagerfeld for many years. My wife loves it! That&#x27;s all that really matters. ;)</li>
            <li> I have ordered quite a lot of this from Amazon, not only for myself, but for other&#x27;s that smell it and want it. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in retail shops and their price are outrageous. This is the real thing at a great price! 5+ STARS!</li>
            <li> I have been using Karl Lagerfeld Classic fragrance for years and really like it.  I am so happy that I have been able to find it on Amazon, as my local department stores no longer carry it.  Plus, the price for this set is excellent!</li>
            <li> Great traditional scent for men in original box.  I bought this as a gift for my husband and he was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Get this for your man it is a unbelievable  smell I can&#x27;t get enough of this I&#x27;ve tried other even more expensive one s but it out does everyone</li>
            <li> Love my Lagrefeld.  Have used it for years and always get compliments about how good I smell.  Ladies want to hug me so they can get a better smell.  I accommodate them of course.</li>
            <li> This is the only after shave lotion that my wife likes.  I used it for about 20 years and then stopped about two years ago {it&#x27;s expensive}, plus it was hard to find in our local stores. I found it on Amazon, and my wife comments on how well she likes it every time I use it. We have been married for 53 years, and this is one of the \\&quot;little\\&quot; things that count.</li>
            <li> It is actual Lagerfeld.  Not a knock off.  Smells great, and at a pretty good price. Makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance for my significant other.  I have loved it for over 30 years because it excites me.</li>
            <li> The kit was not only a great bargain, but arrived before the estimated time. This vendor was very good. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells on my husband.</li>
            <li> This men&#x27;s fragrance is refreshing and clean. Not over powering. This woodsey scent is deep with soft notes that are refreshing. I&#x27;m very please with this product :-).</li>
            <li> Great value! Got here fast. If only someone had the after shave balm and stick deoderant. The Classic is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Well worth its value.  I would choose the same product again for it fits me and I enjoy its fragrance.</li>
