            <li>Works as good as it did the day</li>
            <li>Not as good as I hoped .</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>It has been doing a great job on keeping my feet smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rectangle shape fits nicely in your hand to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color of the stone is nice.</li>
            <li>The string is nice for hanging it up as well.</li>
            <li>Nice size.</li>
            <li>awesome for craked feet came fast.</li>
            <li>Could have been more coarser but good quality still.</li>
            <li>Nice pumice stone with the handy tie.</li>
            <li>With a good price, what more could you want?</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to hold and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used by far.</li>
            <li>First use was great.</li>
            <li>But this, along with a good moisturizer, has done a good job overall of keeping my hands in good shape.</li>
            <li>and It broke it was very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I used it and it didn&#x27;t break any more.</li>
            <li>More sand  fell off the store than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it again.</li>
            <li>I saw versions of the pumice stone being sold on a handle, I think this stick without the handle is better.</li>
            <li>Glad to find these again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pumice stone on a string, what more do you need?  </li>
            <li>Invest in a more quality pumice stone.</li>
            <li>love love love it</li>
            <li>Since the stone works great, I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>i just love things like this a most have for all  to have.</li>
            <li>My heels are softer and smoother and look much better.</li>
            <li>, I received the package much faster than I anticipated and the product was in great condition when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I can say that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Simple design, works perfectly.</li>
            <li>but it seems to work better on the sink because of that and works just as well as others for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li>Better than what you could get at the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>feet looked and felt completely smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>The stone no longer provided a pedicure-like scrub, but more like felt like stone on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>What more do you expect?</li>
            <li>One of the best uses, besides keeping my feet smooth, toilet bowls ring free, is to get pet hair out of the carpeting/mat in the car!!  </li>
            <li>It would work perfectly for any other purpose a pumice stone might come in handy for.</li>
            <li>This item is exactly what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li>These by Diane are very fine-grained, smooth pumice stones that work beautifully.</li>
            <li>works great do not use on normal skin on you feet</li>
            <li>This item is a handy size, and the right coarseness for many uses.</li>
            <li>Best used after a shower when your hands are hot and soft from the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the rectangular shape, which is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and seems to hold up well.</li>
            <li>it broke easily while unwrapping it.</li>
            <li>Easy yo use.</li>
            <li>Will break easily if you drop it.</li>
            <li>4 stars because it&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li>The size works fine for using on feet</li>
            <li>it works fine</li>
            <li>Cheap product broke into 3 pieces upon opening from package.  </li>
            <li>The size and shape of the brush is great for specified personal use</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;pumice&amp;#34; stone felt like it had a smooth surface and does not exfoliate well.</li>
            <li>It is about as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>if it wasn&#x27;t so cheap I would have returned it.</li>
            <li>This is about as cheap as you&#x27;d expect based on the price.</li>
            <li>Got my feet smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and does the job, but broke into two after one drop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like rubbing your feet with a smooth rock.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a cheap pumice stone and this one fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Works just like regular pumice and is a great deal.</li>
            <li>I use it lightly on underarms to prevent ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>The tie is convenient, too - this makes it easier to hang the stone on my shower head shelf or any sort of hanger you have available in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, clean, and with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I had to clean pumice off of my counter.</li>
            <li>arrived relatively quickly, given that prime 2 day shipping wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>I use it on my to scrub off dead skin and it works great, and my feet seem to be in much better shape.  </li>
            <li>The cord is nice if you intend to hang it in the shower and so far it has been working well.</li>
            <li>Finally, I really like that the edges are squared rather than rounded like most pumise stones.</li>
            <li>Natural and nice.</li>
            <li>its worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li>The tie idea is a good touch to a product that is otherwise the same regardless of who manufactures it.</li>
            <li>It does an okay job, but I kind of feel like it&#x27;s wearing down very quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t looked at other pumice stones, but this one works great.  </li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get a good one.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and shipped quickly, so there&#x27;s that, too.</li>
            <li>The value is good, but this is a commodity item, other similar products may be as good.</li>
            <li>Very brittle and falls apart easily.</li>
            <li>It was rectangular, pumice, and on top of that had a classy tie!</li>
            <li>Scrub your feet and then they feel soft! :)</li>
            <li>Great for those days when your feet need a little TLC.</li>
            <li>Works really well for pampering yourself and keeping your feet smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price….</li>
            <li>worth them money.</li>
            <li>and this thing smoothed them right out.  </li>
            <li>Broke right away.</li>
            <li>My guess is that it broke during shipping, but I&#x27;d hope that if they were selling a product online, they&#x27;d do well to make sure it withstands general shipment.</li>
            <li>Super simple product and a super easy to use this.</li>
            <li>This pumice stone is a joke, it doesn&#x27;t clean very well (for pumice stone), and it broke the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Always in need of a new pumice stone, and this one fit the bill.</li>
            <li>This pumice stone had absolutely everything I could ask for in a pumice stone, and was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little rougher, but it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>These pumice stones can help keep heels and elbows soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Be aware</li>
            <li>The first one I received was cracked.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>But this thing worked readily and got 100% of whatever the stain was -- OUT!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a good job of removing dead skin.</li>
            <li>This is a decent price for a pumice stone, it&#x27;s got a nice open structure that really helps to scrape the callous off your heels.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time about two months ago and it successfully scrubbed my feet free from excess dead skin, especially on my heels.</li>
            <li>First, the price is among the most reasonable for a similar product.</li>
            <li>They are large, as described by the seller, and do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice the price is considerably higher today, and there are other similar products.</li>
            <li>Better than they have looked or felt in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also very strong, and does not look like it will break anytime in the near future.  </li>
            <li>While I would purchase these again, before doing so, I&#x27;d verify pricing, to be certain of value.</li>
            <li>not only it removed the sediment, it was fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The pores are smaller, which allows you smoothly remove the callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smooth feet, finally!</li>
            <li>Went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li>But it works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>The pumice stone is too coarse and doesn&#x27;t smooth out the skin.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s all I really need to say.</li>
            <li>just doing a whole lot a movement for a whole lot of nothing.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>Pumice stone doesn&#x27;t really vary from one product to another, and it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Works very well and shipped within the allotted time.</li>
            <li>very easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>stone worked PERFECTLY on my very calloused heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is bigger, nicer looking, and works MUCH better than the Natural Sierra Pumice Stone.  </li>
            <li>Not much to say here beyond this is a good price for a simple pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>Wow, it just pulls it right out</li>
            <li>This one is a great shape and big enough to keep your hands out of the toilet.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and it keeps my feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t know that you can use a pumice stone to clean the stains on your toilet that won&#x27;t come off with any other product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far it works great</li>
            <li>so far mine have been great, they have done their job, they havent crumbled away or broken a bunch like some people have had happen, and i have NOT been gentle with them</li>
            <li>USE THIS TO CLEAN YOUR TOILET BOWL.</li>
            <li>decent pumice stone</li>
            <li>are so very soft!  </li>
            <li>Put them with your cleaning supplies, they work great removing hard water deposits from  toilet bowls and can also be used to remove rust and rust stains.</li>
            <li>It came just as expected and works fine.</li>
            <li>It allows a little more precision and grit on touch to reach places, like the sides of my toes.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little bit more porous</li>
            <li>Great long lasting pumice stone to keep those rough summer feet staying soft.</li>
            <li>Assuming this isn&#x27;t normal.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth shipping it back to return it.</li>
            <li>It came wrapped in plastic and as i began to unwrap it the top part with the hole for the loop to go through completely separated from the bottom half.</li>
            <li>That one lasted only 3 uses before it broke right in 2 and is now falling apart.  </li>
            <li>This must be why they call it a &amp;#34;Rectangular Pumice Stone with Tie.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m convinced this will usher in a new era of pumice stones.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for a new type of pumice stone.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new pumice stone</li>
            <li>exactly as described, still holding up today almost a year later.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine,  deducted one star, because it broke in half as I was removing the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Makes you soo soft.!</li>
            <li>the pumice stone started to wear down and smooth out.</li>
            <li>the cheap price, less than 1 dollars, and it has a rope that you can put in the shower you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li>Opened clear package and the diane rectangular pumice stone with tie was in three pieces.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, but it works to smooth the foot, especially the heals.</li>
            <li>This item arrived as expected, not broken or with way too much packaging.</li>
            <li>Some are too soft.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work really well with continued daily use.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old stepped in  </li>
            <li>I opened it up, and it broke into about a dozen pieces, and just crumbles when you touch it, completely unusable.</li>
            <li>B000HZ9L8K Natural Sierra Pumice Stone]])</li>
            <li>will buy more from u at a late date.</li>
            <li>the plastic package seemed whole, but when you open it, it was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>used it one time and it completely removed my callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is keeping my feet soft and free of dead skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried a large number of toilet cleaners trying to remove these rings.</li>
            <li>Some is too porus and breaks down quickly as you use it.  </li>
            <li>and it breaks down quickly (for a pumice stone).  </li>
            <li>It works fine but is quite brittle; every time I use it, small bits would break off.</li>
            <li>Kind of small and not as course as expected.</li>
            <li>This stone was packaged in shrink wrap inside of a hanging retail-style package, and that package was inside a small box filled with packing peanuts.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday, usually only three times a week or so, but it&#x27;s enough to keep my feet healthy.</li>
            <li>The pumice  stone is strong and hard.</li>
            <li>Clean down the middle.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stone and they are hard to find, so I bought several.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for dry feet and calluses.</li>
            <li>effective.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong for the price, I assure you that you get much more than you paid for!</li>
            <li>It is a little softer and more crumbly than other pumice stones I have used</li>
            <li>came as expected, it&#x27;s pretty huge, like my hand length, and I&#x27;m a girl, so lets keep that in mind what I mean with hand</li>
            <li>You get better leverage by holding on to the stick itself and you can change the grip as you need to use it at different angles to get under the rim or other odd angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than the fact that it was broken in half when it got here, I lost a good portion of the stone on the first use.</li>
            <li>at the same time, and the Natural Sierra Pumice stone barely works at all.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see this item was larger than I was expecting so it is easier to hold than some tinier pumice stones.</li>
            <li>This product works very well on my rough heels.    </li>
            <li>Even though I was using both sides, the surface was not nearly as rough.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this actually works!</li>
            <li>This is my first pumice stone, so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal or not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I&#x27;m not overly inconvenienced by this, as I bought this product to clean my toilet, but for potential buyers wanting to buy for actual exfoliation purposes, consider your purchase carefully.</li>
            <li>Cracked in half the first time I tried it .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this was broken long before they shipped this item due to the nature of the damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one lasted me for about 4 months on semi-weekly uses before it cracked down the middle</li>
            <li>I was at Kmart and found almost the exact same thing for a couple dollars less.</li>
            <li>So hard to find in the drugstores now, and many of the Amazon pumice stones being offered are coarse with rough edges.</li>
            <li>I really feel like it doesn&#x27;t do much to smooth out my feet (which really aren&#x27;t bad to start out with.</li>
            <li>If the callus is too large, I still need to trim it down first (and usually resort to nail clippers for that...).</li>
            <li>But it took less than 10 minutes to completely remove all the nastiness completely.</li>
            <li>The stone itself is a little bit rougher to the touch than the ones I&#x27;ve seen in the stores, which I really like because I feel like it gets the job done easier and</li>
            <li>Came in a clear plastic with a crack in the center.</li>

            <li> Nice pumice stone with the handy tie.</li>
            <li> With a good price, what more could you want?</li>
            <li> I find it very easy to hold and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used by far.</li>
            <li> First use was great.</li>
            <li> But this, along with a good moisturizer, has done a good job overall of keeping my hands in good shape.</li>
            <li> and It broke it was very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I used it and it didn&#x27;t break any more.</li>
            <li> More sand  fell off the store than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> I saw versions of the pumice stone being sold on a handle, I think this stick without the handle is better.</li>
            <li> Glad to find these again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pumice stone on a string, what more do you need?  </li>
            <li> Invest in a more quality pumice stone.</li>
            <li> love love love it</li>
            <li> Since the stone works great, I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> i just love things like this a most have for all  to have.</li>
            <li> My heels are softer and smoother and look much better.</li>
            <li> , I received the package much faster than I anticipated and the product was in great condition when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I can say that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Simple design, works perfectly.</li>
            <li> but it seems to work better on the sink because of that and works just as well as others for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Better than what you could get at the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> feet looked and felt completely smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> The stone no longer provided a pedicure-like scrub, but more like felt like stone on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> What more do you expect?</li>
            <li> One of the best uses, besides keeping my feet smooth, toilet bowls ring free, is to get pet hair out of the carpeting/mat in the car!!  </li>
            <li> It would work perfectly for any other purpose a pumice stone might come in handy for.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> These by Diane are very fine-grained, smooth pumice stones that work beautifully.</li>
            <li> works great do not use on normal skin on you feet</li>
            <li> This item is a handy size, and the right coarseness for many uses.</li>
            <li> Best used after a shower when your hands are hot and soft from the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the rectangular shape, which is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and seems to hold up well.</li>
            <li> it broke easily while unwrapping it.</li>
            <li> Easy yo use.</li>
            <li> Will break easily if you drop it.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li> The size works fine for using on feet</li>
            <li> it works fine</li>
            <li> Cheap product broke into 3 pieces upon opening from package.  </li>
            <li> The size and shape of the brush is great for specified personal use</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;pumice&amp;#34; stone felt like it had a smooth surface and does not exfoliate well.</li>
            <li> It is about as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> if it wasn&#x27;t so cheap I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> This is about as cheap as you&#x27;d expect based on the price.</li>
            <li> Got my feet smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and does the job, but broke into two after one drop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like rubbing your feet with a smooth rock.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a cheap pumice stone and this one fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> Works just like regular pumice and is a great deal.</li>
            <li> I use it lightly on underarms to prevent ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> The tie is convenient, too - this makes it easier to hang the stone on my shower head shelf or any sort of hanger you have available in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, clean, and with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had to clean pumice off of my counter.</li>
            <li> arrived relatively quickly, given that prime 2 day shipping wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> I use it on my to scrub off dead skin and it works great, and my feet seem to be in much better shape.  </li>
            <li> The cord is nice if you intend to hang it in the shower and so far it has been working well.</li>
            <li> Finally, I really like that the edges are squared rather than rounded like most pumise stones.</li>
            <li> Natural and nice.</li>
            <li> its worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li> The tie idea is a good touch to a product that is otherwise the same regardless of who manufactures it.</li>
            <li> It does an okay job, but I kind of feel like it&#x27;s wearing down very quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t looked at other pumice stones, but this one works great.  </li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get a good one.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and shipped quickly, so there&#x27;s that, too.</li>
            <li> The value is good, but this is a commodity item, other similar products may be as good.</li>
            <li> Very brittle and falls apart easily.</li>
            <li> It was rectangular, pumice, and on top of that had a classy tie!</li>
            <li> Scrub your feet and then they feel soft! :)</li>
            <li> Great for those days when your feet need a little TLC.</li>
            <li> Works really well for pampering yourself and keeping your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price….</li>
            <li> worth them money.</li>
            <li> and this thing smoothed them right out.  </li>
            <li> Broke right away.</li>
            <li> My guess is that it broke during shipping, but I&#x27;d hope that if they were selling a product online, they&#x27;d do well to make sure it withstands general shipment.</li>
            <li> Super simple product and a super easy to use this.</li>
            <li> This pumice stone is a joke, it doesn&#x27;t clean very well (for pumice stone), and it broke the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Always in need of a new pumice stone, and this one fit the bill.</li>
            <li> This pumice stone had absolutely everything I could ask for in a pumice stone, and was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little rougher, but it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> These pumice stones can help keep heels and elbows soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Be aware</li>
            <li> The first one I received was cracked.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> But this thing worked readily and got 100% of whatever the stain was -- OUT!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a good job of removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> This is a decent price for a pumice stone, it&#x27;s got a nice open structure that really helps to scrape the callous off your heels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time about two months ago and it successfully scrubbed my feet free from excess dead skin, especially on my heels.</li>
            <li> First, the price is among the most reasonable for a similar product.</li>
            <li> They are large, as described by the seller, and do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice the price is considerably higher today, and there are other similar products.</li>
            <li> Better than they have looked or felt in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also very strong, and does not look like it will break anytime in the near future.  </li>
            <li> While I would purchase these again, before doing so, I&#x27;d verify pricing, to be certain of value.</li>
            <li> not only it removed the sediment, it was fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The pores are smaller, which allows you smoothly remove the callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smooth feet, finally!</li>
            <li> Went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> But it works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> The pumice stone is too coarse and doesn&#x27;t smooth out the skin.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s all I really need to say.</li>
            <li> just doing a whole lot a movement for a whole lot of nothing.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> Pumice stone doesn&#x27;t really vary from one product to another, and it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Works very well and shipped within the allotted time.</li>
            <li> very easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> stone worked PERFECTLY on my very calloused heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is bigger, nicer looking, and works MUCH better than the Natural Sierra Pumice Stone.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say here beyond this is a good price for a simple pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> Wow, it just pulls it right out</li>
            <li> This one is a great shape and big enough to keep your hands out of the toilet.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and it keeps my feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t know that you can use a pumice stone to clean the stains on your toilet that won&#x27;t come off with any other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far it works great</li>
            <li> so far mine have been great, they have done their job, they havent crumbled away or broken a bunch like some people have had happen, and i have NOT been gentle with them</li>
            <li> USE THIS TO CLEAN YOUR TOILET BOWL.</li>
            <li> decent pumice stone</li>
            <li> are so very soft!  </li>
            <li> Put them with your cleaning supplies, they work great removing hard water deposits from  toilet bowls and can also be used to remove rust and rust stains.</li>
            <li> It came just as expected and works fine.</li>
            <li> It allows a little more precision and grit on touch to reach places, like the sides of my toes.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bit more porous</li>
            <li> Great long lasting pumice stone to keep those rough summer feet staying soft.</li>
            <li> Assuming this isn&#x27;t normal.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth shipping it back to return it.</li>
            <li> It came wrapped in plastic and as i began to unwrap it the top part with the hole for the loop to go through completely separated from the bottom half.</li>
            <li> That one lasted only 3 uses before it broke right in 2 and is now falling apart.  </li>
            <li> This must be why they call it a &amp;#34;Rectangular Pumice Stone with Tie.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m convinced this will usher in a new era of pumice stones.</li>
            <li> I will be looking for a new type of pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new pumice stone</li>
            <li> exactly as described, still holding up today almost a year later.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine,  deducted one star, because it broke in half as I was removing the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Makes you soo soft.!</li>
            <li> the pumice stone started to wear down and smooth out.</li>
            <li> the cheap price, less than 1 dollars, and it has a rope that you can put in the shower you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> Opened clear package and the diane rectangular pumice stone with tie was in three pieces.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, but it works to smooth the foot, especially the heals.</li>
            <li> This item arrived as expected, not broken or with way too much packaging.</li>
            <li> Some are too soft.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work really well with continued daily use.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old stepped in  </li>
            <li> I opened it up, and it broke into about a dozen pieces, and just crumbles when you touch it, completely unusable.</li>
            <li> B000HZ9L8K Natural Sierra Pumice Stone]])</li>
            <li> will buy more from u at a late date.</li>
            <li> the plastic package seemed whole, but when you open it, it was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used it one time and it completely removed my callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is keeping my feet soft and free of dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried a large number of toilet cleaners trying to remove these rings.</li>
            <li> Some is too porus and breaks down quickly as you use it.  </li>
            <li> and it breaks down quickly (for a pumice stone).  </li>
            <li> It works fine but is quite brittle; every time I use it, small bits would break off.</li>
            <li> Kind of small and not as course as expected.</li>
            <li> This stone was packaged in shrink wrap inside of a hanging retail-style package, and that package was inside a small box filled with packing peanuts.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, usually only three times a week or so, but it&#x27;s enough to keep my feet healthy.</li>
            <li> The pumice  stone is strong and hard.</li>
            <li> Clean down the middle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stone and they are hard to find, so I bought several.  </li>
            <li> It works very well for dry feet and calluses.</li>
            <li> effective.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong for the price, I assure you that you get much more than you paid for!</li>
            <li> It is a little softer and more crumbly than other pumice stones I have used</li>
            <li> came as expected, it&#x27;s pretty huge, like my hand length, and I&#x27;m a girl, so lets keep that in mind what I mean with hand</li>
            <li> You get better leverage by holding on to the stick itself and you can change the grip as you need to use it at different angles to get under the rim or other odd angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than the fact that it was broken in half when it got here, I lost a good portion of the stone on the first use.</li>
            <li> at the same time, and the Natural Sierra Pumice stone barely works at all.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see this item was larger than I was expecting so it is easier to hold than some tinier pumice stones.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on my rough heels.    </li>
            <li> Even though I was using both sides, the surface was not nearly as rough.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this actually works!</li>
            <li> This is my first pumice stone, so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I&#x27;m not overly inconvenienced by this, as I bought this product to clean my toilet, but for potential buyers wanting to buy for actual exfoliation purposes, consider your purchase carefully.</li>
            <li> Cracked in half the first time I tried it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this was broken long before they shipped this item due to the nature of the damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me for about 4 months on semi-weekly uses before it cracked down the middle</li>
            <li> I was at Kmart and found almost the exact same thing for a couple dollars less.</li>
            <li> So hard to find in the drugstores now, and many of the Amazon pumice stones being offered are coarse with rough edges.</li>
            <li> I really feel like it doesn&#x27;t do much to smooth out my feet (which really aren&#x27;t bad to start out with.</li>
            <li> If the callus is too large, I still need to trim it down first (and usually resort to nail clippers for that...).</li>
            <li> But it took less than 10 minutes to completely remove all the nastiness completely.</li>
            <li> The stone itself is a little bit rougher to the touch than the ones I&#x27;ve seen in the stores, which I really like because I feel like it gets the job done easier and</li>
            <li> Came in a clear plastic with a crack in the center.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had a stone of unknown origin around the water line in my toilet that was resistant to cleansers and brushes, soft or rigid.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that its not quite abrasive enough to handle the whole callus.</li>
            <li> but I would not buy this to use on my skin in the shower because I know it wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> not buy again since it did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I did not realize pumice works create on rusty stains in your toilet.  </li>
            <li> I felt no damage to the toilet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Split image of 2 photos attached: the toilet before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This pumice stone was minimally packaged (yay to less waste) and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It scrubbed my feet the first few times, but now it feels like it&#x27;s getting smoother and less &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> packaging is plain (clear plastic).</li>
            <li> off.&lt;br /&gt;Should have listened to the other reviews that had the same experience, but thought I&#x27;d get lucky.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Keeps it dry and out of the way until I need</li>
            <li> so I can hang it on the shower rack to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have dry heels that callous</li>
            <li> I use it while I am in the shower or immediately afterwards, however, do not store in shower, store in dry area or the item will get ruined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been scrubbing my palms with this daily for the last few months to keep my calluses in control.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the simple purpose of scrubbing my feet in the shower to get the dead, dry and callus skin off and it did so well enough for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> A few days of weightlifting a week will cause some major calluses to build up if not kept in control.</li>
            <li> I at least expected to be able to use it ONCE, but this was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> but it is only about half the length in size pictured.</li>
            <li> Very fragile - arrived already cracked in half.</li>
            <li> as soon as i open it from the plastic wrap it broke in half.</li>
            <li> Seems a little brittle but not entirely so that I would not of bought it.</li>
            <li> and I pull it into a little ball and remove, or use the vacuum to swoop it up!  </li>
            <li> works as expected, however it crumbles</li>
            <li> Not much else to say there.</li>
            <li> , I did not really think it would work either.</li>
            <li> Not too much grit comes off and I haven&#x27;t broken it yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using it about once or twice a week for a few months now and it is still solid.</li>
            <li> Beyond that, both halves worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was just rough on this one somehow.</li>
            <li> that are rough to the touch</li>
            <li> I bought it to scrub some porcelain products, it&#x27;s not very course</li>
            <li> It works as expected in the shower/bath and even though I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times it hasn&#x27;t chipped any chunks off of it yet as my last one did.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works as expected.</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t tried any other products.</li>
            <li> (unlike other Pumice stones I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I have not had the crumbling issues that other users have had; I even dropped it in my metal tub while taking a shower</li>
            <li> Other than that works like a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other stones, so</li>
            <li> not cute to have calloused heels whether your a male or a female.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as efficient as other products</li>
            <li> I have very rough feet</li>
            <li> This stone is an appropriate size and shape to get at the base of the fingers on the inside of the palm, unlike some other stones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It still does the job and was only a few dollars, so not many complaints.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth returning.</li>
            <li> However, this stone is cracked in two pieces, about 2/3 of the way down.  </li>
            <li> If it does wear down eventually, I will buy this one again.</li>
            <li> My heels have been really dry these past two years</li>
            <li> Immediately upon opening the package, the stone broke in half.</li>
            <li> Broke in half immediately when I took the plastic</li>
            <li> Broke in half while I was trying to get it out of packaging.</li>
            <li> I just thought it would take less than a minute per callous.</li>
            <li> When I received this product it was broke in half.</li>
            <li> When taking out the package, this &amp;#34;pumice stone&amp;#34; broke in half...</li>
            <li> It broke in half after one use.</li>
            <li> Broke in half being removed from the package</li>
            <li> It broke in half upon opening and does not remove dead skin well.</li>
            <li> however it snapped in half after few weeks.</li>
            <li> broke in half after a few uses</li>
            <li> like the rope to hang on the little plastic hook I put in my bathtub.  </li>
            <li> You will still rip a little but this will help</li>
            <li> with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did think it could have been just a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Do not buy, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just remember to rinse it a few times while you are using it, and when you are done.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I can leave it in the shower and use it on my dead skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as great as an actual pedicure, but for an immediate at-home solution, it did well.</li>
            <li> if you use it to heavily it can cut through the skin and rub you raw</li>
            <li> This thing was not strong AT ALL.</li>
            <li> NO MORE</li>
            <li> My stone also arrived broken in half.</li>
            <li> Ended up throwing this away as it arrived broken in half.</li>

            <li> Poor quality.</li>

            <li> It is not a full rectangle so was disappointed</li>
            <li> Total Crap!</li>
            <li> Until recently my toilets looked terrible because of the rust and sediment rings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Calloused feet can damage your confidence and make you feel insecure about being barefoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Received it broken :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stone--heel callouses be gone!</li>
            <li> i used this my heels looked terrible and covered in thick callouses</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my feet and they&#x27;re not that bad.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Cheap product broke into 3 pieces upon opening from package.  Still usable but wouldn&#x27;t get this again.</li>
            <li> USE THIS TO CLEAN YOUR TOILET BOWL. Most people don&#x27;t know that you can use a pumice stone to clean the stains on your toilet that won&#x27;t come off with any other product. This one is a great shape and big enough to keep your hands out of the toilet.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it was broken. Also crumbles a lot.</li>
            <li> All pumice is NOT created equal.  Some is too porus and breaks down quickly as you use it.  Some are too soft.  This one is a very good quality pumice.  The pores are smaller, which allows you smoothly remove the callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the rope to hang on the little plastic hook I put in my bathtub.  Keeps it dry and out of the way until I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rectangle shape fits nicely in your hand to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stone--heel callouses be gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been scrubbing my palms with this daily for the last few months to keep my calluses in control. A few days of weightlifting a week will cause some major calluses to build up if not kept in control. This stone is an appropriate size and shape to get at the base of the fingers on the inside of the palm, unlike some other stones I&#x27;ve used. Best used after a shower when your hands are hot and soft from the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that its not quite abrasive enough to handle the whole callus. If the callus is too large, I still need to trim it down first (and usually resort to nail clippers for that...). But this, along with a good moisturizer, has done a good job overall of keeping my hands in good shape.</li>
            <li> Immediately upon opening the package, the stone broke in half. I had to clean pumice off of my counter. It still does the job and was only a few dollars, so not many complaints. I used it and it didn&#x27;t break any more.</li>
            <li> Broke in half immediately when I took the plastic off.&lt;br /&gt;Should have listened to the other reviews that had the same experience, but thought I&#x27;d get lucky.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Works really good!</li>
            <li> This has been great for my calluses.  The size and shape of the brush is great for specified personal use</li>
            <li> Smooth feet, finally!</li>
            <li> Broke in half while I was trying to get it out of packaging.</li>
            <li> Broke as I took the plastic wrapper off. Total Crap!</li>
            <li> Poor quality. It broke in half upon opening and does not remove dead skin well.</li>
            <li> I wear stilettos every day and it takes a toll on my feet, especially my heels. This seems to work really well with continued daily use.</li>
            <li> works as expected, however it crumbles and I don&#x27;t know if thats supposed to happen.</li>
            <li> Takes quite a while to scrape off a noticeable amount of callouses. But I haven&#x27;t tried any other products. I just thought it would take less than a minute per callous.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality, broke into 3 pieces just getting it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see this item was larger than I was expecting so it is easier to hold than some tinier pumice stones. The cord is nice if you intend to hang it in the shower and so far it has been working well.</li>
            <li> decent pumice stone but it is only about half the length in size pictured. It is not a full rectangle so was disappointed</li>
            <li> It has worked how it is suppose to work. The shape makes it alright to hold in the hand. The color of the stone is nice. It seems like it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Its a pumice stone and it works.  Hangs in the shower. Not much else to say there.</li>
            <li> This pumice stone works great. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used by far. I cannot recommend it enough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, clean, and with fast shipping. I like the rectangular shape, which is easy to use. The rope adds style and function.</li>
            <li> Same as sold at the dollar store. But works.</li>
            <li> This rectangular pumice stone with tie is worthless. More sand  fell off the store than I could have imagined. Spend a little more and get a good one.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old stepped in  and It broke it was very cheaply made. I would never buy it again</li>
            <li> Came in pieces. Very brittle and falls apart easily.</li>
            <li> good quality, fasr shipping!</li>
            <li> It works fine but is quite brittle; every time I use it, small bits would break off. 4 stars because it&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;pumice&amp;#34; stone felt like it had a smooth surface and does not exfoliate well. Do not buy, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> One of the best uses, besides keeping my feet smooth, toilet bowls ring free, is to get pet hair out of the carpeting/mat in the car!!  Wow, it just pulls it right out and I pull it into a little ball and remove, or use the vacuum to swoop it up!  This item is a handy size, and the right coarseness for many uses.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful! Used to have this same one 15 years ago. Glad I found it again. Just remember to rinse it a few times while you are using it, and when you are done.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3H4PR9CUKGXUV]]Everyone knows to use pumice stone for your feet.  However until I have tried this I did not realize pumice works create on rusty stains in your toilet.  It cleans them without damaging the porcelain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very hard water. Until recently my toilets looked terrible because of the rust and sediment rings. I have tried a large number of toilet cleaners trying to remove these rings. Nothing worked. I was embarrassed when people visited my house. It looked like I never cleaned my toilets. Trying the pumice stick was my last ditch effort, I did not really think it would work either. But it took less than 10 minutes to completely remove all the nastiness completely. I am attaching the before and after photos. You just have to see it to believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pumice stick not only it removed the sediment, it was fast and easy to use. I saw versions of the pumice stone being sold on a handle, I think this stick without the handle is better. You get better leverage by holding on to the stick itself and you can change the grip as you need to use it at different angles to get under the rim or other odd angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A-m-a-z-i-n-g! It worked well and when I ran my finger over the area where I scrubbed I felt no damage to the toilet itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Split image of 2 photos attached: the toilet before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> This pumice stone had absolutely everything I could ask for in a pumice stone, and was exactly as described! It was rectangular, pumice, and on top of that had a classy tie! This must be why they call it a &amp;#34;Rectangular Pumice Stone with Tie.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m convinced this will usher in a new era of pumice stones.</li>
            <li> It was shipped in an envelope with no packing material and arrived as two pieces. Dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Came broke in the mail. Went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> Product was broken when received.  Opened clear package and the diane rectangular pumice stone with tie was in three pieces.</li>
            <li> These pumice stones can help keep heels and elbows soft and smooth. Use after bath or shower and follow up with jojoba  or coconut oil and you will feel silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you need to replace them don&#x27;t throw the worn out ones away. Put them with your cleaning supplies, they work great removing hard water deposits from  toilet bowls and can also be used to remove rust and rust stains.</li>
            <li> It is about as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Doesn&#x27;t work at all! if it wasn&#x27;t so cheap I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> When I received this product it was broke in half. But it works really well. Great price for a good item.</li>
            <li> Glad to find these again. So hard to find in the drugstores now, and many of the Amazon pumice stones being offered are coarse with rough edges. These by Diane are very fine-grained, smooth pumice stones that work beautifully.</li>
            <li> arrived relatively quickly, given that prime 2 day shipping wasn&#x27;t available. It came wrapped in plastic and as i began to unwrap it the top part with the hole for the loop to go through completely separated from the bottom half. Still works as advertised, but is a very fragile product against everything but your skin. It will break if dropped, shipped, squeezed, or knocked under any pressure.</li>
            <li> Works as described and it&#x27;s great having the tie so I can hang it on the shower rack to dry.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far it works great and I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t looked at other pumice stones, but this one works great.  I use it on my to scrub off dead skin and it works great, and my feet seem to be in much better shape.  Be aware if you use it to heavily it can cut through the skin and rub you raw</li>
            <li> no surprises.  packaging is plain (clear plastic).</li>
            <li> I use it as a humidor stone in my wife&#x27;s cigarette box. It would work perfectly for any other purpose a pumice stone might come in handy for.</li>
            <li> This stone was packaged in shrink wrap inside of a hanging retail-style package, and that package was inside a small box filled with packing peanuts.  However, this stone is cracked in two pieces, about 2/3 of the way down.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this was broken long before they shipped this item due to the nature of the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I&#x27;m not overly inconvenienced by this, as I bought this product to clean my toilet, but for potential buyers wanting to buy for actual exfoliation purposes, consider your purchase carefully.</li>
            <li> This is about as cheap as you&#x27;d expect based on the price. I was using it for craft purposes (scrubbing some denim) rather than in the shower so it worked for my needs but I would not buy this to use on my skin in the shower because I know it wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> This pumice stone is a joke, it doesn&#x27;t clean very well (for pumice stone), and it broke the first time I used it (unlike other Pumice stones I&#x27;ve used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures also seem a bit misleading on size -- this is tiny!</li>
            <li> When taking out the package, this &amp;#34;pumice stone&amp;#34; broke in half...horribly, horribly quality.</li>
            <li> Received it broken :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for your feet, but don&#x27;t use it anywhere else because it doesn&#x27;t work anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it didn&#x27;t work for what I got it for (hair removal)</li>
            <li> Other than the fact that it was broken in half when it got here, I lost a good portion of the stone on the first use. If I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it if I hadn&#x27;t gotten Prime. I would recommend buying something like this at home.</li>
            <li> I really like this pumice stone.  It works well and arrived in a timely manner.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because shortly after I bought it I was at Kmart and found almost the exact same thing for a couple dollars less.</li>
            <li> It arrived in pieces. It still works but it doesn&#x27;t hang like I wanted. It&#x27;s not worth returning.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, but it works to smooth the foot, especially the heals.</li>
            <li> Chest to bars...Pull ups...power cleans...NO MORE RIps...gets rid of the callus that tears yoru hands apart...You will still rip a little but this will help</li>
            <li> When I open box , I saw two piece pumice!!</li>
            <li> so far mine have been great, they have done their job, they havent crumbled away or broken a bunch like some people have had happen, and i have NOT been gentle with them, I bought multiple just in case, especially since they where like 50 cents at the time, and none of them have had any issues yet.</li>
            <li> There are several things to like about this. First, the price is among the most reasonable for a similar product. Second, the rope hanger allows me to hang this from a shower curtain hook, avoiding the mildew that comes from leaving it in a pool of water in the soap dish. Finally, I really like that the edges are squared rather than rounded like most pumise stones. It allows a little more precision and grit on touch to reach places, like the sides of my toes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> It broke in half after one use. But, that didn&#x27;t impact the functionality.</li>
            <li> This product works like all pumice however it snapped in half after few weeks. I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price….</li>
            <li> Got my feet smooth as glass. Dont dig too deep with it. You can hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> Works great. The rope is great for hanging in the shower. I use it every other day and it keeps my feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The rope broke off instantly, BUT WHO NEEDS A ROPE ON THEIR PUMICE STONE????</li>
            <li> I like this stone but it came broken. Not packaged well maybe. I am using both halves anyway and like it. I can leave it in the shower and use it on my dead skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and seems to hold up well. The string is nice for hanging it up as well.</li>
            <li> Always in need of a new pumice stone, and this one fit the bill. Great size and does a good job on those toe callouses.</li>
            <li> Works great. Not too much grit comes off and I haven&#x27;t broken it yet.</li>
            <li> It was broken inside the package.  I opened it up, and it broke into about a dozen pieces, and just crumbles when you touch it, completely unusable.</li>
            <li> it broke easily while unwrapping it.</li>
            <li> Great long lasting pumice stone to keep those rough summer feet staying soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pumice stone on a string, what more do you need?  Great for those days when your feet need a little TLC.</li>
            <li> The pumice stone is too coarse and doesn&#x27;t smooth out the skin.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> pumice stone on a rope. exactly as described, still holding up today almost a year later.</li>
            <li> Good value, stone disintegrates</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and does the job, but broke into two after one drop. Invest in a more quality pumice stone.</li>
            <li> this is a great buy.  I have very rough feet and this thing smoothed them right out.  love love love it</li>
            <li> Used this on sore and calloused heels.  Seems to work fine,  deducted one star, because it broke in half as I was removing the packaging.  Assuming this isn&#x27;t normal.  Still works a-ok, though.</li>
            <li> Nice size. Easy yo use. Wish it was a little rougher, but it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, arrived in broken 2 pieces condition.</li>
            <li> I have had this stone for awhile.  It has held up good.  Works good.  It is good quality.  Very nice that you can hang it in the shower.  The size works fine for using on feet</li>
            <li> It Doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t buy it. that&#x27;s all I really need to say. It&#x27;s like rubbing your feet with a smooth rock. just doing a whole lot a movement for a whole lot of nothing.</li>
            <li> Basically I paid fifty cents for this item. I really didn&#x27;t expect much. The first one I received was cracked. Amazon promptly replaced it. The pumice  stone is strong and hard. I find it very easy to hold and effective.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong for the price, I assure you that you get much more than you paid for!</li>
            <li> It does an okay job, but I kind of feel like it&#x27;s wearing down very quickly. It scrubbed my feet the first few times, but now it feels like it&#x27;s getting smoother and less &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34;. This is my first pumice stone, so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal or not.</li>
            <li> Since the stone works great, I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my feet and they&#x27;re not that bad.</li>
            <li> Product does a great job and is effective and what I am using it for. If I needed a similar product I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Broke in half being removed from the package</li>
            <li> This pumice stone was minimally packaged (yay to less waste) and arrived quickly. I have been using it about once or twice a week for a few months now and it is still solid. I have not had the crumbling issues that other users have had; I even dropped it in my metal tub while taking a shower and it didn&#x27;t break or crumble. It has been doing a great job on keeping my feet smooth.</li>
            <li> Clean down the middle.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on my rough heels.    I bought another pumice stone - ([[ASIN:B000HZ9L8K Natural Sierra Pumice Stone]]) at the same time, and the Natural Sierra Pumice stone barely works at all.  I tossed it as soon as I tried Diane&#x27;s.    The Diane Pumice stone came as pictured.  It is bigger, nicer looking, and works MUCH better than the Natural Sierra Pumice Stone.  It is also very strong, and does not look like it will break anytime in the near future.  If it does wear down eventually, I will buy this one again.</li>
            <li> This is a decent price for a pumice stone, it&#x27;s got a nice open structure that really helps to scrape the callous off your heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a rock... If you drop it, it&#x27;s going to break, know that...</li>
            <li> Bought to replace the one that fell and broke.  It&#x27;s simple and it does the job.  No muss no fuss.</li>
            <li> Stone arrived broken. Other than that works like a pumice stone. Kind of small and not as course as expected.</li>
            <li> This item arrived as expected, not broken or with way too much packaging. I wish it was a little bit more porous but it works fairly well.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Came in a clear plastic with a crack in the center. It broke into two pieces immediately.</li>
            <li> awesome for craked feet came fast. worth them money. i just love things like this a most have for all  to have. will buy more from u at a late date.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these pumice stones.  The first one lasted me for about 4 months on semi-weekly uses before it cracked down the middle and then sort of started falling apart.  I thought it was simply maybe that stone, so I purchased a second one.  That one lasted only 3 uses before it broke right in 2 and is now falling apart.  I will be looking for a new type of pumice stone.</li>
            <li> i have been using this pumice stone now for about two months, and i am sad to say that i don&#x27;t love it. I really feel like it doesn&#x27;t do much to smooth out my feet (which really aren&#x27;t bad to start out with. i would hate to see how they worked with people with really rough feet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this after taking baths, which means that my feet should be in prime smoothing condition, but it still doens&#x27;t seem like it does much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, i would not buy again.</li>
            <li> My heels have been really dry these past two years and I finally decided to treat them. I saw a difference after the first use. My heels are softer and smoother and look much better. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, usually only three times a week or so, but it&#x27;s enough to keep my feet healthy. The stone itself is a little bit rougher to the touch than the ones I&#x27;ve seen in the stores, which I really like because I feel like it gets the job done easier and with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I received the package much faster than I anticipated and the product was in great condition when it arrived.</li>
            <li> The product came split in 3.&lt;br /&gt;In the plastic package seemed whole, but when you open it, it was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in an envelope, if they know this is a brittle item why don&#x27;t they protect it?</li>
            <li> Very fragile - arrived already cracked in half. Other than that it works as expected.</li>
            <li> Could have been more coarser but good quality still.</li>
            <li> My stone also arrived broken in half. Beyond that, both halves worked as expected. Pumice stone doesn&#x27;t really vary from one product to another, and it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> bought it as an addon to my order and to get the water line out of the commodes.. it works fine</li>
            <li> Seems a little brittle but not entirely so that I would not of bought it. I can say that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a cheap pumice stone and this one fit the bill.  I like the rope on it so I can hang it in the shower.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> The second I removed the plastic wrap the stone broke in two pieces.  Both pieces still &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; but its not ideal. I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for a few bucks.</li>
            <li> This thing was not strong AT ALL. I at least expected to be able to use it ONCE, but this was broken when I received it. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other stones, so I don&#x27;t know if I was just rough on this one somehow. My guess is that it broke during shipping, but I&#x27;d hope that if they were selling a product online, they&#x27;d do well to make sure it withstands general shipment.</li>
            <li> came as expected, it&#x27;s pretty huge, like my hand length, and I&#x27;m a girl, so lets keep that in mind what I mean with hand length.&lt;br /&gt;For the cheap price, less than 1 dollars, and it has a rope that you can put in the shower you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> Simple design, works perfectly. Natural and nice. It came just as expected and works fine. I have no complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and as expected. Thanks!</li>
            <li> as soon as i open it from the plastic wrap it broke in half.</li>
            <li> Nice pumice stone with the handy tie. Recommend this if you need pumice for those touch stains.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rock on a string.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, viz., buff out heel calluses.  It was inexpensive and shipped quickly, so there&#x27;s that, too.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here beyond this is a good price for a simple pumice stone.  It works as expected in the shower/bath and even though I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times it hasn&#x27;t chipped any chunks off of it yet as my last one did.</li>
            <li> I use one in the shower for exfoliating and one in the kitchen for cleaning my ceramic sink. It is a little softer and more crumbly than other pumice stones I have used but it seems to work better on the sink because of that and works just as well as others for exfoliation. I like the size and the attached string. I did think it could have been just a little cheaper. All-in-all very happy with it and will probably buy again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Cracked in half the first time I tried it . I didn&#x27;t even bother to send it back. Got what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Ended up throwing this away as it arrived broken in half. Wasn&#x27;t worth shipping it back to return it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work. I need something stronger I guess.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stone and they are hard to find, so I bought several.  I use this every time I shower and my feet are so very soft!  My pedicurist has even complimented me!</li>
            <li> Super simple product and a super easy to use this. I loved it and the price was great order one!</li>
            <li> They are just pumice stones... what am I supposed to say? Scrub your feet and then they feel soft! :)</li>
            <li> Works very well and shipped within the allotted time. Works just like regular pumice and is a great deal.</li>
            <li> This stone is brittle and creates dust when I use it. It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Better than what you could get at the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;Good for the price but not the best.</li>
            <li> I have dry heels that callous very easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not cute to have calloused heels whether your a male or a female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feet that are rough to the touch are not attractive and not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calloused feet can damage your confidence and make you feel insecure about being barefoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this pumice stone because lotions were not working and i was fed up with my calloused heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stone is tough so you wont break it or wear it out by rubbing it on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very porous and will definitely scrape and buff away the dead skin from your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;before i used this my heels looked terrible and covered in thick callouses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stone worked PERFECTLY on my very calloused heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it one time and it completely removed my callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet looked and felt completely smooth and nice. Better than they have looked or felt in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and IT DEFINITELY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Used for about 3 years now and it still holds up.  Works as good as it did the day I got it.  I imagine if you drop it it may break but just don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> I bought it to scrub some porcelain products, it&#x27;s not very course and it breaks down quickly (for a pumice stone).  Great for body not for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I purchased these at $.49 each as a prime add on, and they are probably one of the best values for this type of product at Amazon. They are large, as described by the seller, and do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice the price is considerably higher today, and there are other similar products. While I would purchase these again, before doing so, I&#x27;d verify pricing, to be certain of value. The value is good, but this is a commodity item, other similar products may be as good. Shop and compare!</li>
            <li> Very Fragile. This product arrived broken into two pieces.</li>
            <li> Broke right away. Doesn&#x27;t do a good job of removing dead skin. Don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I use it lightly on underarms to prevent ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> Not as efficient as other products</li>
            <li> Works really well for pampering yourself and keeping your feet smooth. I use it while I am in the shower or immediately afterwards, however, do not store in shower, store in dry area or the item will get ruined.</li>
            <li> First use was great. I used it for the first time about two months ago and it successfully scrubbed my feet free from excess dead skin, especially on my heels. Not nearly as great as an actual pedicure, but for an immediate at-home solution, it did well. The tie is convenient, too - this makes it easier to hang the stone on my shower head shelf or any sort of hanger you have available in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two months (using it maybe 3 times a week) the pumice stone started to wear down and smooth out. Even though I was using both sides, the surface was not nearly as rough. The stone no longer provided a pedicure-like scrub, but more like felt like stone on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again since it did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> It does what it is suppose to do. Will break easily if you drop it. its worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li> great for my heels...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new pumice stone and i came across this one.It works very well for dry feet and calluses.It made my feet feet softer after one time of useing this product.</li>
            <li> The length of the stone is great. Allows for longer strokes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the simple purpose of scrubbing my feet in the shower to get the dead, dry and callus skin off and it did so well enough for the price I paid. So I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works great. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> works great do not use on normal skin on you feet just where callous is</li>
            <li> broke in half after a few uses</li>
            <li> It works great.  It is keeping my feet soft and free of dead skin.</li>
            <li> This is a really good pumice stone, I use it from head to toes! Makes you soo soft.!</li>
            <li> The tie idea is a good touch to a product that is otherwise the same regardless of who manufactures it. I was pleasantly surprised that this actually works! I&#x27;d had a stone of unknown origin around the water line in my toilet that was resistant to cleansers and brushes, soft or rigid. But this thing worked readily and got 100% of whatever the stain was -- OUT!</li>
            <li> Not as good as I hoped .</li>
            <li> Nice size for handling, very good at getting rid of calluses.  With a good price, what more could you want?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pumice store on a tie.  What more do you expect?</li>
