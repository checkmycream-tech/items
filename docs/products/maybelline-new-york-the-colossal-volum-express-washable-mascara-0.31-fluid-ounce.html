    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Besides the smell, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>Even if it looked great, I wouldn&#x27;t keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price on amazon</li>
            <li>Great look tho.  </li>
            <li>Great color and price</li>
            <li>price is great also,</li>
            <li>This mascara is truly great.</li>
            <li>The Falsies Spoon Brush Washable Mascara is my favarite one,It has a Fair price,</li>
            <li>I really enjoy wearing it and it gives a great volume!</li>
            <li>After spending four times as much, I found that this is comprable to the best out there!</li>
            <li>A nice size for purse or my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market</li>
            <li>Madeline is a reliable  company and the price is nice.</li>
            <li>I Love the Maybelline products What I bought,</li>
            <li>Love this mascara and have been buying it for a while.</li>
            <li>One reviewed said this makes better &amp;#34;false&amp;#34; lashes than the falsies.</li>
            <li>Looks better than the Falsies.</li>
            <li>but so far so good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, and probably the most important reason why I won&#x27;t use it again, it made the skin around my eyes itchy.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily in the shower without the need for makeup remover</li>
            <li>Best Mascara hands down.</li>
            <li>but I always keep coming back because it proves to be among the best, and at a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush, while it looked great conceptually, was way too big for me.  </li>
            <li>I think I will just stick with the cheap Maybelline mascara from here on out.</li>
            <li>and honestly my lashes look very full and natural.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was the overwhelming smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is good for length and volume as well, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>It also flakes off quickly, and flakes off if touched at all.  </li>
            <li>Great mascara - so convenient to be able to have it delivered (especially since I can&#x27;t seem to go into the makeup department without buying a handful of products that I don&#x27;t actually need...)</li>
            <li>so i try to keep mascara more natural looking).</li>
            <li>i probably wont buy again, but it was worth a try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been paying $14/tube for Clinique&#x27;s washable waterproof mascara and this was by far the better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Creates nice long lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>It was a lot clumpier than I expected, and that kind of made sense to me.  </li>
            <li>But only more perfumey.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li>People complain about the smell, but it does not bother me anymore - it did at first, but really, it basically smells like roses.</li>
            <li>should have such a strong odor, and it bothered me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I DO have long lashes, I&#x27;ve experienced some smudging with other brands if I blink too soon after putting it on, but never as much as this.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how it&#x27;s supposed to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also is very clumpy.</li>
            <li>Gave this a 4, as it performs very well, but it has a noticeable odor/fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It smells like straight up wax or medicine (chemical smell), idk.</li>
            <li>I bought a glam brown mascara to give my look more natural and it did actually.</li>
            <li>I felt sure that I would like their other products as well, and after comparing a couple of options at the store I grabbed this</li>
            <li>this mascara was much darker than i anticipated... more like a black brown than a brown</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Maybelline mascara user for YEARS - who doesn&#x27;t have one of those little pink tubes of Great Lash around?  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for super long time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes super long.</li>
            <li>old, I&#x27;m now 47!</li>
            <li>When the new one arrives I know it is time to discard the old one.  </li>
            <li>Then I throw the old one away.</li>
            <li>Since I wear contacts, I was concerned that it would flake off, but again, so far so good!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can do a light lash or a heavy one depending on number of coats.</li>
            <li>the liquid definitely comes out a little thick and clumpy, you have to wipe it off on the sides, but it looks great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks like I&#x27;ll be going back to my old standby!</li>
            <li>Makes your lashes long and pretty and lasts long without clumping.</li>
            <li>but the packaging was already open and looked old when i received it.</li>
            <li>This keeps me from using a tube for years, a most unhealthy habit.</li>
            <li>cannot say that this product delivers the big colossal effect that it claims to, but with 2 coats you can achieve full, dark, yet fluttery, feathery-looking lashes that have just enough flare without being too dramatic.</li>
            <li>Whether you think it smells good or bad, it&#x27;s just too</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it was hard to just hit the lashes without smudging makeup on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the intent is to volumize (I read that as \\&quot;make wider/fuller\\&quot; vs. \\&quot;make longer\\&quot;), if your lashes are thin or sparse wouldn&#x27;t it have to clump to fill in the gaps?  </li>
            <li> The packaging of this product was very poor.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Maybelline mascara user for YEARS - who doesn&#x27;t have one of those little pink tubes of Great Lash around?  Even my mother always had one, and I don&#x27;t remember her using mascara.  I felt sure that I would like their other products as well, and after comparing a couple of options at the store I grabbed this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the overwhelming smell.  It doesn&#x27;t seem that something intended to go that close to your eye should have such a strong odor, and it bothered me. Whether you think it smells good or bad, it&#x27;s just too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush, while it looked great conceptually, was way too big for me.  I have small eyes with very long, but very pale and thin/sparse lashes, and even with what I consider a pretty steady hand it was hard to just hit the lashes without smudging makeup on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it where I wanted it, it didn&#x27;t STAY there.  It was a lot clumpier than I expected, and that kind of made sense to me.  Since the intent is to volumize (I read that as \\&quot;make wider/fuller\\&quot; vs. \\&quot;make longer\\&quot;), if your lashes are thin or sparse wouldn&#x27;t it have to clump to fill in the gaps?  Just a thought - I don&#x27;t really know how it&#x27;s supposed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I DO have long lashes, I&#x27;ve experienced some smudging with other brands if I blink too soon after putting it on, but never as much as this.  It also flakes off quickly, and flakes off if touched at all.  Every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried can tolerate a little \\&quot;poking\\&quot; with the end of my finger to push clumped lashes apart, etc, but this just flakes off and leaves bare spots.  It&#x27;s odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, and probably the most important reason why I won&#x27;t use it again, it made the skin around my eyes itchy.  Even if it looked great, I wouldn&#x27;t keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I&#x27;ll be going back to my old standby!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for super long time. Great price on amazon</li>
            <li> Super disappointed in this product. It has an unpleasant strong odor, both in the bottle and once its on my eyelashes, like a chemical perfume. I had to wash my face immediately. It also is very clumpy. Seems like it&#x27;s expired. Not a quality product.</li>
            <li> I Love the Maybelline products What I bought,Maybelline Volum&#x27; Express The Falsies Spoon Brush Washable Mascara is my favarite one,It has a Fair price,</li>
            <li> I bought a glam brown mascara to give my look more natural and it did actually. I really enjoy wearing it and it gives a great volume!</li>
            <li> This mascara is creamy and easy to apply. The color I got was the dark brown or black/brown but it is nearly black. Doesn&#x27;t clump on the brush or on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  After spending four times as much, I found that this is comprable to the best out there!</li>
            <li> You are supposed to change your mascara every 6 months, so I put it on a 6-month subscription.  When the new one arrives I know it is time to discard the old one.  A nice size for purse or my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> Gave this a 4, as it performs very well, but it has a noticeable odor/fragrance.  Great look tho.  Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using maybelline mascara since I was 15 yrs. old, I&#x27;m now 47! I can honestly say I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market but I always keep coming back because it proves to be among the best, and at a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> Great mascara - so convenient to be able to have it delivered (especially since I can&#x27;t seem to go into the makeup department without buying a handful of products that I don&#x27;t actually need...) I just keep this in my cart and add it onto an order every couple of months... I never run out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather content with the look of this mascara. I cannot decide if it&#x27;s the one, but it&#x27;s definitely one that I&#x27;d keep on my mind just in case another mascara runs out or is not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say that this product delivers the big colossal effect that it claims to, but with 2 coats you can achieve full, dark, yet fluttery, feathery-looking lashes that have just enough flare without being too dramatic. It gives enough length for my satisfaction even though the product is not meant for length. The lashes remain rather separated from each other unless you start overdoing it (i.e. no more than 2 coats or else it does start looking weird).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might repurchase this again. People complain about the smell, but it does not bother me anymore - it did at first, but really, it basically smells like roses. But only more perfumey.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara and have been buying it for a while. Makes your lashes long and pretty and lasts long without clumping.</li>
            <li> Best Mascara hands down. Finally no clumpped together eyelashes! And this stuff stays on all day with no residue or flakes!</li>
            <li> Creates nice long lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump. Wish the brown color came in waterproof also for my summer beach days.</li>
            <li> Great color and price</li>
            <li> I like the color, Brown, and the volume I really need as my lashes are thin. I order them on Subscribe and Save so that they are delivered about every three months. Then I throw the old one away. This keeps me from using a tube for years, a most unhealthy habit. Madeline is a reliable  company and the price is nice.</li>
            <li> The packaging of this product was very poor. The package looked open. The mascara itself did not look used but the packaging was already open and looked old when i received it.</li>
            <li> this mascara was much darker than i anticipated... more like a black brown than a brown (i am a red head so i try to keep mascara more natural looking). the liquid definitely comes out a little thick and clumpy, you have to wipe it off on the sides, but it looks great once it&#x27;s on! i probably wont buy again, but it was worth a try</li>
            <li> Not the &amp;#34;Colossal Volume&amp;#34; I was hoping for. I think I will just stick with the cheap Maybelline mascara from here on out.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara! It washes off easily in the shower without the need for makeup remover but I&#x27;ve had no problem with it smearing, running or wearing off. I have allergies so was concerned about it running but so far so good! Since I wear contacts, I was concerned that it would flake off, but again, so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great also, I&#x27;ve been paying $14/tube for Clinique&#x27;s washable waterproof mascara and this was by far the better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good for length and volume as well, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highlights but doesn&#x27;t clump up</li>
            <li> This mascara is truly great. It doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes super long. I have been buying it for a long time and it never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I got the color glam brown and honestly my lashes look very full and natural. I would definitely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is the smell. It smells like straight up wax or medicine (chemical smell), idk. Besides the smell, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Having the sparse eyelashes of an older woman forced my search for a mascara that would help me at least look like I have some eyelashes. This mascara does the trick for me. Voila!</li>
            <li> Says glamor brown but it looks black to me. I was using it to cover up a gray patch in my beard</li>
            <li> I like this mascara. One reviewed said this makes better &amp;#34;false&amp;#34; lashes than the falsies. I have to agree. For a heavier look, apply multiple coats. Looks better than the Falsies. Can do a light lash or a heavy one depending on number of coats.</li>
