    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>this product its one or maybe the best moisturizer that i have tried</li>
            <li>It gives great results!</li>
            <li>This was a great purchase!</li>
            <li>good one for Oil skin people!!!!</li>
            <li>However this moisturizer is perfect for my skin!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect acne treatment because it&#x27;s in the form of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very good to use 15 minutes before you start applying make up.</li>
            <li>It works great and has greatly reduced my breakouts.</li>
            <li>, it is really good</li>
            <li>It is also fairly cheap for the great quality you get from it!</li>
            <li>I bought this upon good reviews, well I used it once &amp; my face felt like it was on fire.</li>
            <li>The good news is that it doesn&#x27;t make you break out, but I also didn&#x27;t notice a change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I like this product fairly well.</li>
            <li>But for my skin I love it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright but not as effective as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li>This keeps my face clear and moisturizes, it&#x27;s a great product, a must have!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s prone more to clogged pores than breakouts.  </li>
            <li>though, so make sure you wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I received more inflammation and bumps after using this product.</li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer</li>
            <li>it has a nice, light, scent-</li>
            <li>Also, many of them can clog your pores, and you end up with problems that you didn&#x27;t have before.</li>
            <li>And, after using it for a while, I feel that my skin has more of a refined look, as though I&#x27;ve just had a facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the elf acne fighting foundation during the day :)</li>
            <li>One of the most awesome products by clean &amp; clear.</li>
            <li>it doesnt look dry but after 5-7 days your skill should get used to this moisturizer, the best thing is that it doesnt have an odor.</li>
            <li>Not greasy light and easy on skin.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t available in stores.</li>
            <li>This product works great for both myself and my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li>Oil-Free Acne Moisturizer is so good that I will definitely purchase it again and again.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product to a friend, because it is just sooooo good.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone seeking a good, light, moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It really does sound like it works  </li>
            <li>nothing overpowering, and makes u feel fresh morning and night.</li>
            <li>On the one hand, I liked that it acted as both a moisturizer and acne medication, but I was worried the salicylic acid would be too drying on my skin, even though it&#x27;s only at 0.5%.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve avoided moisturizers for the obvious reasons -- they make your skin feel nice at first</li>
            <li>It dried my skin out more than moisturized and resulted in more breakouts.</li>
            <li>, the first day you try it your going to feel like is not doing anything you feel  </li>
            <li>Howeveer, Clean &amp; Clear Advantage</li>
            <li>The moisturizer itself is moderate thickness, more creme-like, but when it is on my face it feels really light-weight.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that I don&#x27;t get breakout too much now.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It kept my skin clean, soft and clear all the time.</li>
            <li>The Clean &amp; Clear exfoliating gel does the same thing.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with sensitive or even normal skin, because if it can clean up my daily oil slick, I&#x27;m sure it completely dries out people with a normal amount of oil.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is the ONLY kind that I have ever used that actually moisturizes my dry skin without breaking it out.</li>
            <li>it maintains your face clear of oil</li>
            <li>I have VERY acne prone skin and have tried numerous \\&quot;oil free\\</li>
            <li>Washing my face in the shower and using my old moisturizer hasn&#x27;t helped it yet</li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t really helped reduce my pimples, but it has evened out my tone and is working on reducing red marks and scarring from acne, as well as reducing the redness that results from acne.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this would work for more serious cases</li>
            <li>So if you put it on your face I would recommend the classic formula in the white bottle instead.</li>
            <li>I have realllly oily skin &amp; my face barely ever breaks out, &amp; I do have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Upon first applying it my face feels so soft; it absorbs quickly into my skin and does not leave a greasy or shiny film behind.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that when I get it near my eyes it causes my eyes to become irritated and get watery all day long.  </li>
            <li>The new formula in the grey bottle has a long list of ingredients including several kinds of bark extract, seed extract, etc.</li>

            <li> your skin dry even tho</li>
            <li> I have combination dry skin and this product doesnt work at all for me.  </li>
            <li> - the active ingredient is only 0.5% salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> It also goes on pretty thin</li>
            <li> I noticed there were tiny bumps all over the bottom half of my face where it was itching and burning.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it and went back to my Proactiv regimen for a few weeks then skinned cleared.</li>
            <li> Nothing cleared up her face prior to using this product, and believe me we&#x27;ve tried quite a few products on the market.</li>
            <li> I have also tried their clean and clear dual action moisturizer, which is horrible.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin, and it moisturized WITHOUT making me oily!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin: I have an extremely oily t-zone all the time and occasionally get really dry patches on my jaw around my mouth, usually during the winter or when I apply a lot of spot treatment without moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I like all the other products in this line except this one.</li>
            <li> definitely NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> This keeps the shine down all day with out clogging up my pores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typing now with a face full of painful lumps and bumps after using it for 2 days.</li>
            <li> and i have been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Money wasted.</li>
            <li> The bumps, burning and itching gets worse when I go in the sun even for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I load it on and my face still ends up feeling tight and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> When i apply it in the morning, my skin stays moisturized  til late afternoon if not all day!</li>
            <li> Any other acne medicine I have ever used had dried my face out so bad that it was like alligator skin, and peeled so bad.</li>
            <li> I also used it two times on Saturday and by Saturday evening, my face was feeling a bit swollen and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> My skin was at least stable before I started using this crap again;</li>
            <li> Also, i have bad acne, and this product helped reduce my breakouts  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The new formula in the grey bottle has a long list of ingredients including several kinds of bark extract, seed extract, etc. I noticed that when I get it near my eyes it causes my eyes to become irritated and get watery all day long.  This never happened with the same product in the white bottle.  So if you put it on your face I would recommend the classic formula in the white bottle instead.</li>
            <li> this product its one or maybe the best moisturizer that i have tried, it is really good it maintains your face clear of oil, the first day you try it your going to feel like is not doing anything you feel  your skin dry even tho it doesnt look dry but after 5-7 days your skill should get used to this moisturizer, the best thing is that it doesnt have an odor.</li>
            <li> One of the most awesome products by clean &amp; clear. It kept my skin clean, soft and clear all the time. I noticed that I don&#x27;t get breakout too much now. Very good to use 15 minutes before you start applying make up. It gives great results! Totally recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is the ONLY moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried them all...) that keeps me from being oily during the day.  I have very oily skin that&#x27;s prone more to clogged pores than breakouts.  This keeps the shine down all day with out clogging up my pores.  I wear it only during the day under sunscreen, and use a different anti-aging moisturizer at night.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with sensitive or even normal skin, because if it can clean up my daily oil slick, I&#x27;m sure it completely dries out people with a normal amount of oil.  But for my skin I love it!  No spf though, so make sure you wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I use this before bed and when I have breakouts. It is non-greasy, and very moisturizing. It is also fairly cheap for the great quality you get from it! I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received more inflammation and bumps after using this product. I stopped using it and went back to my Proactiv regimen for a few weeks then skinned cleared. I gave it another chance a yr later (blamed the reaction on \\&quot;the time of the month\\&quot;), because I wanted to believe there was an cheaper alternative to solve my acne problem. I&#x27;m typing now with a face full of painful lumps and bumps after using it for 2 days. My skin was at least stable before I started using this crap again; square one. The Clean &amp; Clear exfoliating gel does the same thing. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I won&#x27;t use it ever again. Into the garbage it goes.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all</li>
            <li> This product has a strange, sulphur like scent. I like all the other products in this line except this one.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase! I have VERY dry skin, and it moisturized WITHOUT making me oily! Also, i have bad acne, and this product helped reduce my breakouts  it has a nice, light, scent- nothing overpowering, and makes u feel fresh morning and night. i use it every night. When i apply it in the morning, my skin stays moisturized  til late afternoon if not all day! I definitely recommend this product to anyone seeking a good, light, moisturizer for sensitive skin. A+!</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t available in stores. It works great and has greatly reduced my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have combination dry skin and this product doesnt work at all for me.  I load it on and my face still ends up feeling tight and uncomfortable.  definitely NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this upon good reviews, well I used it once &amp; my face felt like it was on fire. I have realllly oily skin &amp; my face barely ever breaks out, &amp; I do have really sensitive skin. I had to immediately wash this off of my face, the next morning when I woke up my face felt like a reptile, it felt scaly &amp; gross.... Never using it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a bit of extra help in my moisturizer in controlling my acne. The good news is that it doesn&#x27;t make you break out, but I also didn&#x27;t notice a change in my skin.  It also goes on pretty thin so if you need something thicker for drier skin I would recommend something else.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the ONLY kind that I have ever used that actually moisturizes my dry skin without breaking it out. I have VERY acne prone skin and have tried numerous \\&quot;oil free\\&quot; things that simply did not moisturize! I have also tried their clean and clear dual action moisturizer, which is horrible. It dried my skin out more than moisturized and resulted in more breakouts. This stuff contains salicylic acid so it supposedly helps prevent breakouts. I think perhaps that&#x27;s why I can get away with using it. Bottom line: It moisturizes without breaking out acne prone skin.     This is the only moisturizer I will use. Period.</li>
            <li> This keeps my face clear and moisturizes, it&#x27;s a great product, a must have! I can&#x27;t find it in the stores so I&#x27;ll be ordering it online from here on out.</li>
            <li> I trust this on my face</li>
            <li> This did nothing to help my acne and i have been using it for a few weeks now. Money wasted.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work 100% at all. It really does sound like it works  but it doesnt. It doesnt get rid of acne</li>
            <li> good one for Oil skin people!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this item Friday and used it that night.  I also used it two times on Saturday and by Saturday evening, my face was feeling a bit swollen and uncomfortable.  It began to burn and itch on the lower parts of my cheeks, my chin, and under my chin.  I noticed there were tiny bumps all over the bottom half of my face where it was itching and burning.  Washing my face in the shower and using my old moisturizer hasn&#x27;t helped it yet and it&#x27;s Sunday evening.  The bumps, burning and itching gets worse when I go in the sun even for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This product works great for both myself and my teenage daughter. Nothing cleared up her face prior to using this product, and believe me we&#x27;ve tried quite a few products on the market.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my facial acne and made my skin too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does seem to help prevent breakouts on my chest though.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne so I don&#x27;t know if this would work for more serious cases - the active ingredient is only 0.5% salicylic acid.  The moisturizer itself is moderate thickness, more creme-like, but when it is on my face it feels really light-weight.  Usually I break out midway through my cycle or really whenever I&#x27;m in school, but I haven&#x27;t had a breakout yet with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always seen this in stores and debated about purchasing it.  On the one hand, I liked that it acted as both a moisturizer and acne medication, but I was worried the salicylic acid would be too drying on my skin, even though it&#x27;s only at 0.5%.  I have combination skin: I have an extremely oily t-zone all the time and occasionally get really dry patches on my jaw around my mouth, usually during the winter or when I apply a lot of spot treatment without moisturizing.  However this moisturizer is perfect for my skin!  Upon first applying it my face feels so soft; it absorbs quickly into my skin and does not leave a greasy or shiny film behind.  After about a week of continuous use (every day, morning and night) my oil production is under control.  My t-zone isn&#x27;t nearly as greasy and I wake up in the morning with soft skin, not an oil slick.  It also helps extend the life of my makeup and keeps shine at bay for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the salicylic acid, I have noticed improvements in my skin tone.  This hasn&#x27;t really helped reduce my pimples, but it has evened out my tone and is working on reducing red marks and scarring from acne, as well as reducing the redness that results from acne.  My complexion looks a lot clearer and healthier since using this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, I definitely recommend.  It around $6, it fits into almost anybody&#x27;s budget.</li>
            <li> Not greasy light and easy on skin. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a moisturizer to help with occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve avoided moisturizers for the obvious reasons -- they make your skin feel nice at first and then the shine begins. Also, many of them can clog your pores, and you end up with problems that you didn&#x27;t have before. Howeveer, Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Oil-Free Acne Moisturizer is so good that I will definitely purchase it again and again. (And I recommend it even if you do not break out.) Your skin will look and feel smoother, and there is no greasy look or feel even at the end of the day. And, after using it for a while, I feel that my skin has more of a refined look, as though I&#x27;ve just had a facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to a friend, because it is just sooooo good.</li>
            <li> I like this product fairly well. When I apply it I can see a difference in redness and smoothness to my skin. I will definately continue to use it</li>
            <li> This is the only acne medication that I can use that doesn&#x27;t burn my face to prices. Any other acne medicine I have ever used had dried my face out so bad that it was like alligator skin, and peeled so bad. My face would look like hamburger meat. Not with this though! It&#x27;s the perfect acne treatment because it&#x27;s in the form of a moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or anything. It treats my acne and soothes my skin. I have super oily skin so I only wear this at night after I take my makeup off and wash my face. If I&#x27;m not going anywhere or gonna wear makeup, I&#x27;ll put it on during the day after I shower. But usually only at night I wear it. I use the elf acne fighting foundation during the day :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright but not as effective as i thought it would be.</li>
