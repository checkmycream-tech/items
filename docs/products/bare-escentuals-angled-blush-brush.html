    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size and shape and quality.</li>
            <li>As a makeup enthusiast, I found it works best for contouring my cheekbones and putting on blush.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for blush along the cheekbones!</li>
            <li>awesome brush!</li>
            <li>The angle of the brush is just perfect to obtain beautiful results.</li>
            <li>happy customer üëç</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush hoping that it would be a good dupe of a Sigma Angle Brush.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush!</li>
            <li>but I still love this brush!</li>
            <li>They work perfectly with the Bare Escentuals products and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I would not be able to do blush without this brush, now that I have used it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>My favorite blush brush of all time.</li>
            <li>It might be better for contouring than blush application.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals has great products.</li>
            <li>This brush does a great job getting into smaller, contoured features of the face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft, blends really nicely, and most importantly-</li>
            <li>My blush goes on really smooth and you can get it just right with the angle</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find this at a cheaper price but with the same quality</li>
            <li>I use this brush every day with a darker color BM foundation for contouring, and with a very light Mineral Veil Illuminating powder for the highlighting at my eye brows, around and underneath my nostrils, the smile lines next to my mouth, and the tops of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly soft and easily taps out excess to help you control how much blush color you apply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush just didn&#x27;t realize it was gonna be a small brush.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and  sealed close very well.</li>
            <li>Really like the angle of this brush.</li>
            <li>works very well with BareMinerals blush products as well as with a Cover Girl blush.</li>
            <li>Be sure and rinse completely and let it dry</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li>It cleans thoroughly with just a little mild soap.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this brush, it is a little smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>In other reviews I&#x27;ve said how much I like Bare Escentuals brushes.  </li>
            <li>but,  for some reason the brush is smaller than the ones sold  at bare mineral counters.</li>

            <li> Mine has lasted for a long time and never bends or gets grungy</li>
            <li> This brush was much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Small enough handle to not be unwieldy but long enough</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, it is worthless unless you want it for very occassional use.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave behind stray bristles on my face!</li>
            <li> Resembles and reminds me of a mini broom that has been used badly.</li>
            <li> worthless-</li>
            <li> This brush is not dense and has hair sticking out like it was havinga bad hair day!  </li>
            <li> terrible brush, wish I never bought it!</li>

            <li> I bought this brush hoping that it would be a good dupe of a Sigma Angle Brush.  It is DEFINITELY NOTHING LIKE THAT BRUSH.  This brush is not dense and has hair sticking out like it was havinga bad hair day!  Resembles and reminds me of a mini broom that has been used badly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush just didn&#x27;t realize it was gonna be a small brush. Was looking for something bigger in size</li>
            <li> I love this brush. My blush goes on really smooth and you can get it just right with the angle</li>
            <li> In other reviews I&#x27;ve said how much I like Bare Escentuals brushes.  They work perfectly with the Bare Escentuals products and this one is no exception.

            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, it is worthless unless you want it for very occassional use. the bristles are rough and fall out frequently</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> My favorite blush brush of all time. It&#x27;s the perfect size and shape and quality. Mine has lasted for a long time and never bends or gets grungy</li>

            <li> This brush was much smaller than expected. It&#x27;s the same size as my travel brush. It might be better for contouring than blush application.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and  sealed close very well. happy customer üëç</li>
            <li> The brush is everything they said it would be.</li>
            <li> Really like the angle of this brush. works very well with BareMinerals blush products as well as with a Cover Girl blush. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! As a makeup enthusiast, I found it works best for contouring my cheekbones and putting on blush. It&#x27;s really soft, blends really nicely, and most importantly- it doesn&#x27;t leave behind stray bristles on my face!</li>
            <li> It does tend to puff out a lot when washed or used a lot but I still love this brush! Perfect size for blush along the cheekbones!</li>
            <li> awesome brush! I use it every day for contouring. Small enough handle to not be unwieldy but long enough that you can grip the tip for lighter applications to designated areas of your face.</li>
