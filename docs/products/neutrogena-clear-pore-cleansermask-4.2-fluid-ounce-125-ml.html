            <li>Amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best acne cleansing product there is out there.</li>
            <li>This mask/cleaner is excellent!!</li>
            <li>Great stuff!  </li>
            <li>The mask was good :</li>
            <li>and my wife have basically perfect skin, rarely a pimple ever forms for them.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>With the amount of money I save from not having to make a dermatology appointment and buy RX cleansers and medicine along with the beauty benefits make this an outstanding product!</li>
            <li>In fact, it is pretty awesome!</li>
            <li>I suppose I&#x27;m not being fair as I haven&#x27;t tried it as a mask yet, but the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be that great on my acne (which is mainly stubborn blackheads and some whiteheads).</li>
            <li>This is a great idea and useful for anyone who prefers to use Benzoyl Peroxide in a wash instead of a cream.</li>
            <li>Mostly use it for areas on my face where I have problems with blackheads.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the mask for about 8 mos and my skin is the nicest and most healthy it&#x27;s been in many years....</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the cooling effect of the cleanser however.  </li>
            <li>love it, love it, love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you will 2</li>
            <li>Okay, I observed my wife and my brother use this product upon the effusive recommendation of my sister-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, off the soapbox.  </li>
            <li>either when you consider that the better your skin looks, the better you feel.  </li>
            <li>Walgreens and most drug stores carry this.</li>
            <li>The product is perfect to use as a daily cleanser or as an intensive mask.</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels on my face as a mask.</li>
            <li>with moisturizer always and sunscreen for the day on top of moisturizer</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time whether it is as a wash or a mask it works great and keeps my face clear!</li>
            <li>so, this is economical as well as effective and luxurious cleaning for your face.  </li>
            <li>When used as a cleanser it has a cool clean feeling, nice too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, if I use this in conjunction with a very mild cleanser</li>
            <li>You can apply this before getting in the shower and it easily rinses away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I like to use it as a face wash and it truely gets rid of blackheads and breakouts :)</li>
            <li>You can feel a really cool tingly, refreshing sensation.</li>
            <li>This is also a wonderful product to use on large areas of your body, like your back in the summer, etc.</li>
            <li>I simply smooth a couple times a day for about the time it takes to brush teeth, and wash it off.  </li>
            <li>That is why I went to try the Oil Free Grapefruit cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been going to the dermatologist since the age of 9 for acne, and this product is just fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a month and my face is neat and oil free.  </li>
            <li>But overall this product is great.</li>
            <li>I am not saying it is the best, but I know two other good friends who see the same results I do.</li>
            <li>If I use this product (as the mask) twice a week it makes a significant difference in the amount of breakout I have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is rather drying, so you might want to use a more intense moisturizer on the day you use this</li>
            <li>I let it sit on my face while brushing my teeth or during the shower, then rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>it certainly is not a bad cleanser at all.</li>
            <li>Use this once a week if you have mild acne problem, or whenever u see a breakout.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel like normal healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I think Clean and Clear discontinued my favorite benzoyl peroxide wash, so I tried this one.</li>
            <li>And frankly the acne market is worth billions, so I tend to use affordable products if I can,</li>
            <li>I started using Neutrogena&#x27;s Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask in May 2010 when I started to suffer from (surprising) adult acne.  </li>
            <li>People who are irritated by benzoyle peroxide probably won&#x27;t have the same kind of experience I do.   </li>
            <li>If you plan on using it as a mask id consider not leaving it on for more than 5 minutes if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>Recommend this for someone who doesn&#x27;t even have acne but wants a good firm and refreshing mask.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It leaves my skin very, very  clean,  and *soft.</li>
            <li>I had smooth, normal sky.  </li>
            <li>My brother also uses this product to great effect as well, which I have observed over the past year.  </li>
            <li>Although, I recommend not to exceed 3-4 mins when using as a mask, since I experienced excessive drying afterwards.</li>
            <li>It has 3.5% benzoyl peroxide, 1% more than proactive, so it really keeps your skin clear.</li>
            <li>As a reference I am very very oily, acne prone, clog prone.</li>
            <li>My first impressions using it were that this cleanser did not sting and burn my face as the RX had done.  </li>
            <li>I had rapid improvement of both my regular acne and the rosacea on top of it.</li>
            <li>I stay clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>While I felt my skin was getting clearer, it wasn&#x27;t exactly keeping pimples at bay.  </li>
            <li>intense cooling feeling!?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li>if I wash in circles for 30 sec to a full minute and rinse well, my skin looks very clean and almost radiant.</li>
            <li>Like good hair styling cream/paste, a little dab does it all you need!  </li>
            <li>While not completely gone, my pores are reduced and many of them have vanished.  </li>
            <li>My skin is older and more sensitive and prefers natural cleansers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BP creams have always helped, but were not as effective as this mask, which really gets down in the pores.</li>
            <li>is the only product(from thousands of treatments I used) that made a huge diference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a very hash chemical, so that makes sense.</li>
            <li>but if anything my breakouts were coming closer together and getting more severe as I aged.</li>
            <li>I can really feel my skin cleaner after I use it</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t break out that much I used to.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Even my bf who never comments on my skin asked me why I was breaking out so much.</li>
            <li>After the eczema healed and a month or so went by, I tried adding just a dab of this into a much milder cleanser.</li>
            <li>If warm weather makes you break out, try this product a few times a week</li>
            <li>It is a rich, creamy clay-like mask that instantly dissolves when water is applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had eczema before, and after ruling out many other products, conditions, etc...</li>
            <li>I also use this with the Neutrogena Wave Duo, I rinse out the soap from the disposable pads and use it to deep clean my face.</li>
            <li>more like faceburning, feeling like i&#x27;m talking to Sirius Black via the floo network with my head in a fire, bacteria burning away in a sludge of lava-like facemask feeling.  </li>
            <li>No prescriptions, no panicked spot treatment of painful blemishes or pustules...just perfect skin for me.  </li>
            <li>So, its gentle on the BP sensitive.</li>
            <li>Over a year later, I rarely have breakouts and when I do, I apply the cleanser as a mask for 5 minutes twice a day and the blemish is gone within two days.  </li>
            <li>He has normal but acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>While ones already on my face cleared sooner, new pimples would pop up and clear just as fast.  </li>
            <li>Working super as a mask even on my sensitive skin - I only use it on the oily bits, though.</li>
            <li>It does an okay job of preventing new formations, but its not touching what I already have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many benzoyl peroxide products in the past, and never had any issues.</li>
            <li>just a very trouble prone face for most of my adult life.   </li>
            <li>It may burn, cause rednesss and even make skin super dry if used to much or too long.</li>
            <li>my skin looks clear.</li>
            <li>Clear concealing treatment stick</li>
            <li>Clear Pore Cleanser OR Neutrogena Blackhead Cleaners as a wash every night, as a mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Formula 10.0.5 mud mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Apricot</li>
            <li>I will use this maybe, once a month or after a long hot summer day.</li>
            <li>I had was nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my early forties now with skin that has been trouble-prone since I hit my teens...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not harsh or abrasive like some others are -</li>
            <li>Avoid if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to buy this from here because I cant seem to find it in Duane reade but why is the price 18.99, double the cost at the store.</li>
            <li>indeed, my skin has become less sensitive and reactive and is calm and feels good when it used to be angry and irritated all the time.  </li>
            <li>This particular Neutrogena product seems to be different.</li>
            <li>At first I discontinued use, but I had so much (2 bottles) that I didn&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately stress, diet and hormones have a significant affect on my acne, which can be anything from mild to severe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still made my hands painfully dry, so I can&#x27;t really get any use out of this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to get this one labeled Cleanser/Mask or you might just get a face wash which is used up in no time and far too thin.  </li>
            <li>Even though it helped get rid of my pimples faster, though not altogether, I actually threw this product away when it was still half full.  </li>
            <li>- its decent for people wth dry</li>
            <li>And it feels soft from the tiny, tiny exfoliation</li>
            <li>No dry patches, redness, or peeling.  </li>
            <li>There was some stinging sensation the first few times I used it, but no longer.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is very much the consistency of a mask and, therefore, it takes a little bit extra time to get off your fingers.  </li>
            <li>Compared to THAT hot mess, this is a gem!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a month and a half.  There was some stinging sensation the first few times I used it, but no longer.  Mostly use it for areas on my face where I have problems with blackheads.  While not completely gone, my pores are reduced and many of them have vanished.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> This product has replaced my Proactive cleanser. It has 3.5% benzoyl peroxide, 1% more than proactive, so it really keeps your skin clear. CAn be used as a mask and cleanser. It is non irritating, and does not dry my face out. Dissolves oil too. I use the benzoyl peroxide moisturizer (step 3) from proactive. This is the only product that always works and does not irritate my skin, with exfoliants. I also use this with the Neutrogena Wave Duo, I rinse out the soap from the disposable pads and use it to deep clean my face.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser and tend to recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many,many fancy and store bought brands and the Neutrogena CPM seems to help keep my break outs to a minimum. I am not saying it is the best, but I know two other good friends who see the same results I do. It just works for us. Unfortunately stress, diet and hormones have a significant affect on my acne, which can be anything from mild to severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if I use this in conjunction with a very mild cleanser my skin looks clear. I have also noticed, if I wash in circles for 30 sec to a full minute and rinse well, my skin looks very clean and almost radiant. And it feels soft from the tiny, tiny exfoliation beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is too drying, but as a cleanser, I prefer it to proactiv. And frankly the acne market is worth billions, so I tend to use affordable products if I can, that work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: October 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using this product. My skin is older and more sensitive and prefers natural cleansers. I will use this maybe, once a month or after a long hot summer day. But sadly, it dries me out horribly now and irritates my skin which it never used to. I have heard some people say you can develop sensitivity to b peroxide. It is a very hash chemical, so that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I started using Neutrogena&#x27;s Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask in May 2010 when I started to suffer from (surprising) adult acne.  I had deep, painful acne cysts around my jawline and cheeks that didn&#x27;t seem to go away despite the use of harsh RX cleansers and gels.  With my sensitive skin, the harsh formula of the RXs seemed to just my skin raw, chapped, and aching.  On a whim, I decided to try the Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask because of the Benzoyl Peroxide formula that was similar to the RX but without some of the other additives.  My first impressions using it were that this cleanser did not sting and burn my face as the RX had done.  After about three days of using the product, I began to notice that the size of my acne cysts had decreased considerably and were less painful and red in appearance.  By week two of using the product, I had no new breakouts and the acne I had was nearly gone.  Additionally, my skin seemed to be handling the formula well- I had smooth, normal sky.  No dry patches, redness, or peeling.  Over a year later, I rarely have breakouts and when I do, I apply the cleanser as a mask for 5 minutes twice a day and the blemish is gone within two days.  The only negative point about this cleanser is that it can be hard to wash off your hands and face.  The cleanser is very much the consistency of a mask and, therefore, it takes a little bit extra time to get off your fingers.  I recommend using a washcloth to wipe away the cleanser from your face (and also to provide a bit of exfoliation for your skin).  With the amount of money I save from not having to make a dermatology appointment and buy RX cleansers and medicine along with the beauty benefits make this an outstanding product!</li>
            <li> This product was nothing short of miraculous for me. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early forties now with skin that has been trouble-prone since I hit my teens...and while I have used various and sundry products to control breakouts from acne and rosacea (which started about age 40), including retin A cream,  topical and systemic antibiotics, and every sort of over the counter cleanser, these treatments helps but if anything my breakouts were coming closer together and getting more severe as I aged. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the mask for about 8 mos and my skin is the nicest and most healthy it&#x27;s been in many years....I had rapid improvement of both my regular acne and the rosacea on top of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Caution - I&#x27;ve never had any benzoyle peroxide sensitivity. People who are irritated by benzoyle peroxide probably won&#x27;t have the same kind of experience I do.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BP creams have always helped, but were not as effective as this mask, which really gets down in the pores. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use it heavily.  I apply it either before I brush my teeth or before I get in the shower.  It is cool and refreshing.  I usually let it sit as a mask for a few minutes before I rinse off, although sometimes I use it just as a cleanser when my skin needs freshening...like after I&#x27;ve walked through a cloud of someones cigarette smoke. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin very, very  clean,  and *soft.*  I have never had any dryness or irritation from this product at all...indeed, my skin has become less sensitive and reactive and is calm and feels good when it used to be angry and irritated all the time.  The dryness others warn of has never been an issue for me.  it makes my skin feel like normal healthy skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Working outside in the heat or cleaning in a dusty, dirty environment used to cause my skin to break out.  Now before cleaning or working I will actually put a bit of this mask on- wne I am done,  my skin is none the worse the wear for the activity... I stay clear and smooth.  I guess it blocks the irritants or stops the sebaceous glands from making my pores either block or become a haven for bacteria. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do not have serious acne all over my body...just a very trouble prone face for most of my adult life.   The benzoyle peroxide mask has ended this trouble for me.  I simply smooth a couple times a day for about the time it takes to brush teeth, and wash it off.  No prescriptions, no panicked spot treatment of painful blemishes or pustules...just perfect skin for me.  Amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Working super as a mask even on my sensitive skin - I only use it on the oily bits, though.</li>
            <li> This is the best acne cleansing product there is out there. Do not waste money on expensive stuff and kits and blah. Use this once a week if you have mild acne problem, or whenever u see a breakout. The key in usage is to massage slowly all over and take 1 min at least to do that and at least another minute to rinse it off. Also, use very less detergent/bleach, and no fabric softener on towels u use with your face. Trust me, this last tip does it.</li>
            <li> I want to know what all the hype is about...it certainly is not a bad cleanser at all. In fact, it is pretty awesome! Usually (with panoxyl(sp?)at least) benzoyl peroxide - the main acne fighter in this product - dries me out and irritated my skin. So, its gentle on the BP sensitive. Also, (I don&#x27;t like it but) it does have menthol which gives the \\&quot;wake up\\&quot; cooling sensation. I suppose I&#x27;m not being fair as I haven&#x27;t tried it as a mask yet, but the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be that great on my acne (which is mainly stubborn blackheads and some whiteheads). It does an okay job of preventing new formations, but its not touching what I already have. That is why I went to try the Oil Free Grapefruit cleanser. BAD IDEA. Compared to THAT hot mess, this is a gem!</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser because the Oil-Free Acne Cleanser didn&#x27;t seem to be getting rid of my pimples.  I was drawn to the product because it can be used as a regular lathering cleanser or a 5-minute mask.  While I felt my skin was getting clearer, it wasn&#x27;t exactly keeping pimples at bay.  While ones already on my face cleared sooner, new pimples would pop up and clear just as fast.  I enjoyed the cooling effect of the cleanser however.  Even though it helped get rid of my pimples faster, though not altogether, I actually threw this product away when it was still half full.  Read the ingredients and warnings very carefully because it states plainly that product &#x27;may&#x27; bleach hair or fabrics.  &#x27;May&#x27; is an understatement.  I have mocha-colored towels that have orange streaks from this product and blue towels that have white streaks because of this cleanser.  Not exactly sure what&#x27;s in it that makes the cleanser bleach towels and hair, but I wish I had read the warnings on the bottle before purchase.  After I found my ruined towels, I thought I should just rinse my face extra well, which did nothing to alleviate the problem.  Either don&#x27;t buy this product because your stuff will get bleached from residue that won&#x27;t come off your face or simply use/buy a white towel to dry with.</li>
            <li> intense cooling feeling!?  more like faceburning, feeling like i&#x27;m talking to Sirius Black via the floo network with my head in a fire, bacteria burning away in a sludge of lava-like facemask feeling.  I ADORE this product.  I&#x27;ve been going to the dermatologist since the age of 9 for acne, and this product is just fabulous.  Even after six months of accutane, the only side effects in my very-sensitive skin were facial redness for about half an hour and having to hear the agonized screams of the bacteria on my skin being burned away.  love it, love it, love it.  I would recommend this product to just about anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having acne since 13, now I&#x27;m 24.This is the only product(from thousands of treatments I used) that made a huge diference in my skin.I can really feel my skin cleaner after I use it and I don&#x27;t break out that much I used to.It even helps with post acne marks.  The only down side is that I find it very hard and the shipping costs are bigger than the product itself.But it woths every penny.</li>
            <li> This product works and does help get rid of acne. If you plan on using it as a mask id consider not leaving it on for more than 5 minutes if you have sensitive skin like me. It may burn, cause rednesss and even make skin super dry if used to much or too long. I like to use it as a face wash and it truely gets rid of blackheads and breakouts :)</li>
            <li> This mask/cleaner is excellent!! it cleans and I exspecially like the mask. You can feel a really cool tingly, refreshing sensation. it&#x27;s like u can feel it working!! I really like it and I&#x27;m sure you will 2</li>
            <li> Okay, I observed my wife and my brother use this product upon the effusive recommendation of my sister-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister-in-law and my wife have basically perfect skin, rarely a pimple ever forms for them.  My brother also uses this product to great effect as well, which I have observed over the past year.  My wife uses this as a routine facial cleanser, then she applies moisturizer after she&#x27;s done.  She does not get irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think a lot of commercial cosmetic products are super expensive, over rated items that take advantage of the \\&quot;newest fad\\&quot;. -- Okay, off the soapbox.  This particular Neutrogena product seems to be different.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m over 50, I can&#x27;t believe I still get acne.  I found this product on a whim and use it 3-4 times a week.  It&#x27;s a thick white cooling gel that you can wash off immediately or wait and use it like a mask.  I can&#x27;t believe that it has cleared up my skin and tightened up pores.  I truly wish I had this as a teenager.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it over-drying.  It&#x27;s not expensive either when you consider that the better your skin looks, the better you feel.  Great stuff!  Walgreens and most drug stores carry this.</li>
            <li> The mask was good :-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros :- its decent for people wth dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons :-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve sensitive skin it will cause redness.</li>
            <li> This product broke me out something crazy. Even my bf who never comments on my skin asked me why I was breaking out so much. I gave it to my little brother and it also broke him out. As a reference I am very very oily, acne prone, clog prone. He has normal but acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Like good hair styling cream/paste, a little dab does it all you need!  so, this is economical as well as effective and luxurious cleaning for your face.  Recommend this for someone who doesn&#x27;t even have acne but wants a good firm and refreshing mask.  Put it on before shower and let it dry then lather in the shower/bath, etc.  the newest variety seems to have beads in it, which I don&#x27;t like.  Make sure to get this one labeled Cleanser/Mask or you might just get a face wash which is used up in no time and far too thin.  This stuff is the bomb!  I&#x27;m not really girly and I hardly wear any makeup but I like my hair styled just-so and like the cleanliness of this mask.  Also, it&#x27;s not harsh or abrasive like some others are - like I tried a Noxzema cream wash/mask - no no no no OUCH!  Neutrogena is the gold-standard in OTC washes anyway - just get it!</li>
            <li> This is a great idea and useful for anyone who prefers to use Benzoyl Peroxide in a wash instead of a cream. I like using this once every few weeks to kill the bacteria that can cause blackheads. It is a rich, creamy clay-like mask that instantly dissolves when water is applied. You can apply this before getting in the shower and it easily rinses away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the product penetrates into your pores, you feel a cooling sensation. This is also a wonderful product to use on large areas of your body, like your back in the summer, etc. If warm weather makes you break out, try this product a few times a week and I think you will see a difference in the clearness of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is rather drying, so you might want to use a more intense moisturizer on the day you use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.5% Benzoyl Peroxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also look for Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear concealing treatment stick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many benzoyl peroxide products in the past, and never had any issues. I think Clean and Clear discontinued my favorite benzoyl peroxide wash, so I tried this one. My face felt dry and tight, but didn&#x27;t react too badly. It was a bit too harsh for daily use, so I had a milder cleanser for every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real issue is that, for the first time in my life, my hands broke out in terrible eczema. I&#x27;ve never had eczema before, and after ruling out many other products, conditions, etc...I found out this was the culprit. At first I discontinued use, but I had so much (2 bottles) that I didn&#x27;t want to waste it. After the eczema healed and a month or so went by, I tried adding just a dab of this into a much milder cleanser. It still made my hands painfully dry, so I can&#x27;t really get any use out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but something about this cleanser HATES my hands. Avoid if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect to use as a daily cleanser or as an intensive mask. I&#x27;ve used it for a month and my face is neat and oil free.  Although, I recommend not to exceed 3-4 mins when using as a mask, since I experienced excessive drying afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have always had fairly bad acne. If I use this product (as the mask) twice a week it makes a significant difference in the amount of breakout I have.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to buy this from here because I cant seem to find it in Duane reade but why is the price 18.99, double the cost at the store. I guess ill keep looking elsewhere. But overall this product is great.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time whether it is as a wash or a mask it works great and keeps my face clear!</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my face as a mask. When used as a cleanser it has a cool clean feeling, nice too.</li>
            <li> I have an oily forehead with dry nose and cheeks. I get blackheads and sometimes acne, especially if I don&#x27;t follow my skin reggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is white and thick, clay-like. It tingles on the skin. I let it sit on my face while brushing my teeth or during the shower, then rinse with cool water. I use every night, as a mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin reggie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Cream Cleanser every morning&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser OR Neutrogena Blackhead Cleaners as a wash every night, as a mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Formula 10.0.5 mud mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Apricot Scrub once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change pillowcases every few days&lt;br /&gt;Use a separate towel for face only, change every few days&lt;br /&gt;Wash face morning and night&lt;br /&gt;Follow with moisturizer always and sunscreen for the day on top of moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Try not to touch my face, don&#x27;t pick blemishes</li>
