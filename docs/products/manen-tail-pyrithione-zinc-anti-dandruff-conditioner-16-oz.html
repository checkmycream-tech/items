            <li>Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST DANDRUFF SHAMPOO EVER</li>
            <li>works wonderful and smells great</li>
            <li>and my hair smells soooo good!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it was great at doing either of these things.  </li>
            <li>So happy to find a dandruff shampoo ad conditioner that won&#x27;t fade the color.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely, smells great.</li>
            <li>I believe its just that good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>OMG if you have or know of someone with Dandruff this product is the absolute best .</li>
            <li>Very healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>Seems to make it more manageable.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is safe for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I have dandruff issues, and needed a color safe shampoo to use that would also stave off my dandruff.</li>
            <li>out of all of the shampoo and hair products we have used on my daughter&#x27;s dry frizzy hair, this has worked the best.  </li>
            <li>Love Mane and Tail - makes my hair feel squeaky clean and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>The original one did soften my hair though</li>
            <li>and it never feels clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>You can tell your hair is clean as you rinse out the product.  </li>
            <li>(my color faded quickly, but I don&#x27;t know if I would attribute it to this shampoo or not).  </li>
            <li>Cleared up my dandruff quickly.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing  and works better than any other shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I love that my hair feels soft all over and no oily feeling.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can complain about is that I guess the medicine for the dandruff control is very strong because after using it your scalp will burn temporarily.</li>
            <li>Came quick and works very well</li>
            <li>After first use my hair feels lite and my dandruff seems to be controlled.</li>
            <li>it for the first time tonight</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>Very creamy.</li>
            <li>My scalp is pretty sensitive, so it might work better for other people.</li>
            <li>I have an incredibly sensitive scalp and it seemed to dry me out more.</li>
            <li>I have been using main &amp; tail conditioner for years</li>
            <li>Now that I am older</li>
            <li>Being that I am tex-laxed, this shampoo and conditioner works very well and keeps my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and this combination worked wonders.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is light, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>Took care of my dandruff issue and my hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is so soft and manageable now.  </li>
            <li>His beard has completely cleared of all dandruff and the olive oil in the set has helped keep his beard smoother and in control.</li>
            <li>and I have even tried a prescription steroid that was applied directly to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Smells a bit old lady and powdery.</li>
            <li>I have  no regrets.  </li>
            <li>I am a 25 year old white woman with highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li>(I grew my hair from my shoulders to my waist in a few months with the normal conditioner), and I was surprised to see that the brand offered dandruff options.  </li>
            <li>My husbands beard was getting a bit icky with dandruff, and I remembered using Mane &#x27;n Tail as a kid and how amazing it was for my thick curly hair.</li>

            <li> I felt like my dandruff got a little worse after using this, and couldn&#x27;t really say either way if it maintained my color very well</li>
            <li> Have tired numerous shampoos and this is the first one I have found that controls the scalp scaling.  </li>

            <li> It makes my hair feel heavy</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell of it either.  </li>
            <li> No more itch.</li>
            <li> Conditioner does not make scalp issue worse as others have.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a dramatic difference in how my hair feels, and the moisture added to my scalp.  </li>

            <li> Love Mane and Tail - makes my hair feel squeaky clean and leaves no residue.  Seems to make it more manageable.</li>
            <li> After first use my hair feels lite and my dandruff seems to be controlled. Good product.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Works wonderfully. This shampoo is safe for color-treated hair. It has olive oil in it too. Lathers nicely, smells great. No more itch. The conditioner is light, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I&#x27;ve always used Mane and Tail but didn&#x27;t know they had an anti-dandruff until Amazon. I have waist length hair. Very healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> Took care of my dandruff issue and my hair is soft and shiny.  Have tired numerous shampoos and this is the first one I have found that controls the scalp scaling.  Conditioner does not make scalp issue worse as others have.</li>
            <li> Hair tends to get greasy by the end of the day when using this. It makes my hair feel heavy and it never feels clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Being that I am tex-laxed, this shampoo and conditioner works very well and keeps my hair very soft.  The only thing I can complain about is that I guess the medicine for the dandruff control is very strong because after using it your scalp will burn temporarily.</li>

            <li> out of all of the shampoo and hair products we have used on my daughter&#x27;s dry frizzy hair, this has worked the best.  Her hair is so soft and manageable now.  She uses this with the shine and anit friz serum.</li>
            <li> I was worried this would make my hair feel dry.  I have a very sensitive scalp and this combination worked wonders.  You can tell your hair is clean as you rinse out the product.  Other products leave that silky feel...  but I often wonder if the silky feel is due to the product not rinsing well from my hair.  Definitely treats dry scalp.  I have noticed a dramatic difference in how my hair feels, and the moisture added to my scalp.  This will be my choice for regular use.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: After using this for about a week I have flakes again. Now using Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for the first time tonight and I&#x27;m in love! One use and I have no flakes and my hair smells soooo good! Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> works wonderful and smells great</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST DANDRUFF SHAMPOO EVER</li>
            <li> I bought this after dyeing my hair a semi-permanent color.  I have dandruff issues, and needed a color safe shampoo to use that would also stave off my dandruff. I can&#x27;t say that it was great at doing either of these things.  I felt like my dandruff got a little worse after using this, and couldn&#x27;t really say either way if it maintained my color very well (my color faded quickly, but I don&#x27;t know if I would attribute it to this shampoo or not).  My scalp is pretty sensitive, so it might work better for other people.</li>
            <li> OMG if you have or know of someone with Dandruff this product is the absolute best . You can&#x27;t find a product like this on  store shelves  that tackles  dandruff I believe its just that good. Thumbs Up.</li>
            <li> My husbands beard was getting a bit icky with dandruff, and I remembered using Mane &#x27;n Tail as a kid and how amazing it was for my thick curly hair. His beard has completely cleared of all dandruff and the olive oil in the set has helped keep his beard smoother and in control.</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year old white woman with highlighted hair.  I have suffered from dandruff for years.  I have tried every over the counter shampoo and I have even tried a prescription steroid that was applied directly to my scalp.  The only things that have worked in the past were prescription or the green head and shoulders.  This product takes the cake.  I have been using main &amp; tail conditioner for years (I grew my hair from my shoulders to my waist in a few months with the normal conditioner), and I was surprised to see that the brand offered dandruff options.  This actually works.  Not only does it get rid of the flakes, it also keeps the itching at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the price -- the bottles are regular sized.  ALSO - The products have a BLUE TINT, so fake redheads beware.  This did tone my blonde highlights down a bit.  No major change; it just took the brassy-ness out (which is a plus in my book).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I have an incredibly sensitive scalp and it seemed to dry me out more.</li>
            <li> Been a Mane &amp; Tail user for years. Always worked before. Now that I am older I hope it still will.</li>
            <li> Came quick and works very well</li>
            <li> After the first use, my hair got extra itchy than before :( this didn&#x27;t help my hair .. The original one did soften my hair though</li>
            <li> So happy to find a dandruff shampoo ad conditioner that won&#x27;t fade the color.</li>
            <li> Just received this yesterday and tried it out this morning. Makes my hair feel really dry and made my hair tangled after getting out of th shower. My hair feels heavy, dull, and my scalp feels dry too.  Not a huge fan of the smell of it either.  Smells a bit old lady and powdery.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my dandruff quickly. Very creamy.</li>
