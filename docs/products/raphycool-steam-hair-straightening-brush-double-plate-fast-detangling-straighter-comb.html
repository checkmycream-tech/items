            <li>One of the best &#x27;as seen on TV...&#x27; things I&#x27;ve ever gotten - worked much better than expected!!</li>
            <li>as it is described, there is a special design of container on the top of the machine to store hair conditioner or hair treatment products, helps the hair to absorb the nutrition while curling the hair.</li>

            <li> I STILL HAVE DIFFICULT DOING MY OWN HAIR.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure it takes any shorter of a time to curl hair then a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> So I was pretty skeptical aboutthis RC curling machine</li>
            <li> Only negative aspect is the one I received it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure the curls come out as well as it would if I had shorter hair.</li>
            <li> bought the wrong color, my baby easily left her little dirty print on it.well, my mistake.</li>
            <li> But difficult for me to use it.</li>
            <li> Wrap the hair from the base of the curling iron to the tip in a downward direction.</li>
