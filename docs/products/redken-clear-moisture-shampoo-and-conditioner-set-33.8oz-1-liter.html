            <li>Excellent price and very fast service</li>
            <li>product is great for any kind of hair - mine is damaged and very dry - and it works great!</li>
            <li>use about a quarter (sometimes a bit more)</li>
            <li>Every time I go, she says my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li>Should have known better....</li>
            <li>My hair is more frizzy than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I have tried most of them.  </li>
            <li>love the price and ease of ordering shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Now her hair is shiny and her scalp is healthy.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love the smell</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have just about shoulder length hair and its nice and light.</li>
            <li>I love Redken.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes  my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>It was just okay</li>
            <li>I have used better products and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice lather and hair feels clean without product buildup or overly stripping hair.  </li>
            <li>She has very curly hair and needs a great conditioner to make combing her hair easy.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers well, rinses easily and my hair feels lovely.</li>
            <li>It smells real fresh too.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be pretty happy with the large sizes.</li>
            <li>and I was fine.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was packaged just fine.</li>
            <li>Super price for the duo!</li>
            <li>Worked OK but the real product is much better.</li>
            <li>I love Redken products, and this particular combination leaves my hair feeling healthy and protected.  </li>
            <li>I have numerous allergies and although this product has a light pleasant scent it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze...</li>
            <li>Much better price than the salons, and ships fast!  </li>
            <li>This product makes your hair feel clean.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty oily asian hair, and the shampoo does a great job at leaving my hair clean, while the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too oily.</li>
            <li>I loved it and could not find larger bottles in my city so ordered them online.  </li>
            <li>Perfect makes my hair soft and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>so i keep them filled rather than fight these big bottles, and it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; take much (because its effective)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m accustomed to, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Very upset!</li>
            <li>and I needed to use a lot of the product to feel as if my hair was soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fresh smell of the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Adds moisture and helps keep hair smooth, shiny and healthy, without weighing hair down.  </li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the smell, but besides that it works very well and leaves my hair soft and still full of body.</li>
            <li>Buying the large bottles makes sense, and unlike some brands, the scent does not change over time.</li>
            <li>It is actually squeaky clean to be exact.  </li>
            <li>I have fine straight blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>Really tames my dry/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very cost-effective.</li>
            <li>Has anyone else had an issue feeling like this wasn&#x27;t the real thing?</li>
            <li>Either won&#x27;t buy this brand again, or will be more careful when purchasing online...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for the perfumy apricot scent.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Was nice to find such a big bottle at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my teenage daughter who is mixed with black/white.  </li>
            <li>I just put the cap back on and turn it upside down to make sure I get every ml out.</li>
            <li>I bought this large size after trying smaller bottles from a salon.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Redken Clear Moisture shampoo and conditioner for years and hope Redken NEVER stops making it.</li>
            <li>I will not waste my money again.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly(mostly wavy) hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this on both me and my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair is soft and shiny</li>
            <li>/&gt;They may seem costly but so far a bottle lasts over 6 months when used with the inexpensive dispensing pumps sold elsewhere on Amazon.</li>
            <li>, I could barely get a brush through my hair.</li>
            <li>and apparently my stylist was correct in saying it is a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>nice for dry hair, but not too heavy to weigh hair down</li>
            <li>The results from using this product are positive, shining hair that is not weighed down.</li>
            <li>After switching to another salon brand after being prodded into it by the salon I realized I had major allergies to those products and would constantly be scratching my scalp.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and would not use anything else for my thin hair.</li>

            <li> Give it a try you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> So unfortunately, this product I had to return.</li>
            <li> It made my head itch so bad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. Your hair will not feel heavy or dry after using. Super price for the duo!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really tames my dry/curly hair.  Gentle.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Definitely a knock-off. Worked OK but the real product is much better. I will not waste my money again.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo and conditioner, great price. I am not crazy about the smell, but besides that it works very well and leaves my hair soft and still full of body.</li>
            <li> Redken is one of the best shampoo/conditioners out there! I have been using Redken products for years.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for any kind of hair - mine is damaged and very dry - and it works great! Also, the smell is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go with these bottles because of the price, and I am very happy with this purchase. You receive both bottles, the amount is as advertised, and it came in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about a quarter (sometimes a bit more) and I get about a years-worth of use. Very cost-effective.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. My hairdresser recommended it. Every time I go, she says my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li> A great product. Much better price than the salons, and ships fast!  Made a noticeable difference in my hair, my stylist said so!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year.  My hair responds great to it.  It smells real fresh too.</li>
            <li> Very upset! Should have known better....product expired and may not even be actually redken in bottle. Will never buy again! Beware buyers!!</li>
            <li> I bought this large size after trying smaller bottles from a salon.  I loved it and could not find larger bottles in my city so ordered them online.  I was so disappointed it did not seem the same at all, I could barely get a brush through my hair. I have switched shampoos all together</li>
            <li> Smells like chemicals and scared me when using it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Perfect makes my hair soft and fluffy.  Will be buying this product on the regular.  Keep it comming please and thankyou</li>
            <li> I love Redken products, and this particular combination leaves my hair feeling healthy and protected.  Buying the large bottles makes sense, and unlike some brands, the scent does not change over time. Just cannot imagine switching to anything else.</li>
            <li> Has anyone else had an issue feeling like this wasn&#x27;t the real thing? I&#x27;d like to give the benefit of the doubt, but there&#x27;s hardly any scent, no moisturization, hardly any lather? Seems like dial soap in the Redken Bottle. I bought it because it was such a luxurious experience at the salon - not at all the same here. Either won&#x27;t buy this brand again, or will be more careful when purchasing online...</li>
            <li> nice for dry hair, but not too heavy to weigh hair down</li>
            <li> My hair is long and I am in my 50&#x27;s.  My hair is more frizzy than it used to be.  This stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> Redken has a great line of products. I have tried most of them.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue the ones I like.</li>
            <li> love the price and ease of ordering shampoo.  I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and would not use anything else for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product at the salon in much smaller quantities. Was nice to find such a big bottle at a decent price.</li>
            <li> My daughter discovered this shampoo after going to a local salon and they recommended this for her. She&#x27;d been using all types of dandruff shampoos but this worked like a miracle. Now her hair is shiny and her scalp is healthy.</li>
            <li> Great product. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for about 2 years and don&#x27;t like using any other shampoo/conditioner. I have pretty oily asian hair, and the shampoo does a great job at leaving my hair clean, while the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too oily. Using these big bottles can be cumbersome, but just purchase a couple of squirt tops for them and you&#x27;ll be pretty happy with the large sizes.</li>
            <li> wife loves it i dont use it</li>
            <li> This set adds moisture to my hair, allowing my curls to come out.</li>
            <li> Great product! Since I started getting highlights, my hair tends to be drier. The results from using this product are positive, shining hair that is not weighed down. Give it a try you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> It works good but I don&#x27;t love the smell</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner!  I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner worked great and my hair looked good.  I didn&#x27;t really care for the perfumy apricot scent.  The reason I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars, though is because I was allergic to it!  It made my head itch so bad I thought I had lice or something!  After about a week with a different shampoo and conditioner, scalp calmed down and I was fine.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, it is obviously not real redkin. I have bought this product from the salon and I thought I would give it a shot to order on line and apparently my stylist was correct in saying it is a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; product. I ended up returning because it not only smelled different than the real product, it smelled so bad It almost made me sick. So unfortunately, this product I had to return.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. I have just about shoulder length hair and its nice and light.</li>
            <li> I love Redken.  This product makes your hair feel clean.  It is actually squeaky clean to be exact.  I love the way it makes  my hair feel.  I have naturally curly(mostly wavy) hair.  So, frizz is a problem all the time.  This is a very good shampoo and conditioner.  I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at the recommendation of a friend.  It arrived on time and was packaged just fine. it just didn&#x27;t work as wonderful as my friend said it would work or as great as the reviews said it would.  I originally bought it for my teenage daughter who is mixed with black/white.  She has very curly hair and needs a great conditioner to make combing her hair easy. This did not work as well as expected.  I used the product to see how it would work on my hair.  I have fine straight blonde hair.  It was just okay and I needed to use a lot of the product to feel as if my hair was soft and tangle free.  I have used better products and cheaper.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and very fast service</li>
            <li> I really like the fresh smell of the shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;m not one for fruity smells in my hair. The shampoo lathers well, rinses easily and my hair feels lovely. The conditioner leaves my hair very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a pump dispenser for a 1L bottle from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply for less than $3 to use with this. One squirt of that was a perfect amount and also economical. The downside to the dispenser is there&#x27;s still contents left in the bottle when it stops working. I just put the cap back on and turn it upside down to make sure I get every ml out. Of course, the conditioner lasts longer than the shampoo as I didn&#x27;t condition every time.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Adds moisture and helps keep hair smooth, shiny and healthy, without weighing hair down.  I have very thick naturally wavy/curly hair.  I use this on both me and my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  Has a nice lather and hair feels clean without product buildup or overly stripping hair.  No strong scent.  Great price, much better than you can find in a retail store.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff!!  I recommend it.  A bit more expensive thank I&#x27;m accustomed to, but it is worth it.  I have smaller bottles so i keep them filled rather than fight these big bottles, and it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; take much (because its effective)  Cleans and lifts my hair</li>
            <li> I have been using Redken Clear Moisture shampoo and conditioner for years and hope Redken NEVER stops making it. I have numerous allergies and although this product has a light pleasant scent it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze... don&#x27;t know if it will you. Also have skin allergies and these products do not make me break out or itch. After switching to another salon brand after being prodded into it by the salon I realized I had major allergies to those products and would constantly be scratching my scalp. After trying almost every one of their products and a hypo-allergenic line I got from the drugstore (which was not great and made me itch) I switched back to Redken and will never stray again. Hair is soft and shiny which is what I look for in hair products.&lt;br /&gt;They may seem costly but so far a bottle lasts over 6 months when used with the inexpensive dispensing pumps sold elsewhere on Amazon. These are truly the economy sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I give them 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!</li>
