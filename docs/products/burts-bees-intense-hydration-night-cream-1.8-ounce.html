            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>- I wore it every night for a week and woke up even more impressed</li>
            <li>Smells nice, too!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant texture and smell.</li>
            <li>and it is pleasant smelling moisturizer</li>
            <li>Good for skin hydration, but I feel it clogs pores.</li>
            <li>it has no smell and good.</li>
            <li>want to see some good effect after a period of time.</li>
            <li>plus it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Even my doctor commented on how good my skin looked when I went for a routine checkup.</li>
            <li>It feels good but</li>
            <li>I know a really good, emollient cream can do wonders for my hands, so I gave this a try.  </li>
            <li>Good value also.</li>
            <li>but this product is not so good for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m not looking for &amp;#34;results&amp;#34;; I was just looking for a good night cream</li>
            <li>Feels good, smells good and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>Not as good as you think</li>
            <li>The share my happiness to a friend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a drugstore face cream.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>They cringe at the smell when they kiss me good night.  </li>
            <li>Because this product is just that good.</li>
            <li>I have always loved the Burt&#x27;s Bees line and</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and is rich yet not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Great night moisturizer - love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite night time moisturizer, its creamy, but not greasy and has a great scent to it.  </li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I really love this face lotion!</li>
            <li>It has a great, light scent too.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Skin absorbs it nicely</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice smell.</li>
            <li>The cream has a nice consistency, goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not greasy and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I really liked this night cream.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice hydrating cream.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, but I don&#x27;t like the consistency.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, it&#x27;s not greasy and it moisturizes well throughout the night,  </li>
            <li>The mosturizer feels nice on skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for couple weeks now and still feels nice.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but not too fragrant.</li>
            <li>Still, it smells nice, seems to keep my skin hydrated at night and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>it is good ,i love it</li>
            <li>It has a really nice thickness to it, which I like in a night cream.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I thoroughly cleanse the day off my face in the evening, and while it&#x27;s still moist and towel blotted, I put this cream on and it is like a nice luxurious treat for me.</li>
            <li>This cream is really, truly awesome.</li>
            <li>honestly, this belongs to the garbage.</li>
            <li>Both smell nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample through BzzAgent and asked to share my honest and unbiased opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d prefer it if it didn&#x27;t have any fragrance at all, but the fragrance is very mild and pleasant</li>
            <li>Love, love it!</li>
            <li>It has a very mild and pleasant smell, nothing overpowering and perfumed like most</li>
            <li>and I loved how light weight it was.</li>
            <li>To be honest, Curel body lotion seems to do a better job.  </li>
            <li>I love burt&#x27;s bees lip products, so when I found out that they have a moisturizer I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this cream is perfect for it.</li>
            <li>I had the good fortune of qualifying to participate in a Bzz campaign that provided me with the Intense Hydration Night Cream, Treatment Mask and Cream Cleanser and am really pleased to have been introduced to this great product.</li>
            <li>But when I do, I cleanse my face first, use Witch Hazel toner, then apply this, and my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>but again it stings my face for a good full minute after putting it on.</li>
            <li>the product&#x27;s effectiveness seems to be fine as I don&#x27;t expect a miracle out of this kind of product in terms of age renewal or hydration.</li>
            <li>wish this came in a huge tub because I would buy it!</li>
            <li>This is a great non-greasy intense moisturizer that can be used at any time of the day.</li>
            <li>There are way too many to choose from as in Night cream.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth creamy product&lt;</li>
            <li>Love this cream.  </li>
            <li>Love it for sure.</li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>Instead of answering my question, safe to use</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both LOVE this cream.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li>Gave it a week and returned it for the &amp;#34;Radience&amp;#34; products which I like a lot better</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees has been fantastic!</li>
            <li>It just sits on top and leaves me sticky and under hydrated.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the scent.</li>
            <li>and I just absolutely LOVE what this is doing for my skin</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>At this point, I am sure I will continue to purchase this night cream.  </li>
            <li>use a Neutrogena night cream now instead, which is not quite as moisturizing but has a much better smell.</li>
            <li>It met my expectations and more.</li>
            <li>I have already ordered another to make sure I had it on hand.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this hydration night cream.  </li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees product.</li>
            <li>What happened to my favorite night cream?</li>
            <li>Love the thickness of this cream and the nine greasy feel it gives.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much more than hydration anyway.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast deliver.</li>
            <li>When I lost my job, I thought damn I wont be able to afford my fave moisturizer anymore.</li>
            <li>My brother also uses it after I recommended it to him. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The night cream has a pleasant light clean scent.</li>
            <li>I would give this more stars, except I seem to be allergic to something in it.</li>
            <li>How do you know for sure?</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing...</li>
            <li>This cream is ok.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite night Cream,  I can feel the difference a minute I put it on</li>
            <li>I love the sage smell- smells like the sage candles I have in my house</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be okay in the summer.</li>
            <li>Just wish it would spread better.</li>
            <li>- I was in love...</li>
            <li>I like it better than Olay Regenerist.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this hydrating night cream.</li>
            <li>It does hydrate the skin well and plumps it up for a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>I even love the scent of this moisturizer since it is calming and refreshing.</li>
            <li>This one is it for sure.</li>
            <li>I can see my skin is being \\&quot;renewed\\&quot; more rapidly and doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;tight\\&quot; from</li>
            <li>Favorite face cream.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I seriously do love all burts bees.</li>
            <li>This one is definitely a much better choice.</li>
            <li>I will be buying again. :)</li>
            <li>My concern is wrinkles and this is where I need more time to assess whether or not it helps with them.</li>
            <li>But my favorite is the way my skin just drinks it in.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this face cream.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the citrus scent and it fades away after applying it.</li>
            <li>Since adding this to my skincare routine, I have not needed as many products.</li>
            <li>I used to use a serum, Cerave lotion and a neutrogena night cream on top of that.</li>
            <li>Now I can get better results from the night cream only.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very rich cream.</li>
            <li>, it is a pretty good cream, I still buy it because my girlfriend likes it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I was willing to overlook this if the moisturization was good.  </li>
            <li>and I look pretty good in the morning.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty good product for the price ($16.00 ).  </li>
            <li>this stuff is my new favorite night cream!!</li>
            <li>so I contacted Burt&#x27;s Bees and asked if the cream was fine and safe to use.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s bees makes great all natural products.</li>
            <li>Most importantly I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals.</li>
            <li>This cream has a lovely light scent.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I light Burts Bees products and feel safe using them.</li>
            <li>Protect wet, wipe the skin feels very exquisite</li>
            <li>Good price, and really keep your skin moisture, when I woke up in the morning</li>
            <li>but this is by far on the top of my list!!</li>
            <li>It does not smell like a herb sage I am familiar with, it reminds me more of a clover scent.</li>
            <li>The skin is easy to absorb it.</li>
            <li>it clumps up and doesn&#x27;t blend easily with the liquid.</li>
            <li>I will be sticking with their Intensive Repairing Serum since it goes on and spreads so easily.</li>
            <li>but really, it is the perfect thickness to feel comforting for a night cream but not heavy or greasy like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>: Has this strong fragrant to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a scent that might be a bit strong for some people, but I like it</li>
            <li>It does give off a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like strong scents</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients in this product are outstanding and I must say my skin looks and feels good again.</li>
            <li>It was SO amazing from the first moment I put it on, I hesitated writing a review of it - waiting for it to disappoint me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially perfect for these super dry winter nights.</li>
            <li>When you live in CO, you have to have good hydration or your skin will fall off.</li>
            <li>It does keep away fine lines and wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li>Awesome moisturizer, the only cream that really makes a difference on my skin!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this cream and am delighted that even a small amount is very effective.  </li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant, but isn&#x27;t a fragrance I love.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell strong at all and feels so rich on the skin.</li>
            <li>Yes my skin is smooth when I use this</li>
            <li>This night cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It goes on and makes my skin feel comfortable .</li>
            <li>, feels oh-so smooth, and</li>
            <li>: the smell is light, but nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>This night cream goes on smoothly, but does not absorb into the skin&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product also has a light sage smell which I like.</li>
            <li>, I like the light scent, and I like the results.</li>
            <li>, it is light \\&quot;background\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this intense hydration cream for my night cream after my shower and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I thought which is my fault but is really great lotion luv</li>
            <li>Scent is incredibly light and soothing and the cream makes my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free as part of a \\&quot;BzzAgent\\&quot; campaign.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a light night cream, this is not it.</li>
            <li>The consistency could be considered a bit light for a night cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fantastic face cream.</li>
            <li>I only need a dime-sized amount for my whole face and it absorbs into my skin great!  </li>
            <li>My skin type really need hydration products, but i have net yet found a really impressed one until this....</li>
            <li>It is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread as easily and when I try to mix it with my foundation to make a tinted moisturizer (something I do often and was able to do with the first batch, no problem)</li>
            <li>But even more so right now as, just like another reviewer, I&#x27;m doing some peels.</li>
            <li>The product is very good, next time also to buy, thank you very much for amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, thick cream that goes on smooth and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have generally had a good experience with Burt Bees night creams.</li>
            <li>Their quality is consistent, any product is a safe bet.  </li>
            <li>I love this whole line !  </li>
            <li>It feels rich and creamy and once applied skin</li>
            <li>It absorbs relatively fast but you need to make sure you don&#x27;t put on more than a finger pads worth.</li>
            <li>I have been using Olay products for years and while having ok results (and some not so ok- due to having acute dermatitis) started looking around for another solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re new to skincare, this is a nice entry into it.</li>
            <li>It emulsifies nicely without leaving a gross coating on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have dealt with acne and sensitive skin for more years than I care to count and have tried so many face products</li>
            <li>However, it does leave your face super smooth and hydrated in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually moved to write a review on my own.  </li>
            <li>all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Scent - wonderful and fresh, not strong or synthetic and does not linger long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect - not too oily or thick - and my skin feels super smooth when I wake up.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need anything special for my face and this cream</li>
            <li>did nothing special for it.</li>
            <li>So many moisturizers sting after an acid peel that I began to use pure safflower oil post treatment.</li>
            <li>nice, feels a little cakey when you first put it on, but smells fresh and great for hydrating face overnight.</li>
            <li>Thick and a bit oily but perfect for night time routine.</li>
            <li>products is good, hydration is not enough.</li>
            <li>It really does hydrate my skin :)</li>
            <li>lighter smell than my Burt&#x27;s Bee day cream, hope it is same good as my day cream</li>
            <li>This face cream actually works good on my face and see result the nest day.</li>
            <li>I need the sensitive skin kind.</li>
            <li>When you rub it in your face, you really have to work it in; it also doesn&#x27;t make my face feel as hydrated as most night creams do.</li>
            <li>I lightly massage it into my skin (face and neck) and it is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>The only product that seems to make my skin look good and also moisturized in the morning is Olay Regenerist night cream-</li>
            <li>good for daily use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am always on the lookout for a good moisturizing cream, as part of my essential skin care.</li>
            <li>Overall, that&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li>This product actually works...and smells good too.  </li>
            <li>Mild but clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>The full size product lives up to the promise that the samples gave me.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing yet not sticky or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice, very thick moisturizing cream, which is exactly what I was looking for, but it does have (for me anyway) a strong rose aroma (kind of like perfume your grandmother would wear), which my husband doesn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>My first order of this cream from Amazon left me very satisfied, I love the product - it moisturizes my dry winter skin beautifully without leaving a greasy feeling (it really soaks in)</li>
            <li>While it does feel a little waxy going on, it soaks in smooth and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>Every other Burt&#x27;s Bees product I&#x27;ve used has work great for me.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best night cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful midpoint between the two - smooth, but not too thin.  </li>
            <li>But the skin absorbes it quick.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more solid than liquid, unlike many moisturizers and lotions, which means that it&#x27;s a bit heavier.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s mild.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not leave your face greasy.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs really quickly, so I will even use it during the day on weekends.</li>
            <li>I also love the eye cream and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>There is a light smell which I cannot exactly describe.</li>
            <li>So I give it 2 stars (instead of zero) &#x27;cause it might be OK for normal skin.</li>
            <li>It has a cooling and refreshing feeling when applied (not like the minty feeling, but more like splashing cool water on your face after a long day out).</li>
            <li>Other Burt&#x27;s Bees products are much more effective.</li>
            <li>Very surprised to find this product very good, I like very much, the next will also buy.</li>
            <li>but it is not unpleasant</li>
            <li>Clary Sage is my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal/dry in the summer and dry in the winter and for me this provides a good amount of moisture.</li>
            <li>I love to use this stuff in the winter when my face is more dry.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried nice creams, this one will be hard to meet expectations honestly</li>
            <li>Smells great and is moisturizing but not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great non greasy hydrator I can keep using year round.</li>
            <li>The consistency is very creamy and the texture is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>use 2-3 drops of either Fresh &amp;#34;Seaberry Moisturizing Face Oil&amp;#34; or Josie Maran &amp;#34;Argan Oil, Light.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>My favorite night cream so far has been L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Youth Code day/night cream.</li>
            <li>I like how it feels on my skin and the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I like how it feels on my skin and the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I am all for more natural products, but for me, this isn&#x27;t the one.</li>
            <li>The smile lines around my mouth have plumped.</li>
            <li>So I started a nightly regimen of smoothing on a good layer of this intense hydration night cream and put white cotton gloves over my hands to help absorption.</li>
            <li>it seals in the moisture that hasn&#x27;t evaporated from my skin, since it is freshly cleansed.</li>
            <li>the more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Will not even worth a dollar.</li>
            <li>Feels good, extremely thick which is better than being watery.</li>
            <li>And the scent is comforting, soothing, and elegant in a natural way.</li>
            <li>the peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is very pleasant: thick, but not heavy, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Fragrant without being overwhelming like so many other beauty products.</li>
            <li>Rich moisturizing cream at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>You put it on right before you go to sleep?</li>
            <li>I joke to put some on right under their noses if they miss behave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs and makes your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is a WIN and thats coming from someone who is usually a department store junkie.</li>
            <li>very  moisturizing cream and love that it is natural!</li>
            <li>The cream keep my face hydrated all day long and provide a nice matte finish to my face.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin and smells super.</li>
            <li>Also so easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I found the Intense Hydrating cream is soooooo much better than their product marketed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchase... to finally pay money for a product I will actually finish... a rarity for me.</li>
            <li>Once it has absorbed, my face is incredibly smooth, soft, and hydrated and remains that way all night/</li>
            <li>It has a reasonable texture (not too light or heavy) and lovely light scent.</li>
            <li>I do not like it very much</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced compared to some of the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very gentle and helps my skin stay moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been using the sensitive one for a very long time and tried to apply more in the winter</li>
            <li>put this on after I come home from work around 7pm &amp; wash my face - amazingly, the super soft feeling lasts until the next morning!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I first used it all over my face and had an acne breakout.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Also, instead of being creamy like a lot of moisturizers, it is pretty oily feeling in consistency.  </li>
            <li>I like to try different moisturizing products and this is at the top of the list.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t ask refund, I just simply wanted to know if the cream was safe to use</li>
            <li>After years with Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Moisture night lotion I opted to try out something more ...</li>
            <li>My skin felt incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>ahem!;-) looking for a face cream that was intensively hydrating but not sticky and not pore clogging.</li>
            <li>I would Love to try the mask next!</li>
            <li>Did exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I just switched to this product from my most recent night cream</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used products like Simple (Ok results), Olay (sometimes had allergic reactions to regenerist line),</li>
            <li>I have tried several others but Burt&#x27;s Bees remains my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several others but Burt&#x27;s Bees remains my favorite.  </li>
            <li>i did order this from Amazon, in December, and when I first got it out of the mail and opened it, I put some on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use the intense hydration cleanser, the day lotion and the eye cream too!  </li>
            <li>After using this for longer than 2 weeks my skin started to get clogged up, breaking out more often and actually feeling greasy in the morning.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin smooth like alabaster and soft as silk.</li>
            <li>So glad I finally found</li>
            <li>I tried radiance night cream first and like it better, so will go back to it.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be continuing to use this second jar because it is breaking me out, definitely a different formula than the first jar I purchased,I am not at all impressed with my second purchase of this product..</li>
            <li>I fully expected to receive a nice so-so product that would be safer for me to use.</li>
            <li>When I  tried to order some more lately,and found out the price of the same product was up to $31.00,  </li>
            <li>I used this product this morning instead of tonight I am amazed at how soft and smooth my face feels.</li>
            <li>I would personally prefer something more creamy and spreadable.</li>
            <li>Roc has a deep wrinkle night cream with retinol that is phenomenal for a \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; cream and compares to creams</li>
            <li>First</li>
            <li>I initially was using Burts &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; face cream, which was okay...</li>
            <li>Although this product works very, very well on its own, I include the face oils because my skin is THAT dry and the oils really help lock in moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good and half the cost!</li>
            <li>It is a great winter night cream when the furnace is running and air is dry inside and outside.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it isn&#x27;t greasy or oily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how little of this I have to use to apply to my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Very intense moisturising and didn&#x27;t feel greasy but made my skin feel really</li>
            <li>/&gt;i found out that its better to apply this one first right after you wash face, and then apply other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is VERY hydrating, It has been my finding that if it seems hard to massage into your skin you arent using enough, You have to use a generous amount for the best effect.</li>
            <li>but I do know that I actually LOVE this night cream and will continue to use it for a long time!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and completely, and leaves my skin feeling almost plump.</li>
            <li>Super hydrating and even helps clear my skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that both breaks out and dries out easily, and this is the only night lotion that works for my face without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>you get with most dry skin night creams.  </li>
            <li>Very intense hydration, my new fav!</li>
            <li>This for my face, and Pure Fiji Pure Fiji Body Butter - Coconut Milk &amp; Honey for my bod</li>
            <li>I decided after speaking with a skin specialist to Try a more natural Affordable night cream and a higher end serum under because supposedly the serums actually absorb into our skin and the moisturizer just moisturizers so it dosent matter what you use over the serum, I dont know about all that</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had my various skin care regimes that have worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been trying to find a decently priced moisturizer that works,finally I found this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently been mixing the two together to give me more moisture than the sensitive kind but less pimples.</li>
            <li>But if your skin is sensitive to retinol, or you want a natural soothing product, this one works just fine.</li>
            <li>This night cream is a little thicker than I am accustomed to, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>In formulation, it now feels more waxy and harder than the BB intense hydration mask, which makes me think there&#x27;s some error here -</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t use it as much in warmer weather.  </li>
            <li>That said, I decided to try this as it was much cheaper</li>
            <li>It really is intensely hydrating but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>The Night Cream is really creamy and enriches my skin.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not awful, but I do not really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like how it makes my skin stay hydrated for hours after being applied.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.</li>
            <li>Very please and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>it is very calming on irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I have cut it with a much lighter moisturizer to avoid ditching it.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use those... but the rest of the daily skin care products didn&#x27;t feel like they justified the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so decided to try out the Intense Hydration Night Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommended the product to my bf who is very anti-female brand mentality unless the product says &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>how much cream you want to put on your face (I am attaching a photo of the opened container under customer</li>
            <li>I really like it, and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it, and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, if you&#x27;re not allergic to it, it does keep your skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream does that and does it very well.</li>
            <li>but, I have to say, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>but the Intense Hydration is a much thicker cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating without greasy feel</li>
            <li>Only deducted 1 star for this as up until it got warm outside this</li>
            <li>I changed to the Burt&#x27;s Bee product line and whilst I liked it, I did have a few pimples arise</li>
            <li>However, after having used it for several weeks I can honestly recommend it and say I will buy it in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers and creams, from drug store to high end brands, that promise to &amp;#34;hydrate&amp;#34; dry/very dry skin, but none of them do the job quite like this product does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin, and it sat on top of my face like a coat of plastic.</li>
            <li>After running out of my first jar, I quickly ordered another, but this time, the cream is different.</li>
            <li>To me, that&#x27;s the ultimate cream test: not only being able to maintain the skin when it is in its \\&quot;normal\\&quot; state, but also being able to replenish it when it is extremely dry.</li>
            <li>I refuse to spread chemical cocktails of toxins all over my face with ingredients found in most conventional creams and serums.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, makes face feel soft, goes deep into the skin, see improvement in the morning.</li>
            <li>Just keep it in a cool location, not in  your purse outside in the heat.</li>
            <li>It smells like sweet herbs such as sage.</li>
            <li>I love some of their other products!</li>
            <li>While the end result of the peels should be fabulous skin, in the meantime, it is mostly very dry skin that needs to be moisturized intensely...</li>
            <li>but the second jar of cream is a much, much firmer consistency than the first one I had, maybe Burt&#x27;s Bees changed their formula?!</li>
            <li>I am a facial moisturizer snob and hard to please and for the price this is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I need to have just washed my face and patted dry to smooth this on</li>
            <li>I tried it, thinking it would prove to be less occlusive on than it looked in the jar, and instead I have a face covered with a waxy film that feels like it&#x27;s on top of my skin rather than sinking in.</li>
            <li>It comes in a wide tub that is easy to access and control</li>
            <li>Even just the one application took my skin from dry and flaky to feeling a bit smooth.</li>
            <li>Ever since moving to an apartment with free heat using radiators my face and skin has been so dry.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly at night after a shower and once in a while during the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine ever changing our main night creams.</li>
            <li>my skin is still left smooth and soft after I wash this off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s short lived and mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li>There are other products all natural and organic they do just as well and carry a better price tag.</li>
            <li>However my gym started leaving a little basket of samples of this night cream in the locker room and after a couple of weeks of grabbing \\&quot;just a couple more\\&quot; I decided I better buy the darn jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a slightly tacky consistency, but is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews due to my schedule, but OMG, I love their Intense Hydration line!!!!</li>
            <li>very creamy, absorbs completely into skin</li>
            <li>This really soothes my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my friends are very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Because these products are now required, and it is natural.</li>
            <li>Too early for me to determine if it really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t slather it on and have a normal skin type.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this product alone or with the face oil, the results are the same: I wake up the next morning with soft, smooth, and HYDRATED skin!</li>
            <li>I normally use Olay Regenerist Night Cream, but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>There was no &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; for me and my skin is is normal.</li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>/&gt;i will be trying a few more days, but i agree with some reviewers.</li>
            <li>After years on Amazon, I am finally writing my first review and it is for Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream with Clary Sage.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t begin to say how very pleased I am with the results of this regime and hope these products are not &#x27;improved&#x27; or are no longer produced; if so, I most likely will be back in the game again of researching a product that will work for me</li>
            <li>Something that left my face super soft &amp; supple that lasted for hours.</li>
            <li>The hydration lasts right into the following day/evening.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re  caking makeup on yourself right before going to sleep, I think you have some larger problems.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and have skin that is sensitive to certain products.  </li>
            <li>I mix this with a tiny little bit of bio oil at night time &amp; it does amazing things for my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really really great, it is very thick and moisturizing and I can definitely tell a noticeable difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>I have to wait few more weeks to see results, so far nothing extraordanary.</li>
            <li>Overall I like it very much</li>
            <li>But this stuff leaves my skin feeling feeling very soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m talking about those high priced brand names that couldn&#x27;t keep my skin soft living in Colorado.</li>
            <li>All of Burts bees products are priced far too high.</li>
            <li>My face  feel soft every morning!</li>
            <li>I have been using it every night for 2 weeks and my skin is so soft and hydrated!  </li>
            <li>my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stop rubbing my cheek after I&#x27;ve put it on - so soft!</li>
            <li>My fine lines are plumped up and less noticeable and the flakes are almost non-existent</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft and moisturized but not oily!</li>
            <li>While they smell similar and feel similar on my skin, the second jar of cream is incredibly dense and thick</li>
            <li>others have said in reviews of this product, a little goes a long way, the scent is not overwhelming but very pleasant, and is 100% natural!</li>
            <li>so far not so impressed... :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really thick cream, doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, and it has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>But sets in fine without any heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>My recent move to Arizona has left my skin flaky and dehydrated... to the point where I see every fine line and future wrinkle for that matter.</li>
            <li>I use other Burt&#x27;s Bees products (the eucalyptus and soap bark cleanser and mango shampoo are extraordinary)</li>
            <li>left - only to discover that the new jar contained a hard jar of waxy material instead of a jar filled with rich cream.</li>
            <li>I always seem to have chronic dryness after I shave and this always seems to clear up any problem dryness</li>
            <li>Feels gentle on my Irish sensitive</li>
            <li>and I wake up with soft moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for people who are sensitive to stronger smells.</li>
            <li>Natural?</li>
            <li>We both have sensitive skin and have no problems with this cream.</li>
            <li>It does not leave the skin greasy and makes my face soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and makes skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Price, accessibility of product, natural was a bonus.  </li>
            <li>I am really surprised.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft in the morning after using it in the evening before bed.</li>
            <li>However, when you purchase this product locally, it has the consistency of a very creamy yogurt.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m soft and hydrated all over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and moisturized every morning.</li>
            <li>IT  leaves my skin SO soft in the morning</li>
            <li>I do have semi sensitive skin and this did not irritate it at</li>
            <li>I also use the day cream and the sensitive cleanser.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in my early 40s).  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So if you are sensitive I&#x27;d stay away from this.</li>
            <li>, I prefer Burt&#x27;s bees sensitive line of products.</li>
            <li>so I will give it MY stamp of approval for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The description says it is a natural scent of Clary Sage.</li>
            <li>linalool \\&quot;natural fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>linalool \\&quot;natural fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>This cream is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>oh so soft.</li>
            <li>and I have had no irritation thus far.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t always use it, every morning after my face feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Natural</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a few different Burt&#x27;s Bees hand treatments for about a year and love them...</li>
            <li>Even though I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, this cream was a bit thick for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Apparently some burt bees products contain lanolin, which some are allergic to (My back tested positive for a lanolin allergy on my patch test).</li>
            <li>The cream is thick and it kind of makes my skin feel a little waxy at first when I put it on (the feeling doesn&#x27;t linger)</li>
            <li>and I see a small reduction in appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, but it&#x27;s very subtle.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is really doing anything more then just any other lotion</li>
            <li>This is the second subscribe and save installment of this cream, and I opened my new jar when I had about a quarter of the old jar</li>
            <li>had to remove it right away, but it was on long enough to cause me to break out a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skin care junkie, have used very expensive night creams until I read some great reviews on this and decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Although its scent and smooth texture are quite pleasant, am afraid this particular Burt&#x27;s Bees product was disappointing, in that I expected more thorough hydration.  </li>
            <li>The results have been fantastic and this little jar will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t really understand how there could be so much variation between the two jars only ordered 2 months apart from each other.</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn and this lesson only costed $16.</li>
            <li>I break out very easily, especially with new products, but haven&#x27;t had any issues with this cream.</li>
            <li>I prefer either non-fragrance cosmetics or only slightly smelly with a clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li>and this didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;quench&amp;#34; my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a night cream without all the chemicals you find on the drugstore shelves promising to roll back the clock ten</li>
            <li>Too thick and tacky, does not rub in easily.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product and other products in the &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; BB niche since my skin is horribly dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone with dry and sensitive skin, or even normal.</li>
            <li>Love Burt&#x27;s Bees usually, but this did not live up to expectations.</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing and my face is moisturized without having the heavy feeling that has accompanied other moisturizers that I have used.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend especially if you have sensitivities to facial products!!</li>
            <li>After a warm facial steam and cleanser, I put a little of this product because the cream is  heavy.</li>
            <li>At 68 and with badly sun damaged olive toned skin I&#x27;ve found that this product does a great job in moisturizing at night after using the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub and of course I use a Moroccan oil in between.  </li>
            <li>I generally like their products</li>
            <li>So far my only go to night cream!</li>
            <li>So be careful with it and really look at your skin while you use it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even occur to me till the next day when I went to use it again and noticed how creamy and soft it was this time...</li>
            <li>During the day, I use a gel moisturizer in a different natural line with no SPF because I have an SPF in my foundation.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and goes on thick, so a little of the cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use anything other than Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream.  </li>
            <li>When it first went on, I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like it because it didn&#x27;t  soak in and made my skin feel tight.  </li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and this lotion moisturizes my face so well</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate, so this is a necessity.  </li>
            <li>The cream is so rich you only need to place just a dot at the end of your fingertip, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I was initially hesitant to purchase this due to its small size but I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>What I did not expect was a night cream that left my skin feeling softer and more hydrated than ANY other night cream I have used in the past (and I am almost 50</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t usually like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products all that much even though I try and go all natural!</li>
            <li>Ok but not ideal.</li>
            <li>I never liked lotion that much, because personally I like the feeling of clean, dry skin (not bone dry, but I don&#x27;t like skin to feel damp or oily because of lotion).</li>
            <li>Worth the price since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It tingles a lot, almost burns, and while my skin felt soft and hydrated to my fingers, my face still felt dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult for me to find natural products that work for my odd skin type but this line by Burt&#x27;s Bees is phenomenal and I&#x27;m thankful their products are usually labeled as being cruelty free</li>
            <li>I need to disclose that I am not normally a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan - I can appreciate their company ethos and their natural, paraben-free philosophy</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have live in some harsh climates.</li>
            <li>I have VERY dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have excruciatingly dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, which is also very dry.</li>

            <li> Good value also.</li>
            <li> but this product is not so good for me.</li>

            <li> The share my happiness to a friend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a drugstore face cream.</li>

            <li> I really love this face lotion!</li>
            <li> It has a great, light scent too.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Skin absorbs it nicely</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice smell.</li>
            <li> The cream has a nice consistency, goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not greasy and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I really liked this night cream.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice hydrating cream.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice, but I don&#x27;t like the consistency.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, it&#x27;s not greasy and it moisturizes well throughout the night,  </li>
            <li> The mosturizer feels nice on skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for couple weeks now and still feels nice.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but not too fragrant.</li>
            <li> Still, it smells nice, seems to keep my skin hydrated at night and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> it is good ,i love it</li>
            <li> It has a really nice thickness to it, which I like in a night cream.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I thoroughly cleanse the day off my face in the evening, and while it&#x27;s still moist and towel blotted, I put this cream on and it is like a nice luxurious treat for me.</li>
            <li> This cream is really, truly awesome.</li>
            <li> honestly, this belongs to the garbage.</li>
            <li> Both smell nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample through BzzAgent and asked to share my honest and unbiased opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer it if it didn&#x27;t have any fragrance at all, but the fragrance is very mild and pleasant</li>
            <li> Love, love it!</li>
            <li> It has a very mild and pleasant smell, nothing overpowering and perfumed like most</li>
            <li> and I loved how light weight it was.</li>
            <li> To be honest, Curel body lotion seems to do a better job.  </li>
            <li> I love burt&#x27;s bees lip products, so when I found out that they have a moisturizer I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this cream is perfect for it.</li>
            <li> I had the good fortune of qualifying to participate in a Bzz campaign that provided me with the Intense Hydration Night Cream, Treatment Mask and Cream Cleanser and am really pleased to have been introduced to this great product.</li>
            <li> But when I do, I cleanse my face first, use Witch Hazel toner, then apply this, and my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> but again it stings my face for a good full minute after putting it on.</li>
            <li> the product&#x27;s effectiveness seems to be fine as I don&#x27;t expect a miracle out of this kind of product in terms of age renewal or hydration.</li>
            <li> wish this came in a huge tub because I would buy it!</li>
            <li> This is a great non-greasy intense moisturizer that can be used at any time of the day.</li>
            <li> There are way too many to choose from as in Night cream.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth creamy product&lt;</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  </li>
            <li> Love it for sure.</li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> Instead of answering my question, safe to use</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both LOVE this cream.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li> Gave it a week and returned it for the &amp;#34;Radience&amp;#34; products which I like a lot better</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees has been fantastic!</li>
            <li> It just sits on top and leaves me sticky and under hydrated.</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love the scent.</li>
            <li> and I just absolutely LOVE what this is doing for my skin</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> At this point, I am sure I will continue to purchase this night cream.  </li>
            <li> use a Neutrogena night cream now instead, which is not quite as moisturizing but has a much better smell.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations and more.</li>
            <li> I have already ordered another to make sure I had it on hand.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this hydration night cream.  </li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees product.</li>
            <li> What happened to my favorite night cream?</li>
            <li> Love the thickness of this cream and the nine greasy feel it gives.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much more than hydration anyway.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast deliver.</li>
            <li> When I lost my job, I thought damn I wont be able to afford my fave moisturizer anymore.</li>
            <li> My brother also uses it after I recommended it to him. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The night cream has a pleasant light clean scent.</li>
            <li> I would give this more stars, except I seem to be allergic to something in it.</li>
            <li> How do you know for sure?</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing...</li>
            <li> This cream is ok.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite night Cream,  I can feel the difference a minute I put it on</li>
            <li> I love the sage smell- smells like the sage candles I have in my house</li>
            <li> Maybe it would be okay in the summer.</li>
            <li> Just wish it would spread better.</li>
            <li> - I was in love...</li>
            <li> I like it better than Olay Regenerist.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this hydrating night cream.</li>
            <li> It does hydrate the skin well and plumps it up for a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I even love the scent of this moisturizer since it is calming and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This one is it for sure.</li>
            <li> I can see my skin is being \\&quot;renewed\\&quot; more rapidly and doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;tight\\&quot; from</li>
            <li> Favorite face cream.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I seriously do love all burts bees.</li>
            <li> This one is definitely a much better choice.</li>
            <li> I will be buying again. :)</li>
            <li> My concern is wrinkles and this is where I need more time to assess whether or not it helps with them.</li>
            <li> But my favorite is the way my skin just drinks it in.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this face cream.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the citrus scent and it fades away after applying it.</li>
            <li> Since adding this to my skincare routine, I have not needed as many products.</li>
            <li> I used to use a serum, Cerave lotion and a neutrogena night cream on top of that.</li>
            <li> Now I can get better results from the night cream only.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very rich cream.</li>
            <li> , it is a pretty good cream, I still buy it because my girlfriend likes it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I was willing to overlook this if the moisturization was good.  </li>
            <li> and I look pretty good in the morning.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good product for the price ($16.00 ).  </li>
            <li> this stuff is my new favorite night cream!!</li>
            <li> so I contacted Burt&#x27;s Bees and asked if the cream was fine and safe to use.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees makes great all natural products.</li>
            <li> Most importantly I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals.</li>
            <li> This cream has a lovely light scent.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I light Burts Bees products and feel safe using them.</li>
            <li> Protect wet, wipe the skin feels very exquisite</li>
            <li> Good price, and really keep your skin moisture, when I woke up in the morning</li>
            <li> but this is by far on the top of my list!!</li>
            <li> It does not smell like a herb sage I am familiar with, it reminds me more of a clover scent.</li>
            <li> The skin is easy to absorb it.</li>
            <li> it clumps up and doesn&#x27;t blend easily with the liquid.</li>
            <li> I will be sticking with their Intensive Repairing Serum since it goes on and spreads so easily.</li>
            <li> but really, it is the perfect thickness to feel comforting for a night cream but not heavy or greasy like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> : Has this strong fragrant to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a scent that might be a bit strong for some people, but I like it</li>
            <li> It does give off a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like strong scents</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients in this product are outstanding and I must say my skin looks and feels good again.</li>
            <li> It was SO amazing from the first moment I put it on, I hesitated writing a review of it - waiting for it to disappoint me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially perfect for these super dry winter nights.</li>
            <li> When you live in CO, you have to have good hydration or your skin will fall off.</li>
            <li> It does keep away fine lines and wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizer, the only cream that really makes a difference on my skin!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this cream and am delighted that even a small amount is very effective.  </li>
            <li> It is not unpleasant, but isn&#x27;t a fragrance I love.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell strong at all and feels so rich on the skin.</li>
            <li> Yes my skin is smooth when I use this</li>
            <li> This night cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It goes on and makes my skin feel comfortable .</li>
            <li> , feels oh-so smooth, and</li>
            <li> : the smell is light, but nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li> This night cream goes on smoothly, but does not absorb into the skin&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product also has a light sage smell which I like.</li>
            <li> , I like the light scent, and I like the results.</li>
            <li> , it is light \\&quot;background\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this intense hydration cream for my night cream after my shower and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought which is my fault but is really great lotion luv</li>
            <li> Scent is incredibly light and soothing and the cream makes my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free as part of a \\&quot;BzzAgent\\&quot; campaign.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a light night cream, this is not it.</li>
            <li> The consistency could be considered a bit light for a night cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fantastic face cream.</li>
            <li> I only need a dime-sized amount for my whole face and it absorbs into my skin great!  </li>
            <li> My skin type really need hydration products, but i have net yet found a really impressed one until this....</li>
            <li> It is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spread as easily and when I try to mix it with my foundation to make a tinted moisturizer (something I do often and was able to do with the first batch, no problem)</li>
            <li> But even more so right now as, just like another reviewer, I&#x27;m doing some peels.</li>
            <li> The product is very good, next time also to buy, thank you very much for amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, thick cream that goes on smooth and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have generally had a good experience with Burt Bees night creams.</li>
            <li> Their quality is consistent, any product is a safe bet.  </li>
            <li> I love this whole line !  </li>
            <li> It feels rich and creamy and once applied skin</li>
            <li> It absorbs relatively fast but you need to make sure you don&#x27;t put on more than a finger pads worth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay products for years and while having ok results (and some not so ok- due to having acute dermatitis) started looking around for another solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re new to skincare, this is a nice entry into it.</li>
            <li> It emulsifies nicely without leaving a gross coating on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with acne and sensitive skin for more years than I care to count and have tried so many face products</li>
            <li> However, it does leave your face super smooth and hydrated in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually moved to write a review on my own.  </li>
            <li> all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Scent - wonderful and fresh, not strong or synthetic and does not linger long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The texture is perfect - not too oily or thick - and my skin feels super smooth when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need anything special for my face and this cream</li>
            <li> did nothing special for it.</li>
            <li> So many moisturizers sting after an acid peel that I began to use pure safflower oil post treatment.</li>
            <li> nice, feels a little cakey when you first put it on, but smells fresh and great for hydrating face overnight.</li>
            <li> Thick and a bit oily but perfect for night time routine.</li>
            <li> products is good, hydration is not enough.</li>
            <li> It really does hydrate my skin :)</li>
            <li> lighter smell than my Burt&#x27;s Bee day cream, hope it is same good as my day cream</li>
            <li> This face cream actually works good on my face and see result the nest day.</li>
            <li> I need the sensitive skin kind.</li>
            <li> When you rub it in your face, you really have to work it in; it also doesn&#x27;t make my face feel as hydrated as most night creams do.</li>
            <li> I lightly massage it into my skin (face and neck) and it is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> The only product that seems to make my skin look good and also moisturized in the morning is Olay Regenerist night cream-</li>
            <li> good for daily use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am always on the lookout for a good moisturizing cream, as part of my essential skin care.</li>
            <li> Overall, that&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> This product actually works...and smells good too.  </li>
            <li> Mild but clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> The full size product lives up to the promise that the samples gave me.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing yet not sticky or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, very thick moisturizing cream, which is exactly what I was looking for, but it does have (for me anyway) a strong rose aroma (kind of like perfume your grandmother would wear), which my husband doesn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> My first order of this cream from Amazon left me very satisfied, I love the product - it moisturizes my dry winter skin beautifully without leaving a greasy feeling (it really soaks in)</li>
            <li> While it does feel a little waxy going on, it soaks in smooth and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Every other Burt&#x27;s Bees product I&#x27;ve used has work great for me.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best night cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful midpoint between the two - smooth, but not too thin.  </li>
            <li> But the skin absorbes it quick.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more solid than liquid, unlike many moisturizers and lotions, which means that it&#x27;s a bit heavier.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s mild.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does not leave your face greasy.</li>
            <li> It also absorbs really quickly, so I will even use it during the day on weekends.</li>
            <li> I also love the eye cream and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> There is a light smell which I cannot exactly describe.</li>
            <li> So I give it 2 stars (instead of zero) &#x27;cause it might be OK for normal skin.</li>
            <li> It has a cooling and refreshing feeling when applied (not like the minty feeling, but more like splashing cool water on your face after a long day out).</li>
            <li> Other Burt&#x27;s Bees products are much more effective.</li>
            <li> Very surprised to find this product very good, I like very much, the next will also buy.</li>
            <li> but it is not unpleasant</li>
            <li> Clary Sage is my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal/dry in the summer and dry in the winter and for me this provides a good amount of moisture.</li>
            <li> I love to use this stuff in the winter when my face is more dry.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried nice creams, this one will be hard to meet expectations honestly</li>
            <li> Smells great and is moisturizing but not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great non greasy hydrator I can keep using year round.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very creamy and the texture is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> use 2-3 drops of either Fresh &amp;#34;Seaberry Moisturizing Face Oil&amp;#34; or Josie Maran &amp;#34;Argan Oil, Light.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My favorite night cream so far has been L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Youth Code day/night cream.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels on my skin and the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels on my skin and the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I am all for more natural products, but for me, this isn&#x27;t the one.</li>
            <li> The smile lines around my mouth have plumped.</li>
            <li> So I started a nightly regimen of smoothing on a good layer of this intense hydration night cream and put white cotton gloves over my hands to help absorption.</li>
            <li> it seals in the moisture that hasn&#x27;t evaporated from my skin, since it is freshly cleansed.</li>
            <li> the more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Will not even worth a dollar.</li>
            <li> Feels good, extremely thick which is better than being watery.</li>
            <li> And the scent is comforting, soothing, and elegant in a natural way.</li>
            <li> the peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is very pleasant: thick, but not heavy, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Fragrant without being overwhelming like so many other beauty products.</li>
            <li> Rich moisturizing cream at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> You put it on right before you go to sleep?</li>
            <li> I joke to put some on right under their noses if they miss behave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbs and makes your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is a WIN and thats coming from someone who is usually a department store junkie.</li>
            <li> very  moisturizing cream and love that it is natural!</li>
            <li> The cream keep my face hydrated all day long and provide a nice matte finish to my face.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin and smells super.</li>
            <li> Also so easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I found the Intense Hydrating cream is soooooo much better than their product marketed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase... to finally pay money for a product I will actually finish... a rarity for me.</li>
            <li> Once it has absorbed, my face is incredibly smooth, soft, and hydrated and remains that way all night/</li>
            <li> It has a reasonable texture (not too light or heavy) and lovely light scent.</li>
            <li> I do not like it very much</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced compared to some of the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very gentle and helps my skin stay moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using the sensitive one for a very long time and tried to apply more in the winter</li>
            <li> put this on after I come home from work around 7pm &amp; wash my face - amazingly, the super soft feeling lasts until the next morning!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I first used it all over my face and had an acne breakout.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Also, instead of being creamy like a lot of moisturizers, it is pretty oily feeling in consistency.  </li>
            <li> I like to try different moisturizing products and this is at the top of the list.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t ask refund, I just simply wanted to know if the cream was safe to use</li>
            <li> After years with Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Moisture night lotion I opted to try out something more ...</li>
            <li> My skin felt incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> ahem!;-) looking for a face cream that was intensively hydrating but not sticky and not pore clogging.</li>
            <li> I would Love to try the mask next!</li>
            <li> Did exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I just switched to this product from my most recent night cream</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used products like Simple (Ok results), Olay (sometimes had allergic reactions to regenerist line),</li>
            <li> I have tried several others but Burt&#x27;s Bees remains my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several others but Burt&#x27;s Bees remains my favorite.  </li>
            <li> i did order this from Amazon, in December, and when I first got it out of the mail and opened it, I put some on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use the intense hydration cleanser, the day lotion and the eye cream too!  </li>
            <li> After using this for longer than 2 weeks my skin started to get clogged up, breaking out more often and actually feeling greasy in the morning.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin smooth like alabaster and soft as silk.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally found</li>
            <li> I tried radiance night cream first and like it better, so will go back to it.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be continuing to use this second jar because it is breaking me out, definitely a different formula than the first jar I purchased,I am not at all impressed with my second purchase of this product..</li>
            <li> I fully expected to receive a nice so-so product that would be safer for me to use.</li>
            <li> When I  tried to order some more lately,and found out the price of the same product was up to $31.00,  </li>
            <li> I used this product this morning instead of tonight I am amazed at how soft and smooth my face feels.</li>
            <li> I would personally prefer something more creamy and spreadable.</li>
            <li> Roc has a deep wrinkle night cream with retinol that is phenomenal for a \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; cream and compares to creams</li>
            <li> First</li>
            <li> I initially was using Burts &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; face cream, which was okay...</li>
            <li> Although this product works very, very well on its own, I include the face oils because my skin is THAT dry and the oils really help lock in moisture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good and half the cost!</li>
            <li> It is a great winter night cream when the furnace is running and air is dry inside and outside.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it isn&#x27;t greasy or oily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with how little of this I have to use to apply to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Very intense moisturising and didn&#x27;t feel greasy but made my skin feel really</li>
            <li> /&gt;i found out that its better to apply this one first right after you wash face, and then apply other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is VERY hydrating, It has been my finding that if it seems hard to massage into your skin you arent using enough, You have to use a generous amount for the best effect.</li>
            <li> but I do know that I actually LOVE this night cream and will continue to use it for a long time!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and completely, and leaves my skin feeling almost plump.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating and even helps clear my skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that both breaks out and dries out easily, and this is the only night lotion that works for my face without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> you get with most dry skin night creams.  </li>
            <li> Very intense hydration, my new fav!</li>
            <li> This for my face, and Pure Fiji Pure Fiji Body Butter - Coconut Milk &amp; Honey for my bod</li>
            <li> I decided after speaking with a skin specialist to Try a more natural Affordable night cream and a higher end serum under because supposedly the serums actually absorb into our skin and the moisturizer just moisturizers so it dosent matter what you use over the serum, I dont know about all that</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had my various skin care regimes that have worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been trying to find a decently priced moisturizer that works,finally I found this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been mixing the two together to give me more moisture than the sensitive kind but less pimples.</li>
            <li> But if your skin is sensitive to retinol, or you want a natural soothing product, this one works just fine.</li>
            <li> This night cream is a little thicker than I am accustomed to, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> In formulation, it now feels more waxy and harder than the BB intense hydration mask, which makes me think there&#x27;s some error here -</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t use it as much in warmer weather.  </li>
            <li> That said, I decided to try this as it was much cheaper</li>
            <li> It really is intensely hydrating but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> The Night Cream is really creamy and enriches my skin.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not awful, but I do not really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my skin stay hydrated for hours after being applied.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Very please and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> it is very calming on irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I have cut it with a much lighter moisturizer to avoid ditching it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use those... but the rest of the daily skin care products didn&#x27;t feel like they justified the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so decided to try out the Intense Hydration Night Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommended the product to my bf who is very anti-female brand mentality unless the product says &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> how much cream you want to put on your face (I am attaching a photo of the opened container under customer</li>
            <li> I really like it, and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it, and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, if you&#x27;re not allergic to it, it does keep your skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream does that and does it very well.</li>
            <li> but, I have to say, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> but the Intense Hydration is a much thicker cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating without greasy feel</li>
            <li> Only deducted 1 star for this as up until it got warm outside this</li>
            <li> I changed to the Burt&#x27;s Bee product line and whilst I liked it, I did have a few pimples arise</li>
            <li> However, after having used it for several weeks I can honestly recommend it and say I will buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers and creams, from drug store to high end brands, that promise to &amp;#34;hydrate&amp;#34; dry/very dry skin, but none of them do the job quite like this product does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin, and it sat on top of my face like a coat of plastic.</li>
            <li> After running out of my first jar, I quickly ordered another, but this time, the cream is different.</li>
            <li> To me, that&#x27;s the ultimate cream test: not only being able to maintain the skin when it is in its \\&quot;normal\\&quot; state, but also being able to replenish it when it is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I refuse to spread chemical cocktails of toxins all over my face with ingredients found in most conventional creams and serums.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, makes face feel soft, goes deep into the skin, see improvement in the morning.</li>
            <li> Just keep it in a cool location, not in  your purse outside in the heat.</li>
            <li> It smells like sweet herbs such as sage.</li>
            <li> I love some of their other products!</li>
            <li> While the end result of the peels should be fabulous skin, in the meantime, it is mostly very dry skin that needs to be moisturized intensely...</li>
            <li> but the second jar of cream is a much, much firmer consistency than the first one I had, maybe Burt&#x27;s Bees changed their formula?!</li>
            <li> I am a facial moisturizer snob and hard to please and for the price this is a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I need to have just washed my face and patted dry to smooth this on</li>
            <li> I tried it, thinking it would prove to be less occlusive on than it looked in the jar, and instead I have a face covered with a waxy film that feels like it&#x27;s on top of my skin rather than sinking in.</li>
            <li> It comes in a wide tub that is easy to access and control</li>
            <li> Even just the one application took my skin from dry and flaky to feeling a bit smooth.</li>
            <li> Ever since moving to an apartment with free heat using radiators my face and skin has been so dry.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly at night after a shower and once in a while during the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine ever changing our main night creams.</li>
            <li> my skin is still left smooth and soft after I wash this off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short lived and mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li> There are other products all natural and organic they do just as well and carry a better price tag.</li>
            <li> However my gym started leaving a little basket of samples of this night cream in the locker room and after a couple of weeks of grabbing \\&quot;just a couple more\\&quot; I decided I better buy the darn jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a slightly tacky consistency, but is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews due to my schedule, but OMG, I love their Intense Hydration line!!!!</li>
            <li> very creamy, absorbs completely into skin</li>
            <li> This really soothes my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my friends are very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Because these products are now required, and it is natural.</li>
            <li> Too early for me to determine if it really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t slather it on and have a normal skin type.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this product alone or with the face oil, the results are the same: I wake up the next morning with soft, smooth, and HYDRATED skin!</li>
            <li> I normally use Olay Regenerist Night Cream, but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> There was no &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; for me and my skin is is normal.</li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will be trying a few more days, but i agree with some reviewers.</li>
            <li> After years on Amazon, I am finally writing my first review and it is for Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream with Clary Sage.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t begin to say how very pleased I am with the results of this regime and hope these products are not &#x27;improved&#x27; or are no longer produced; if so, I most likely will be back in the game again of researching a product that will work for me</li>
            <li> Something that left my face super soft &amp; supple that lasted for hours.</li>
            <li> The hydration lasts right into the following day/evening.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re  caking makeup on yourself right before going to sleep, I think you have some larger problems.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and have skin that is sensitive to certain products.  </li>
            <li> I mix this with a tiny little bit of bio oil at night time &amp; it does amazing things for my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really really great, it is very thick and moisturizing and I can definitely tell a noticeable difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I have to wait few more weeks to see results, so far nothing extraordanary.</li>
            <li> Overall I like it very much</li>
            <li> But this stuff leaves my skin feeling feeling very soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m talking about those high priced brand names that couldn&#x27;t keep my skin soft living in Colorado.</li>
            <li> All of Burts bees products are priced far too high.</li>
            <li> My face  feel soft every morning!</li>
            <li> I have been using it every night for 2 weeks and my skin is so soft and hydrated!  </li>
            <li> my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t stop rubbing my cheek after I&#x27;ve put it on - so soft!</li>
            <li> My fine lines are plumped up and less noticeable and the flakes are almost non-existent</li>
            <li> It leaves my face soft and moisturized but not oily!</li>
            <li> While they smell similar and feel similar on my skin, the second jar of cream is incredibly dense and thick</li>
            <li> others have said in reviews of this product, a little goes a long way, the scent is not overwhelming but very pleasant, and is 100% natural!</li>
            <li> so far not so impressed... :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really thick cream, doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, and it has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> But sets in fine without any heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> My recent move to Arizona has left my skin flaky and dehydrated... to the point where I see every fine line and future wrinkle for that matter.</li>
            <li> I use other Burt&#x27;s Bees products (the eucalyptus and soap bark cleanser and mango shampoo are extraordinary)</li>
            <li> left - only to discover that the new jar contained a hard jar of waxy material instead of a jar filled with rich cream.</li>
            <li> I always seem to have chronic dryness after I shave and this always seems to clear up any problem dryness</li>
            <li> Feels gentle on my Irish sensitive</li>
            <li> and I wake up with soft moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for people who are sensitive to stronger smells.</li>
            <li> Natural?</li>
            <li> We both have sensitive skin and have no problems with this cream.</li>
            <li> It does not leave the skin greasy and makes my face soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and makes skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Price, accessibility of product, natural was a bonus.  </li>
            <li> I am really surprised.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft in the morning after using it in the evening before bed.</li>
            <li> However, when you purchase this product locally, it has the consistency of a very creamy yogurt.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m soft and hydrated all over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and moisturized every morning.</li>
            <li> IT  leaves my skin SO soft in the morning</li>
            <li> I do have semi sensitive skin and this did not irritate it at</li>
            <li> I also use the day cream and the sensitive cleanser.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my early 40s).  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So if you are sensitive I&#x27;d stay away from this.</li>
            <li> , I prefer Burt&#x27;s bees sensitive line of products.</li>
            <li> so I will give it MY stamp of approval for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The description says it is a natural scent of Clary Sage.</li>
            <li> linalool \\&quot;natural fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> linalool \\&quot;natural fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> This cream is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> oh so soft.</li>
            <li> and I have had no irritation thus far.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t always use it, every morning after my face feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Natural</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a few different Burt&#x27;s Bees hand treatments for about a year and love them...</li>
            <li> Even though I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, this cream was a bit thick for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Apparently some burt bees products contain lanolin, which some are allergic to (My back tested positive for a lanolin allergy on my patch test).</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and it kind of makes my skin feel a little waxy at first when I put it on (the feeling doesn&#x27;t linger)</li>
            <li> and I see a small reduction in appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, but it&#x27;s very subtle.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is really doing anything more then just any other lotion</li>
            <li> This is the second subscribe and save installment of this cream, and I opened my new jar when I had about a quarter of the old jar</li>
            <li> had to remove it right away, but it was on long enough to cause me to break out a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin care junkie, have used very expensive night creams until I read some great reviews on this and decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Although its scent and smooth texture are quite pleasant, am afraid this particular Burt&#x27;s Bees product was disappointing, in that I expected more thorough hydration.  </li>
            <li> The results have been fantastic and this little jar will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t really understand how there could be so much variation between the two jars only ordered 2 months apart from each other.</li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn and this lesson only costed $16.</li>
            <li> I break out very easily, especially with new products, but haven&#x27;t had any issues with this cream.</li>
            <li> I prefer either non-fragrance cosmetics or only slightly smelly with a clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li> and this didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;quench&amp;#34; my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a night cream without all the chemicals you find on the drugstore shelves promising to roll back the clock ten</li>
            <li> Too thick and tacky, does not rub in easily.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product and other products in the &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; BB niche since my skin is horribly dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone with dry and sensitive skin, or even normal.</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees usually, but this did not live up to expectations.</li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing and my face is moisturized without having the heavy feeling that has accompanied other moisturizers that I have used.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend especially if you have sensitivities to facial products!!</li>
            <li> After a warm facial steam and cleanser, I put a little of this product because the cream is  heavy.</li>
            <li> At 68 and with badly sun damaged olive toned skin I&#x27;ve found that this product does a great job in moisturizing at night after using the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub and of course I use a Moroccan oil in between.  </li>
            <li> I generally like their products</li>
            <li> So far my only go to night cream!</li>
            <li> So be careful with it and really look at your skin while you use it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even occur to me till the next day when I went to use it again and noticed how creamy and soft it was this time...</li>
            <li> During the day, I use a gel moisturizer in a different natural line with no SPF because I have an SPF in my foundation.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and goes on thick, so a little of the cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything other than Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream.  </li>
            <li> When it first went on, I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like it because it didn&#x27;t  soak in and made my skin feel tight.  </li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and this lotion moisturizes my face so well</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate, so this is a necessity.  </li>
            <li> The cream is so rich you only need to place just a dot at the end of your fingertip, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I was initially hesitant to purchase this due to its small size but I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> What I did not expect was a night cream that left my skin feeling softer and more hydrated than ANY other night cream I have used in the past (and I am almost 50</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products all that much even though I try and go all natural!</li>
            <li> Ok but not ideal.</li>
            <li> I never liked lotion that much, because personally I like the feeling of clean, dry skin (not bone dry, but I don&#x27;t like skin to feel damp or oily because of lotion).</li>
            <li> Worth the price since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It tingles a lot, almost burns, and while my skin felt soft and hydrated to my fingers, my face still felt dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to find natural products that work for my odd skin type but this line by Burt&#x27;s Bees is phenomenal and I&#x27;m thankful their products are usually labeled as being cruelty free</li>
            <li> I need to disclose that I am not normally a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan - I can appreciate their company ethos and their natural, paraben-free philosophy</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have live in some harsh climates.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have excruciatingly dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, which is also very dry.</li>
            <li> I have heinously dry skin that usually soaks up oceans worth of moisturizer daily.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to spread it on your skin and feels so thick like sitting on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> I removed 2 stars because it is a very thick cream and has an almost waxy consistency that wont spread evenly or easily without a applying a lot of pressure with my fingers to really rub it in hard.</li>
            <li> It feels as though I have a new skin to present to the public on the few occasions I venture out.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very hard to get out of the jar without a small plastic spatula whereas the first jar was thick, yet soft enough to easily dip a finger in to remove product.</li>
            <li> For years, I have used moisturizing lotions, but oddly enough they left my skin greasy yet still dry.  </li>
            <li> I used this in the morning and evening for a couple of weeks, glopping it on pretty thick at night.  </li>
            <li> At first it goes on a bit thick but it does go in.  </li>
            <li> I admit was hesitant to try something new because of my sensitive skin, and it does feel a bit strange going on, like it is too thick to absorb.  </li>
            <li> and I seem to have broken out a little more.</li>
            <li> However, ever since the first morning after using this, my skin has stayed moisturized throughout the day without having to use an additional daytime moisturizer, and the oily shine is a thing of the past!  </li>
            <li> It is not strong in hydration even for my normally oily skin.  </li>
            <li> (Side note: If you have extremely dry skin, look up face oils - specifically the two products mentioned above.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and scaly, especially in winter.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the other natural creams has my husband running in the opposite direction due to funky smells but this one doesn&#x27;t stink and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Now I am using it only on the dry areas and so far haven&#x27;t had any trouble.</li>
            <li> I only use it when my skin is very very dry</li>
            <li> Its super thick and does have a slight smell to it.</li>
            <li> It seemed much thicker, almost hard to put on.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that if I do not use this at night, my skin will be rough the next day.</li>
            <li> I just started using night cream about 3-4 months ago and wish I would have used it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> how long I try to massage it in.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my face a few times to completely remove it.</li>
            <li> Really strange smell.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like strong scents but had no issues with this cream and did see a decrease in the small wrinkles that I am unfortunately suffering from.  </li>
            <li> This cream is very very heavy, too rich, hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> This is my second jar in 1 year a little goes a long way, but this is my daily night cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strange.</li>
            <li> So I use on my dry arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always have dry patches of skin along the bridge of my nose and my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Still feel dry...</li>
            <li> I have normal/combination skin but the dry winter has been killing me.</li>
            <li> I have combination dry flaky skin and use this at night after my clarisonic and my skin drinks it up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has this problem, but my eyelids get so dry anymore</li>
            <li> My sample seemed to dry out or evaporate quicklty</li>
            <li> My face is no longer cracking dry</li>
            <li> My skin is dry, even when it is humid out.</li>
            <li> helps hydrate  dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> I would put hand cream on my face and it would still be dry in the morning.</li>
            <li> and my skin in parts felt dry.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try it on dry skin, because the&lt;br /&gt;purpose is to seal in the moisture.</li>
            <li> it feels really dry when you apply it .</li>
            <li> They contacted me back a few days later and asked the lot #</li>
            <li> However in the winter months, the skin on my hands started cracking a little bit in places like knuckles especially, and the normal (inexpensive) lotion we usually get was not helping at all.</li>
            <li> , the ingredients are natural, there is very little scent, etc</li>
            <li> When you first apply only apply a small amount because it is thick &amp; that goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It is hard to put this cream on as it creates a thick layer of white mask on your face before it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as thick as some other creams, but it moisturizes really well and absorbs into the skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry - very dry.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or very dry skin this would work</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and, until this cream, had a hard time finding anything that worked on my skin at night that didn&#x27;t also break the bank.</li>
            <li> The only down side to it was the fragrance.</li>
            <li> But it means that you only need to use a little so goes a long way.</li>
            <li> super sad that this did not work out.</li>
            <li> - I have a combination skin, which is both acne prone and tends to get very dry around mouth and cheeks.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and this cream does wonders for it.  </li>
            <li> I have a very dry T-zone area.</li>
            <li> He has very dry skin around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> About two years ago during a pregnancy, I started dealing with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My dry winter skin is already showing difference after only a few applications combined with the Burts Bees Ageless Intensive Repairing Serum.</li>
            <li> Little too thick for me, my 28-year-old skin just doesn&#x27;t need this much moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so this small jar will likely last me months.</li>
            <li> I realized there is a hollow center.</li>
            <li> or they changed the formula, they just sent me a $20 coupon a few weeks later.</li>
            <li> This cream was thicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really hydrating.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream thinking it would actually help because it is supposedly all natural but it made my face worse.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that it&#x27;s too thick for me, but it&#x27;s really effective.</li>
            <li> Moreover it left a whitish film on my already NorthWest pale skin.  </li>
            <li> No more dry patches or flakes (internal cringe) for me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feels weird putting cream right away..</li>
            <li> Due to this harsh winter it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would you believe that even after a long, hard day, the promise of putting this cream on will actually get me to wash my face before bed every night?</li>
            <li> I use it every night and think it has helped my skin feel less dry.</li>
            <li> I also tried the day cream and was amazed by that was well, same results but a little lighter for the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with this cream for awhile!</li>
            <li> (a little goes a long way and</li>
            <li> First, I thought it was just what it is but after tossing the package, I read some reviews about the weird texture on Amazon</li>
            <li> Just remember to screw the cap back on because it gets gummy if you&#x27;re lazy (ahem).</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re extremely oily, you might not like this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have extremely hypoallergenic and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> This thick cream might be good for someone who works outdoors with cold wind hitting their face, who needs a thick mask of cream to protect  the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It looked very mild but it was itchy and painful, and my hands would swell somewhat, due to the irritation.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive creams (full of chemicals) and less expensive creams (full of more horrible chemicals) with no success.</li>
            <li> Cream was not easy to use--too dry and drying.</li>
            <li> , otherwise it&#x27;s a little like trying to spread wet clay.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy moisturizer and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy night creme, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;A very little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Reduced both dark circles under eyes and shadows in mustache area.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely thick and actually tugs on my face when I apply it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably wont buy again simply because of the thick, waxyness.</li>
            <li> But unlike the other lotions that made my skin feel tight- that went away</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product, which is saying something because I usually have to fully lather my face with other brands&#x27; products to get a fraction of the result I get with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (usually when my skin feels dry after putting on lotion-</li>
            <li> It is a little harder to apply than other night creams I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> I am still searching for an affordable yet less toxic solution.</li>
            <li> No more peely, dry skin on my face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use a lighter mousturizer and use less of it</li>
            <li> Not super nourishing.</li>
            <li> It typically soaks into my face after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super greasy, so I never feel like I am going to break out from it.</li>
            <li> When I put on my make up after I apply it, it cakes and rolls into my make-up making a gunky mess.</li>
            <li> It has the typical Burt&#x27;s Bees smell, which is a little off-putting when you are putting it all over your face before bed.  </li>
            <li> This is a little thicker than the previous night creams that I used.  </li>
            <li> My skin still felt tight in the mornings, but I didn&#x27;t have flakiness like before.</li>
            <li> Also, seems a little sticky sometimes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the products,</li>
            <li> Works well for dry face; The natural bees wax blend helps keep skin moist and hydrated over night or in cold weather.</li>
            <li> But it does keep down the flakes!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s heavy and it makes you look oily.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I don&#x27;t want anything to heavy</li>
            <li> This makes my skin firm.  </li>
            <li> too oily and way too heavy for my skin.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I do not feel like it is heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> it feels heavy and you need to be generous with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> Also, the heavy glass jar is a nuisance if you&#x27;re a klutz like myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I end up washing the dried film off my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> Clary Sage plant thrives in the harsh environments because it has ability to trap and retain moisture.</li>
            <li> and I did not find Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; heavy or overpowering</li>
            <li> It has a heavy feeling that I expect in a night cream.  </li>
            <li> It is a heavy cream but not greasy at all</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical with the first use.  </li>
            <li> I will update in a few of weeks.</li>
            <li> I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees products a few days ago</li>
            <li> I usually use the Radiance cream or the carrot cream, but the former is kinda thin and the latter very thick.  </li>
            <li> I did not fine the expiry date anywhere on the bottle or the cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As some of the other people mentioned, the cream I received was really hard and waxy texture.</li>
            <li> This is very thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It might be this seller, or this specific product may be old or expired or placed in a bad warehouse - I am not sure?</li>
            <li> When I put it on my face, it pulls my skin, due to being so thick.</li>
            <li> not easy to apply.not</li>
            <li> Upon opening, I noticed it smelled slightly (very slightly) medicinal.</li>
            <li> it does have a very slightly waxy finish but it is not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> but I do wish it was a little less thick.</li>
            <li> it stays dry and gets worse).  </li>
            <li> I use other moisturizers (likely with artificial ingredients I&#x27;d rather avoid) but they don&#x27;t cause this problem.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick, but feels waxy and heavy.</li>
            <li> and when it got in my eyes- burn terribly for about a hour), even to my latest ditch effort ($300) with the mall kiosk Seacret (I like the magnetic mud mask and</li>
            <li> I realize over the counter products don&#x27;t usually work the way the advertise</li>
            <li> Never had a reaction to any product before, so not sure what ingredient caused</li>
            <li> Weird initial feeling</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I was also developing what looked like stress eczema on my hands in a couple of small patches.</li>
            <li> so I have used a few!).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the oil slick</li>
            <li> $16 for one and a half ounces is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> so the dead skin that always looks bad is finally gone as well-</li>
            <li> I think it may just be to thick.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat thick, but I don&#x27;t mind that because I use it at night.  </li>
            <li> Extremely thick, doesn&#x27;t loosen up even when rubbed in hands.</li>
            <li> Too thick for my liking.</li>
            <li> It is not oily of any type, but it is thick.</li>
            <li> its texture is really thick</li>
            <li> Goes on thick and waxy.  </li>
            <li> the texture, it was creamy and thick but not oily.  </li>
            <li> The clary sage scent is repellent and long lasting</li>
            <li> It never soaked in, and was very difficult to remove the next morning.</li>
            <li> The peeling has stopped, except for a stray bit here and there from the cold dry weather...</li>
            <li> so I was a little sad about this experience.</li>
            <li> It kinda smells a little weird, but when I wake up in the morning</li>
            <li> Regardless of my reasoning I did pick  this thick, tough to absorb goo and</li>
            <li> Too expensive to waste</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and so sorry because my daughters and I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products--use the cleanser all the time--as well as the baby products.</li>
            <li> except I hate using products that aren&#x27;t natural.  </li>
            <li> I have been using VERY expensive night creams for the past few years 60-200$ ones.</li>
            <li> I picked the wrong one, its just too greasy for my face, wake up to an oil slick.</li>
            <li> : Very thick and moisturizes your skin well.</li>
            <li> Very thick on skin, it has a almost watermelon smell to it.</li>
            <li> I am currently on a facial medication that dried out my skin terribly.</li>
            <li> It has moisturized my poor eyelids and softened the skin around my eyes as well.  </li>
            <li> This plant is the inspiration behind the Burt&#x27;s Bee hydration line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen a dramatic change in my under eye circles and the lines on my neck.</li>
            <li> ultra creamy even for those frigid and dry Boston winters....</li>
            <li> : I failed to mention that even without make-up it still rolls up cakes off on my pillow.</li>
            <li> I cannot emphasize enough how awful this cream was.</li>
            <li> … but, unfortunately, this moisturizer makes my skin break out.</li>
            <li> doctors have been unable to diagnose the cause...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> They gave me random samples but nothing seemed to hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> and I find that so very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming they do not rotate stock or get rid of outdated product. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be contacting Burt&#x27;s Bees about this - I&#x27;m massively unhappy at the difference.</li>
            <li> So if you get it in the mail, in the cold, maybe wait a day before using it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was just from being delivered in the cold, and it also sat in my mailbox overnight!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> My kids literally hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> .. Hated it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not sure if it is really doing anything more then just any other lotion</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> After cleansing I put this on before going to bed. It goes on easy, makes face feel soft, goes deep into the skin, see improvement in the morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great, skin is hydrated!!</li>
            <li> Overall I like it very much but it&#x27;s not the best it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: Very thick and moisturizes your skin well. I use it mainly at night after a shower and once in a while during the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: Has this strong fragrant to it. Ok but not ideal. It&#x27;s sort of a floral scent so it&#x27;s not bad. Also, seems a little sticky sometimes.</li>
            <li> This is a great non-greasy intense moisturizer that can be used at any time of the day. It quickly absorbs and makes your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Rich moisturizing cream at a reasonable price.  Stays on the skin and hydrates well.</li>
            <li> Love this night cream!  I even have my husband using it, and he loves it too!  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything other than Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream.  This stuff Rocks!</li>
            <li> Works well for my oily skin as of now during the fall/winter time.  May not be a product I will still need during the summertime.</li>
            <li> it makes  me anaphylactic</li>
            <li> So far my only go to night cream! Skin absorbs it nicely and I wake up with soft moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> This has worked great this winter.  Probably won&#x27;t use it as much in warmer weather.  Has a slightly tacky consistency, but is absorbed quickly.  Will purchase again when it is gone.  I also use Burt&#x27;s Day Cream for my moisturizer under makeup.</li>
            <li> There are way too many to choose from as in Night cream. I picked the wrong one, its just too greasy for my face, wake up to an oil slick. So I use on my dry arms and legs. Too expensive to waste</li>
            <li> Works well as I sleep in the aircon all night. Keeps my skin hydrated. Has a peculiar smell but have got used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin care junkie, have used very expensive night creams until I read some great reviews on this and decided to give it a shot. It&#x27;s just as good and half the cost! Love it!</li>
            <li> I was using Algenist before this and I loved how light weight it was. I never had breakouts and I woke up with a semi-matte face. I admit I am not as acne prone as others but I do get a rather oily t-zone. That said, I decided to try this as it was much cheaper and I wanted to prove (disprove?) that all creams are the same...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice smell. It has a slight cooling sensation. But it&#x27;s heavy and it makes you look oily. Waking up it is a hit or miss if I get a breakout or not. I have noticed that if I do not use this at night, my skin will be rough the next day. Yes my skin is smooth when I use this but it has a residue type feel that Algenist never had. I wash my face every evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have gone in expecting a $60+ cream for &amp;#60; $20. If you&#x27;ve tried nice creams, this one will be hard to meet expectations honestly but if you&#x27;re new to skincare, this is a nice entry into it.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth creamy product&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer it if it didn&#x27;t have any fragrance at all, but the fragrance is very mild and pleasant</li>
            <li> - I have a combination skin, which is both acne prone and tends to get very dry around mouth and cheeks. I first used it all over my face and had an acne breakout. Now I am using it only on the dry areas and so far haven&#x27;t had any trouble. I must mention I am using this during night in summer months and it does have a waxy-coat feeling however it is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;- The cream has a nice consistency, goes on nicely. My skin does feel softer in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;- There is a light smell which I cannot exactly describe. I do not like it very much but it is not unpleasant either.&lt;br /&gt;- I did not fine the expiry date anywhere on the bottle or the cap.&lt;br /&gt;- My biggest qualm with the product was the quantity, the net weight is 50 g, however when I opened my bottle I realized there is a hollow center. Once I balanced the cream the jar seemed half-empty! Wondering if anyone else had this problem.</li>
            <li> Good for skin hydration, but I feel it clogs pores. I&#x27;ve gotten bumps since using it. So if you have sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t recommend use.</li>
            <li> Great hydration!  At 68 and with badly sun damaged olive toned skin I&#x27;ve found that this product does a great job in moisturizing at night after using the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub and of course I use a Moroccan oil in between.  It feels as though I have a new skin to present to the public on the few occasions I venture out.  Pore and wrinkles seem to have been greatly diminished.  Can&#x27;t begin to say how very pleased I am with the results of this regime and hope these products are not &#x27;improved&#x27; or are no longer produced; if so, I most likely will be back in the game again of researching a product that will work for me and I find that so very frustrating.  These work for me just the way they are.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, very thick moisturizing cream, which is exactly what I was looking for, but it does have (for me anyway) a strong rose aroma (kind of like perfume your grandmother would wear), which my husband doesn&#x27;t care for. It&#x27;s not for people who are sensitive to stronger smells.</li>
            <li> Great item! Love it so far. Gentle on the skin and smells super. Exactly as described. Burt&#x27;s bees makes great all natural products.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  I just started using night cream about 3-4 months ago and wish I would have used it a long time ago.  This cream feels great, it&#x27;s not greasy and has a nice scent. Hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry - very dry. So my review of this product is for this type of skin. This cream did not help at all. Putting it on was like putting on a clay type mask; my skin did not feel moisturized. So I give it 2 stars (instead of zero) &#x27;cause it might be OK for normal skin.</li>
            <li> This night cream is fantastic. Smells great and is moisturizing but not sticky or heavy. Love it for sure. Will order more.</li>
            <li> very  moisturizing cream and love that it is natural!</li>
            <li> It has the typical Burt&#x27;s Bees smell, which is a little off-putting when you are putting it all over your face before bed.  Also, instead of being creamy like a lot of moisturizers, it is pretty oily feeling in consistency.  I don&#x27;t think I will be a repurchaser of this product.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this cream!  I usually use the Radiance cream or the carrot cream, but the former is kinda thin and the latter very thick.  This is a wonderful midpoint between the two - smooth, but not too thin.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has totally worn off overnight!  Also so easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this several times. I always seem to have chronic dryness after I shave and this always seems to clear up any problem dryness well! As a guy, I don&#x27;t want anything to heavy and this fits the build!</li>
            <li> I like to try different moisturizing products and this is at the top of the list.  Very good night cream.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin firm.  Most importantly I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals.</li>
            <li> When you live in CO, you have to have good hydration or your skin will fall off. This does the trick</li>
            <li> As some of the other people mentioned, the cream I received was really hard and waxy texture. First, I thought it was just what it is but after tossing the package, I read some reviews about the weird texture on Amazon so I contacted Burt&#x27;s Bees and asked if the cream was fine and safe to use. They contacted me back a few days later and asked the lot # but I told them that I&#x27;ve already threw it away because I didn&#x27;t expect that it was possibly defected. Instead of answering my question, safe to use or they changed the formula, they just sent me a $20 coupon a few weeks later. I didn&#x27;t ask refund, I just simply wanted to know if the cream was safe to use but I&#x27;ve never found out what it was. I generally like their products so I was a little sad about this experience.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and, until this cream, had a hard time finding anything that worked on my skin at night that didn&#x27;t also break the bank. I&#x27;d always have dry patches of skin along the bridge of my nose and my cheeks. But this stuff leaves my skin feeling feeling very soft and pliable. It&#x27;s got a scent that might be a bit strong for some people, but I like it and it wears off. The cream absorbs within 15 minutes and by then the scent disappears. Just remember to screw the cap back on because it gets gummy if you&#x27;re lazy (ahem).</li>
            <li> Thick and a bit oily but perfect for night time routine.</li>
            <li> After years with Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Moisture night lotion I opted to try out something more ... Sustainable? Natural? I don&#x27;t remember why I switched? Regardless of my reasoning I did pick  this thick, tough to absorb goo and wah wah wahhh.. Hated it. Oh well, live and learn and this lesson only costed $16.</li>
            <li> I like it. It seems to help.</li>
            <li> too oily and way too heavy for my skin.  it felt like i clogged up all my pours after just cleaning my face.  had to remove it right away, but it was on long enough to cause me to break out a bit.</li>
            <li> products is good, hydration is not enough. Still feel dry...</li>
            <li> Just begin to try after shower and before night sleep. it has no smell and good. want to see some good effect after a period of time.</li>
            <li> I am currently on a facial medication that dried out my skin terribly. This night cream is the only thing that keeps me from looking like I&#x27;m permanently sunburnt--peeling and red. I love it. It has a pleasant scent and goes on thick, so a little of the cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t oily in any way!  I only need a dime-sized amount for my whole face and it absorbs into my skin great!  It really does hydrate my skin :)</li>
            <li> My husband and I both LOVE this cream. It really is intensely hydrating but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. We both have sensitive skin and have no problems with this cream. Doesn&#x27;t clog our pores either. Can&#x27;t imagine ever changing our main night creams.</li>
            <li> I really liked this night cream. My skin felt incredibly soft and smooth. The fragrance is very nice. But..my face broke out. I&#x27;m bummed. I&#x27;m trying another product on my face, and using the remainder on my hands and arms. Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Love this cream. It does not leave the skin greasy and makes my face soft.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I live in a dry climate and this lotion moisturizes my face so well plus it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  The Night Cream is really creamy and enriches my skin.  I live in a dry climate, so this is a necessity.  At the same time, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Great night moisturizer - love it.  It&#x27;s not greasy and makes skin soft and supple.  Worth the price since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I did not find this moisturizer to be waxy at all.  It&#x27;s a nice, thick cream that goes on smooth and feels great on my skin. I break out very easily, especially with new products, but haven&#x27;t had any issues with this cream. It has a great, light scent too.  I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase once I run out.</li>
            <li> lighter smell than my Burt&#x27;s Bee day cream, hope it is same good as my day cream</li>
            <li> This is a really nice hydrating cream.  I like that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product and other products in the &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; BB niche since my skin is horribly dry.  Price, accessibility of product, natural was a bonus.  It did solve the dryness issue but I felt wax coated &amp; suddenly remembered this was a BB product and what do they have a TON of but wax!  Might be a coincidence here ?  Moreover it left a whitish film on my already NorthWest pale skin.  Gave it a week and returned it for the &amp;#34;Radience&amp;#34; products which I like a lot better but now the Carrot products are calling me......to be continued...</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! I have had problems with the skin on my  face peeling my entire life. I have tried expensive creams (full of chemicals) and less expensive creams (full of more horrible chemicals) with no success. Burt&#x27;s Bees has been fantastic! I found the Intense Hydrating cream is soooooo much better than their product marketed for sensitive skin. The peeling has stopped, except for a stray bit here and there from the cold dry weather...I&#x27;ll take that any day over what I&#x27;ve been through for the last 40 years!</li>
            <li> Very nice Cream. It&#x27;s moisturizing and smelless. The skin is easy to absorb it. It can be used about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I like this night cream. It moisturizers my skin well for an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this moisturizer. I have heinously dry skin that usually soaks up oceans worth of moisturizer daily. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate my skin at all no matter how long I try to massage it in. It just sits on top and leaves me sticky and under hydrated. I am really surprised. Every other Burt&#x27;s Bees product I&#x27;ve used has work great for me. *Every* product from baby perfume to tinted lip balm. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Takes care of my daughter&#x27;s eczema and it has a great scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews due to my schedule, but OMG, I love their Intense Hydration line!!!! I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 days, and I can actually tell the different.  My skin type really need hydration products, but i have net yet found a really impressed one until this....</li>
            <li> For people with contact dermatitis beware- I bought this cream thinking it would actually help because it is supposedly all natural but it made my face worse. Apparently some burt bees products contain lanolin, which some are allergic to (My back tested positive for a lanolin allergy on my patch test). Organic is not always the safest bet.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but I don&#x27;t like the consistency.  Too thick and tacky, does not rub in easily.  I prefer the Aveeno night creams to this one and will go back to them when I use this up.</li>
            <li> This product was on a list of &amp;#34;must-haves&amp;#34; that I came across.  It has a nice smell, it&#x27;s not greasy and it moisturizes well throughout the night,  I don&#x27;t even have to add an additional layer of moisturizer in the morning like I have had to do with others.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> It was okay. I don&#x27;t need anything special for my face and this cream did nothing special for it. It wasn&#x27;t bad or anything.</li>
            <li> When I put on my make up after I apply it, it cakes and rolls into my make-up making a gunky mess. I have tried to let it absorb but that doesn&#x27;t work. I think it may just be to thick. It also gets into my pores which I don&#x27;t like. Maybe its just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I failed to mention that even without make-up it still rolls up cakes off on my pillow.</li>
            <li> Reduced both dark circles under eyes and shadows in mustache area.  Love it.  No greasy residue.  No allergic reaction.  Feels gentle on my Irish sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else have you got?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have reordered.</li>
            <li> Best night cream ever! Ever since I started using it about two months ago, several people have commented that I look younger and/or my skin looks great! Even my doctor commented on how good my skin looked when I went for a routine checkup. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It was below my expectation.  It is not strong in hydration even for my normally oily skin.  The name is misleading</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it and never let myself run out. This face cream actually works good on my face and see result the nest day.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy moisturizer and a little goes a long way. My skin feels so soft in the morning after using it in the evening before bed. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Did not like at all.was. not easy to apply.not cr&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not like. .</li>
            <li> This is the worst moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever encountered. I have normal to dry skin, and it sat on top of my face like a coat of plastic. It never soaked in, and was very difficult to remove the next morning. I had to wash my face a few times to completely remove it. I cannot emphasize enough how awful this cream was. It was a waste of money. DO NOT BUY IT.</li>
            <li> The product came in a timely fashion. However, when you purchase this product locally, it has the consistency of a very creamy yogurt. The product I received was more like brick cream cheese and useless. I&#x27;m assuming they do not rotate stock or get rid of outdated product. :(</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is THE most impressive &amp; best face cream I have EVER tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spend hundreds maybe thousands of dollars since I turned 30 (like yesterday, ahem!;-) looking for a face cream that was intensively hydrating but not sticky and not pore clogging. Something that left my face super soft &amp; supple that lasted for hours. It was SO amazing from the first moment I put it on, I hesitated writing a review of it - waiting for it to disappoint me - I wore it every night for a week and woke up even more impressed every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on after I come home from work around 7pm &amp; wash my face - amazingly, the super soft feeling lasts until the next morning!&lt;br /&gt;I also like the day cream but this -- this is the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said in reviews of this product, a little goes a long way, the scent is not overwhelming but very pleasant, and is 100% natural! I also put it on my face, the back of my hands, my neck and decolletage! This for my face, and Pure Fiji Pure Fiji Body Butter - Coconut Milk &amp; Honey for my bod and I&#x27;m soft and hydrated all over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bargain jar DELIVERS and is under $20! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have normal/combination skin but the dry winter has been killing me. This has worked wonders... A lot of the other natural creams has my husband running in the opposite direction due to funky smells but this one doesn&#x27;t stink and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. My skin is soft and moisturized every morning. I think it&#x27;s a great non greasy hydrator I can keep using year round.</li>
            <li> This creme is non greasy. It feels good but one thing I don&#x27;t like is the fragrance. Really strange smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using VERY expensive night creams for the past few years 60-200$ ones. I decided after speaking with a skin specialist to Try a more natural Affordable night cream and a higher end serum under because supposedly the serums actually absorb into our skin and the moisturizer just moisturizers so it dosent matter what you use over the serum, I dont know about all that but I do know that I actually LOVE this night cream and will continue to use it for a long time! It is VERY hydrating, It has been my finding that if it seems hard to massage into your skin you arent using enough, You have to use a generous amount for the best effect. IT  leaves my skin SO soft in the morning and I absolutely love the scent. I do have semi sensitive skin and this did not irritate it at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Scent - wonderful and fresh, not strong or synthetic and does not linger long.&lt;br /&gt;* Moisturization- Wonderful! It goes on and makes my skin feel comfortable . I have combination dry flaky skin and use this at night after my clarisonic and my skin drinks it up. I do not feel like it is heavy or greasy but I definitely feel it on my skin which I like.&lt;br /&gt;*effects after you wash it off- my skin is still left smooth and soft after I wash this off. and I just absolutely LOVE what this is doing for my skin and I am so impressed with the price point. Especially if you have coupons you cannot beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have to give this 5 stars. I am seeing results, it does hydrate and soothe my skin. It does not clog my pores or make me breakout. This product is a WIN and thats coming from someone who is usually a department store junkie. I love this stuff. I also use the day cream and the sensitive cleanser. I would Love to try the mask next!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has this problem, but my eyelids get so dry anymore (I&#x27;m in my early 40s).  I know a really good, emollient cream can do wonders for my hands, so I gave this a try.  It is somewhat thick, but I don&#x27;t mind that because I use it at night.  I like it.  It has moisturized my poor eyelids and softened the skin around my eyes as well.  I will buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> I used this in the morning and evening for a couple of weeks, glopping it on pretty thick at night.  It tingles a lot, almost burns, and while my skin felt soft and hydrated to my fingers, my face still felt dry.  To be honest, Curel body lotion seems to do a better job.  I am still searching for an affordable yet less toxic solution.</li>
            <li> This cream has a lovely light scent. It emulsifies nicely without leaving a gross coating on top of my skin. It seems to moisturize well without leaving me feeling greasy. I&#x27;m a big fan and will be buying it when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite night time moisturizer, its creamy, but not greasy and has a great scent to it.  And the price was cheaper than the store</li>
            <li> Excellent night cream.  The hydration lasts right into the following day/evening.  It absorbs well and is NOT greasy.  I love it.  My skin is very dry and this cream does wonders for it.  Very reasonably priced compared to some of the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; brand names.  At this point, I am sure I will continue to purchase this night cream.  Good value also.</li>
            <li> The smell is not awful, but I do not really like it. I prefer either non-fragrance cosmetics or only slightly smelly with a clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is a pretty good cream, I still buy it because my girlfriend likes it.&lt;br /&gt;I use a Neutrogena night cream now instead, which is not quite as moisturizing but has a much better smell.</li>
            <li> The mosturizer feels nice on skin. I have a sensitive acne prone skin and I have had no problems with it. I have been using it for couple weeks now and still feels nice. it feels heavy and you need to be generous with it. But the skin absorbes it quick. I have to wait few more weeks to see results, so far nothing extraordanary.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations and more. I have already ordered another to make sure I had it on hand. Wonderful stuff</li>
            <li> Cream was not easy to use--too dry and drying. Love Burt&#x27;s Bees usually, but this did not live up to expectations. I am disappointed and so sorry because my daughters and I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products--use the cleanser all the time--as well as the baby products.</li>
            <li> … but, unfortunately, this moisturizer makes my skin break out. I use other moisturizers (likely with artificial ingredients I&#x27;d rather avoid) but they don&#x27;t cause this problem. I use other Burt&#x27;s Bees products (the eucalyptus and soap bark cleanser and mango shampoo are extraordinary) but this product is not so good for me. It has a reasonable texture (not too light or heavy) and lovely light scent. I don&#x27;t slather it on and have a normal skin type.</li>
            <li> This face cream made my skin get red and inflamed. I do have sensitive skin. So if you are sensitive I&#x27;d stay away from this. The consistency of the cream was nice and felt good going on.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry and sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers and creams, from drug store to high end brands, that promise to &amp;#34;hydrate&amp;#34; dry/very dry skin, but none of them do the job quite like this product does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this came in a huge tub because I would buy it! Upon opening, I noticed it smelled slightly (very slightly) medicinal. It is not unpleasant, but isn&#x27;t a fragrance I love. This smell goes away in a matter of moments after application. The consistency is very creamy and the texture is extremely smooth. This is a cream so it&#x27;s more solid than liquid, unlike many moisturizers and lotions, which means that it&#x27;s a bit heavier. However, it isn&#x27;t greasy at all and you can&#x27;t even tell that there&#x27;s any weight from the product on your face. It has a cooling and refreshing feeling when applied (not like the minty feeling, but more like splashing cool water on your face after a long day out). A little goes a long way with this product, which is saying something because I usually have to fully lather my face with other brands&#x27; products to get a fraction of the result I get with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use this product:&lt;br /&gt;I use 2-3 drops of either Fresh &amp;#34;Seaberry Moisturizing Face Oil&amp;#34; or Josie Maran &amp;#34;Argan Oil, Light.&amp;#34; I wait about 10 minutes for these oils to absorb into my skin and then apply the Burt&#x27;s Bees. Although this product works very, very well on its own, I include the face oils because my skin is THAT dry and the oils really help lock in moisture. (Side note: If you have extremely dry skin, look up face oils - specifically the two products mentioned above. They literally changed my skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product alone or with the face oil, the results are the same: I wake up the next morning with soft, smooth, and HYDRATED skin! No more dry patches or flakes (internal cringe) for me! This is my holy grail night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone with dry and sensitive skin, or even normal. However, if you&#x27;re extremely oily, you might not like this product.</li>
            <li> Extremely thick, doesn&#x27;t loosen up even when rubbed in hands. When I put it on my face, it pulls my skin, due to being so thick. It might be this seller, or this specific product may be old or expired or placed in a bad warehouse - I am not sure? I have generally had a good experience with Burt Bees night creams. Would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Love this facecream! Non-comedogenic means I don&#x27;t break out, feels oh-so smooth, and ultra creamy even for those frigid and dry Boston winters.... No more peely, dry skin on my face!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but not too fragrant. I really like how it makes my skin stay hydrated for hours after being applied. Great product</li>
            <li> this product does wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> This night cream is a little thicker than I am accustomed to, but so far so good.  I don&#x27;t necessarily like the smell but if it works on my skin I won&#x27;t care. By the end of the jar I&#x27;ll know if it beats Regenerist!</li>
            <li> Did exactly as advertised. The cream keep my face hydrated all day long and provide a nice matte finish to my face.</li>
            <li> I use it because it works. However, it gives me pimples. I need the sensitive skin kind. It&#x27;s a catch 22. I&#x27;ve recently been mixing the two together to give me more moisture than the sensitive kind but less pimples. Wish me luck. I&#x27;m no scientist.</li>
            <li> This night cream is everything I was needed. Very hydrating. The cream is thick and it kind of makes my skin feel a little waxy at first when I put it on (the feeling doesn&#x27;t linger) but it doesn&#x27;t make my skin look waxy at all. Definitely a go-to product for me!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Use it every day!!!  Very please and will continue to use it.  Great product and i will definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent, I prefer Burt&#x27;s bees sensitive line of products. I&#x27;d rather use a lighter mousturizer and use less of it</li>
            <li> Great Hydration cream. My skin is so smoothie. Love, love it!</li>
            <li> I use this- it is very calming on irritated skin. You can put it in the frig and put it on sunburns. I did find that it does stop up pores- just enough. So be careful with it and really look at your skin while you use it. Back off and use some Osmosis Polish if you notice it happening. But it does keep down the flakes!</li>
            <li> I bought a sample before I got this. My sample seemed to dry out or evaporate quicklty so I was worried that would happen with this one. Just keep it in a cool location, not in  your purse outside in the heat. It does give off a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I have excruciatingly dry sensitive skin. It&#x27;s difficult for me to find natural products that work for my odd skin type but this line by Burt&#x27;s Bees is phenomenal and I&#x27;m thankful their products are usually labeled as being cruelty free</li>
            <li> Even though I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, this cream was a bit thick for my skin.  I like the smell, though.</li>
            <li> This cream is very very heavy, too rich, hard to apply.  I have cut it with a much lighter moisturizer to avoid ditching it.</li>
            <li> Works well for dry face; The natural bees wax blend helps keep skin moist and hydrated over night or in cold weather.</li>
            <li> Like my review for the cleanser this does hydrate well (a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s best to do when skin is still damp from a toner so it spreads easier) but again it stings my face for a good full minute after putting it on. It&#x27;s not cheap so I feel I have to suffer through till its gone.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s the 2nd time I have purchased it and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> nice, feels a little cakey when you first put it on, but smells fresh and great for hydrating face overnight.</li>
            <li> I like this enough to order the regular delivery of this product but I do wish it was a little less thick. I need to have just washed my face and patted dry to smooth this on, otherwise it&#x27;s a little like trying to spread wet clay. Still, it smells nice, seems to keep my skin hydrated at night and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I just switched to this product from my most recent night cream and I have to say I won&#x27;t be sticking with it when it&#x27;s run out. The cream is thick, but feels waxy and heavy. When you rub it in your face, you really have to work it in; it also doesn&#x27;t make my face feel as hydrated as most night creams do. Also, the heavy glass jar is a nuisance if you&#x27;re a klutz like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: the smell is light, but nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: heavy&lt;br /&gt;Waxy&lt;br /&gt;Not &amp;#34;intense moister.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This night cream goes on smoothly, but does not absorb into the skin&lt;br /&gt; IT STAYS ON THE TOP OF THE SKIN AND DRIES TO AN UNCOMFORTABLE COATING.</li>
            <li> Little too thick for me, my 28-year-old skin just doesn&#x27;t need this much moisturizer.  My favorite night cream so far has been L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Youth Code day/night cream.</li>
            <li> good! My face  feel soft every morning!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase... to finally pay money for a product I will actually finish... a rarity for me. I have been all over the map recently with my skin care... searching for a healthier solution. I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have live in some harsh climates. My recent move to Arizona has left my skin flaky and dehydrated... to the point where I see every fine line and future wrinkle for that matter. I have been using Olay products for years and while having ok results (and some not so ok- due to having acute dermatitis) started looking around for another solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used products like Simple (Ok results), Olay (sometimes had allergic reactions to regenerist line), Yes (the consistency of the moisturizer drove me up the wall- but didn&#x27;t react with my skin), Philosophy (miracle worker- made my eyes lids swell and when it got in my eyes- burn terribly for about a hour), even to my latest ditch effort ($300) with the mall kiosk Seacret (I like the magnetic mud mask and the peeling get- I will continue to use those... but the rest of the daily skin care products didn&#x27;t feel like they justified the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a few different Burt&#x27;s Bees hand treatments for about a year and love them... so decided to try out the Intense Hydration Night Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a night cream... I expect it to be thick/rich/heavier than what I put on my face during the day... although, I have been using it during the day while I decide which day lotion I will purchase from Burt&#x27;s Bees. It does take about 30 to 40 minutes to absorb... it does have a very slightly waxy finish but it is not at all greasy. Once it has absorbed, my face is incredibly smooth, soft, and hydrated and remains that way all night/day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very little does go a long way. I haven&#x27;t had any reactions so I will give it MY stamp of approval for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! This product smells great and makes my skin so soft. It&#x27;s especially perfect for these super dry winter nights.</li>
            <li> This cream is very nice.  It makes my face feel very soft.  The only down side to it was the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great hydration. I use it on my hands too.</li>
            <li> I love this hydration night cream.  I actually use it for night and day.  Only apply sun screen during the night.  My face is no longer cracking dry</li>
            <li> keeps skin moisturized and is all natual</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees product. This cream is no exception. My skin is dry, even when it is humid out. This great product does not need to be reapplied, I use it in the daytime as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best night cream I have ever used and I&#x27;m talking about those high priced brand names that couldn&#x27;t keep my skin soft living in Colorado. The cream is so rich you only need to place just a dot at the end of your fingertip, a little goes a long way.  When I wake in the morning I can feel it still doing it&#x27;s job.  I know we all vary with our skin types but thankfully I&#x27;ve found what finally works on mine!</li>
            <li> I mix this with a tiny little bit of bio oil at night time &amp; it does amazing things for my skin. When you first apply only apply a small amount because it is thick &amp; that goes a long way!</li>
            <li> What happened to my favorite night cream? This is the second subscribe and save installment of this cream, and I opened my new jar when I had about a quarter of the old jar left - only to discover that the new jar contained a hard jar of waxy material instead of a jar filled with rich cream. I tried it, thinking it would prove to be less occlusive on than it looked in the jar, and instead I have a face covered with a waxy film that feels like it&#x27;s on top of my skin rather than sinking in. In formulation, it now feels more waxy and harder than the BB intense hydration mask, which makes me think there&#x27;s some error here - did I get a dud? I&#x27;ll be contacting Burt&#x27;s Bees about this - I&#x27;m massively unhappy at the difference.</li>
            <li> Love the thickness of this cream and the nine greasy feel it gives. However, I have seen no improvements to my skin in about a months use. I realize over the counter products don&#x27;t usually work the way the advertise so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much more than hydration anyway.</li>
            <li> So-so; wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> helps hydrate  dry skin</li>
            <li> Too thick for my liking. Not super nourishing. I end up washing the dried film off my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> it is good ,i love it</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  It smells wonderful and is rich yet not greasy.  I am a facial moisturizer snob and hard to please and for the price this is a great deal.  I also love the eye cream and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast deliver.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry T-zone area. I used to wear $$$ brand name moisturizer. When I lost my job, I thought damn I wont be able to afford my fave moisturizer anymore. So I went and started looking for a $ moisturizer. I love burt&#x27;s bees lip products, so when I found out that they have a moisturizer I was thrilled. After a warm facial steam and cleanser, I put a little of this product because the cream is  heavy. The product also has a light sage smell which I like. After several weeks of use, I wake up with hydrated skin. I recommended the product to my bf who is very anti-female brand mentality unless the product says &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; lol. He has very dry skin around the eyes and nose. After using it, he says it works wonder. My brother also uses it after I recommended it to him. :)</li>
            <li> the product meet my expectations</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees night cream every night for 30 days. I lightly massage it into my skin (face and neck) and it is quickly absorbed. I like how it feels on my skin, I like the light scent, and I like the results. My skin feels softer than before and I see a small reduction in appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees night cream is infused with Clary Sage. Clary Sage plant thrives in the harsh environments because it has ability to trap and retain moisture. This plant is the inspiration behind the Burt&#x27;s Bee hydration line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night cream has a pleasant light clean scent. The description says it is a natural scent of Clary Sage. It does not smell like a herb sage I am familiar with, it reminds me more of a clover scent. I don&#x27;t like strong scents and I did not find Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; heavy or overpowering, it is light \\&quot;background\\&quot; scent. The scent of the night cream is lighter than the scent of a Burt&#x27;s Bees day cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the packaging of Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; night cream. It comes in a wide tub that is easy to access and control how much cream you want to put on your face (I am attaching a photo of the opened container under customer photos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;aqua (water, eau), olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, glycerin, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, tapioca starch, parfum (fragrance), propanediol, salvia sclarea (clary) extract, lactobacillus, astrocaryum tucuma seed butter, garcinia indica seed butter, trichilia emetica seed butter, cera alba (beeswax, cire d&#x27;abeille), simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, candelilla/jojoba/rice bran poIygIyceryl-3 esters, jojoba esters, hydrolyzed jojoba esters, chondrus crispus (carrageenan), polymnia sonchifolia root juice, alpha-glucan oligosaccharide, maltodextrin, zea mays (corn) starch, sucrose, tocopherol, xanthan gum, glycine soja (soybean) oil, glyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium PCA, zinc PCA, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, phenoxyethanol, amyl cinnamal, eugenol, hydroxycitronellal, linalool \\&quot;natural fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I really like it, and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update September 2011&lt;br /&gt;It has been almost a year since I began using this cream.

I have tried several others but Burt&#x27;s Bees remains my favorite.  I like how it feels on my skin and the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I would give this more stars, except I seem to be allergic to something in it. After one day of use, my face broke out in red, itchy bumps all over. Never had a reaction to any product before, so not sure what ingredient caused it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if you&#x27;re not allergic to it, it does keep your skin very hydrated. Even just the one application took my skin from dry and flaky to feeling a bit smooth.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. How do you know for sure? It is good for sensitive skin. It has a pleasant texture and smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees products for years.  Their quality is consistent, any product is a safe bet.  I have sensitive skin and this cream is perfect for it.</li>
            <li> I use this cream after cleansing my skin before going to bed. it&#x27;s very gentle and helps my skin stay moisturized. I approve!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter so I actually use this as a day cream. It lasts all day and I don&#x27;t need to reapply until I was my face at night.</li>
            <li> very creamy, absorbs completely into skin</li>
            <li> super sad that this did not work out. I am all for more natural products, but for me, this isn&#x27;t the one. I love some of their other products!</li>
            <li> Works great after using the wash, and I will be purchasing the day lotion for all day moisture. My family and I are  sold on the products from BURT&#x27;S BEES.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought this after getting a sample in the mail.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how wonderful it felt.  I have sensitive skin, which is also very dry. Almost everything burns my face, but this was wonderful. It absorbs quickly and completely, and leaves my skin feeling almost plump. Bought some for my mom too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing...i did order this from Amazon, in December, and when I first got it out of the mail and opened it, I put some on.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice it was a different consistency than the sample I had tried. It seemed much thicker, almost hard to put on.  It didn&#x27;t even occur to me till the next day when I went to use it again and noticed how creamy and soft it was this time...it was just from being delivered in the cold, and it also sat in my mailbox overnight!  Was a completely different texture after it had time to settle back to room temp!  So if you get it in the mail, in the cold, maybe wait a day before using it.</li>
            <li> The best night cream ever! Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> This cream is ok. It is extremely thick and actually tugs on my face when I apply it. I would recommend to apply while skin is still damp. I have very dry skin in the winter and this didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;quench&amp;#34; my dry skin. My skin still felt tight in the mornings, but I didn&#x27;t have flakiness like before. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great night moisturiser</li>
            <li> Works great!  I have been using it every night for 2 weeks and my skin is so soft and hydrated!  I love this whole line !  I use the intense hydration cleanser, the day lotion and the eye cream too!  I am so glad I found these products!</li>
            <li> I am afraid that it&#x27;s too thick for me, but it&#x27;s really effective.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy and moisturizers well!</li>
            <li> Update 5-7-15: After using this for longer than 2 weeks my skin started to get clogged up, breaking out more often and actually feeling greasy in the morning. I&#x27;ve stopped use. It may be because the warmer Temps have finally arrived. Putting this aside until fall. Only deducted 1 star for this as up until it got warm outside this worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using for 2 weeks every night. I wash and use toner prior to applying. I have seen a dramatic change in my under eye circles and the lines on my neck. The smile lines around my mouth have plumped. I am very pleased with how little of this I have to use to apply to my face and neck. I was initially hesitant to purchase this due to its small size but I am glad that I did. The results have been fantastic and this little jar will last me quite a while. Great buy!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! Would highly recommend especially if you have sensitivities to facial products!! I have dealt with acne and sensitive skin for more years than I care to count and have tried so many face products but this is by far on the top of my list!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is my new favorite night cream!! Super hydrating and even helps clear my skin. and smells amazing!! I think the smell even helps me fall asleep. love it.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy night creme, a little goes a long way.  If you have dry or very dry skin this would work</li>
            <li> This is a little thicker than the previous night creams that I used.  But it does its job keeping the skin moisturized throughout the night.</li>
            <li> Ever since moving to an apartment with free heat using radiators my face and skin has been so dry. I would put hand cream on my face and it would still be dry in the morning. I decided to try this intense hydration cream for my night cream after my shower and it is amazing. It is not oily of any type, but it is thick. It kinda smells a little weird, but when I wake up in the morning my face is still moisturized. I also tried the day cream and was amazed by that was well, same results but a little lighter for the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with this cream for awhile!</li>
            <li> This is my second jar in 1 year a little goes a long way, but this is my daily night cream and I always use it. Makes the skin smooth like alabaster and soft as silk.</li>
            <li> I normally use Olay Regenerist Night Cream, but decided to give this a try. It has a really nice thickness to it, which I like in a night cream. It typically soaks into my face after about 10 minutes. I personally prefer how Olay&#x27;s stays moist all night, until I wash my face the next morning. However, for those of you who want a heavier night cream but no greasy feeling, this one is for you!</li>
            <li> My favorite night Cream,  I can feel the difference a minute I put it on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought which is my fault but is really great lotion luv it will purchase again when need.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin.  The only product that seems to make my skin look good and also moisturized in the morning is Olay Regenerist night cream- except I hate using products that aren&#x27;t natural.  I have no idea what&#x27;s soaking into my skin.  So, I&#x27;ve been using apricot oil- but it&#x27;s oily (obviously) and it still doesn&#x27;t hydrate enough.  So- I read these good reviews and hoped for the best.  I also bought a Clarisonic- so the dead skin that always looks bad is finally gone as well- but this was a perfect accompaniment!  I don&#x27;t have to use oil anymore.  I love the sage smell- smells like the sage candles I have in my house and it&#x27;s mild.  When it first went on, I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like it because it didn&#x27;t  soak in and made my skin feel tight.  But unlike the other lotions that made my skin feel tight- that went away and it actually did soak in and moisturize (usually when my skin feels dry after putting on lotion- it stays dry and gets worse).  Weird initial feeling but it works and it&#x27;s natural and I trust that the ingredients won&#x27;t harm me.  So glad I finally found this- and I don&#x27;t usually like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products all that much even though I try and go all natural!</li>
            <li> Love this! Scent is incredibly light and soothing and the cream makes my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bum. And for those who said this made their makeup cake up on them - it&#x27;s NIGHT cream. You put it on right before you go to sleep? If you&#x27;re  caking makeup on yourself right before going to sleep, I think you have some larger problems. This cream is excellent and the price point is spot on. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> the product&#x27;s effectiveness seems to be fine as I don&#x27;t expect a miracle out of this kind of product in terms of age renewal or hydration. good for daily use. one comment on the application, though. It is hard to put this cream on as it creates a thick layer of white mask on your face before it is absorbed. But sets in fine without any heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> The clary sage scent is repellent and long lasting but I was willing to overlook this if the moisturization was good.  It&#x27;s short lived and mediocre at best.  There was no &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; for me and my skin is is normal.</li>
            <li> At first it goes on a bit thick but it does go in.  Smells nice.  Due to this harsh winter it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough.  I changed to the Burt&#x27;s Bee product line and whilst I liked it, I did have a few pimples arise and I normally don&#x27;t and my skin in parts felt dry.  So I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it.  Maybe it would be okay in the summer.</li>
            <li> I light Burts Bees products and feel safe using them. This cream is not heavy or greasy. It feels rich and creamy and once applied skin is oh so soft. I use it every night and think it has helped my skin feel less dry. It should be part of your nightly regime.</li>
            <li> The product is very good, next time also to buy, thank you very much for amazon.</li>
            <li> Very thick on skin, it has a almost watermelon smell to it. I only use it when my skin is very very dry and even then it feels like I&#x27;m wearing a mask on my face.</li>
            <li> I never liked lotion that much, because personally I like the feeling of clean, dry skin (not bone dry, but I don&#x27;t like skin to feel damp or oily because of lotion). However in the winter months, the skin on my hands started cracking a little bit in places like knuckles especially, and the normal (inexpensive) lotion we usually get was not helping at all. I was also developing what looked like stress eczema on my hands in a couple of small patches. It looked very mild but it was itchy and painful, and my hands would swell somewhat, due to the irritation. So I started a nightly regimen of smoothing on a good layer of this intense hydration night cream and put white cotton gloves over my hands to help absorption. It took a while to recover my hands &amp;#34;back to normal&amp;#34; but this helped like nothing else.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best night cream I&#x27;ve used. I have combination skin that both breaks out and dries out easily, and this is the only night lotion that works for my face without clogging my pores. It isn&#x27;t as thick as some other creams, but it moisturizes really well and absorbs into the skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I tried radiance night cream first and like it better, so will go back to it. This is real nice, but doesn&#x27;t spread well on skin, so I gave it 4 stars. After using it at bed time, I did wake up to softer skin. Just wish it would spread better.</li>
            <li> Good price, and really keep your skin moisture, when I woke up in the morning, I can tell and feel the moisture.  I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a night cream without all the chemicals you find on the drugstore shelves promising to roll back the clock ten years.&lt;br /&gt;A think a face cream should feed and nourish your skin like the food you put in your body. I thoroughly cleanse the day off my face in the evening, and while it&#x27;s still moist and towel blotted, I put this cream on and it is like a nice luxurious treat for me. It is fragrance free&lt;br /&gt;and it seals in the moisture that hasn&#x27;t evaporated from my skin, since it is freshly cleansed. I wouldn&#x27;t try it on dry skin, because the&lt;br /&gt;purpose is to seal in the moisture. It says in the directions to use in the evening after cleansing, so there must be something to it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m not looking for &amp;#34;results&amp;#34;; I was just looking for a good night cream and this is my second jar. I so like it that I&#x27;m going to try&lt;br /&gt;their day cream. This really soothes my sensitive skin and I look pretty good in the morning. During the day, I use a gel moisturizer in a different natural line with no SPF because I have an SPF in my foundation.</li>
            <li> ive used it one night only but realized ive got some pimples on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will be trying a few more days, but i agree with some reviewers. its texture is really thick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it feels really dry when you apply it . so far not so impressed... :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( One day after !  )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i found out that its better to apply this one first right after you wash face, and then apply other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feels weird putting cream right away.. but it worked better !</li>
            <li> I like the way my face feels when I use this cream.  It has a heavy feeling that I expect in a night cream.  It is a little harder to apply than other night creams I have used in the past.  I do not stick to one daily/nightly cleansing and moisturizing routine, so I do not use this every night.  But when I do, I cleanse my face first, use Witch Hazel toner, then apply this, and my skin feels great.  I am 51 years old and have skin that is sensitive to certain products.  I have not had any adverse effects on my skin from this product.  Since I do not use regularly, it has not made a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My first order of this cream from Amazon left me very satisfied, I love the product - it moisturizes my dry winter skin beautifully without leaving a greasy feeling (it really soaks in), the ingredients are natural, there is very little scent, etc - I was in love... After running out of my first jar, I quickly ordered another, but this time, the cream is different. Both of the jars I ordered are shipped and sold by Amazon and I can&#x27;t imagine Amazon would be selling a counterfeit product or anything but the second jar of cream is a much, much firmer consistency than the first one I had, maybe Burt&#x27;s Bees changed their formula?! While they smell similar and feel similar on my skin, the second jar of cream is incredibly dense and thick, it&#x27;s very hard to get out of the jar without a small plastic spatula whereas the first jar was thick, yet soft enough to easily dip a finger in to remove product. It doesn&#x27;t spread as easily and when I try to mix it with my foundation to make a tinted moisturizer (something I do often and was able to do with the first batch, no problem) it clumps up and doesn&#x27;t blend easily with the liquid. It&#x27;s very strange. I just don&#x27;t really understand how there could be so much variation between the two jars only ordered 2 months apart from each other. I won&#x27;t be continuing to use this second jar because it is breaking me out, definitely a different formula than the first jar I purchased,I am not at all impressed with my second purchase of this product.. I am considering purchasing another jar elsewhere for further comparison... I will update my review when I come to a conclusion.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does not leave your face greasy. It has a nice smell, but it&#x27;s very subtle. I like it better than Olay Regenerist.</li>
            <li> Got this for a steal on Amazon, the product is great and smells wonderful.  It is a heavy cream but not greasy at all and no objections from my husband when I come to bed after putting it on (wink-wink).  It is a great winter night cream when the furnace is running and air is dry inside and outside.</li>
            <li> I purchased Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products as they do not have parabens. I fully expected to receive a nice so-so product that would be safer for me to use. What I did not expect was a night cream that left my skin feeling softer and more hydrated than ANY other night cream I have used in the past (and I am almost 50 so I have used a few!).  This is an excellent product and I am recommending it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> This cream is really, truly awesome. It absorbs relatively fast but you need to make sure you don&#x27;t put on more than a finger pads worth. Its super thick and does have a slight smell to it. However, it does leave your face super smooth and hydrated in the morning. I have extremely hypoallergenic and acne prone skin and I have had no irritation thus far.</li>
            <li> Although its scent and smooth texture are quite pleasant, am afraid this particular Burt&#x27;s Bees product was disappointing, in that I expected more thorough hydration.  Other Burt&#x27;s Bees products are much more effective.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this hydrating night cream. It does hydrate the skin well and plumps it up for a more youthful appearance. It does keep away fine lines and wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out. I even love the scent of this moisturizer since it is calming and refreshing. It smells like sweet herbs such as sage. Most importantly, it isn&#x27;t greasy or oily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling heavy. I can even put makeup over this moisturizer when I want to where it as a day cream instead of a nighttime moisturizer. The natural ingredients in this product are outstanding and I must say my skin looks and feels good again. There definitely won&#x27;t be another moisturizer for me. This one is it for sure.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free as part of a \\&quot;BzzAgent\\&quot; campaign. However, after having used it for several weeks I can honestly recommend it and say I will buy it in the future. Here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always on the lookout for a good moisturizing cream, as part of my essential skin care. But even more so right now as, just like another reviewer, I&#x27;m doing some peels. While the end result of the peels should be fabulous skin, in the meantime, it is mostly very dry skin that needs to be moisturized intensely...To me, that&#x27;s the ultimate cream test: not only being able to maintain the skin when it is in its \\&quot;normal\\&quot; state, but also being able to replenish it when it is extremely dry. Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream does that and does it very well. I can see my skin is being \\&quot;renewed\\&quot; more rapidly and doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;tight\\&quot; from the peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is very pleasant: thick, but not heavy, and easy to apply. It also absorbs really quickly, so I will even use it during the day on weekends. Overall, that&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> Favorite face cream. Feels good, smells good and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been going through different brands, trying to find something that works, doesn&#x27;t smell/fragrance fee, and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell strong at all and feels so rich on the skin.</li>
            <li> While it does feel a little waxy going on, it soaks in smooth and leaves my skin feeling great. A little goes a long way, so this small jar will likely last me months. Smells nice, too! Fragrant without being overwhelming like so many other beauty products.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good product for the price ($16.00 ).  When I  tried to order some more lately,and found out the price of the same product was up to $31.00,  For this price,I probably will go back to what I have been used name brand night cream. What a shame !</li>
            <li> I started developing a rash at the age of 60 on my face... doctors have been unable to diagnose the cause... this product cured the problem within one month</li>
            <li> I used this product this morning instead of tonight I am amazed at how soft and smooth my face feels.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a light night cream, this is not it. This is very thick and a little goes a long way. Very intense hydration, my new fav!</li>
            <li> Not as good as you think</li>
            <li> I was really impressed by this product because it was both effective and non-intrusive.  I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like strong scents but had no issues with this cream and did see a decrease in the small wrinkles that I am unfortunately suffering from.  The scent is refreshing and my face is moisturized without having the heavy feeling that has accompanied other moisturizers that I have used.  I strongly recommend this cream and am delighted that even a small amount is very effective.  I had the good fortune of qualifying to participate in a Bzz campaign that provided me with the Intense Hydration Night Cream, Treatment Mask and Cream Cleanser and am really pleased to have been introduced to this great product.</li>
            <li> Very surprised to find this product very good, I like very much, the next will also buy. The share my happiness to a friend.</li>
            <li> the same as the day lotion, it is too oily for summer, my wife will use it in autumn and winter</li>
            <li> Great product to use during the winter months when my skin gets dry/flaky. I put this on each night before bed, works great.</li>
            <li> I removed 2 stars because it is a very thick cream and has an almost waxy consistency that wont spread evenly or easily without a applying a lot of pressure with my fingers to really rub it in hard. I would personally prefer something more creamy and spreadable. This thick cream might be good for someone who works outdoors with cold wind hitting their face, who needs a thick mask of cream to protect  the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the more natural ingredients. I refuse to spread chemical cocktails of toxins all over my face with ingredients found in most conventional creams and serums. My dry winter skin is already showing difference after only a few applications combined with the Burts Bees Ageless Intensive Repairing Serum. It has a very mild and pleasant smell, nothing overpowering and perfumed like most creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably wont buy again simply because of the thick, waxyness. I will be sticking with their Intensive Repairing Serum since it goes on and spreads so easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for three weeks now. My skin is normal/dry in the summer and dry in the winter and for me this provides a good amount of moisture.It&#x27;s non-greasy. You can feel it on your face but it&#x27;s not the oil slick you get with most dry skin night creams.  It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and I use it around my eyes as a eye cream at night too. I&#x27;ve even used it after a bi-weekly lunchtime peel,which for me is 40% glycolic acid for 3mins. So many moisturizers sting after an acid peel that I began to use pure safflower oil post treatment. It&#x27;s good for a drugstore face cream. It was $17 and I got a $3 off coupon online so it&#x27;s a good deal. If you have very dry skin Roc has a deep wrinkle night cream with retinol that is phenomenal for a \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; cream and compares to creams 4 times it&#x27;s price. But if your skin is sensitive to retinol, or you want a natural soothing product, this one works just fine. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Will not even worth a dollar. It is not easy to spread it on your skin and feels so thick like sitting on top of your skin. honestly, this belongs to the garbage.</li>
            <li> I love to use this stuff in the winter when my face is more dry. Love it!</li>
            <li> This cream was thicker than I expected. But it means that you only need to use a little so goes a long way. Very intense moisturising and didn&#x27;t feel greasy but made my skin feel really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this. Great buy</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and scaly, especially in winter.  I recently started using this cream and it has made ALL the difference!  For years, I have used moisturizing lotions, but oddly enough they left my skin greasy yet still dry.  I admit was hesitant to try something new because of my sensitive skin, and it does feel a bit strange going on, like it is too thick to absorb.  I was very skeptical with the first use.  However, ever since the first morning after using this, my skin has stayed moisturized throughout the day without having to use an additional daytime moisturizer, and the oily shine is a thing of the past!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier about finding this!!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  This product actually works...and smells good too.  It hydrates without leaving a greasy feel.  I feel like it is feeding my skin.</li>
            <li> Protect wet, wipe the skin feels very exquisite</li>
            <li> moisturizes the shhh out of my face! Im only 25 but this stuff will keep me looking this way for atleast 4 to 5 years.. then i&#x27;ll be 26 for awhile (wink wink) lol. I seriously do love all burts bees.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using the sensitive one for a very long time and tried to apply more in the winter, it didn&#x27;t work well This one is definitely a much better choice.</li>
            <li> Each received I send gifts my friends are very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Because these products are now required, and it is natural.</li>
            <li> I have always been a burt&#x27;s bees fan, so when I saw this facial night cream, I had to give it a try! Although I don&#x27;t always use it, every morning after my face feels so soft. It&#x27;s not super greasy, so I never feel like I am going to break out from it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have Keratosis Pilaris and I&#x27;ve been trying to find a decently priced moisturizer that works,finally I found this! It costs about $17 at target. It&#x27;s a really thick cream, doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, and it has a very light scent. I will be buying again. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive. $16 for one and a half ounces is ridiculous. All of Burts bees products are priced far too high. There are other products all natural and organic they do just as well and carry a better price tag.</li>
            <li> Feels good, extremely thick which is better than being watery. Too early for me to determine if it really works. However, it does moisturize my face well and does not cause breakouts. My concern is wrinkles and this is where I need more time to assess whether or not it helps with them. I will update in a few of weeks.</li>
            <li> Tried this based on the reviews.  I don&#x27;t like it.  Goes on thick and waxy.  My kids literally hate the smell. They cringe at the smell when they kiss me good night.  I joke to put some on right under their noses if they miss behave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-it didn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be going back to Kheil&#x27;s 24 hour moisturizer/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually moved to write a review on my own.  When I get a request to sometimes I&#x27;ll say a sentence or two but, I have to say, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this as much as I do.  First the texture, it was creamy and thick but not oily.  The smell is wonderful.  Mild but clean smelling.  But my favorite is the way my skin just drinks it in.  And it doesn&#x27;t end up all over my pillow!!  Love it.  It will definitely stay on subscribe!</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizer, the only cream that really makes a difference on my skin! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great night cream. I have semi-oily skin. my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> Love this face cream. I initially was using Burts &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; face cream, which was okay...but the Intense Hydration is a much thicker cream. I actually feel like I&#x27;m putting something moisturizing on my face at night. I use it along with the face cleanser from the same line. Both smell nice. Recommended</li>
            <li> After years on Amazon, I am finally writing my first review and it is for Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream with Clary Sage. Because this product is just that good. I need to disclose that I am not normally a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan - I can appreciate their company ethos and their natural, paraben-free philosophy but I&#x27;ve had my various skin care regimes that have worked fine for me. However my gym started leaving a little basket of samples of this night cream in the locker room and after a couple of weeks of grabbing \\&quot;just a couple more\\&quot; I decided I better buy the darn jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am so glad I did. The full size product lives up to the promise that the samples gave me. The consistency could be considered a bit light for a night cream but really, it is the perfect thickness to feel comforting for a night cream but not heavy or greasy like others I&#x27;ve used. It absorbs into skin like a dream and I can&#x27;t stop rubbing my cheek after I&#x27;ve put it on - so soft! And the scent is comforting, soothing, and elegant in a natural way. When I wake up in the morning, my skin is happy and hydrated, but not oily at all - I don&#x27;t even feel like I need to wash my face in the morning (like I&#x27;ve felt after wearing heavier creams at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you believe that even after a long, hard day, the promise of putting this cream on will actually get me to wash my face before bed every night? With makeup remover and everything? It must be a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Burt&#x27;s Bees. I just adore this cream.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and my skin looks so good!</li>
            <li> Not really hydrating. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Natural and it is pleasant smelling moisturizer</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s very hydrating without greasy feel</li>
            <li> Wife said that this stuff works great</li>
            <li> About two years ago during a pregnancy, I started dealing with very dry skin. I tried product after product and asked two doctors about it. They gave me random samples but nothing seemed to hydrate my skin. FINALLY I have found a system that works! I love it!! I have always loved the Burt&#x27;s Bees line and this just adds to the list of things that I love!! My fine lines are plumped up and less noticeable and the flakes are almost non-existent now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this nightly for weeks. I love the citrus scent and it fades away after applying it. It is very moisturizing yet not sticky or overwhelming. Since adding this to my skincare routine, I have not needed as many products. I used to use a serum, Cerave lotion and a neutrogena night cream on top of that. Now I can get better results from the night cream only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample through BzzAgent and asked to share my honest and unbiased opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> Clary Sage is my new favorite scent. I used this on my feet and hands and just loved it!</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price. Very rich cream.</li>
            <li> I really love this face lotion! It leaves my face soft and moisturized but not oily! I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really really great, it is very thick and moisturizing and I can definitely tell a noticeable difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees products a few days ago and I seem to have broken out a little more. Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the products, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see if it improves.</li>
            <li> I put this cream on at night after washing up. The texture is perfect - not too oily or thick - and my skin feels super smooth when I wake up. It&#x27;s really fantastic face cream.</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
