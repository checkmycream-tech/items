            <li>I tried it and loved my skin.</li>
            <li>Good for a cheep highlighter under the eyes and the concealer is good for spot concealing on the face (not under the eyes)</li>

            <li>I feel in love with this product witch I have never tried before.</li>
            <li>Works okay, but I would rather just have more of the concealing formula instead of having the illuminating formula.</li>
            <li>This product applied easily, though I wish it came in a tube.  </li>
            <li>this was a fantastic deal.</li>

            <li>It didn&#x27;t give me the full coverage n hide my scars..</li>
            <li>the same.you do get a small amount but works great</li>
            <li>The highlight side definitely brightens by eyes and covers up the bags I&#x27;ve acquired since losing a lot of sleep (newborn baby).&lt;br /&gt;The concealer is okay.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>i like very much this product, it really delivers without the hefty price tag.</li>

            <li>If I had been able to see the color up close I would have realized that it was just a bit too dark for my face, I do like it however, because it does hold up well.</li>
            <li>I was particularly looking for a concealer which can cover the blemishes and scars on my face..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it adds a shine to my face but covering dark spots and hiding bags under the eye its useless</li>
            <li> This is not a good concealer.</li>
            <li> Very unfortunate.</li>

            <li> It has concealer and illuminator. Concealer does not work well with my asian (light brown) skin type but illuminator works well. I think I need tan/dark shade.</li>
            <li> If I had been able to see the color up close I would have realized that it was just a bit too dark for my face, I do like it however, because it does hold up well.</li>
            <li> I needed a dupe for my Giorgio Armani concealer, this one was it!  This product applied easily, though I wish it came in a tube.  Both the highlighter and concealer work well for every day work use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping to conceal my under eye circles. Instead it made them look darker and just did not help at all.</li>
            <li> Nice!  Very nice love the brush, because you just dot it on where you need it!  Great formula, and the highlighter is good too, for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> i like very much this product, it really delivers without the hefty price tag. Love it! creates a bright look around the eye.</li>
            <li> The highlight side definitely brightens by eyes and covers up the bags I&#x27;ve acquired since losing a lot of sleep (newborn baby).&lt;br /&gt;The concealer is okay. I will probably buy this again!</li>
            <li> Very unfortunate.Maybelline has discontinued this concealer and their replacement is NOT the same.you do get a small amount but works great so i dont mind. I was SO happy to find a couple on amazon!</li>

            <li> I like the concealer part but don&#x27;t see how the other side highlights anything. It doesn&#x27;t. Just make one of the concealer on its own and I will love you forever! And if you do have one, someone tell me! ;)</li>
            <li> This is not a good concealer. I like the instant age rewind dark circle eraser much better. I&#x27;m 37 and need quality concealer you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> this was a fantastic deal. i bought several as stocking stuffers and they worked just as i had expected. A+++</li>

            <li> I feel in love with this product witch I have never tried before. The only problem I had was that the cover up half ran out so fast I thought maybe it was a used items. It wasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m hooked though and will try to find just the concealer side.</li>
            <li> Ok product!!!! I was particularly looking for a concealer which can cover the blemishes and scars on my face.. It didn&#x27;t give me the full coverage n hide my scars..</li>
