            <li>thank you it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Great Buy!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s even great to wear alone.</li>
            <li>The color is so nice, I can just put it on and my nails look perfect.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Ingrown Gone Ingrown Toenail]] and a good nail file to help with keeping the nails and skin trim after the fact.</li>
            <li>So I would say it is a good product to have.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It dries really fast too which is so great!</li>
            <li>Use by itself and it provides a nice polished look.</li>
            <li>Nice product but</li>
            <li>Item came packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>Without nail polish, it gives a nice manicured look without being too noticeable when it chips.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice &amp;#34;bare&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>I goes on easy, and dries immediately so you can go onto your manicure!</li>
            <li>Makes my nails feel really strong!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so healthy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried most of them including CND, OPI and Nail Tek.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so healthy</li>
            <li>I have also used it as a top coat</li>
            <li>I use it on top of their nail strengthener and then put their top coat on.</li>
            <li>I love this, it makes my nails grow so fast and makes them really strong!</li>
            <li>My nails aren&#x27;t flimsy anymore; they&#x27;re strong and even useful for opening things!</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It goes on with a light clear/white coat</li>
            <li>What I like best about this one is that if you use two coats and a shiny top coat it is a very pretty pale white color on its own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with it so far, it&#x27;s made the nail polish stick and not chip for much longer than before.</li>
            <li>The color seems very opaque in the bottle but goes on ok.</li>
            <li>, she says that it makes her nails stronger, which is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with how the whole system works, and plan to be using it for a long time!</li>
            <li>Worth the shot if you have troubles with keeping your nails from breaking.</li>
            <li>I apply the clear top coat - no chips ahead.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a moment, and it has helped me from getting any more ingrown fingernails.</li>
            <li>It lasts more than a week, even with hands scrubbing and in the sink regularly.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it to all you nail lovers out there!</li>
            <li>It definitely seems to strengthen my nails and make them healthier, which I love.</li>
            <li>But I assume than a coat of this on the nails is better than nothing at all, since it has essential nutrients for the nails like &amp;#34;protein&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Even though it is a little girly, it really works as a good self treatment to try to stop nibbling my nails and the skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good price for Essie products, usually they are around 8-9 dollars.</li>
            <li>One coat gives a soft matte finish, then I top with quick dry Northern Lights for a two minute polish job with the slightest tinge of sparkle.</li>
            <li>Definitely give it a try if you have nails that break and peel easily.</li>
            <li>/break rather easily because I&#x27;m constantly immersing my hands in water (e.g. washing dishes).</li>
            <li>My nails have never looked better, and are long!!!</li>
            <li>As described and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of bases and just really like this one.</li>
            <li>And the shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>I use this product in combination with the Millionails treatment by Essie and it works really well.</li>
            <li>And it really does help make my nails healthier and stronger.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in my nails.</li>
            <li>Really helped my nails.  </li>
            <li>so my nails were very damaged.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected!</li>
            <li>Helps your colors last longer plus whenever you clean your nails off</li>
            <li>Helps your colors last longer plus whenever you clean your nails off</li>
            <li>Using this 2 coat style - as my main polish - afterward</li>
            <li>last long, especially when paired with the top coat!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it really makes my manicure last that much longer, but my nails seem a lot stronger already.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t any better than Revlon or even Cover Girl - not worth the money at all-my nails where chipping the same day!</li>
            <li>I really like the Sally Hansen Ingrown Toenail one because it gets into spaces that are a pain to do with regular clippers.</li>
            <li>I bit my nails for nearly 20 years.</li>
            <li>and it really helped my manicures last longer.</li>
            <li>I was having problems with frequent nail breaks and</li>
            <li>this product completely solved it.  </li>
            <li>and it gives a soft, creamy finish to my nails which I like.</li>
            <li>This is the best base coat I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>My nails are stronger and growing faster - and the chic basic color kind of screams rasta without the green yellow and red awkwardness that won&#x27;t match your outfits, especially if you&#x27;re like me - and love pink!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this I was surprised to like the slightly-nude, neutral color it left on my nails, so I actually didn&#x27;t follow up with a color.</li>
            <li>Best base for fragile nails!!</li>
            <li>I finally figured out the &#x27;magic&#x27; trick is actually using a base &amp; top coat to keep it lasting</li>
            <li>This product goes on really well and prevents staining from dark nail polishes.</li>
            <li>The basecoat protects your natural nail color, while providing a solid foundation to lock the color and help provide a long life to your polish.</li>

            <li> I think the Essie protein base is amazing!</li>
            <li> I acctidently filled my thumb nail too thin and it hurted, once I put Essie protein base coat on really made my nail strong and does last for a while would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It goes on thin and dries quick.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, especially since it got such got such great reviews.</li>
            <li> This is good base coat, you can use with or without the nail polish.</li>
            <li> I was never much of a &#x27;do your nails&#x27; type girl, but I&#x27;ve been trying to cut back on gnawing my fingernails and the dry skin around them off.</li>
            <li> (I use KPT Thermals) + basecoat, let it all dry, and then put the Essie Apricot Cuticle Treatment over the dry skin and cuticles around the polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect base coat for thin nails...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect base coat for thin nails...</li>
            <li> Works very well helped my weak nails</li>
            <li> (red orange and yellow are so hard to match with pink)</li>
            <li> Great base coat!  </li>
            <li> Really great base coat!</li>
            <li> Nice base for other polish colors.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> It helps my nails stay thicker (due to the protein) and grown longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a good base coat.</li>
            <li> Plus, my nails don&#x27;t stain when I use dark colors anymore.</li>
            <li> Recently switched to this after using a Sally Hansen base coat for a long time and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I love this base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Essie products for a little while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a nail product destroy my nails the way that</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I find if I reapply every few days when I wear it without polish my nails stay healthier.</li>
            <li> However, my nail polish chipped so easily no matter what the brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, I picked up this Essie Protein Base Coat (as well as a few of their other products) after trying to paint my nails and really suffering a lot of chipping that didn&#x27;t make sense to me.</li>
            <li> The base coat looks white in the bottle but dries clear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that this product strengthened my nails, but it works well as a base coat and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I usually paint my nails to try to prevent excessive breakage.</li>
            <li> Used as a base for other nail polishes, it increases longevity of polish by several days.</li>
            <li> The base just does the work and my nails are clearly stronger since I use this.</li>
            <li> this has.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, I also have very slow growing nails</li>
            <li> Works no better or worse than my other base  coats</li>
            <li> My nails are paper thin and now, they aren&#x27;t see thru anymore</li>
            <li> typically use one really thin layer of the Essie Protein Base Coat +</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this base coat under my nail polish for a few months now, and you&#x27;d never even know the difference.</li>
            <li> Two very thin of my nailpolish</li>
            <li> A bad habit, but a habit I&#x27;ve always had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear it both under my polish as a base coat and without polish for a layer of protection on my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using as a base coat</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my nail polish lasts longer with this base coat.</li>
            <li> but this is the worst base coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Makes my nails feel really strong! It dries really fast too which is so great! I never paint my nails without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect base coat for thin nails... Helps your colors last longer plus whenever you clean your nails off they&#x27;re so healthy. I&#x27;d recommend this item to any nail junkie.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first I acctidently filled my thumb nail too thin and it hurted, once I put Essie protein base coat on really made my nail strong and does last for a while would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The color seems very opaque in the bottle but goes on ok. Nice base for other polish colors.  As described and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of bases and just really like this one. Definitely makes a difference when I use this before a color coat and it&#x27;s even great to wear alone.</li>
            <li> Use this basecoat before applying polishes. The basecoat protects your natural nail color, while providing a solid foundation to lock the color and help provide a long life to your polish.</li>
            <li> I know every one is different but this is the worst base coat I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve never had a nail product destroy my nails the way that this has.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, I also have very slow growing nails so it&#x27;s taking forever to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;I have two bottle of a product I will never use. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried most of them including CND, OPI and Nail Tek.  My nails are healthier since using it and my polish stays on days longer.  Great find!</li>

Even though it is a little girly, it really works as a good self treatment to try to stop nibbling my nails and the skin around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had anything else to recommend, it would to be to get something like [[ASIN:B004KRYXCK Sally Hansen Ingrown Gone Ingrown Toenail]] and a good nail file to help with keeping the nails and skin trim after the fact. I really like the Sally Hansen Ingrown Toenail one because it gets into spaces that are a pain to do with regular clippers. It only takes a moment, and it has helped me from getting any more ingrown fingernails.</li>
            <li> This is good base coat, you can use with or without the nail polish. I haven&#x27;t used it personally but my daughter uses it and she likes it, she says that it makes her nails stronger, which is good enough for me. So I would say it is a good product to have. And the shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> This is a great base coat. I have tried them all. What I like best about this one is that if you use two coats and a shiny top coat it is a very pretty pale white color on its own.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s truly amazing!!! My nails have never looked better, and are long!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product in combination with the Millionails treatment by Essie and it works really well. The base just does the work and my nails are clearly stronger since I use this. Worth the shot if you have troubles with keeping your nails from breaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Essie products for a little while and I like the way it&#x27;s been healing my nails. I had to stop using acetone products and this has helped to replenish my nails back to health.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. I wear it both under my polish as a base coat and without polish for a layer of protection on my nails. It goes on thin and dries quick. I find if I reapply every few days when I wear it without polish my nails stay healthier.</li>
            <li> Even though this says base coat, it looks great used alone for every day. One coat gives a soft matte finish, then I top with quick dry Northern Lights for a two minute polish job with the slightest tinge of sparkle. It lasts more than a week, even with hands scrubbing and in the sink regularly. Used as a base for other nail polishes, it increases longevity of polish by several days.</li>
            <li> thank you it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I think the Essie protein base is amazing! I goes on easy, and dries immediately so you can go onto your manicure! It helps my nails stay thicker (due to the protein) and grown longer. It&#x27;s a really good price for Essie products, usually they are around 8-9 dollars. I really recommend it to all you nail lovers out there!</li>
            <li> I love this, it makes my nails grow so fast and makes them really strong! I recommend it to everybody</li>
            <li> I bit my nails for nearly 20 years. I&#x27;ve been using this base coat under my nail polish for a few months now, and you&#x27;d never even know the difference. My nails aren&#x27;t flimsy anymore; they&#x27;re strong and even useful for opening things! Woo hoo!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. It goes on with a light clear/white coat so your nails look manicured. And it really does help make my nails healthier and stronger. My nails are paper thin and now, they aren&#x27;t see thru anymore cause I use this product.</li>
            <li> Works very well helped my weak nails</li>
            <li> It works! And it doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails.</li>
            <li> Use by itself and it provides a nice polished look.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this I was surprised to like the slightly-nude, neutral color it left on my nails, so I actually didn&#x27;t follow up with a color. I just left it as-is. It definitely seems to strengthen my nails and make them healthier, which I love.</li>
            <li> Great base coat!  It&#x27;s definitely makes any nail polish last long, especially when paired with the top coat! Great Buy!</li>
            <li> Really great base coat!</li>
            <li> Using this 2 coat style - as my main polish - afterward I apply the clear top coat - no chips ahead.  My nails are stronger and growing faster - and the chic basic color kind of screams rasta without the green yellow and red awkwardness that won&#x27;t match your outfits, especially if you&#x27;re like me - and love pink! (red orange and yellow are so hard to match with pink) this color works with all seasons - and all colors- no matter what!!</li>
            <li> Recently switched to this after using a Sally Hansen base coat for a long time and I really like it! I don&#x27;t know that it really makes my manicure last that much longer, but my nails seem a lot stronger already. I&#x27;ve been using as a base coat and when I don&#x27;t feel like polishing, I wear it alone. Definitely give it a try if you have nails that break and peel easily.</li>
            <li> This product goes on really well and prevents staining from dark nail polishes.It&#x27;s the perfect base coat for thin nails... Helps your colors last longer plus whenever you clean your nails off they&#x27;re so healthy</li>
            <li> My nails peel/break rather easily because I&#x27;m constantly immersing my hands in water (e.g. washing dishes). I usually paint my nails to try to prevent excessive breakage. However, my nail polish chipped so easily no matter what the brand. I started using this and it really helped my manicures last longer. I have been using this for a few weeks now (3 manicures) and all of them have lasted so much longer than before. Plus, my nails don&#x27;t stain when I use dark colors anymore. Yay! Love this! Buy it!</li>
            <li> This protein base coat is great.  I was having problems with frequent nail breaks and this product completely solved it.  It also makes my polish last 4-5 days longer.  The base coat looks white in the bottle but dries clear.</li>
            <li> Nice product but haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in my nails. But I assume than a coat of this on the nails is better than nothing at all, since it has essential nutrients for the nails like &amp;#34;protein&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really helped my nails.  Seller sent product immediately.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t any better than Revlon or even Cover Girl - not worth the money at all-my nails where chipping the same day! Very disappointed, especially since it got such got such great reviews. I would not but this again. It&#x27;s really hard to find a good base coat. Still looking!</li>
            <li> I love this base. The color is so nice, I can just put it on and my nails look perfect.</li>
            <li> Item came packaged nicely. I have noticed that my nail polish lasts longer with this base coat. I have also noticed that the tips of my nails actually peel, like the actual nail, not nail polish. Great base coat but something in the formula doesn&#x27;t seem to work with my nails</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I do my nails two to three times a week so my nails were very damaged. Just after one time of using it, I could tell a difference!!</li>
            <li> I like to wear this with and without nail polish.  Without nail polish, it gives a nice manicured look without being too noticeable when it chips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only use this one since I bought it but it didn&#x27;t seem to hold the polish as well as it said. Will try again and update review later.</li>
            <li> Works no better or worse than my other base  coats</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that this product strengthened my nails, but it works well as a base coat and dries quickly.  I have also used it as a top coat and it gives a soft, creamy finish to my nails which I like.</li>
            <li> Best base for fragile nails!! I use it on top of their nail strengthener and then put their top coat on. Gives a nice &amp;#34;bare&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected!</li>
