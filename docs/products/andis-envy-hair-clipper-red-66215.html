            <li>The clippers were good, attractive and had a good.  </li>
            <li>these are the best ones I&#x27;ve found, they are easy to work with,&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li>Was looking for a good clipper to use at home.  </li>
            <li>Maybe you will get the good product.</li>
            <li>Cuts great and still better than a Wahl brand clipper.</li>
            <li>This is a good set, I just think the plastic material of the clippers doesn&#x27;t allow the hair to slip through very easily.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great clipper for a great price.</li>
            <li>This clipper felt nice in my hands and had some weight to it.  </li>

            <li>Great but and fast delivery</li>
            <li>These clippers are my favorite</li>
            <li>It pays for itself and more.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>Maybe someone who had more formal training in using a clipper would get a better result...</li>
            <li>Although they make top of the line trimmers and edgers, their clippers have been sub par.</li>
            <li>Better than all the others I have bought</li>
            <li>This clipper is better than the one we had before, but it still doesn&#x27;t get everything in one pass.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are pretty cheaply made and didnt do a great job on buzzing the hair.</li>
            <li>I am glad to see the price has come down and feel that at $33 they are an excellent buy.  </li>
            <li>and you can find replacement blades easily on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am sure someone with a little more skill than me would be able to give a great haircut.</li>
            <li>This clipper seems to be running just fine</li>
            <li>Cuts through the hair quick and smooth !</li>
            <li>Good product I love the fact that it doesnt get hot fast.</li>
            <li>Instead I bough myself some Oster Fast feed clippers and love them!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with these clippers, fast, don&#x27;t get caught and really cut my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>Runs smoothly</li>
            <li>Cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li>But once it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>clippers are precise and smooth.</li>
            <li>and so far so good, i&#x27;ll recommend this product</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>It  a good cutter so far.</li>
            <li>Aside from that the first thing I noticed when I got a hold of it is that its very light and grips snugly into your palm.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with.  </li>
            <li>It would be a great product if it would cut a little better</li>
            <li>I look a lot better then last week thanks to a good self administered haircut to the scalp.</li>
            <li>Motor runs cool.</li>
            <li>Thanks &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Does the job, feels strong, i had a first hair cut with it</li>
            <li>great quality not too heavy not to light.</li>
            <li>My first clipper!</li>
            <li>I only cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>This is worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice even cut and quiet.</li>
            <li>fiddling with the lever, the noise reduced a bit (not as much as i would have liked as noise reduction is directly proportional to power loss/vibration of the the clipper.</li>
            <li>As a hair stylist, I&#x27;ve used and loved other Andis brand clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li>I like how smooth &amp; powerful they Cut &amp; fades Hair , an different size comb attachments makes it easy to evenly Cut hair</li>
            <li>It seemed to help and the blade screwed back on very easily.</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations were just too high, but I&#x27;m wishing I had just bought another cheap clipper like I had before.</li>
            <li>The cord was nice and long.  </li>
            <li>Excellent power and smooth cutting.</li>
            <li>My wife cuts my hair and after years of using the cheap hair cutting &amp;#34;Kit&amp;#34;, all she could say was these clippers are awesome.  </li>
            <li>the prices are very reasonable as well.</li>
            <li>they run quiet, don&#x27;t get that hot, and do a fine job!</li>
            <li>I used to use Wahl hair clippers for the last decade or more.</li>
            <li>I finally decided I wanted something better</li>
            <li>I am male and I go to the barber every so often but most of the time I just buzz my hair off.</li>
            <li>and I love the red color.</li>
            <li>it got really hot.</li>
            <li>they also don&#x27;t seem to get hot like some clippers do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cuts well, and does the job, except whenever he first turns it on</li>
            <li>too heavy, and are at a great price on here compared to professional beauty supplier stores they get the job done very well!</li>
            <li>After my last ones had been dropped, I ordered these in hopes they&#x27;d be just as good as my last ones.</li>
            <li>clipper feels good in the hand, doesnt get that hot, but the only real problem it constantly trips the outlet, so i need to keep resetting it any and every time i turn the clipper on and off.  </li>
            <li>This clipper is easy to use and is definitely reliable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 9 months it would quit working at certain angles</li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Works well and is very efficient.</li>
            <li>With these they cut fast and did not pull his hair</li>
            <li>It is working well and still feels smooth and solid.  </li>
            <li>I (ignorantly) thought combs would be universal fit - wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you want an inexpensive, durable, smooth, solid pair of clippers, buy these without reservation.  </li>
            <li>These clippers were reasonably priced and work like a charm.  </li>
            <li>They do the job very well.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s very fond of it.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re in Canada and after much research, chose the Andis.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Andis.</li>
            <li>item is very affordable.</li>
            <li>better than i expected</li>
            <li>The other is that it does not come with the number 5 and number 7 guard, and they are not available for purchase at retail stores, but I called the manufacturer and they were happy to send me, free of charge, a complete set of guards.</li>
            <li>One week or so after giving my son a fairly close cut (#2 and #3 attachments), he already looks shaggy because of the many little stray long hairs it left all over.</li>
            <li>First, I had to call the manufacturer and order replacement combs for the clipper directly.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me, and need angled combs, do your homework and spend a little more and get what you really need.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like these clippers</li>
            <li>I also paid a few bucks and got a warranty that is more comprehensive at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Will be tossing these and looking for a new brand to try.</li>
            <li>However, I plugged in and turned it on, and it was VERY loud.  </li>
            <li>I just have so many other universal (oster and wahl size) attachments that it couldn&#x27;t justify me keeping these.</li>
            <li>The blades are not as sharp and it does not stay cool after 10 min.</li>
            <li>a little cheap</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a professional, maybe look elsewhere as the plastic guides are a little cheap compared to what they have at the salon, but for a family it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Initially, I was a little surprised by the weight and the loud &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; it makes when turned on, but I attributed this to being a more &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; clipper than the one I used to use.</li>
            <li>I save a lot just cutting my hair myself and these clippers work great.</li>
            <li>These clippers are professional level and at this price its a steal.</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old clippers because I couldn&#x27;t get a replacement blade for it.  </li>
            <li>It  is that Loud you cannot use it.</li>
            <li>It is like trying to shave with a Angle Grinder that Loud</li>
            <li>It gives off a very quiet purr as if it isn&#x27;t putting much effort</li>
            <li>wicked loud</li>
            <li>I eventually had to go to a hair salon to get it all fixed up.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have done around my 6 yr old</li>
            <li>They would overheat,get jammed up easily, and would take a long time to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>This clipper is fine for normal work, but if you&#x27;re a professional it sucks.</li>
            <li>I had to return it for repair and the cost of shipping may have not been worth the return if it breaks down again.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is a nice quiet set, very sharp!</li>
            <li>Thick and fine hair gets caught.</li>
            <li>I had only bought the cheap department store Wahl brand in the past and they had angle combs.  </li>
            <li>Complete and utter</li>
            <li>I went back to using my old andis and a comb and blade to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>I decided to ignore the bad reviews and focus on the good ones, subconsciously hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones to receive the &#x27;good&#x27; product from good reviews rather than the &#x27;bad product&#x27; from bad reviews as I have always been that lucky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i hate spending money on a hair cut, when with a few tutorials i could cut my own hair and do it better..</li>
            <li>It seems new however the box seems opened and crushed.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed that it&#x27;s adjustment wasn&#x27;t as low as I had experienced when I used a friend&#x27;s Andis on my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty &amp; powerful, never bogs down or pulls hair like less powerful ones.</li>

            <li> They do the job very well.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s very fond of it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re in Canada and after much research, chose the Andis.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Andis.</li>
            <li> item is very affordable.</li>
            <li> better than i expected</li>
            <li> The other is that it does not come with the number 5 and number 7 guard, and they are not available for purchase at retail stores, but I called the manufacturer and they were happy to send me, free of charge, a complete set of guards.</li>
            <li> One week or so after giving my son a fairly close cut (#2 and #3 attachments), he already looks shaggy because of the many little stray long hairs it left all over.</li>
            <li> First, I had to call the manufacturer and order replacement combs for the clipper directly.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me, and need angled combs, do your homework and spend a little more and get what you really need.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like these clippers</li>
            <li> I also paid a few bucks and got a warranty that is more comprehensive at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Will be tossing these and looking for a new brand to try.</li>
            <li> However, I plugged in and turned it on, and it was VERY loud.  </li>
            <li> I just have so many other universal (oster and wahl size) attachments that it couldn&#x27;t justify me keeping these.</li>
            <li> The blades are not as sharp and it does not stay cool after 10 min.</li>
            <li> a little cheap</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a professional, maybe look elsewhere as the plastic guides are a little cheap compared to what they have at the salon, but for a family it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initially, I was a little surprised by the weight and the loud &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; it makes when turned on, but I attributed this to being a more &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; clipper than the one I used to use.</li>
            <li> I save a lot just cutting my hair myself and these clippers work great.</li>
            <li> These clippers are professional level and at this price its a steal.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old clippers because I couldn&#x27;t get a replacement blade for it.  </li>
            <li> It  is that Loud you cannot use it.</li>
            <li> It is like trying to shave with a Angle Grinder that Loud</li>
            <li> It gives off a very quiet purr as if it isn&#x27;t putting much effort</li>
            <li> wicked loud</li>
            <li> I eventually had to go to a hair salon to get it all fixed up.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have done around my 6 yr old</li>
            <li> They would overheat,get jammed up easily, and would take a long time to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> This clipper is fine for normal work, but if you&#x27;re a professional it sucks.</li>
            <li> I had to return it for repair and the cost of shipping may have not been worth the return if it breaks down again.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is a nice quiet set, very sharp!</li>
            <li> Thick and fine hair gets caught.</li>
            <li> I had only bought the cheap department store Wahl brand in the past and they had angle combs.  </li>
            <li> Complete and utter</li>
            <li> I went back to using my old andis and a comb and blade to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> I decided to ignore the bad reviews and focus on the good ones, subconsciously hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones to receive the &#x27;good&#x27; product from good reviews rather than the &#x27;bad product&#x27; from bad reviews as I have always been that lucky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i hate spending money on a hair cut, when with a few tutorials i could cut my own hair and do it better..</li>
            <li> It seems new however the box seems opened and crushed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it&#x27;s adjustment wasn&#x27;t as low as I had experienced when I used a friend&#x27;s Andis on my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty &amp; powerful, never bogs down or pulls hair like less powerful ones.</li>
            <li> zips right through thick hair, doesn&#x27;t tug at the hair at all as with some</li>
            <li> As a professional stylist in a salon with primarily male clientele, I was a little hesitant based on my prior experience with Andis clippers.</li>
            <li> Only minor complaint is that the plastic guards feel a little cheap.  </li>
            <li> I paid $60 for my first one this one is half the price and half the quality.</li>
            <li> This is not a major issue as you may not need to ever order combs, but I did.  </li>
            <li> The lever that moves the smaller blade comes loose everytime.</li>
            <li> Clipper works like any other clipper machine and different levels seem to be the same.</li>
            <li> so it mqlade the whole hair cutting ordeal so much easier.</li>
            <li> I only have 2 issues with these clippers, when you extend the lever to the half sizes, it does not cut well.</li>
            <li> So far this one is cutting really well.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased cheaper clippers in the past and they didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;there is always room for improvement but for the price I have no compliants and if you need a pair of clippers just buy these at least so far</li>
            <li> Overall these clippers are legit and paid for themselves with a few cuts.</li>
            <li> (minus one star)</li>
            <li> I will try it for a week and if the blade keeps slipping out of place will return it.</li>
            <li> It only has a few combs/sizes</li>
            <li> The seller sent it fast but not really happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Heavy and not as quiet as i wanted.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like so many other things, these are hard to find up here.</li>
            <li> It has been properly oiled and maintained between uses however it isn&#x27;t cutting evenly and seems to bog down quickly.  </li>
            <li> The powerful noise/vibration also dislodged the alignment, which I found really difficult to realign as compared to other Clippers i have used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the plastic guides are insanely sharp, when fading hair or just taking hair off it seems as if it&#x27;s scratching the scalp.</li>
            <li> I was having issues with my other clippers and was concerned about buying a brand</li>
            <li> The noise was so bad he absolutely refused to have that machine near him.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t come with a case.</li>
            <li> My dad was previously using a Wahl razor that you can buy at a store like Costco or bjs.</li>
            <li> if i mess up,</li>
            <li> I have to hold my finger on it tightly while I cut with them.</li>
            <li> I mean they are literally plastic, but there aren&#x27;t any issues with them, they just probably won&#x27;t hold too long if you&#x27;re using them and switching them out for 8 hours a day.</li>
            <li> I bought these to cut my little ones hair as a replacement for some cordless conair ones I bought that took forever to cut his hair and pulled it.</li>
            <li> they have made it through 3 buzz cuts with no snagging and fast cutting.</li>
            <li> It still seems to cut somewhat unevenly.</li>
            <li> Plus, the combs are rather sharp, so if I push too hard in an effort to get all the hairs, it irritates his scalp.</li>
            <li> Not heavy to hold or awkward.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is because I am an amateur, but I did not like this clipper.</li>
            <li> However, I was not pleased with the cut it gives, either.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just ours</li>
            <li> Disappointed about this product because it was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I wil update when I notice the blades getting dull or a problem</li>
            <li> The past 6 months the clipper has dramatically decreased in performance.  </li>
            <li> It also pulls and clients are unhappy with the (minor) pain it causes.</li>
            <li> Yes, they&#x27;re quiet, but even after cleaning and oiling, they pull hair so bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for over 50 years and this never happened with my previous 2 clippers.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of paying 15+ dollars for someone to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> used it one round on my son&#x27;s head and gave up as the cutting was also not up to par.</li>
            <li> weird.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which made it useless</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m a youtube, hair cutting, wax/paste/fiber product wearing junkie.</li>
            <li> No problem cutting the husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Blade just broke off for no reason... didn&#x27;t fall or anything..weird.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time great product</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming my husband and sons hair! Runs smoothly</li>
            <li> Works well and is very efficient. Very good investment and will save on the cost of getting your hair cut.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT and it was cheaper here than at Sally&#x27;s with my discount!!!</li>
            <li> Does the job, feels strong, i had a first hair cut with it and so far so good, i&#x27;ll recommend this product</li>
            <li> So far so good i have no troubles with it I love it. What more do you want Thank you</li>
            <li> I like how smooth &amp; powerful they Cut &amp; fades Hair , an different size comb attachments makes it easy to evenly Cut hair</li>
            <li> Great product and price!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product I love the fact that it doesnt get hot fast. It would be a great product if it would cut a little better</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m a youtube, hair cutting, wax/paste/fiber product wearing junkie. i hate spending money on a hair cut, when with a few tutorials i could cut my own hair and do it better.. if i mess up, oh well it will grow back and i didn&#x27;t spend 25$ on a cut.  clipper feels good in the hand, doesnt get that hot, but the only real problem it constantly trips the outlet, so i need to keep resetting it any and every time i turn the clipper on and off.  the plastic guides are insanely sharp, when fading hair or just taking hair off it seems as if it&#x27;s scratching the scalp. Overall these clippers are legit and paid for themselves with a few cuts. they run quiet, don&#x27;t get that hot, and do a fine job!</li>
            <li> As a hair stylist, I&#x27;ve used and loved other Andis brand clippers and trimmers. After my last ones had been dropped, I ordered these in hopes they&#x27;d be just as good as my last ones. I was wrong. Yes, they&#x27;re quiet, but even after cleaning and oiling, they pull hair so bad. Instead I bough myself some Oster Fast feed clippers and love them!</li>
            <li> I bought these to cut my little ones hair as a replacement for some cordless conair ones I bought that took forever to cut his hair and pulled it. With these they cut fast and did not pull his hair so it mqlade the whole hair cutting ordeal so much easier. They also come with guards all the way up to 1 in. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t come with a case.</li>
            <li> I like this but the on and off switch has a short in it or something. I have to hold my finger on it tightly while I cut with them.</li>
            <li> Great but and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I used to use Wahl hair clippers for the last decade or more. They would overheat,get jammed up easily, and would take a long time to cut my hair. I finally decided I wanted something better so I read some reviews online and went to the local Sally Beauty Supply; they were on sale for 34 bucks or so and I bought them. Very pleased with these clippers, fast, don&#x27;t get caught and really cut my hair nicely. I am male and I go to the barber every so often but most of the time I just buzz my hair off. I save a lot just cutting my hair myself and these clippers work great. They also have a two year warranty/I also paid a few bucks and got a warranty that is more comprehensive at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have owned these Envy clippers for approx. 6 months.  It is working well and still feels smooth and solid.  I only cut my own hair.  I am glad to see the price has come down and feel that at $33 they are an excellent buy.  The reason I only gave 3 stars is twofold.  First, I had to call the manufacturer and order replacement combs for the clipper directly.  This is not a major issue as you may not need to ever order combs, but I did.  And here is why. Second, the manufacturer does not have angled combs for around your ears for this model.  Again this may not be an issue for you, but I need them and will have to fashion my own with a belt sander!  I had only bought the cheap department store Wahl brand in the past and they had angle combs.  I (ignorantly) thought combs would be universal fit - wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an inexpensive, durable, smooth, solid pair of clippers, buy these without reservation.  If you are like me, and need angled combs, do your homework and spend a little more and get what you really need.</li>
            <li> These clippers were reasonably priced and work like a charm.  I was having issues with my other clippers and was concerned about buying a brand I wasn&#x27;t familiar with.  I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like these clippers and I love the red color.</li>
            <li> These clippers quit on me after the 3rd use.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty &amp; powerful, never bogs down or pulls hair like less powerful ones. Great kit &amp; Made in the USA!</li>
            <li> These clippers are professional level and at this price its a steal. They do the job very well.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old clippers because I couldn&#x27;t get a replacement blade for it.  So far this one is cutting really well.  Not heavy to hold or awkward.</li>
            <li> My first clipper! This clipper is easy to use and is definitely reliable. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great clipper for a great price.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying 15+ dollars for someone to cut my hair. I am balding anyway, so I have opted to just buzz my hair. I have used this clipper enough already that it has paid for itself. I also use it to trim my beard prior to shaving. Cuts smoothly. No pulls or snags. I am sure someone with a little more skill than me would be able to give a great haircut. I have purchased cheaper clippers in the past and they didn&#x27;t last long. This clipper seems to be running just fine and you can find replacement blades easily on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is not the same quality clipper I ordered 5 years ago. I paid $60 for my first one this one is half the price and half the quality. The blades are not as sharp and it does not stay cool after 10 min. it got really hot.</li>
            <li> great product in my opinion and great customer support. the prices are very reasonable as well. i also bought the hair trimmer by Andis.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this produce to anyone, The price is great for do it yourself. It is also easy to use.</li>
            <li> These clippers are my favorite I will not buy another brand or model these are the best ones I&#x27;ve found, they are easy to work with,&lt;br /&gt;not too heavy, and are at a great price on here compared to professional beauty supplier stores they get the job done very well!</li>
            <li> Cuts great and still better than a Wahl brand clipper. After a month the Andis clipper would turn on and off  while in the on position (never dropped it, handled with care). In order to keep the clipper from shutting off I need a rubber band to keep pressure on the switch. Has not shutoff yet while the rubber band is on.  UPDATE JULY 17, 2015 Rubber band or not, it finally gave out. KAPUT! (minus one star)</li>
            <li> It  is that Loud you cannot use it. It is like trying to shave with a Angle Grinder that Loud you need Ear Muff&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I received this item tonight after opening the box the blade is completely crooked. I unscrewed it and kinda realigned it. It seemed to help and the blade screwed back on very easily. It still seems to cut somewhat unevenly. I will try it for a week and if the blade keeps slipping out of place will return it.</li>
            <li> they have made it through 3 buzz cuts with no snagging and fast cutting. so far im impressed. they also don&#x27;t seem to get hot like some clippers do. I wil update when I notice the blades getting dull or a problem happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is always room for improvement but for the price I have no compliants and if you need a pair of clippers just buy these at least so far they work great and cut faster than cheapies</li>
            <li> Great clippers to cut any type of hair into any style!!! It pays for itself and more. I am glad that I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is because I am an amateur, but I did not like this clipper. Initially, I was a little surprised by the weight and the loud &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; it makes when turned on, but I attributed this to being a more &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; clipper than the one I used to use. However, I was not pleased with the cut it gives, either. One week or so after giving my son a fairly close cut (#2 and #3 attachments), he already looks shaggy because of the many little stray long hairs it left all over. Plus, the combs are rather sharp, so if I push too hard in an effort to get all the hairs, it irritates his scalp. Maybe my expectations were just too high, but I&#x27;m wishing I had just bought another cheap clipper like I had before. Maybe someone who had more formal training in using a clipper would get a better result...</li>
            <li> I bought it back in June for my father and he&#x27;s very fond of it. Aside from that the first thing I noticed when I got a hold of it is that its very light and grips snugly into your palm. It gives off a very quiet purr as if it isn&#x27;t putting much effort but it slices hair like a ninja sword! It only has a few combs/sizes but that&#x27;s all you need. My dad was previously using a Wahl razor that you can buy at a store like Costco or bjs.</li>
            <li> These clippers work! Excellent power and smooth cutting. My wife cuts my hair and after years of using the cheap hair cutting &amp;#34;Kit&amp;#34;, all she could say was these clippers are awesome.  We&#x27;re in Canada and after much research, chose the Andis. Unfortunately, like so many other things, these are hard to find up here. Amazon.com saves the day again...and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this Envy Hair Clipper for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday, and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts well, and does the job, except whenever he first turns it on it goes *CLACKKKK* wicked loud and it scares him. But once it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s fantastic. I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering buying this as a gift or as a daily (weekly or monthly) hair care product.</li>
            <li> This is a good set, I just think the plastic material of the clippers doesn&#x27;t allow the hair to slip through very easily. Other than that it is a nice quiet set, very sharp!</li>
            <li> After using it for only 6 times, the power would not stay on.  I had to return it for repair and the cost of shipping may have not been worth the return if it breaks down again.  It is under warranty for 1 year but you have to pay for the shipping charges to send it for repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for over 50 years and this never happened with my previous 2 clippers.  I used them until I wanted a quieter one or lighter one.</li>
            <li> Works well and bought it as a multi-purpose trimmer for head and face. I was disappointed that it&#x27;s adjustment wasn&#x27;t as low as I had experienced when I used a friend&#x27;s Andis on my beard and mustache. Nonetheless, it works well and woulud recommend but not for facial trimming.</li>
            <li> The lever that moves the smaller blade comes loose everytime. Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a good clipper to use at home.  Had purchased some cheaper clippers and regretted it.  This clipper felt nice in my hands and had some weight to it.  No problem cutting the husband&#x27;s hair.  The cord was nice and long.  Only minor complaint is that the plastic guards feel a little cheap.  *Update 1/10/16 - going to drop a star in the rating.  The past 6 months the clipper has dramatically decreased in performance.  It has been properly oiled and maintained between uses however it isn&#x27;t cutting evenly and seems to bog down quickly.  Will be tossing these and looking for a new brand to try.</li>
            <li> I  bought this in a pinch. As a professional stylist in a salon with primarily male clientele, I was a little hesitant based on my prior experience with Andis clippers. Although they make top of the line trimmers and edgers, their clippers have been sub par. I only have 2 issues with these clippers, when you extend the lever to the half sizes, it does not cut well. The other is that it does not come with the number 5 and number 7 guard, and they are not available for purchase at retail stores, but I called the manufacturer and they were happy to send me, free of charge, a complete set of guards. Thanks, Andis.</li>
            <li> Works great and is serving the intended purpose quite well.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner considering we are overseas.  However, I plugged in and turned it on, and it was VERY loud.  This is advertised as a &amp;#34;quiet motor&amp;#34; and there is nothing quiet about this.  Disappointed about this product because it was reasonably priced.  Returning for a refund today.</li>
            <li> The seller sent it fast but not really happy with the product. It seems new however the box seems opened and crushed. Clipper works like any other clipper machine and different levels seem to be the same.</li>
            <li> Would like to changes rating&lt;br /&gt;After 9 months it would quit working at certain angles&lt;br /&gt;Which made it useless&lt;br /&gt;Which made me scrap it and go back to wahl</li>
            <li> The clippers were good, attractive and had a good.  I just have so many other universal (oster and wahl size) attachments that it couldn&#x27;t justify me keeping these.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It zips right through thick hair, doesn&#x27;t tug at the hair at all as with some clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a professional, maybe look elsewhere as the plastic guides are a little cheap compared to what they have at the salon, but for a family it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By a little cheap I mean they are literally plastic, but there aren&#x27;t any issues with them, they just probably won&#x27;t hold too long if you&#x27;re using them and switching them out for 8 hours a day.</li>
            <li> item is very affordable. great quality not too heavy not to light. clippers are precise and smooth. Would recommend to anyone that cuts hair.</li>
            <li> Heavy and not as quiet as i wanted.</li>
            <li> It  a good cutter so far. Cuts clean and good.</li>
            <li> better than i expected</li>
            <li> I look a lot better then last week thanks to a good self administered haircut to the scalp. Nice even cut and quiet. Of course, at my age anything is an improvement</li>
            <li> This clipper is fine for normal work, but if you&#x27;re a professional it sucks. Thick and fine hair gets caught. It also pulls and clients are unhappy with the (minor) pain it causes. I bought the Sterling Reflections and can honestly say it&#x27;s at leadt 10 times better.</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer, Cuts Smooth!!! Totally recommend buying this item! Works as describe. Motor runs cool. Cuts like a charm on any hair. Thanks &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> A very good, high quality hair cutter for the money.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> The clippers are pretty cheaply made and didnt do a great job on buzzing the hair. I eventually had to go to a hair salon to get it all fixed up.</li>
            <li> Complete and utter trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch hasn&#x27;t worked properly.  And when it has run, it has cut me.</li>
            <li> Nice set. One has to remember to oil the blade area before each use.</li>
            <li> I decided to ignore the bad reviews and focus on the good ones, subconsciously hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones to receive the &#x27;good&#x27; product from good reviews rather than the &#x27;bad product&#x27; from bad reviews as I have always been that lucky.&lt;br /&gt;My luck ran out in this case.&lt;br /&gt;On turning it on,(which I shouldn&#x27;t have done around my 6 yr old whose hair I was about to cut), my son jumped out of the chair, the living daylights scared out of him. The noise was so bad he absolutely refused to have that machine near him.&lt;br /&gt;After fiddling with the lever, the noise reduced a bit (not as much as i would have liked as noise reduction is directly proportional to power loss/vibration of the the clipper. The powerful noise/vibration also dislodged the alignment, which I found really difficult to realign as compared to other Clippers i have used.&lt;br /&gt;I used it one round on my son&#x27;s head and gave up as the cutting was also not up to par. I went back to using my old andis and a comb and blade to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;Some andis clippers are great. This, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;Who knows? Maybe you will get the good product. I certainly didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great clipper for the price !! Cuts through the hair quick and smooth !</li>
            <li> Better than all the others I have bought and it has not worn out or lost teeth!</li>
            <li> Great clipper and for professional use as a barber works amazing and holds up very well very impressed would deff buy again</li>
            <li> This clipper is better than the one we had before, but it still doesn&#x27;t get everything in one pass.  It is rather quiet, which is another bonus.  Sometimes, when switching hands, my husband said that the power button will pop out of place short off and on.  Not sure if it&#x27;s just ours or if anyone else has this issue, too.</li>
