            <li> Ponds makes great creams. I use the face wash and this night cream and they work well together.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  Provides good moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this, I prefer than other more expensive brands. It works on fine lines on my face. I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> ❤️❤️❤️ This stuff is great! Smells good, feels good, my skin looks great!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and my skin already is a lot softer.  It helps the wrinkles also!!! That is a plus.  I would recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> This product knocks all others out of the ballpark. I&#x27;ve used every cream I could get my hands on but none left my face wrinkle-free and really soft until now.</li>
            <li> Just start using it but it feel good on my face I can see my face is looking smooth n shine,</li>
            <li> Works like a wonder!  And inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I tried this while traveling and love what it does for my skin.  Amazon is one of the only places to find it (I was traveling internationally) and so happy that I can continue to get it.  My skin looks great with this and I would recommend to all.  I use on my face, neck and hands, It seems to help exfoliate and so your skin is brighter.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you try it.</li>
            <li> This cream is the bomb! Used it in Mexico and now I get it from Amazon. It is the most fantastic cream I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> Good price! This works just as well as some of the way more expensive brands that I&#x27;ve tried. Just don&#x27;t use it in the eye area - as with most of these anti-aging products. I&#x27;m still looking for something to turn back time (like Cher) but I haven&#x27;t found that yet.  This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a couple of weeks now have seen a noticeable difference in my skin texture and beautiful luster ,and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and years and you just cannot beat it!</li>
            <li> I use this product at night. I basically bought the whole line of Ponds products once I used my two smaller sample jars while in Spain. I recommended the product to all my friends as it keeps my complexion soft and reduces wrinkles without break outs and a great price compared to any other skin line.  The pink jar removed the spots on my face that I had for ten years and my sister-in-law had bad spots and yesterday I noticed that they had already began to fade and get smaller.</li>
            <li> Very good product, non problem! Thanks</li>
