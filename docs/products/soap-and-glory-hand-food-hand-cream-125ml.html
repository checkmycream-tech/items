            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a product that would heal and protect and finally I&#x27;ve found it!</li>
            <li> Working in the medical field my hands had become so dry with frequent handwashing.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, especially in the winter, but this lotion keeps them hydrated all day, as I apply it several times.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need alot, so a tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My hands instantly feel soothed, smooth, and even visibly look healthy instead of dry but without that nasty, greasy sheen that I get with everything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> As a nurse who washes her hands and uses hand sanitizers constantly, my hands are dry, flaky and/or cracked at any given time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hand cream, but it&#x27;s twice as expensive from amazon as it is from other places.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy, and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands close to 20 times a day due to my work, and this is the only hand cream that after just one use makes my hands go from sandpaper to silk.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hands and elbows</li>
            <li> My hands we so dry from using Clorox</li>
            <li> im rough with my hands.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> so I find that this tube will last longer that your usual hand lotion.</li>
            <li> i have always had dry feet year round.</li>
            <li> no fun.</li>
            <li> It seems thicker than regular lotion, but not quite as thick as body butter.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a disgusting soap - not even a good scented one.</li>
            <li> bought the little scraper thing--</li>
            <li> Not much more to say</li>
            <li> my dad who is an electrician swears by this stuff after a hard days work.</li>
            <li> had to wash my hands at least 5 times to diminish the smell -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and the moisture stays with your hands after applying it.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time not rubbing my hands together just to feel the glory of this hand cream!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this hand cream.</li>
            <li> I was so sad when Target stop selling this brand</li>
            <li> It was an expensive lesson on reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy and not my thing.</li>
            <li> I am crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Addicted!!!!!</li>
            <li> However, it smells terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought the whole line.&lt;br /&gt;This product smells very good&lt;br /&gt;i Love this product so much</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion! (Actually, I love the smell of all the Soap &amp; Glory products.) It&#x27;s thick and the moisture stays with your hands after applying it.</li>
            <li> Smell is just HEAVENLY.  Love this entire line.  Wouldn&#x27;t go without it now that I&#x27;ve tried it.  Addicted!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the body butter, but this product makes my hands peel. I think my problem may be with glycerin in products. Will not be making repeat purchase</li>
            <li> im rough with my hands. Between CrossFit and constantly washing my hands because I have two boys. It can really do a number on someone&#x27;s hands. I love this hand lotion. It helps with my callouses and dryness. A little goes a long way so I find that this tube will last longer that your usual hand lotion. I&#x27;ve recently discovered soap and glory products and so far, I&#x27;ve become a huge fan.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say, it is a great product, moisturizes my hands, leaves a nice scent on them. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> The best hand lotion I have used.  Get it, your hands will be so soft.  I know some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I think it is great.</li>
            <li> This medium-thick cream quickly absorbs into the skin leaving your hands moisturized and soft.  The fresh, soft scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and lingers for a short period of time.  A definite repurchase for me.</li>
            <li> Working in the medical field my hands had become so dry with frequent handwashing. I was looking for a hand lotion that will help with the dryness. I came across this on Amazon..read the reviews and decided to try it. I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months and I have noticed the difference. My hands don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;ve been in water for hours and they feel smoother. Would buy another one once I run out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry skin</li>
            <li> i have always had dry feet year round. bought the little scraper thing--no fun. so i started looking for creams, etc. that touted that theirs was the best. tried 2 diff products--eh, somewhat effective. still had to scrape. when i saw that soap and glory had an item for feet, i got excited cuz i love their bath items. so i ordered. let&#x27;s just say the other 2 products are in the garbage--this stuff is great!!!!!! you don&#x27;t need alot, so a tube will last a long time. i saw positive results in one week---without scraping!!! a must have, especially if you wear alot of sandals and flip&#x3D;flops.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand cream. Love the smell also.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Makes my feet and hands softer and smells great.  I got my first tube as a gift.  I quickly knew I wanted more.  Happy to find it here, on Amazon.  I would recommend this cream to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I heard about this hand cream on the Marilyn Show, and looked everywhere for it here (Alberta) with no luck, so I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  It is a great non greasy hand cream that leaves your hands very soft, and also has a nice scent.  I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hands and elbows but I don&#x27;t like that greasy feeling that comes with most lotions and creams! I was walking around a store when I saw this and bought it on a whim.  I am so pleased to say that this stuff really REALLY works. My hands instantly feel soothed, smooth, and even visibly look healthy instead of dry but without that nasty, greasy sheen that I get with everything else I have tried. And it works great on my elbows too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a strong fragrance (it&#x27;s a floral scent) and usually that would bother me...but I LOVE the way that the lotion makes my hands feel so much that I am totally willing to over look it! Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> i couldnt find this cream here in my local sephora so i order it on line this is the best hand cream ever my hand get sweaty with any other and this doesnt make my hands sweaty i have already order 5 more jars and i am almost about to finish it</li>
            <li> For me i&#x27;ll give it  4 of 5  as a HANDS MOISTURIZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall it&#x27;s a fabulous cream. It&#x27;s has a good smell, not sticky, hands absorb it very fast, had a lotion texture, and it&#x27;s comes in cute tube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it, and definitely I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It seems thicker than regular lotion, but not quite as thick as body butter.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy, and it lasts a long time.  I also like it because if I accidentally have my rings or watch on when I put this on, it&#x27;s easy to get it off of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, but the smell is amazing.  I will be buying this product repeatedly.</li>
            <li> The lotion is good. It&#x27;s not too greasy but the smell is strong. I think overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> smells good, isnt greasy, leaves my hands feeling so good. i would buy more when this one runs out. its just enough to use to get your hands moisturized and not be too much it doesnt get absorbed.</li>
            <li> Love it. Love the smell</li>
            <li> Best ever. Not greasy. Smells fabulous. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is the best. It works super-fast and keeps your hands hydrated for hours. The smell is wonderful! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer and a great cream for all the right reasons. However, it smells terrible. It smells like a disgusting soap - not even a good scented one.</li>
            <li> Love this but too expensive</li>
            <li> I am beyond picky when it comes to hand cream,I don&#x27;t like to feel like my hands are sticky, greasy or goopy when I use a hand cream. And I don&#x27;t like those creams or &#x27;ultra healing balms&#x27; that swear they work wonders, but in reality do nothing. Soap &amp; Glory Hand Food is luxurious, healing and non-greasy. I wash my hands close to 20 times a day due to my work, and this is the only hand cream that after just one use makes my hands go from sandpaper to silk. It&#x27;s the only one I will ever use!</li>
            <li> As a nurse who washes her hands and uses hand sanitizers constantly, my hands are dry, flaky and/or cracked at any given time. I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a product that would heal and protect and finally I&#x27;ve found it! Hand Food is non-greasy, has a very pleasant smell (not overpowering or too dull), and leaves your hand feeling instantly smooth!! I have a hard time not rubbing my hands together just to feel the glory of this hand cream!</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream!  The fragrance is awesome.  The lotion moisturizes without being overly greasy.  Plus it lasts quite awhile!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Pricy stuff but great and not too greasy on dry hands. my dad who is an electrician swears by this stuff after a hard days work. I use it after working on my classic car with excellent results!</li>
            <li> Soap and Glory is such a fun brand and their products are really effective as well. I was so sad when Target stop selling this brand however I was really excited with Amazon started to sell it. Its worth every penny. I loved it so much I bought the whole line.</li>
            <li> Used at a friend&#x27;s home one weakend, and fell in love with the feel of this cream on my hands and the scent- smells like you have been in a spa- very clean and fresh- not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hand cream, but it&#x27;s twice as expensive from amazon as it is from other places. Check out the soap and glory site to see alternative sellers you can buy it from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hand cream has a very pleasant smell and so far is the only lotion I&#x27;ve been able to find for a decent price that really keeps my hands soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read any reviews for this product, so that may have saved me from this purchase. This &amp;#34;Hand Food,&amp;#34; (which always looks like &amp;#34;Hand Foot&amp;#34; to me) has a nice feel and the most minimal residual &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; feel after application; however, the perfume smell is STRONG!&lt;br /&gt;I had to wash my hands at least 5 times to diminish the smell - it&#x27;s crazy and not my thing. It was an expensive lesson on reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It truly hydrates my hands and non-greasy at all! And it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I am crazy about it. I keep it next to me all the time. It is the only hand cream that worked for me. My hands we so dry from using Clorox and i tried many creams but this is the only cream that worked for me, It also smell realy great. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The smell is super strong for me. The cream itself feels like any other hand cream, nothing special. I think L&#x27;Occitane I had once was much better.</li>
            <li> This also is a great light scent.  I use this every day since it came in the mail. The title is cute</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this hand cream. It does not leave your hands feeling sticky or greasy like many others. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, especially in the winter, but this lotion keeps them hydrated all day, as I apply it several times. The scent is subtle, and very nice. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily, and drys quickly. Recommend for everyone to try!</li>
            <li> Finally, a lotion that works.  I can still feel its affects after washing my hands.  I picked a sample size up at Sephora and I am so in love with it, I went back for the regular size.  I may even try the body lotion.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought the item on the 30th of the month and it came eight days later. I didn&#x27;t expect the product to get to me so fast. Good job! I&#x27;m really happy about the product cuz it smells good and makes my hands moisturized. I definitely recommend this seller to anyone and everyone!</li>
