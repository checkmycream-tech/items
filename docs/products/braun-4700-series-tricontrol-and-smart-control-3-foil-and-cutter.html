            <li>Foil and cutter fit the Braun 4700 series razor.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Replacing the razor made shaving faster and more comfortable, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I was able to find my foil/cutter on Amazon for a somewhat more reasonable price</li>
            <li>I like it because it shaves clean and smooth, no nicks.</li>
            <li>Outer cover seemed a bit flimsy compared to the original, so I just replaced the blades and kept the original cover on the razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this will not be my first time :)</li>
            <li>good replacement easy to remove old blade and mount new one.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much for such a good product.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the price and did not know if I could find the replacements I was needing and thought that I would have to buy a new electric razor which I did not want to do.  </li>
            <li>New foil and cutter have revived the 4775 shaver I use on trips, that I have had for many years.  </li>
            <li>&quot; my nine year old Braun with the new parts and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Just as ordered, and easy to replace old and worn out cutters.</li>
            <li>I have had my Braun razor for 7 years and it is a great razor, just hard to find replacement blades.  </li>

            <li>Easy to put together, just take out the old and put in the new.</li>
            <li>I had when the razor was new right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>But overall, works fine.</li>
            <li>and it did not shave very well.  </li>
            <li>For the price the foil should be much stronger.</li>
            <li>just what i expected  out of the razor  love it.</li>
            <li>I clearly made the right choice.</li>
            <li>The price was certainly better than any other listed on the Internet.  </li>
            <li>Braun makes high quality razors but the cost for the replacement parts is very high.</li>
            <li>He says...makes it shave like a new one!</li>
            <li>This replacement works much better than the previous one.</li>
            <li>The foil head fit perfectly on my old shaver and has been working for several weeks.</li>
            <li>This made my older shaver work like new, I will purchase this again when I need to replace it again.</li>
            <li>I doubted that I could replace the razor head and that it would function well, but I was happy to find myself wrong.  </li>
            <li>If you need new blades this seller works well.</li>
            <li>Keeps the razor performing like new.  </li>
            <li>Razor works like new now.</li>
            <li>This set makes the shaver like new again.  </li>
            <li>No problem changing out the old parts as well.</li>
            <li>I wanted the original center bar parallel slot design [not the newer \\&quot;W\\&quot; shape middle bar].</li>
            <li>The foil is little too tight when you need to take it off to clean and stuff.</li>

            <li> Replacing the cutting block and old foil, my Braun shaver is just like new.  I had bought a replacement shaver(not Braun) and it did not shave very well.  I decided to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; my nine year old Braun with the new parts and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> These replacement parts were just what I needed to restore my favorite razor to like-new condition.  Braun makes a great product.</li>
            <li> We have an older model shaver but we love it and was thrilled to get the refill heads. The shipping was fast and it was a perfect fit!!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the product sent to me. It was in perfect condition. The part was sent in a timely manner for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I doubted that I could replace the razor head and that it would function well, but I was happy to find myself wrong.  Replacing the razor made shaving faster and more comfortable, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Why look all over town when you can find what you need on Amazon. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed and I didn&#x27;t have to wait in line or drive all over town to be told \\&quot;they are out of stock\\&quot;. Great blade refill. Great shaver.</li>
            <li> It works but I still get nipped and bleed even though I don&#x27;t press hard.  For the price the foil should be much stronger.</li>
            <li> I have had my Braun razor for 7 years and it is a great razor, just hard to find replacement blades.  These blades were a good price and shipped immediately.  Will buy them here from now on as I can&#x27;t find them anywhere in the stores.  Outer cover seemed a bit flimsy compared to the original, so I just replaced the blades and kept the original cover on the razor.</li>
            <li> It came undamaged and in exelent working order. If you need new blades this seller works well.</li>
            <li> looked everywhere for this blade,all were 24to$28,got lucky and found them on Amazon,for much better price. No hasell,never left the house,and a much better price ,thanks Amazon......................</li>
            <li> Product purchased delivers desired results.  No surprises and met the requirements as advertised.  I was satisfied with the price and did not know if I could find the replacements I was needing and thought that I would have to buy a new electric razor which I did not want to do.  I like the Braun 4702 model.</li>
            <li> Order was received even sooner than expected and was perfect for my razor. I have experienced the sharpness of that I had when the razor was new right out of the box.  The price was certainly better than any other listed on the Internet.  I clearly made the right choice.</li>
            <li> It Works 100% better than the newer razors and 110% better than the Remington electric razors do. longer life span for the heads.</li>
            <li> Nothing more I can say than how I described in the title. The foil is little too tight when you need to take it off to clean and stuff. I end up using a scissor or something with sharp edge to pry it open. But overall, works fine.</li>
            <li> Just as ordered, and easy to replace old and worn out cutters. No problem changing out the old parts as well.</li>
            <li> Braun makes high quality razors but the cost for the replacement parts is very high. Fortunately I was able to find my foil/cutter on Amazon for a somewhat more reasonable price</li>
            <li> No problems with order or product.  The foil head fit perfectly on my old shaver and has been working for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought this item based on the featured picture and application notes. I wanted the original center bar parallel slot design [not the newer \\&quot;W\\&quot; shape middle bar]. If I knew they were going to send the newer Series 3 item, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered.  I could have bought what they sent at the local Target, Walmart, or AF BX.</li>
            <li> Interior plastic part for the foil was not properly manufactured in that part of it was not complete and broke when removing the foil for cleaning</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband&#x27;s shaver and he is very satisfied with it. It works excellently.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Good quality with excellent price&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone is looking for this product&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;this will not be my first time :)</li>

            <li> Factory replacement foil and cutter. Easy replacement.</li>
            <li> Easy transaction the item fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> New foil and cutter have revived the 4775 shaver I use on trips, that I have had for many years.  It is now once again equal to my Braun Series 3 wet and dry in closeness of shaves.</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement for the original. I am very satisfied with it. Easy to put together, just take out the old and put in the new. Very easy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and it is a good product. I am sold on Braun products.</li>
            <li> Foil and blades were priced better than could find them locally, they were received timely and fit my razor perfectly. Only took a couple of minutes to install</li>
            <li> Already experienced.Fantastic. Higher quality. Thank you very much for such a good product. Recommend to everyone.I am satisfied and happy.</li>
            <li> good replacement easy to remove old blade and mount new one.  Getting a closer more comfortable shave now.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with product</li>
            <li> just what i expected  out of the razor  love it. Would tell all of my family and friends. close shave.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement to keep my old Braun Model #4745 functioning perfectly.  Someday will have to replace my shaver, but until then.....?</li>
            <li> Replaced the ancient shaver head. Got what I ordered, it fit perfectly, and worked as I wanted. I am once again smoochable!</li>
            <li> This replacement works much better than the previous one. I like it because it shaves clean and smooth, no nicks.</li>
            <li> The product I received was exactly as it was described. It is in an original package with very good quality. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while with no problem whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different electric razors and haven&#x27;t found one as reliable as my Braun 4700 series.  Now that the model&#x27;s discontinued, I&#x27;m beyond ecstatic this retailer still carries the foil and cutter set!  Woo hoo!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! As is the shaver it goes on.  Feels as good as the original.  Can&#x27;t tell any difference.</li>
