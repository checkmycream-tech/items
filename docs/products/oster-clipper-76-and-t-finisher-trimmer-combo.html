            <li>but they work great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer for over 4 years now and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I am proud of my sons and like to cut their hair myself.  </li>
            <li>However - the clipper itself is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great set.</li>
            <li>Great clippers,I have gone through alot of clippers over the years.</li>

            <li>Both work great for man scaping.</li>
            <li>this is a very nice quality product-</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re still going strong very good product and very good price</li>
            <li>After its introduction many years ago, the 76s are still the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>Works great, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I pop the blades off and spray them good with the air compressor in the garage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are good quality clippers.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve been used a lot and still work good.</li>
            <li>The t-Finisher is good if you adjust the blade.</li>
            <li>so I decided we needed a good set of clippers for this.</li>
            <li>This is a must own and a great gift for barber and cosmetology students.</li>
            <li>Good for home haircutting.  </li>
            <li>I give this Clippers to my daughter and she loved them.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with how this set performs.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Then I went into another trade but used the &amp;#34;76&amp;#34; to cut both my sons hair until they went out on their own in about 1982.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All around great buy, well worth the money!</li>
            <li>The classic 76 is one of the best clippers you can have.</li>
            <li>Awesome clippers that I would highly recommend to any one.  </li>
            <li>Also, the blades change out very easy.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get attachments for the 76 if you plan to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered in a timely manner and the receipient of the gift is very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Maintenance is fairly easy, just don&#x27;t forget to purchase blade wash!</li>
            <li>Point blank, best purchase of it&#x27;s product&#x27;s kind I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought these...</li>
            <li>I was able to get a cleaner line with the 76&#x27;s and the 000 blade it comes with.</li>
            <li>the hey, I have more than paid for the 76s with my savings on barber expenses.  </li>
            <li>Though the 000 blade for the 76 gets close, the trimmer is a lot lighter and easier to maneuver, is better for edging, and the blade design makes it easier to get around the ears.</li>
            <li>Works smoothly!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overly-heavy, it&#x27;s more of a cumbersome device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this combo, and I hope this review helps you decide what to get.</li>
            <li>I was a barber for many years and bought the Oster 76 in about 1962.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of clippers.</li>
            <li>I replaced the switch with a quality one made with metal components and better leads</li>
            <li>Be sure to buy a cleaner for it as well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many brands of clippers I have gone through over the years.  </li>
            <li>I got this combo deal and already love it.</li>
            <li>super, super very nice</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t recall how many zero&#x27;s, LOL) and this clipper cuts smoothly, comfortably, and CLOSE!!  </li>
            <li>Best set of clippers I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li>I finally was able to do flattops that look GOOD!  </li>
            <li>These clippers are used by old school barbers and work great.</li>
            <li>My wife loves them and says they cut so much better than the cheap clippers she had been using.</li>
            <li>Oster has a good reputation and the product arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Being able to very quickly and easily change the blades is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy constructed, easy to use, easy to clean, and the attachments stay on until I take them off!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a strong dependable clipper this is the one.</li>
            <li>I would have to say that these clippers cut a whole lot better than the ones my barber uses!</li>
            <li>The problem with cheap clippers is the lack of power</li>
            <li>By far and away the best shears around, nothing has compared and I&#x27;ve used many different brands.  </li>
            <li>OK, so that part is a lie, but it does make a good segue to my last point:</li>
            <li>My husband even uses the Classic 76 on his own-</li>
            <li>and she was so excited to trim someones hair.</li>
            <li>and I just ordered these and let me just say its worth the money!</li>
            <li>And, let me tell you, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Cuts quick, cool, easy to maintain.    </li>
            <li>These clippers are quiet powerful and a joy to use.</li>
            <li>B000B76T52 Oster Fast Feed Clipper]] is a pretty nice set.</li>
            <li>B000B76T52 Oster Fast Feed Clipper]] is a pretty nice set.</li>
            <li>The operation is smooth and powerful with it&#x27;s gear driven blades...</li>
            <li>The T-trimmer is great for my gotee and keeping it sharp.</li>
            <li>hope to find a replacement switch and hope it is as good as the original as I have read about switch problems in some other of the postings.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I have found that for tight trimming, the [[ASIN:B00011K2BA Wahl Peanut]] does a great</li>
            <li>She dropped the old ones on the floor so many times causing the some cracks in plastic area</li>
            <li>Let me caveat this by saying that I am NOT a barber, I do NOT play one on TV, but I DO have a couple decades worth of experience with clipper cuts.</li>
            <li>but anyone can become a professional using this top quality clipper.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these clippers, worked fine until it was rendered unusable by the switch.</li>
            <li>It came right to my door step just like they said it would.</li>
            <li>Just the right color for her.</li>
            <li>If someone from Oster reads this they better make sure their switch problem does not exist because no company can continue to live off their reputation for long.</li>
            <li>I used to have to make several passes (30 minutes or more), shower, and then reassess my hair cut after a shower.</li>
            <li>They also run pretty hot...</li>
            <li>Lately I only use the 1 1/2 and shorter blades as the burr cut is my now my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have tried and tried brands from Target or Wal-mart but nothing cuts my hair in the first run...</li>
            <li>I looked at the local supply store, and since I&#x27;m not in the business, would have paid more for just the clippers than this set.   </li>
            <li>I have tried many of their products and soon after the warranty ended, they all end up in the same place....</li>
            <li>First is the size (diameter).</li>
            <li>B000ERCU98 Oster Fast Feed Clipper &amp; T-finish Trimmer Combo]].    Cheers!</li>
            <li>I ordered many different blades for the 76 (including 000000...</li>
            <li>I use a #2 blade for a close cut all around and this clipper gives an even cut on the top, sides and back with minimum time and effort.  </li>
            <li>My wife is now my barber and on her first haircut ever she nailed it with these clippers.  </li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>The motor finally died and probably would have lasted linger if I took better care of the motor.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but the clippers get too hot after 5mins.</li>
            <li>I honestly think my used 76s will last the rest of my life (I am 53 years old).</li>
            <li>A step down from my previous timmer - Andis T-Outliner which was superb.</li>
            <li>In the long run you will spend more money.</li>
            <li>The Classic 76 is versatile enough that if you bought the T blade for it, you may not need the T-finisher, but I find that the smaller and quieter T-finisher is great around the ears and for making the edged lines that make the cut look professional.  </li>
            <li>With this set I am able to clipper the hair, do the edging around the ears, and make a flat, even top in much less time.  </li>
            <li>These are the real deal...</li>
            <li>and my whole face is done.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the color</li>
            <li>They are both very quite and the cut is very even.  </li>
            <li>Mine has not broken, but I could see how this might happen.</li>
            <li>B000ERCU98 Oster Fast Feed Clipper &amp; T-finish Trimmer Combo]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But given the price for the pair, its a real steal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and am very dissapointed...</li>
            <li>SHIPPING WAS FAST, CLIPPER AND TRIMMER ARE</li>
            <li>I have saved so much on safety razors and hair cuts over the years</li>
            <li>If you cut hair, your own or someone else&#x27;s, don&#x27;t waste your time and money on Conair, Wahl, Norelco, etc.</li>
            <li>If you are a young person, a small person, or if you just have dainty little hands, this may be a bit of a challenge for you to get a comfortable grip on.</li>
            <li>The Oster Clippper 76 (the big one) is worth it!  </li>
            <li>They are also very high quality, and stay relatively cool, even after prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The T-finisher is a solid item too.</li>
            <li>They literally snap right on - no need to unscrew the old, align and screw on the new!</li>
            <li>Clean it, oil it according to the directions and it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>I then come back to clean him up</li>
            <li>When I decided to go with the Classic 76</li>
            <li>I had been in the market for the Oster 76 Classic for quite sometime</li>
            <li>If you like cutting your own hair there is nothing better than this ..</li>
            <li>Definitely a high quality clipper...</li>
            <li>So far,the new ones is working great and hopefully will be last for at least 15years or until 2027.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,</li>
            <li>I decided to spend a little more this time.</li>
            <li>Overall, this set is worth the money, and I highly recommend its purchase.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>also did and still do my own hair with my wife doing only the very upper back which I cannot see for myself, and this is 2014.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pull or grab hair, or anything that a cheaper clipper normally does.  </li>
            <li>and I can tell these are built way better and will last a long time</li>
            <li>The removable blades on the 76 do much cleaner and nicer cuts than comb attachments, and I can do it all in less time, which is important when kids are sitting still.  </li>
            <li>The cippers she previously used did not cut as short as I liked and occasionaly \\&quot;pulled\\</li>
            <li>Other than the cheap switch...</li>
            <li>I bought Oster clipper and trimmer, model: classic 76 for my wife to replace the old ones that she has have since 1993.</li>
            <li>B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]]</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, professional barber tools.</li>
            <li>Since it is much faster with these tools, I cut their hair every two weeks to keep it looking sharp and feel the set is well worth it.</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>Actually, now i do the finishing first and then clip my hair</li>
            <li>My wife gave me a professional cut on her first try and the finisher clippers are totally money.</li>
            <li>My wife brought her clippers home to show me that the unit had a short and stopped working if she held it in certain positions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairy man and next to a gas powered weed eater these two professional tools really does the trick.</li>
            <li>I probably could&#x27;ve gotten the same level of upgrade much cheaper.</li>
            <li>All old news now.  </li>
            <li>I ended up using an old set of Oster clippers that my Mother-in-law had used 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Tried some of the drugstore trimmers and they do not hold a candle to this professional tool.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that can clip close, near bald but not quite.</li>
            <li>Ask any barber what the \\&quot;old standby\\&quot; clipper is, and they will almost invariably say it is the Oster 76.</li>
            <li>The picture looks red but they are really a brownish hue.  </li>
            <li>I bought this set of professional clippers</li>
            <li>instead of old fashioned relay driven blades</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a cheap plastic piece of junk that broke after a couple months of heavy use in the salon.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer makes everything even and professional looking.  </li>
            <li>When I go over an area a few times the hair cut off is more like dust than clippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 000 length that comes with the 76&#x27;s isn&#x27;t a very low cut.</li>
            <li>every other Wal-Mart/BX special over the last 12 years.</li>
            <li>I would usually end up wearing out my scalp by the number of times I would have to go over it with the cheap clippers...</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how quiet they were after reading some of the reviews about sheering sheep.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not quiet, but they&#x27;re not anywhere near as loud as my last set of struggling Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>I would not get the t-trimmer and direct those $&#x27;s towards extra blades.</li>
            <li>I am a professional hairstylist and have clipper and have used it daily for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>Also, heed one of the other reviewer&#x27;s comments about the size of the clipper - it&#x27;s a pretty big thing.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to do a couple of passes with my old clippers, but these cut unbelievably well on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is the T-Finisher trimmer which hardly does a good job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair (short buzz cuts) since the early 90s, and I got tired of the cheap Wahl units leaving stray hairs, and having to go over, and over, and over my head with the clippers.        </li>
            <li>This is the big gun, great for really thick hair, doesn&#x27;t bog down in the thick of it.  </li>

            <li> Good for home haircutting.  </li>
            <li> I give this Clippers to my daughter and she loved them.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with how this set performs.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Then I went into another trade but used the &amp;#34;76&amp;#34; to cut both my sons hair until they went out on their own in about 1982.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All around great buy, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The classic 76 is one of the best clippers you can have.</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers that I would highly recommend to any one.  </li>
            <li> Also, the blades change out very easy.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get attachments for the 76 if you plan to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered in a timely manner and the receipient of the gift is very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Maintenance is fairly easy, just don&#x27;t forget to purchase blade wash!</li>
            <li> Point blank, best purchase of it&#x27;s product&#x27;s kind I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought these...</li>
            <li> I was able to get a cleaner line with the 76&#x27;s and the 000 blade it comes with.</li>
            <li> the hey, I have more than paid for the 76s with my savings on barber expenses.  </li>
            <li> Though the 000 blade for the 76 gets close, the trimmer is a lot lighter and easier to maneuver, is better for edging, and the blade design makes it easier to get around the ears.</li>
            <li> Works smoothly!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overly-heavy, it&#x27;s more of a cumbersome device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this combo, and I hope this review helps you decide what to get.</li>
            <li> I was a barber for many years and bought the Oster 76 in about 1962.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of clippers.</li>
            <li> I replaced the switch with a quality one made with metal components and better leads</li>
            <li> Be sure to buy a cleaner for it as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many brands of clippers I have gone through over the years.  </li>
            <li> I got this combo deal and already love it.</li>
            <li> super, super very nice</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t recall how many zero&#x27;s, LOL) and this clipper cuts smoothly, comfortably, and CLOSE!!  </li>
            <li> Best set of clippers I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> I finally was able to do flattops that look GOOD!  </li>
            <li> These clippers are used by old school barbers and work great.</li>
            <li> My wife loves them and says they cut so much better than the cheap clippers she had been using.</li>
            <li> Oster has a good reputation and the product arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Being able to very quickly and easily change the blades is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy constructed, easy to use, easy to clean, and the attachments stay on until I take them off!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a strong dependable clipper this is the one.</li>
            <li> I would have to say that these clippers cut a whole lot better than the ones my barber uses!</li>
            <li> The problem with cheap clippers is the lack of power</li>
            <li> By far and away the best shears around, nothing has compared and I&#x27;ve used many different brands.  </li>
            <li> OK, so that part is a lie, but it does make a good segue to my last point:</li>
            <li> My husband even uses the Classic 76 on his own-</li>
            <li> and she was so excited to trim someones hair.</li>
            <li> and I just ordered these and let me just say its worth the money!</li>
            <li> And, let me tell you, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Cuts quick, cool, easy to maintain.    </li>
            <li> These clippers are quiet powerful and a joy to use.</li>
            <li> B000B76T52 Oster Fast Feed Clipper]] is a pretty nice set.</li>
            <li> B000B76T52 Oster Fast Feed Clipper]] is a pretty nice set.</li>
            <li> The operation is smooth and powerful with it&#x27;s gear driven blades...</li>
            <li> The T-trimmer is great for my gotee and keeping it sharp.</li>
            <li> hope to find a replacement switch and hope it is as good as the original as I have read about switch problems in some other of the postings.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have found that for tight trimming, the [[ASIN:B00011K2BA Wahl Peanut]] does a great</li>
            <li> She dropped the old ones on the floor so many times causing the some cracks in plastic area</li>
            <li> Let me caveat this by saying that I am NOT a barber, I do NOT play one on TV, but I DO have a couple decades worth of experience with clipper cuts.</li>
            <li> but anyone can become a professional using this top quality clipper.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these clippers, worked fine until it was rendered unusable by the switch.</li>
            <li> It came right to my door step just like they said it would.</li>
            <li> Just the right color for her.</li>
            <li> If someone from Oster reads this they better make sure their switch problem does not exist because no company can continue to live off their reputation for long.</li>
            <li> I used to have to make several passes (30 minutes or more), shower, and then reassess my hair cut after a shower.</li>
            <li> They also run pretty hot...</li>
            <li> Lately I only use the 1 1/2 and shorter blades as the burr cut is my now my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I have tried and tried brands from Target or Wal-mart but nothing cuts my hair in the first run...</li>
            <li> I looked at the local supply store, and since I&#x27;m not in the business, would have paid more for just the clippers than this set.   </li>
            <li> I have tried many of their products and soon after the warranty ended, they all end up in the same place....</li>
            <li> First is the size (diameter).</li>
            <li> B000ERCU98 Oster Fast Feed Clipper &amp; T-finish Trimmer Combo]].    Cheers!</li>
            <li> I ordered many different blades for the 76 (including 000000...</li>
            <li> I use a #2 blade for a close cut all around and this clipper gives an even cut on the top, sides and back with minimum time and effort.  </li>
            <li> My wife is now my barber and on her first haircut ever she nailed it with these clippers.  </li>
            <li> ;)    </li>
            <li> The motor finally died and probably would have lasted linger if I took better care of the motor.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but the clippers get too hot after 5mins.</li>
            <li> I honestly think my used 76s will last the rest of my life (I am 53 years old).</li>
            <li> A step down from my previous timmer - Andis T-Outliner which was superb.</li>
            <li> In the long run you will spend more money.</li>
            <li> The Classic 76 is versatile enough that if you bought the T blade for it, you may not need the T-finisher, but I find that the smaller and quieter T-finisher is great around the ears and for making the edged lines that make the cut look professional.  </li>
            <li> With this set I am able to clipper the hair, do the edging around the ears, and make a flat, even top in much less time.  </li>
            <li> These are the real deal...</li>
            <li> and my whole face is done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the color</li>
            <li> They are both very quite and the cut is very even.  </li>
            <li> Mine has not broken, but I could see how this might happen.</li>
            <li> B000ERCU98 Oster Fast Feed Clipper &amp; T-finish Trimmer Combo]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But given the price for the pair, its a real steal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and am very dissapointed...</li>
            <li> SHIPPING WAS FAST, CLIPPER AND TRIMMER ARE</li>
            <li> I have saved so much on safety razors and hair cuts over the years</li>
            <li> If you cut hair, your own or someone else&#x27;s, don&#x27;t waste your time and money on Conair, Wahl, Norelco, etc.</li>
            <li> If you are a young person, a small person, or if you just have dainty little hands, this may be a bit of a challenge for you to get a comfortable grip on.</li>
            <li> The Oster Clippper 76 (the big one) is worth it!  </li>
            <li> They are also very high quality, and stay relatively cool, even after prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The T-finisher is a solid item too.</li>
            <li> They literally snap right on - no need to unscrew the old, align and screw on the new!</li>
            <li> Clean it, oil it according to the directions and it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I then come back to clean him up</li>
            <li> When I decided to go with the Classic 76</li>
            <li> I had been in the market for the Oster 76 Classic for quite sometime</li>
            <li> If you like cutting your own hair there is nothing better than this ..</li>
            <li> Definitely a high quality clipper...</li>
            <li> So far,the new ones is working great and hopefully will be last for at least 15years or until 2027.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,</li>
            <li> I decided to spend a little more this time.</li>
            <li> Overall, this set is worth the money, and I highly recommend its purchase.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> also did and still do my own hair with my wife doing only the very upper back which I cannot see for myself, and this is 2014.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull or grab hair, or anything that a cheaper clipper normally does.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell these are built way better and will last a long time</li>
            <li> The removable blades on the 76 do much cleaner and nicer cuts than comb attachments, and I can do it all in less time, which is important when kids are sitting still.  </li>
            <li> The cippers she previously used did not cut as short as I liked and occasionaly \\&quot;pulled\\</li>
            <li> Other than the cheap switch...</li>
            <li> I bought Oster clipper and trimmer, model: classic 76 for my wife to replace the old ones that she has have since 1993.</li>
            <li> B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]]</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, professional barber tools.</li>
            <li> Since it is much faster with these tools, I cut their hair every two weeks to keep it looking sharp and feel the set is well worth it.</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> Actually, now i do the finishing first and then clip my hair</li>
            <li> My wife gave me a professional cut on her first try and the finisher clippers are totally money.</li>
            <li> My wife brought her clippers home to show me that the unit had a short and stopped working if she held it in certain positions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy man and next to a gas powered weed eater these two professional tools really does the trick.</li>
            <li> I probably could&#x27;ve gotten the same level of upgrade much cheaper.</li>
            <li> All old news now.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using an old set of Oster clippers that my Mother-in-law had used 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Tried some of the drugstore trimmers and they do not hold a candle to this professional tool.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that can clip close, near bald but not quite.</li>
            <li> Ask any barber what the \\&quot;old standby\\&quot; clipper is, and they will almost invariably say it is the Oster 76.</li>
            <li> The picture looks red but they are really a brownish hue.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set of professional clippers</li>
            <li> instead of old fashioned relay driven blades</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a cheap plastic piece of junk that broke after a couple months of heavy use in the salon.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer makes everything even and professional looking.  </li>
            <li> When I go over an area a few times the hair cut off is more like dust than clippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 000 length that comes with the 76&#x27;s isn&#x27;t a very low cut.</li>
            <li> every other Wal-Mart/BX special over the last 12 years.</li>
            <li> I would usually end up wearing out my scalp by the number of times I would have to go over it with the cheap clippers...</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quiet they were after reading some of the reviews about sheering sheep.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not quiet, but they&#x27;re not anywhere near as loud as my last set of struggling Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> I would not get the t-trimmer and direct those $&#x27;s towards extra blades.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist and have clipper and have used it daily for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> Also, heed one of the other reviewer&#x27;s comments about the size of the clipper - it&#x27;s a pretty big thing.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to do a couple of passes with my old clippers, but these cut unbelievably well on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the T-Finisher trimmer which hardly does a good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair (short buzz cuts) since the early 90s, and I got tired of the cheap Wahl units leaving stray hairs, and having to go over, and over, and over my head with the clippers.        </li>
            <li> This is the big gun, great for really thick hair, doesn&#x27;t bog down in the thick of it.  </li>
            <li> These heavy duty clippers can get through a lot of hair with little effort and in quick time.</li>
            <li> If you cut hair professionally or as an amateur you should have these clippers for even and straight cuts..</li>
            <li> After having long hair for a number of years, I recently got it all cut off</li>
            <li> From the $25 el-cheapo sets to $100+ cordless units; from Andis to Wahl, this one outperforms them all by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> challenge anyone to name a clipper that lasted that long for them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I spent the extra money to get some quality clippers.  </li>
            <li> Have already give myself a haircut, and after 12 years in the military I keep my hair short and neat.</li>
            <li> The set arrived in two different boxes, one for the Oster 76 and the other for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Every other stylist at her work has the same set of clippers in their arsenal as well.  </li>
            <li> The Oster 76 box included a size 000 blade, a size 1 blade, a brush for loose hairs, blade lubricator, and blade grease.</li>
            <li> I also use it to bring my facial hair down within regulations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only paid about $45 max on any previous set.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re not a big guy like me it might be a little unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> I could not even tell they were cutting my hair as it was that smooth.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I had to purchase the #2 and #1.5 blades separatly as the Oster 76 only comes with two shorter blades which I don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> With the hubs in the military, we save money with my trims rather than a barber shop/salon.  </li>
            <li> Popped on the #1 blade that comes with it, and a few minutes later...</li>
            <li> I am in the military and my wife went to hair school</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with thick curly hair when grown out.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not an understatement from some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> She refers to this brand name due to the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> the other hand</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money, spend a little up front and never have to replace inferior products with other inferior products only to eventually get these...</li>
            <li> I cannot believe Oster is stupid enough to change to a cheap switch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years and have been disappointed with consumer grade hair clippers and so decided to buy the Oster Classic 76 combo (Finisher).  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers say that the trimmer is not worth it, but I disagree.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as powerful.</li>
            <li> The switch is plastic and is located at the bottom near the wire; not a great design or location.</li>
            <li> These babies mow down my hair without bogging down one bit.  </li>
            <li> These things are sharp!</li>
            <li> Less than a minute</li>
            <li> I have had them for a  year in a half</li>
            <li> When i saw the combo pack for way less I had to jump on it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it even cuts as close as the Classic clipper which is just sad.</li>
            <li> The t finisher works fine, but it does not have an awkward weak PLASTIC on/off switch.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a little easier to see the edges.  </li>
            <li> , it is a little heavy for use 8 hrs.</li>
            <li> Alas, last year I sprung for a used set of 76s on Ebay.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on the cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li> As for negatives, the 76 would be a bit heavy to some people, though not for me.</li>
            <li> There are a few items that are a must haves for Barber&#x27;s, Stylists, Pet Groomers, kitchen beauticians and the like.</li>
            <li> the 76 is fab the trimmer gives me trouble because the cord keeps curling up have no idea</li>
            <li> I am a barber machine delivery arrived on time but opening the package I encountered that it was missing the 000 detachable, cleaning brush, lubricating oil, and the clipper grease.</li>
            <li> now I have to order those missing items</li>
            <li> But wasn&#x27;t a fan of the finish trimmers (small one)</li>
            <li> I took it apart to find that one of the power leads coming from the switch and connecting to the motor had broken off of the switch due to vibration.  </li>
            <li> and I need to cut my hair at least weekly.</li>
            <li> I also have thick hair.</li>
            <li> No more barber!  </li>
            <li> we were using an old pair that just wasn&#x27;t &#x27;cutting it&#x27; anymore!  </li>
            <li> All were less expensive</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even fixed some of her coworker&#x27;s clippers with a switch upgrade, saving them $50+ in fees to have Oster fix it with another crap switch.    </li>
            <li> You may find it overkill, but it is by no means as cacophonous as some others have made</li>
            <li> Got tired with sub $50 clippers.  </li>
            <li> Was I ever wrong.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s absurd.</li>
            <li> With these I&#x27;m done cutting 10 minutes or so in...</li>
            <li> The wife doesn&#x27;t like the size of them for when she is cutting our sons</li>
            <li> Disappointment after disappointment after disappointment.</li>
            <li> he says i&#x27;ll be cutting my hair with them 3 years from now.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting hair, people and animals for almost 30 years.  </li>
            <li> &quot; which was very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> For 5 years I used used them all and was always disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in that</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the AF and I need to cut my hair at least weekly. I&#x27;ve gone through Wahl/Andis/every other Wal-Mart/BX special over the last 12 years. These are the real deal...I was surprised at how quiet they were after reading some of the reviews about sheering sheep. They&#x27;re not quiet, but they&#x27;re not anywhere near as loud as my last set of struggling Wahl clippers. Mind you I&#x27;ve only paid about $45 max on any previous set. I probably could&#x27;ve gotten the same level of upgrade much cheaper. I&#x27;m glad I bought these...I&#x27;m African American with thick curly hair when grown out. I used to have to make several passes (30 minutes or more), shower, and then reassess my hair cut after a shower. With these I&#x27;m done cutting 10 minutes or so in...And I haven&#x27;t needed to go over any areas after the cut. I also use it to bring my facial hair down within regulations. Less than a minute and my whole face is done. Power! The problem with cheap clippers is the lack of power (leads to multiple passes), and the blade quality I guess. These things are sharp! When I go over an area a few times the hair cut off is more like dust than clippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 000 length that comes with the 76&#x27;s isn&#x27;t a very low cut. It&#x27;s buzzed...but not as close to bald as some of the Wal-Mart specials took me. I bought the 0000 and 00000 recently to ensure I can get as low as I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re big! That&#x27;s not an understatement from some of the other reviews. I&#x27;m a big guy, so it&#x27;s not an issue...The wife doesn&#x27;t like the size of them for when she is cutting our sons hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is a snap...I pop the blades off and spray them good with the air compressor in the garage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I went 4 instead of 5 was based on the combo rating. The 76&#x27;s are a solid 5! The finishers aren&#x27;t the greatest product I&#x27;ve found for the edging...I was able to get a cleaner line with the 76&#x27;s and the 000 blade it comes with. They also run pretty hot...This is probably something to expect when you think about the power it&#x27;s putting out though.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife because she is a cosmetologist and she was so excited to trim someones hair.</li>
            <li> These are good quality clippers. I don&#x27;t really like the color but they work great. They&#x27;ve been used a lot and still work good.</li>
            <li> Great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for 6 years with this combo.  It&#x27;s perfect in every way.  Be sure to get attachments for the 76 if you plan to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as a gift for Christmas. The product was delivered in a timely manner and the receipient of the gift is very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I bought Oster clipper and trimmer, model: classic 76 for my wife to replace the old ones that she has have since 1993. She dropped the old ones on the floor so many times causing the some cracks in plastic area but it is still functional. She refers to this brand name due to the quality of this product. So far,the new ones is working great and hopefully will be last for at least 15years or until 2027.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,</li>
            <li> we finally upgraded our clippers.  we were using an old pair that just wasn&#x27;t &#x27;cutting it&#x27; anymore!  this is a very nice quality product- I cut my husband&#x27;s hair every two weeks and trim his neck weekly (with the T-finisher trimmer).  With the hubs in the military, we save money with my trims rather than a barber shop/salon.  Definitely will pay for itself within a short time.</li>
            <li> After its introduction many years ago, the 76s are still the best on the market.  I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair (short buzz cuts) since the early 90s, and I got tired of the cheap Wahl units leaving stray hairs, and having to go over, and over, and over my head with the clippers.        Alas, last year I sprung for a used set of 76s on Ebay.  I figured, \\&quot;what the hey, I have more than paid for the 76s with my savings on barber expenses.  These babies mow down my hair without bogging down one bit.  They are virtually unstoppable.  I&#x27;ve expanded my arsenal by purchasing the 00000, 000, 0A, 1, 1 1/2, 2, and 3 1/2 blades.  Lately I only use the 1 1/2 and shorter blades as the burr cut is my now my favorite.  I honestly think my used 76s will last the rest of my life (I am 53 years old).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer for over 4 years now and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I have used 4 or 5 different brand of hair trimmers and clippers.  All were less expensive but I thought they would get the job done.  Was I ever wrong.  None of them even come close to the Oster 76 clippers and the Oster finisher trimmer.  They are both very quite and the cut is very even.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on the cheaper ones.  In the long run you will spend more money.</li>
            <li> My husband is a Barber and I just ordered these and let me just say its worth the money! We went looking all over for the pair in this color and you couldn&#x27;t find any under 500$. When I bought these for him he was impressed at the quality and price. Will buy from them again!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oster 76 with T-Finisher set over a year ago, and I could not be happier with my decision. These heavy duty clippers can get through a lot of hair with little effort and in quick time. The set arrived in two different boxes, one for the Oster 76 and the other for the trimmer. The Oster 76 box included a size 000 blade, a size 1 blade, a brush for loose hairs, blade lubricator, and blade grease. The trimmer box included a second brush and an additional tube of blade lubricator. Maintenance is fairly easy, just don&#x27;t forget to purchase blade wash! Some reviewers say that the trimmer is not worth it, but I disagree. Though the 000 blade for the 76 gets close, the trimmer is a lot lighter and easier to maneuver, is better for edging, and the blade design makes it easier to get around the ears. As for negatives, the 76 would be a bit heavy to some people, though not for me. Some reviews mentioned the on/off switch breaking. Mine has not broken, but I could see how this might happen. The switch is plastic and is located at the bottom near the wire; not a great design or location. Overall, this set is worth the money, and I highly recommend its purchase.</li>
            <li> Works smoothly! Definitely a high quality clipper... it doesn&#x27;t come with any adapters for length, just a 00 and a 1.  Shave and closer shave. :D</li>
            <li> This thing cuts my hair like it is melted butter...I have tried and tried brands from Target or Wal-mart but nothing cuts my hair in the first run...I would usually end up wearing out my scalp by the number of times I would have to go over it with the cheap clippers...All old news now.  These are awesome clippers.  If you want salon quality hair you need salon quality clippers...nuff said.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have had it for years without any problems.</li>
            <li> I am proud of my sons and like to cut their hair myself.  I have been attempting to do flattop haircuts but have not gotten them looking real good up to this point.  I had gotten several pairs of clippers in the $12 to $20 range and they just didn&#x27;t perform well.  I ended up using an old set of Oster clippers that my Mother-in-law had used 20 years ago.  When I decided to go with the Classic 76 I looked at the local supply store, and since I&#x27;m not in the business, would have paid more for just the clippers than this set.   &lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with how this set performs.  I finally was able to do flattops that look GOOD!  With this set I am able to clipper the hair, do the edging around the ears, and make a flat, even top in much less time.  The power of the clippers makes the difference.  The removable blades on the 76 do much cleaner and nicer cuts than comb attachments, and I can do it all in less time, which is important when kids are sitting still.  Both the clippers and the T-finisher do well over a comb when doing tapers.  The Classic 76 is versatile enough that if you bought the T blade for it, you may not need the T-finisher, but I find that the smaller and quieter T-finisher is great around the ears and for making the edged lines that make the cut look professional.  Since it is much faster with these tools, I cut their hair every two weeks to keep it looking sharp and feel the set is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Disappointment after disappointment after disappointment. I have tried many of their products and soon after the warranty ended, they all end up in the same place....in the garbage can!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done! I would have to say that these clippers cut a whole lot better than the ones my barber uses! No joke!! Hope to have these clippers for ever!!</li>
            <li> Awesome. Quality American manufacturing at its finest. Have not been to the barber in 3.5 years and only have cleaned and oiled the blades after each use. I also have thick hair. Tried some of the drugstore trimmers and they do not hold a candle to this professional tool.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper set so I may keep my hair neat and short. I was looking for something that can clip close, near bald but not quite. This item only ships with blade sizes 000 and 1. The blades I would like are probably 0000 or 00000 which only comes with the attachment package so the blades this product ships with is lacking. However - the clipper itself is a great product. Cuts quick, cool, easy to maintain.    My only complaint is the T-Finisher trimmer which hardly does a good job. I don&#x27;t think it even cuts as close as the Classic clipper which is just sad. It&#x27;s definitely not as powerful. A step down from my previous timmer - Andis T-Outliner which was superb.</li>
            <li> Ask any barber what the \\&quot;old standby\\&quot; clipper is, and they will almost invariably say it is the Oster 76. Let me caveat this by saying that I am NOT a barber, I do NOT play one on TV, but I DO have a couple decades worth of experience with clipper cuts. Prior to this purchase, I think I have officially run the proverbial gamut with regard to clipper sets. From the $25 el-cheapo sets to $100+ cordless units; from Andis to Wahl, this one outperforms them all by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not going to over-inflate this review, as there are some drawbacks to this set. First is the size (diameter). If you are a young person, a small person, or if you just have dainty little hands, this may be a bit of a challenge for you to get a comfortable grip on. The second issue is the weight. For the previously-mentioned folks, finessing this instrument may pose somewhat of a challenge. It isn&#x27;t overly-heavy, it&#x27;s more of a cumbersome device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, what this indicates to me is that inside the virtually unbreakable casing, one can expect to find a workhorse power plant. I hear that next year they are planning to produce a twin-turbo diesel model with a rear bagger, and a hedge clipper attachment. OK, so that part is a lie, but it does make a good segue to my last point: The noise. I like it; it says \\&quot;quality\\&quot; to me. You may find it overkill, but it is by no means as cacophonous as some others have made it sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature of these clippers is the quick-change blades. They literally snap right on - no need to unscrew the old, align and screw on the new! They are also very high quality, and stay relatively cool, even after prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The T-finisher is a solid item too. If you don&#x27;t need it, don&#x27;t bother though. Buying the combo saves you money, but the 000 blade (included with the 76) will do the same thing as the \\&quot;T\\&quot;. I have found that for tight trimming, the [[ASIN:B00011K2BA Wahl Peanut]] does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this combo, and I hope this review helps you decide what to get. I also understand that the [[ASIN:B000B76T52 Oster Fast Feed Clipper]] is a pretty nice set. If you don&#x27;t want to spend over a hundred bucks on a clipper set, you might want to look there as well. Here is the same item with the T-Finisher: [[ASIN:B000ERCU98 Oster Fast Feed Clipper &amp; T-finish Trimmer Combo]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!this review helps you decide what to get.

            <li> Point blank, best purchase of it&#x27;s product&#x27;s kind I&#x27;ve ever made. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Got tired with sub $50 clippers.  Bought these babies and wow!  The picture looks red but they are really a brownish hue.  I used to have to do a couple of passes with my old clippers, but these cut unbelievably well on the first pass.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The classic 76 is one of the best clippers you can have. A must have for all barbers. The t-Finisher is good if you adjust the blade.</li>
            <li> I can only agree with all the others. This is a great set. If I could do it over I would not get the t-trimmer and direct those $&#x27;s towards extra blades. If you&#x27;re using 0000 or 00000 blade there&#x27;s about no reason to have the t-trimmer. But given the price for the pair, its a real steal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years and have been disappointed with consumer grade hair clippers and so decided to buy the Oster Classic 76 combo (Finisher).  These clippers are used by old school barbers and work great. I expect to be using this one for years to come.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist and have clipper and have used it daily for over 20 years. With the exception of sending it back to Oster  once for servicing. If you are looking for a strong dependable clipper this is the one. The only thing about it I don&#x27;t like is the weight, it is a little heavy for use 8 hrs. a day. But I have others that I use when I can. This is the big gun, great for really thick hair, doesn&#x27;t bog down in the thick of it.  Clean it, oil it according to the directions and it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> After having long hair for a number of years, I recently got it all cut off and it was back to going to the barber every week to get a \\&quot;number 1 all over\\&quot;.  So, I decided I could do it just as well as him and wanted to get a clipper set to prove it.  I got this one.  And, let me tell you, I was not disappointed.  Popped on the #1 blade that comes with it, and a few minutes later...voila!  No more barber!  I like the finisher, too.  Actually, now i do the finishing first and then clip my hair - it&#x27;s a little easier to see the edges.  Also, heed one of the other reviewer&#x27;s comments about the size of the clipper - it&#x27;s a pretty big thing.  So, if you&#x27;re not a big guy like me it might be a little unwieldy.  All around great buy, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was a barber for many years and bought the Oster 76 in about 1962.&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the barber trade until about 1973. Then I went into another trade but used the &amp;#34;76&amp;#34; to cut both my sons hair until they went out on their own in about 1982.&lt;br /&gt;I also did and still do my own hair with my wife doing only the very upper back which I cannot see for myself, and this is 2014.&lt;br /&gt;I just dropped the clipper today and broke the switch, but the rest of the clipper was never repaired except for me replacing the electrical brushes myself and having blades sharpened.&lt;br /&gt;I challenge anyone to name a clipper that lasted that long for them.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to find a replacement switch and hope it is as good as the original as I have read about switch problems in some other of the postings.&lt;br /&gt; I cannot believe Oster is stupid enough to change to a cheap switch but I will see for myself.&lt;br /&gt; If someone from Oster reads this they better make sure their switch problem does not exist because no company can continue to live off their reputation for long.</li>
            <li> These clippers are awesome.  I am in the military and my wife went to hair school so I have been getting my hair cut at home for some time.  The cippers she previously used did not cut as short as I liked and occasionaly \\&quot;pulled\\&quot; which was very uncomfortable.  I ordered many different blades for the 76 (including 000000...I actually don&#x27;t recall how many zero&#x27;s, LOL) and this clipper cuts smoothly, comfortably, and CLOSE!!  Awesome clippers that I would highly recommend to any one.  Also, the blades change out very easy.</li>
            <li> The Oster Clippper 76 (the big one) is worth it!  But wasn&#x27;t a fan of the finish trimmers (small one) it pulls my hair.  If I had to buy this again I&#x27;d buy the Oster Clipper 76 and just but the 00000 attachment.</li>
            <li> If you cut hair, your own or someone else&#x27;s, don&#x27;t waste your time and money on Conair, Wahl, Norelco, etc. clippers like I did.  They are toys compared to the Oster 76.  For 5 years I used used them all and was always disappointed.  Finally coughed up the dough for the Oster and was amazed what a difference it makes.  I use a #2 blade for a close cut all around and this clipper gives an even cut on the top, sides and back with minimum time and effort.  Do yourself a favor and buy the best. My only complaint is that I had to purchase the #2 and #1.5 blades separatly as the Oster 76 only comes with two shorter blades which I don&#x27;t use. [[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]]</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair, my sons hair and my grandsons hair so I decided we needed a good set of clippers for this. I bought this set of professional clippers and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with them. My wife loves them and says they cut so much better than the cheap clippers she had been using. She says never again.</li>
            <li> My favorites as a stylist of almost 20 years</li>
            <li> There are a few items that are a must haves for Barber&#x27;s, Stylists, Pet Groomers, kitchen beauticians and the like. This product is one of them. The ease of use, the blades and the design. I love this brand of clippers. This is a must own and a great gift for barber and cosmetology students. My husband even uses the Classic 76 on his own- I then come back to clean him up but anyone can become a professional using this top quality clipper.</li>
            <li> Great clippers,I have gone through alot of clippers over the years. I decided to spend a little more this time.These look like they will last for years if taken care of. The 76 is alot bigger than I am use too. I am getting use to them. I would recommend to both lay and pro.</li>
            <li> super, super very nice</li>
            <li> Seriously? The on/off switch snapped off the SECOND time I used these. Would not market these as &amp;#34;durable&amp;#34;. The t finisher works fine, but it does not have an awkward weak PLASTIC on/off switch. I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and am very dissapointed... I had high hopes for these clippers, worked fine until it was rendered unusable by the switch.</li>
            <li> I spent the extra money to get some quality clippers.  I could not be happier. My wife is now my barber and on her first haircut ever she nailed it with these clippers.  They don&#x27;t pull or grab hair, or anything that a cheaper clipper normally does.  I could not even tell they were cutting my hair as it was that smooth.  Highly recommended and worth the extra money.  Don&#x27;t give in to cheaper clippers. My wife gave me a professional cut on her first try and the finisher clippers are totally money. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these clippers, they ROCK!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I uses them a lot  I have had them for a  year in a half and they&#x27;re still going strong very good product and very good price</li>
            <li> These clippers are quiet powerful and a joy to use. I feel at ease when i cut my hair now.</li>
            <li> SHIPPING WAS FAST, CLIPPER AND TRIMMER ARE THE BEST.WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO MY FRIENDS.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to use at her work as a hair stylist.  It is a great set of clippers that she loves to use.  Every other stylist at her work has the same set of clippers in their arsenal as well.  Being able to very quickly and easily change the blades is a huge plus.  The operation is smooth and powerful with it&#x27;s gear driven blades...instead of old fashioned relay driven blades ;)    The only problem with the Oster 76 is the power switch on the bottom of the unit...it&#x27;s a cheap plastic piece of junk that broke after a couple months of heavy use in the salon.  My wife brought her clippers home to show me that the unit had a short and stopped working if she held it in certain positions.  I took it apart to find that one of the power leads coming from the switch and connecting to the motor had broken off of the switch due to vibration.  Several of my wife&#x27;s coworkers have had the same problem with their Oster 76 clippers as well.  I replaced the switch with a quality one made with metal components and better leads and she hasn&#x27;t had a problem since...I&#x27;ve even fixed some of her coworker&#x27;s clippers with a switch upgrade, saving them $50+ in fees to have Oster fix it with another crap switch.    Other than the cheap switch...it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Works great, very pleased.  Good for home haircutting.  Trimmer makes everything even and professional looking.  Received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Durable. Has lasted me for years. I have saved so much on safety razors and hair cuts over the years it&#x27;s absurd.</li>
            <li> I had been in the market for the Oster 76 Classic for quite sometime and I&#x27;d seen the product in Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for well over $200. When i saw the combo pack for way less I had to jump on it. Both clippers work great just as I&#x27;d hoped they would. The best part about it was the shipping! No surprises no problems. It came right to my door step just like they said it would. Great experience. I can&#x27;t wait to order from Amazon again!</li>
            <li> the 76 is fab the trimmer gives me trouble because the cord keeps curling up have no idea why</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. Oster has a good reputation and the product arrived fast. Happy with the product. Be sure to buy a cleaner for it as well.</li>
            <li> Best set of clippers I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> the barber next door to my shop uses these. he says i&#x27;ll be cutting my hair with them 3 years from now.</li>
            <li> By far and away the best shears around, nothing has compared and I&#x27;ve used many different brands.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money, spend a little up front and never have to replace inferior products with other inferior products only to eventually get these...</li>
            <li> I have been cutting hair, people and animals for almost 30 years.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many brands of clippers I have gone through over the years.  The Oster is the best.  Sturdy constructed, easy to use, easy to clean, and the attachments stay on until I take them off!</li>
            <li> The 76&#x27;s are the best. I brought these to replace a pair I had for 25 years. The motor finally died and probably would have lasted linger if I took better care of the motor.</li>
            <li> After going through trimmers and clippers on an annual basis I decided enough was enough. I got this combo deal and already love it. The Oster 76 is a beast and it came with the 000 and 1 blade. I will eventually get a 00000 and a 3 1/2. In the meantime I got plastic guards and they work. Have already give myself a haircut, and after 12 years in the military I keep my hair short and neat. Wish I had these while I was in could have saved tons of money.  The T-trimmer is great for my gotee and keeping it sharp. Both work great for man scaping. I&#x27;m a hairy man and next to a gas powered weed eater these two professional tools really does the trick.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but the clippers get too hot after 5mins.</li>
            <li> these are the best, we have burnt up 3 sets from wal mart and I can tell these are built way better and will last a long time</li>
            <li> I give this Clippers to my daughter and she loved them. Also a very good price for them. Just the right color for her.</li>
            <li> I am a barber machine delivery arrived on time but opening the package I encountered that it was missing the 000 detachable, cleaning brush, lubricating oil, and the clipper grease. I was disappointed in that now I have to order those missing items</li>
            <li> best combo clip ever! Best hair cut products in the market. Highly recommend, professional barber tools. If you like cutting your own hair there is nothing better than this ..</li>
            <li> If you cut hair professionally or as an amateur you should have these clippers for even and straight cuts..The best!</li>
