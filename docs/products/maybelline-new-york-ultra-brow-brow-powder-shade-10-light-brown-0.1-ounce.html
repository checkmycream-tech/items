            <li>if you have the time to look for something else (which you probably do if you&#x27;re reading reviews :^)</li>
            <li>I used this Maybelline brow powder for many years and it is my best chose.  </li>
            <li>This is the best eyebrow enhancer for those of us who have mostly colorless eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>works great, love it!</li>
            <li>Happy to be able to get on line as I cannot find in stores!</li>
            <li>, Maybelline always makes a good product.</li>
            <li>If you want to fill in your eyebrows this gives a good effect.</li>
            <li>However, you will need a good brow brush.</li>
            <li>I received in good time and shape, but color was darker than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>but I use a lighter shade over it and it looks good.</li>
            <li>Of course, it is discontinued, but I will continue to buy until it is gone for good.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a good choice for me although the color is good.</li>
            <li>I was so delighted when I did find it here.</li>
            <li>Loved it for years.</li>
            <li>Stays put, and looks good too.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the color shade.</li>
            <li>Good color, good coverage, and easy to apply!</li>

            <li>Love this...don&#x27;t ever stop carrying this, please!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Nice texture and</li>
            <li>Nobody sells it in the stores, so I was thrilled when I found it.  </li>
            <li>--:}  It&#x27;s perfect for natural looking brows for anyone who is fair skinned.</li>
            <li>Item is discontinued by Maybelline, so very happy I was able to purchase 3 at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product (that I have bought elsewhere) and have used it for many years!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Maybelline&#x27;s Brow Powder, it&#x27;s very easy to apply and never looks overstated.  </li>
            <li>Best eyebrow liner ever, very natural looking and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have very light eyebrows</li>
            <li>I have used this product for more years than I can remember and was devastated when I could no longer&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>

            <li>this is my favorite eyebrow makeup</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many years, and now it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I would buy more if I can find a place to buy it without overnight shipping.</li>
            <li>I love this product and they quit making it, can&#x27;t understand why</li>
            <li>so I figured I better get this while I can.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for most of my life.</li>
            <li>I love this product as the shade works well for me</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>Texture is find, but color is misrepresented as are most &amp;#34;blond&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It is my favorite brow enhancer.  </li>
            <li>Was so pleased to be able to find it again on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR MANY YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;GIVES</li>
            <li>I thought it would work better , I will probably return it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>So much better than a pencil</li>
            <li>I love this brow powder.  </li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Ilove it so much better than the pencil.</li>
            <li>So I am so glad I found this at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I need to get some more.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for 30 years and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>If you want more staying power just swipe some brow gel over it to seal it in.</li>
            <li>I still need two more.</li>
            <li>Do love this brow powder.  </li>
            <li>Love this brow make-up.  </li>
            <li>but more of a smudgy, inconsistent look.  </li>
            <li>I swear that the one I just purchased is more powdery.  </li>
            <li>Seems like it is more like the consistency of eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the pencils.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for women with lighter shades of hair and those who don&#x27;t want the &amp;#34;Charlie Chaplin&amp;#34; look that I so often see on women who&#x27;ve overdosed on the whole makeup thing.  </li>
            <li>Once I put it on it makes my eyebrows stand out and have a better more defined shape.</li>
            <li>Maybelline seems to think that the pencils and colored liners are better and have discontinued making the brown powder.  </li>
            <li>Love this eye brow make-up.</li>
            <li>I am almost 70, but the light brown works well for me!</li>
            <li>We chose the five star rating because we have not been able to find this pressed powder brow product in stores.  </li>
            <li>better than brow pencils.</li>
            <li>I bought 6 of these because none of the drug stores around here carry it any more.</li>
            <li>i like it more than the eyebrow pencils.</li>
            <li>i have been using this product for many years and it was discontinued  </li>
            <li>glad i found it on amazon</li>
            <li>I love this product.have used it for years.</li>
            <li>that was more than the eye brow</li>
            <li>I wrote a note earlier, but will repeat that this is wonderful brow powder and does a bang up job as an eye shadow for the crease of your eye lid as well.</li>
            <li>This fills in the gaps and gives my brows a more dense look, but invisibly.</li>
            <li>Most of my friends can&#x27;t tell I fill in my brows with powder unless I&#x27;ve told them.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this -hope</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find it.</li>
            <li>I had breast cancer many many years ago and this was suggested for use when you lost your eyebrows as it didn&#x27;t rub off easily.</li>
            <li>You can top it with brow gel or wax, but it stays just fine by itself.</li>
            <li>I once dropped my brush and it took awhile to retrieve and clean it!</li>
            <li>Im glad it was available here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Great for fair-skinned blondes who want a natural look.</li>
            <li>She was very happy to receive the supply, since for some unknown reason, the company has stopped manufacturing Ultra Brow.</li>
            <li>I love this product even though I do not believe it&#x27;s the original, it was discontinued and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and buildable.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day and even through the night</li>
            <li>Easy use and does not require a ton of product to obtain result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this product all of my life because it looks more natural than a pencil, and I&#x27;ve always had very light (now gray)</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and color match is very good.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on way too light.  </li>
            <li>I hope this product will be available again for my wife.</li>
            <li>it will be available again.</li>
            <li>This product is no longer available at stores.  </li>
            <li>Want to look your age with fabulous eyebrows...</li>
            <li>This is no longer made or available in drugstores.  </li>
            <li>It is no longer available in my area so at this time I am set for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I could find nothing as light as this in a powder.  </li>
            <li>I like how smooth it applies when i use my concealer brush.</li>
            <li>I have been using this eyebrow powder in light brown for 14 years</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for YEARS and am distressed that it is no longer available from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>it is always available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I wanted &amp; I was able to get the right shade too.</li>
            <li>The color was true and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was true, it did not rub off easily at all (versus a wax based pencil that could smudge).</li>
            <li>After ordering, receiving and trying this product for the first time this week, I liked it so much I ordered two more.  </li>
            <li>Love this product so much!  </li>
            <li>See original review.  </li>
            <li>Color was more medium brown than light brown and very taupe.  </li>
            <li>Much better than an eyebrow pencil; it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and just the right color.  </li>
            <li>It  is good quality and would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>, It is a warm,beige, light brown with golden undertones</li>
            <li>I paid a premium to get one more, since I do like it that much.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I did find surprising was the price of $20.00 each, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>could only hope that they have a change of mind and will once again bring back this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those with light or thin brows.</li>
            <li>did think that the shipping price was to high, $25.00 was more than I have ever paid for any order I have ever made.</li>
            <li>Nice product for filling in bare spots in the brows.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Love this matches my hair and looks very natural</li>
            <li>very natural, better than pencil</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and it is very natural and does not look like I penciled my brows in like \\&quot;coloring with a coloring book\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
            <li>It fills in my thinning eyebrows much more naturally than a pencil would.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find the Maybelline Ultra-Brow because it seems it is no longer carried in local stores.</li>
            <li>- looks so much more natural.  </li>
            <li>eyebrows look more natural.</li>
            <li>It looks much more natural.  </li>
            <li>Love this product because it looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the powder blends in with my natural brow.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth either  price.  </li>
            <li>it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years---makes a more natural  looking eyebrow.</li>
            <li>This powder product looks the most natural</li>
            <li>so glad to have it to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>It is the right size for a pocketbook makeup bag or for use at home.</li>
            <li>just the right shade.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and looks very natural as apposed to the pencil brow product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and looks natural!</li>
            <li>As usual it is great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply using the brush and looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I use it instead of eyebrow pencil, and it is much easier to use and much more natural looking.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Very fast service.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use very much so</li>
            <li>Great product, but hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>, Thank You so much,  definitely will order again :)</li>
            <li>Have been using this product since it first came on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years but am no longer able to find it stocked in local stores.  </li>
            <li>At a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Will be difficult finding another superb product like this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars only because it *is* better than nothing; but</li>
            <li>If you have an open drain, be sure to put a stopper in the sink.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to finally find this again.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Turned several friends on to it now they are frantically searching for more.</li>
            <li>The price is definitely right, but it also is very user-friendly..just brush it on and pretty eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Looks the most natural on,  More so than any other eyebrow makeup I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>very natural and soft looking been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>The little brush is dainty, makes small strokes and allows more control as you apply.</li>
            <li>I love the color as it blends in so well, and is so easy to apply, but I use a small liner brush as it works better than the short brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I have light blonde hair and my eyebrows are very light blonde as well.  </li>
            <li>No other cosmetic company carries the powder brow and it looks so much more natural.</li>
            <li>I believe it comes with a tiny wand, and that is fine, but you will probably lose that before the product runs out.</li>
            <li>This is hard to find in the stores and Amazon is a good place to purchase it.</li>
            <li>The brush does not work very well.  </li>
            <li>thanks for having it</li>
            <li>Not as pleased as I expected.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much easier to apply than eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon...</li>
            <li>Fast shipment &amp; was just as described.</li>
            <li>And it was so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>The color is very nature.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Price was WAY too high!</li>
            <li>This product was actually better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>so much I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it goes on, and did not want to go to a pencil, etc..</li>
            <li>Very pricey from this seller</li>
            <li>but you charge me to much to ship it .</li>
            <li>This brush on powder is so much easier to use than an eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>Looks like my natural brows!!!  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>Saw online that this was recently discontinued by Maybelline, and I sure hope they bring it back.  </li>
            <li>As we get older we lose some of our brows.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend over using an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>you think that was to high for postage ?</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not that old school !!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this in my little town and I love the color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Maybelline Ultra-Brow Powder with the little brush most of my life.</li>
            <li>This is the only makeup product I positively couldn&#x27;t go without  since I lost most of my eyesbrows due to medication use.</li>
            <li>I have no eyebrows and the powder fills in very well so that the eyebrows look natural.  </li>
            <li>Was so excited to find it listed with you, and extremely please with fast service and price</li>
            <li>I am sure it will last a long time</li>
            <li>BECAUSE NOTHING LOOKS  MORE HARSH</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers - it doesn&#x27;t come off the brush, it goes on too light, it doesn&#x27;t give a defining line</li>
            <li>only problem was the high prices, 3-4 times higher that it was in stores</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and no matter what new product I try</li>
            <li>A VERY NATURAL LOOK TO THE BROWS</li>
            <li>It also appears very natural.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>As a light golden blonde, just what I was looking for, dark enough to show up, but not too harsh, on my fair complexion.cA clear brow mascara makes it last all day</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that I have found except for a Mary Kay item years ago that was similar that actually looks authentic.  </li>
            <li>This is fresh, not old stuff.</li>
            <li>I get a little rushed when applying it, as they easily correct any mistakes.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to have natural-looking brows with this powder and brush and not the harsh look the pencils give you.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural and professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been down to the end of my last one for almost a year and haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere until I got the idea of going online and found it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and was unable to find it in the store, found on Amazon, a little pricey, but happy to get the brow powder!</li>
            <li>I find that it is hard to find this brow product by Maybelline in many stores now, so in the interest of saving time, I ordered online.</li>
            <li>For years I have been using this product to fill in my brows with a natural look.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>It is a soft look, not harsh like a waxy crayon or some liquids would be.</li>
            <li>I can draw a well defined brow with my brush and it looks natural with my hair and skin color.  </li>
            <li>It  looks  natural  </li>
            <li>If you want to look 150 years old, use eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural -looking, and I&#x27;ve received compliments on the color as well.  </li>
            <li>BUT I did not like having to pay nearly triple the price to order it online.</li>
            <li>This looks natural, just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>so natural</li>
            <li>Goes on naturally and stays put all day.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and not harsh looking.  </li>
            <li>not messy</li>
            <li>It is applied dry with an eyebrow brush (I have a couple that I saved from old Maybelline products because they&#x27;re only about 1/4&amp;#34; wide), goes on nicely over bare unprimed skin or makeup.  </li>
            <li>Since I have very little eyebrows left, the Powder works much better than the pencil.  </li>
            <li>My brows are so light that they might as well not be there, but a little powder, and voila!</li>
            <li>The price was right compared to the other name brands (Dior etc.)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty long lasting and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Lately I have been unable to find in the drug stores, so I was very happy to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>As is the case with any other brands I&#x27;ve tried thus far, this, too, is, if not a dark brown, certainly a medium brown.  </li>
            <li>There is no other product that is applied this way.</li>
            <li>It is not fake looking in other words.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years as I have no eyebrows and find pencils to hard to get smooth lines.</li>
            <li>So please, if one  must use a pencil, apply using short, feathered strokes for a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IIt&#x27;s the only make-up product I&#x27;ve ever found that looks natural</li>
            <li>This is the best eyebrow powder and most natural, not to mention the least expensive, and it lasts forever, probably at least 7 years with everyday use.  </li>
            <li>It is an exact replacement for my previous Maybelline Ultra Brow Powder.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>now i have enough for a long time who knows they just might bring it back  ..  thanks for your help</li>
            <li>It really is the little things in life that can give you a boost.  </li>

            <li> if you have the time to look for something else (which you probably do if you&#x27;re reading reviews :^)</li>
            <li> I used this Maybelline brow powder for many years and it is my best chose.  </li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow enhancer for those of us who have mostly colorless eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> works great, love it!</li>
            <li> Happy to be able to get on line as I cannot find in stores!</li>
            <li> , Maybelline always makes a good product.</li>
            <li> If you want to fill in your eyebrows this gives a good effect.</li>
            <li> However, you will need a good brow brush.</li>
            <li> I received in good time and shape, but color was darker than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> but I use a lighter shade over it and it looks good.</li>
            <li> Of course, it is discontinued, but I will continue to buy until it is gone for good.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a good choice for me although the color is good.</li>
            <li> I was so delighted when I did find it here.</li>
            <li> Loved it for years.</li>
            <li> Stays put, and looks good too.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the color shade.</li>

            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Nice texture and</li>
            <li> Nobody sells it in the stores, so I was thrilled when I found it.  </li>
            <li> --:}  It&#x27;s perfect for natural looking brows for anyone who is fair skinned.</li>
            <li> Item is discontinued by Maybelline, so very happy I was able to purchase 3 at a reasonable price.  </li>

            <li> I absolutely love Maybelline&#x27;s Brow Powder, it&#x27;s very easy to apply and never looks overstated.  </li>

            <li> I have very light eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more years than I can remember and was devastated when I could no longer&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>

            <li> I would buy more if I can find a place to buy it without overnight shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product and they quit making it, can&#x27;t understand why</li>
            <li> so I figured I better get this while I can.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>

            <li> I love this product as the shade works well for me</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I have been using it for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> Texture is find, but color is misrepresented as are most &amp;#34;blond&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is my favorite brow enhancer.  </li>
            <li> Was so pleased to be able to find it again on Amazon.  </li>

            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR MANY YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;GIVES</li>
            <li> I thought it would work better , I will probably return it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> So much better than a pencil</li>
            <li> I love this brow powder.  </li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> Ilove it so much better than the pencil.</li>
            <li> So I am so glad I found this at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I need to get some more.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for 30 years and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> If you want more staying power just swipe some brow gel over it to seal it in.</li>
            <li> I still need two more.</li>
            <li> Do love this brow powder.  </li>
            <li> Love this brow make-up.  </li>
            <li> but more of a smudgy, inconsistent look.  </li>
            <li> I swear that the one I just purchased is more powdery.  </li>
            <li> Seems like it is more like the consistency of eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the pencils.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for women with lighter shades of hair and those who don&#x27;t want the &amp;#34;Charlie Chaplin&amp;#34; look that I so often see on women who&#x27;ve overdosed on the whole makeup thing.  </li>
            <li> Once I put it on it makes my eyebrows stand out and have a better more defined shape.</li>
            <li> Maybelline seems to think that the pencils and colored liners are better and have discontinued making the brown powder.  </li>
            <li> Love this eye brow make-up.</li>
            <li> I am almost 70, but the light brown works well for me!</li>
            <li> We chose the five star rating because we have not been able to find this pressed powder brow product in stores.  </li>
            <li> better than brow pencils.</li>
            <li> I bought 6 of these because none of the drug stores around here carry it any more.</li>
            <li> i like it more than the eyebrow pencils.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for many years and it was discontinued  </li>
            <li> glad i found it on amazon</li>
            <li> I love this product.have used it for years.</li>
            <li> that was more than the eye brow</li>
            <li> I wrote a note earlier, but will repeat that this is wonderful brow powder and does a bang up job as an eye shadow for the crease of your eye lid as well.</li>
            <li> This fills in the gaps and gives my brows a more dense look, but invisibly.</li>
            <li> Most of my friends can&#x27;t tell I fill in my brows with powder unless I&#x27;ve told them.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this -hope</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find it.</li>
            <li> I had breast cancer many many years ago and this was suggested for use when you lost your eyebrows as it didn&#x27;t rub off easily.</li>
            <li> You can top it with brow gel or wax, but it stays just fine by itself.</li>
            <li> I once dropped my brush and it took awhile to retrieve and clean it!</li>
            <li> Im glad it was available here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Great for fair-skinned blondes who want a natural look.</li>
            <li> She was very happy to receive the supply, since for some unknown reason, the company has stopped manufacturing Ultra Brow.</li>
            <li> I love this product even though I do not believe it&#x27;s the original, it was discontinued and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and buildable.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day and even through the night</li>
            <li> Easy use and does not require a ton of product to obtain result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this product all of my life because it looks more natural than a pencil, and I&#x27;ve always had very light (now gray)</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and color match is very good.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on way too light.  </li>
            <li> I hope this product will be available again for my wife.</li>
            <li> it will be available again.</li>
            <li> This product is no longer available at stores.  </li>
            <li> Want to look your age with fabulous eyebrows...</li>
            <li> This is no longer made or available in drugstores.  </li>
            <li> It is no longer available in my area so at this time I am set for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I could find nothing as light as this in a powder.  </li>
            <li> I like how smooth it applies when i use my concealer brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyebrow powder in light brown for 14 years</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for YEARS and am distressed that it is no longer available from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> it is always available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted &amp; I was able to get the right shade too.</li>
            <li> The color was true and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was true, it did not rub off easily at all (versus a wax based pencil that could smudge).</li>
            <li> After ordering, receiving and trying this product for the first time this week, I liked it so much I ordered two more.  </li>
            <li> Love this product so much!  </li>
            <li> See original review.  </li>
            <li> Color was more medium brown than light brown and very taupe.  </li>
            <li> Much better than an eyebrow pencil; it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and just the right color.  </li>
            <li> It  is good quality and would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> , It is a warm,beige, light brown with golden undertones</li>
            <li> I paid a premium to get one more, since I do like it that much.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I did find surprising was the price of $20.00 each, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> could only hope that they have a change of mind and will once again bring back this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those with light or thin brows.</li>
            <li> did think that the shipping price was to high, $25.00 was more than I have ever paid for any order I have ever made.</li>
            <li> Nice product for filling in bare spots in the brows.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Love this matches my hair and looks very natural</li>
            <li> very natural, better than pencil</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and it is very natural and does not look like I penciled my brows in like \\&quot;coloring with a coloring book\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
            <li> It fills in my thinning eyebrows much more naturally than a pencil would.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find the Maybelline Ultra-Brow because it seems it is no longer carried in local stores.</li>
            <li> - looks so much more natural.  </li>
            <li> eyebrows look more natural.</li>
            <li> It looks much more natural.  </li>
            <li> Love this product because it looks natural.  </li>
            <li> I love the way the powder blends in with my natural brow.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth either  price.  </li>
            <li> it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years---makes a more natural  looking eyebrow.</li>
            <li> This powder product looks the most natural</li>
            <li> so glad to have it to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> It is the right size for a pocketbook makeup bag or for use at home.</li>
            <li> just the right shade.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and looks very natural as apposed to the pencil brow product.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and looks natural!</li>
            <li> As usual it is great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply using the brush and looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I use it instead of eyebrow pencil, and it is much easier to use and much more natural looking.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> Very fast service.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use very much so</li>
            <li> Great product, but hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> , Thank You so much,  definitely will order again :)</li>
            <li> Have been using this product since it first came on the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years but am no longer able to find it stocked in local stores.  </li>
            <li> At a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Will be difficult finding another superb product like this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars only because it *is* better than nothing; but</li>
            <li> If you have an open drain, be sure to put a stopper in the sink.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to finally find this again.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Turned several friends on to it now they are frantically searching for more.</li>
            <li> The price is definitely right, but it also is very user-friendly..just brush it on and pretty eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Looks the most natural on,  More so than any other eyebrow makeup I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> very natural and soft looking been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> The little brush is dainty, makes small strokes and allows more control as you apply.</li>
            <li> I love the color as it blends in so well, and is so easy to apply, but I use a small liner brush as it works better than the short brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair and my eyebrows are very light blonde as well.  </li>
            <li> No other cosmetic company carries the powder brow and it looks so much more natural.</li>
            <li> I believe it comes with a tiny wand, and that is fine, but you will probably lose that before the product runs out.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in the stores and Amazon is a good place to purchase it.</li>
            <li> The brush does not work very well.  </li>
            <li> thanks for having it</li>
            <li> Not as pleased as I expected.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much easier to apply than eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon...</li>
            <li> Fast shipment &amp; was just as described.</li>
            <li> And it was so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> The color is very nature.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Price was WAY too high!</li>
            <li> This product was actually better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> so much I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it goes on, and did not want to go to a pencil, etc..</li>
            <li> Very pricey from this seller</li>
            <li> but you charge me to much to ship it .</li>
            <li> This brush on powder is so much easier to use than an eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> Looks like my natural brows!!!  </li>
            <li> I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> Saw online that this was recently discontinued by Maybelline, and I sure hope they bring it back.  </li>
            <li> As we get older we lose some of our brows.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend over using an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> you think that was to high for postage ?</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not that old school !!  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in my little town and I love the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline Ultra-Brow Powder with the little brush most of my life.</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup product I positively couldn&#x27;t go without  since I lost most of my eyesbrows due to medication use.</li>
            <li> I have no eyebrows and the powder fills in very well so that the eyebrows look natural.  </li>
            <li> Was so excited to find it listed with you, and extremely please with fast service and price</li>
            <li> I am sure it will last a long time</li>
            <li> BECAUSE NOTHING LOOKS  MORE HARSH</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers - it doesn&#x27;t come off the brush, it goes on too light, it doesn&#x27;t give a defining line</li>
            <li> only problem was the high prices, 3-4 times higher that it was in stores</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and no matter what new product I try</li>
            <li> A VERY NATURAL LOOK TO THE BROWS</li>
            <li> It also appears very natural.  </li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> As a light golden blonde, just what I was looking for, dark enough to show up, but not too harsh, on my fair complexion.cA clear brow mascara makes it last all day</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that I have found except for a Mary Kay item years ago that was similar that actually looks authentic.  </li>
            <li> This is fresh, not old stuff.</li>
            <li> I get a little rushed when applying it, as they easily correct any mistakes.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to have natural-looking brows with this powder and brush and not the harsh look the pencils give you.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural and professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been down to the end of my last one for almost a year and haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere until I got the idea of going online and found it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and was unable to find it in the store, found on Amazon, a little pricey, but happy to get the brow powder!</li>
            <li> I find that it is hard to find this brow product by Maybelline in many stores now, so in the interest of saving time, I ordered online.</li>
            <li> For years I have been using this product to fill in my brows with a natural look.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> It is a soft look, not harsh like a waxy crayon or some liquids would be.</li>
            <li> I can draw a well defined brow with my brush and it looks natural with my hair and skin color.  </li>
            <li> It  looks  natural  </li>
            <li> If you want to look 150 years old, use eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural -looking, and I&#x27;ve received compliments on the color as well.  </li>
            <li> BUT I did not like having to pay nearly triple the price to order it online.</li>
            <li> This looks natural, just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> so natural</li>
            <li> Goes on naturally and stays put all day.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and not harsh looking.  </li>
            <li> not messy</li>
            <li> It is applied dry with an eyebrow brush (I have a couple that I saved from old Maybelline products because they&#x27;re only about 1/4&amp;#34; wide), goes on nicely over bare unprimed skin or makeup.  </li>
            <li> Since I have very little eyebrows left, the Powder works much better than the pencil.  </li>
            <li> My brows are so light that they might as well not be there, but a little powder, and voila!</li>
            <li> The price was right compared to the other name brands (Dior etc.)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty long lasting and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been unable to find in the drug stores, so I was very happy to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As is the case with any other brands I&#x27;ve tried thus far, this, too, is, if not a dark brown, certainly a medium brown.  </li>
            <li> There is no other product that is applied this way.</li>
            <li> It is not fake looking in other words.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years as I have no eyebrows and find pencils to hard to get smooth lines.</li>
            <li> So please, if one  must use a pencil, apply using short, feathered strokes for a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IIt&#x27;s the only make-up product I&#x27;ve ever found that looks natural</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow powder and most natural, not to mention the least expensive, and it lasts forever, probably at least 7 years with everyday use.  </li>
            <li> It is an exact replacement for my previous Maybelline Ultra Brow Powder.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> now i have enough for a long time who knows they just might bring it back  ..  thanks for your help</li>
            <li> It really is the little things in life that can give you a boost.  </li>
            <li> Pencils wear down too fast, and this will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but all of a sudden was unable to find it at any drugstore, whereas it used to be universally carried and easy to find.  </li>
            <li> I am sad to see that it is no longer available through retail.  </li>
            <li> I have grey hairs in my brow &amp; this covers up the gaps.</li>
            <li> Gives me a natural brow look without a heavy line.</li>
            <li> AND LASTS A LONG TIME.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t color my grey brow hairs or even the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this brow powder for a long time,  sooooo very&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed that it&#x27;s been discontinued but glad that I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and now I can not find it in stores, What a pity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed that it has been discontinued, since it seems to be so popular.  </li>
            <li> I think the color looks a little red which I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> (I also learned that if you have unruly brows, simply apply a little bit of eye cream on the areas that won&#x27;t lie in place, wait a minute or two, then apply brow powder</li>
            <li> I ordered a couple of them from you, but not sure how long they will last or if you will continue to carry these.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t have spent my money on it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday anymore, and expect this to last for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> the color is not as expected</li>
            <li> Color is about what I expected, I like the brush that came with the product.</li>
            <li> Sometimes cosmetics are not real saturated with color and go on lighter than the package looks.  </li>
            <li> It took longer than I expected to be delivered though.</li>
            <li> As expected, I used it for around 25 years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the brush it comes with, I wet a cotton qtip and then wet the powder and fill in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and was very disappointed when I could no longer find it in the drug stores where I live.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same that I had used in the past.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brow powder over any other brow makeup I have tried</li>
            <li> Just as expected!</li>
            <li> Every color I have purchased at the store has been too dark and I never thought I would find the shade I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Way to dark for me.</li>
            <li> I never could make a pencil of any type look other than drawn on, heavy and clown like.</li>
            <li> This product went on too heavy and the brush is angled too sharply.  </li>
            <li> Color is subtle but enough to fill in the gaps.  </li>
            <li> but I noticed that half of my eyebrows has faded so you can&#x27;t see them..  </li>
            <li> So a little brush of this</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here because this product gets rave reviews.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows grew back, but they&#x27;re just getting thin as I age.</li>
            <li> but the brush is a little too hard.</li>
            <li> There is not much more to say about it.  </li>
            <li> so I paid three times its usual cost because I didn&#x27;t want to be caught without it.</li>
            <li> Sorry to see this discontinued in local stores.</li>
            <li> I have very few problems with skin irritation, so you should test it for a day or two if this is an issue with you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard to find, so I went online to Amazon and ordered two.</li>
            <li> Pencil eyebrow makeup is too hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Can be hard to find in stores - easier to just order on-line.</li>
            <li> So this fills in so it is hard for others to tell.</li>
            <li> Hard to find though.</li>
            <li> I am fair/pale and have a hard time finding contour shades that are not orange or shimmery.  </li>
            <li> Brow powder is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I have never liked pencils and this powder does the job for me.  </li>
            <li> At least I can buy it here.</li>
            <li> I hate to think I have to get used to a new product.</li>
            <li> I paid a ridiculous price to have it once again.  </li>
            <li> I hate that I wasted money on it; but it was the only brand of brow powder in the store</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I looked in all the stores near me, and  could not find it.</li>
            <li> Wrong color.</li>
            <li> so sorry that Maybelline has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> So sorry this is no longer sold at Walgreens---or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I had searched repeatedly at Wal-Mart and drug stores for this product and was unable to find it.  </li>
            <li> So sorry this was discontinued by maybelline.  </li>
            <li> Absurd.  </li>
            <li> How wrong they are and one  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can  no longer find it in the stores  in my area.</li>
            <li> I feel sad that its not on the store shelves</li>
            <li> Height Ill 62208</li>
            <li> sorry posted it incorrectly.</li>
            <li> Too bad stores don&#x27;t carry it often.</li>
            <li> Too bad now we have to get this online.</li>
            <li> Too Bad Maybelline discontinued it.</li>
            <li> and Maybelline is crazy to discontinue!!!!</li>
            <li> The price was so outrageous, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s as scarce as hen&#x27;s teeth</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wrong color. I should have ordered a tint darker. This is for blond women.</li>
            <li> Excellent product have used it for years...easy to use.  Lasts a long time and color match is very good.  Excellent</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more years than I can remember and was devastated when I could no longer&lt;br /&gt;buy it.  So glad I was able to purchase it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Goes great with my brown eyes....bought for an eye shadow...very good purchase.  Would recommend this to others, Maybelline always makes a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been searching everywhere for this item in the stores and the clerks kept showing me the eyeshawdow trying to show me that is what they &amp;#34;used now&amp;#34;  HA  I&#x27;m older but I&#x27;m not that old school !!  Was so excited to find it listed with you, and extremely please with fast service and price, Thank You so much,  definitely will order again :)</li>
            <li> Have been using this product since it first came on the market.  I am sad to see that it is no longer available through retail.  Glad that I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is only brow powder I use.  Have been using for over 30 years!</li>
            <li> This product goes on way too light.  The brush does not work very well.  It does not give a defining line.  There is not much more to say about it.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t have spent my money on it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected..</li>
            <li> Works great .will purchase again.</li>
            <li> If I only have time for one article of make-up, I put on my eyebrows and go.  I use a softer brush than the one that comes with the product.  I like that my brows just get high-lighted and don&#x27;t look drawn on.  My brows are so light that they might as well not be there, but a little powder, and voila! eyebrows appear.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Looks like my natural brows!!!  I will continue using this product. Please have it stocked in stores. Recently they have discontinued it from the stores!!!</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow make-up, and it has been discontinued.  I was so happy to purchase this.  There is no other product that is applied this way.</li>
            <li> For years I have been using this product to fill in my brows with a natural look.  I don&#x27;t like pencils.  Maybelline discontinued it.  I found a source at amazon and think I now have enough for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> i bought this at a chain store, I LUV it.. works great. I have grey hairs in my brow &amp; this covers up the gaps. Will buy from Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> Awesome eyebrow color and exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  Every color I have purchased at the store has been too dark and I never thought I would find the shade I was looking for.  Well, this is it!!  It&#x27;s so easy to apply using the brush and looks so natural. So happy I purchased 2!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and buildable.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite eyebrow makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same that I had used in the past. It  is good quality and would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> As described, prompt shipment</li>
            <li> I was happy to find it.  Why is it when you like something they take it off the market.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will never understand marketing.&lt;br /&gt;But thanks for having it I feel I can always rely on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&#x27;</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued by Maybelline and Im glad it was available here on Amazon.  It is the perfect color.</li>
            <li> Gives me a natural brow look without a heavy line. Easy to use and just the right color.  Love It!</li>
            <li> Not as pleased as I expected. I think I shall return to my pencil.</li>
            <li> this product is great.  I have been using it for many years, and now it has been discontinued.  I would buy more if I can find a place to buy it without overnight shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this product all of my life because it looks more natural than a pencil, and I&#x27;ve always had very light (now gray) brows- so sorry that Maybelline has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Good color, good coverage, and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Great for fair-skinned blondes who want a natural look.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and no matter what new product I try I always come back to Maybelline ultra brow.  The price is definitely right, but it also is very user-friendly..just brush it on and pretty eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is nothing like the Maybelline NY Ultr-Brow powder product I buy at CVS or Walgreen&#x27;s! I was surprised. The quality of the packaging and the color (lighter) was different. I really love this product (that I have bought elsewhere) and have used it for many years!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and now I can not find it in stores, What a pity. I ordered a couple of them from you, but not sure how long they will last or if you will continue to carry these. I hate to think I have to get used to a new product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 30 years.  I recently discovered that it&#x27;s been discontinued so I paid three times its usual cost because I didn&#x27;t want to be caught without it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and they quit making it, can&#x27;t understand why so I figured I better get this while I can.</li>
            <li> If you want to fill in your eyebrows this gives a good effect. It is a soft look, not harsh like a waxy crayon or some liquids would be. However, you will need a good brow brush. I believe it comes with a tiny wand, and that is fine, but you will probably lose that before the product runs out. I find that it is hard to find this brow product by Maybelline in many stores now, so in the interest of saving time, I ordered online. Ouch regarding shipping charges buying that way, so if you like this and can find it in your local stores, get it there and save big.</li>
            <li> Very fast service. Thank you. I hope this product will be available again for my wife. She has used it for several years.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it will be available again.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I can draw a well defined brow with my brush and it looks natural with my hair and skin color.  Nice texture and it stays on well.</li>
            <li> I hope I can always buy this powder.  It fills in my thinning eyebrows much more naturally than a pencil would.</li>
            <li> This is a product I use daily and when I was unable to find it in any store, I searched on-line and was able to purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for most of my life. It&#x27;s been hard to find, so I went online to Amazon and ordered two. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the size of the brush. It used to be longer. I had to buy a separate brush.</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair and my eyebrows are very light blonde as well.  This is the only thing that I have found except for a Mary Kay item years ago that was similar that actually looks authentic.  Great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years but am no longer able to find it stocked in local stores.  It  looks  natural  and it&#x27;s much easier to apply than eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> This product is no longer available at stores.  Was very happy to find it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was the high prices, 3-4 times higher that it was in stores but that is&lt;br /&gt;the way &amp;#34;supply and demand&amp;#34; works.  NO complaints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since they began manufacturing it. I was almost frantic when Maybelline took it off the market. I found it on Amazon and the package arrived just like I bought it from the store. Got here quickly and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered and got to me in record time. This product is discontinued, so happy I found it here.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in my little town and I love the color.</li>
            <li> Love this, for years now!!</li>
            <li> I love this product as the shade works well for me and it&#x27;s pretty long lasting and natural looking. I&#x27;m really disappointed that it&#x27;s been discontinued but glad that I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> So sorry this is no longer sold at Walgreens---or anywhere else. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup&lt;br /&gt;so this Maybelline Ultra Brow is perfect for me. That&#x27;s why I ordered TWO products rather&lt;br /&gt;than one. What will I do when this is no longer available?&lt;br /&gt;  All I have to do is find a product I like and WHAM--then it&#x27;s off the market! Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;  I love this one.&lt;br /&gt;  Joan Gunter&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I see you&#x27;ve been snooping in my Kindle.</li>
            <li> As a light golden blonde, just what I was looking for, dark enough to show up, but not too harsh, on my fair complexion.cA clear brow mascara makes it last all day, It is a warm,beige, light brown with golden undertones</li>
            <li> I agree with all the great reviews!  If you want to look 150 years old, use eyebrow pencil.  Want to look your age with fabulous eyebrows...use maybelline powder.  Used it for years and Maybelline is crazy to discontinue!!!!</li>
            <li> I can no longer find these in any store on the East Coast. I love the color as it blends in so well, and is so easy to apply, but I use a small liner brush as it works better than the short brush that comes with it. Just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you AMAZON, you have done it yet again.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find the Maybelline Ultra-Brow because it seems it is no longer carried in local stores. No other cosmetic company carries the powder brow and it looks so much more natural. I have been using it for many, many years.  I received my order in a timely manner and I am happy to know I will not run out any time soon.  The only thing I did find surprising was the price of $20.00 each, but it was worth it. Thanks to Amazon...I can find just about anything on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Texture is find, but color is misrepresented as are most &amp;#34;blond&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; brow powders.  As is the case with any other brands I&#x27;ve tried thus far, this, too, is, if not a dark brown, certainly a medium brown.  Way to dark for me. I will give mine away.  Not for fair-haired people.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this in stores.  It is my favorite brow enhancer.  I have never liked pencils and this powder does the job for me.  I hope they continue to make it.</li>
            <li> I had searched repeatedly at Wal-Mart and drug stores for this product and was unable to find it.  It is an exact replacement for my previous Maybelline Ultra Brow Powder.  I have been using this product since I discovered it years ago (I&#x27;m now 80) and I hope I disappear before this product does!  --:}  It&#x27;s perfect for natural looking brows for anyone who is fair skinned.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it, hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> One of the Maybelline products that I used over 50 years ago.  Was so pleased to be able to find it again on Amazon.  Wish that the Maybelline cake mascara would reappear also!  At a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I actually have been using this product for years. It&#x27;s the best eye brow filler I have ever used. I was extremely glad when I found this product on your site. Thank You</li>
            <li> Purchased this item because Maybelline has discontinued it.  Looked at every store, department and otherwise, that I could think of, and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  This is the best eyebrow powder and most natural, not to mention the least expensive, and it lasts forever, probably at least 7 years with everyday use.  I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday anymore, and expect this to last for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Pencil eyebrow makeup is too hard to apply.  I have very light eyebrows so the powder is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I suddenly realized that this makeup, that I have used for decades, had bee discontinued.  Happy to find it on Amazon and stocked up.</li>
            <li> Saw online that this was recently discontinued by Maybelline, and I sure hope they bring it back.  It&#x27;s natural -looking, and I&#x27;ve received compliments on the color as well.  It lasts all day and needs no touch-ups!</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and could no longer find it in stores. As usual it is great BUT I did not like having to pay nearly triple the price to order it online.</li>
            <li> I love this product for sparce eyebrows.  I can&#x27;t find it in my local stores, however....the story of my life.  Powder goes where you want it to and stays on well.  Color is subtle but enough to fill in the gaps.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It lasts a long time and is very natural looking. It is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Used it for many years and always does well.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a bit pricey, but still I am satisfied with the product.  You don&#x27;t use very much so I am sure it will last a long time</li>
            <li> Fast shipment &amp; was just as described.</li>
            <li> Great product, but hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This is no longer made or available in drugstores.  I paid a ridiculous price to have it once again.  The brow powders seem to work the best for me, and this was a really good brow powder.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR MANY YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;GIVES A VERY NATURAL LOOK TO THE BROWS AND LASTS A LONG TIME.&lt;br /&gt;WOMEN SHOULD TRY THIS BROW POWDER BECAUSE NOTHING LOOKS  MORE HARSH&lt;br /&gt;THAN PENCILED BROWS.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and love it!</li>
            <li> the color is not as expected</li>
            <li> I think the color looks a little red which I don&#x27;t like I have dark blonde hair I thought it would work better , I will probably return it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs.  Too bad stores don&#x27;t carry it often.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but all of a sudden was unable to find it at any drugstore, whereas it used to be universally carried and easy to find.  I use it instead of eyebrow pencil, and it is much easier to use and much more natural looking.</li>
            <li> This looks natural, just what I wanted.  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> So sorry this was discontinued by maybelline.  Use this brow powder all the time.  It is easy to apply and looks natural.  Also stays on all day without wearing off unless you rub it off or go for a swim.  And it was so reasonably priced.  I paid a premium to get one more, since I do like it that much.  Will be difficult finding another superb product like this one.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this, since Maybelline has discontinued it!  I&#x27;ve used this for 20+ years!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  Love it.  so natural</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and looks natural!</li>
            <li> have used this for years and keeping getting it</li>
            <li> Have used this for 45 years.  This is fresh, not old stuff.</li>
            <li> brush could be thinner.</li>
            <li> Color is about what I expected, I like the brush that came with the product.</li>
            <li> So much better than a pencil - looks so much more natural.  Can be hard to find in stores - easier to just order on-line.</li>
            <li> I love this brow powder.  Pencils wear down too fast, and this will last for a long time.  It is the perfect color for me.  It also appears very natural.  You can top it with brow gel or wax, but it stays just fine by itself.</li>
            <li> The color is very nature. i love it.</li>
            <li> Ilove it so much better than the pencil. The price was right compared to the other name brands (Dior etc.) /the eyebrows look more natural.</li>
            <li> I received in good time and shape, but color was darker than I thought it would be.  I need lighter shade, maybe something called blonde.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 25 years.  How could they discontinue this on me???  So thankful that Amazon has this site for discontinued items.  I bought several.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell this in the stores anymore.  This is a great product.  Great price.  Too bad now we have to get this online.</li>
            <li> I had been looking in stores for eyebrow powder with a brush and couldn&#x27;t find any. Then I saw this on Amazon and was so surprise. It is just as advertised. It is the right size for a pocketbook makeup bag or for use at home. The color was true and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I wish this was still in the stores.  I think it is overpriced online but I haven&#x27;t found anything else that I like as well.</li>
            <li> I lost my eyebrows when I was 18 and have been using the product for years.  Literally years.  AND THEN THEY WENT AND DISCONTINUED IT.  All I could find was Benefits for what $38.  Absurd.  So I am so glad I found this at Amazon.  I need to get some more.  It is the best for eyebrows if you don&#x27;t&#x27; want to spend more money than you need to,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here because this product gets rave reviews. Does nothing for me. Doesn&#x27;t color my grey brow hairs or even the skin. A waste of money. I guess I&#x27;ll continue getting brow tinting at the salon.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and couldn&#x27;t find in stores.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 30 years and am pleased with it. It is no longer available in my area so at this time I am set for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Nice product for filling in bare spots in the brows. Color matches me perfectly.  Goes on naturally and stays put all day.  This is hard to find in the stores and Amazon is a good place to purchase it. If you want more staying power just swipe some brow gel over it to seal it in.</li>
            <li> Since I have very little eyebrows left, the Powder works much better than the pencil.  It looks much more natural.  I&#x27;m just disappointed that it has been discontinued, since it seems to be so popular.  I still need two more.</li>
            <li> I love this product even though I do not believe it&#x27;s the original, it was discontinued and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Do love this brow powder.  It is soft and not harsh looking.  As we get older we lose some of our brows.  So this fills in so it is hard for others to tell.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly as good as it has always been!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my friend, who has been using Ultra Brow for years. She was very happy to receive the supply, since for some unknown reason, the company has stopped manufacturing Ultra Brow. Thank you Amazon, for coming to the rescue. Linda.</li>
            <li> Love this product because it looks natural.  Not stroked on.  Hard to find though.</li>
            <li> Price was WAY too high!</li>
            <li> Love this brow make-up.  I wish they would bring it back.  At least I can buy it here.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers - it doesn&#x27;t come off the brush, it goes on too light, it doesn&#x27;t give a defining line but more of a smudgy, inconsistent look.  I hate that I wasted money on it; but it was the only brand of brow powder in the store and I didn&#x27;t have time to go anywhere else.  I&#x27;m giving it two stars only because it *is* better than nothing; but if you have the time to look for something else (which you probably do if you&#x27;re reading reviews :^) then by all means, do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Nobody sells it in the stores, so I was thrilled when I found it.  It is great. I use this product only</li>
            <li> I have used this product forever.  I swear that the one I just purchased is more powdery.  Seems like it is more like the consistency of eye shadow.  My imagination, or did they change the product?</li>
            <li> I have used this brow powder for a long time,  sooooo very&lt;br /&gt;natural looking.  Amazon is the only place I can now find this product.</li>
            <li> This was recommended for blondes.  Color was more medium brown than light brown and very taupe.  Looked muddy and made my eyebrows look like caterpillars. Sometimes cosmetics are not real saturated with color and go on lighter than the package looks.  This one goes on lots darker and is not flattering to a blonde.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much!  Have been using it for years.  I hope Maybelline reconsiders, and brings this back into production!</li>
            <li> Looks the most natural on,  More so than any other eyebrow makeup I&#x27;ve tried.  Much better than the pencils.  I don&#x27;t know why they would discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> So happy to still find this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow liner ever, very natural looking and easy to apply. Too Bad Maybelline discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Maybelline&#x27;s Brow Powder, it&#x27;s very easy to apply and never looks overstated.  It&#x27;s great for women with lighter shades of hair and those who don&#x27;t want the &amp;#34;Charlie Chaplin&amp;#34; look that I so often see on women who&#x27;ve overdosed on the whole makeup thing.  I always keep cotton swabs on hand, just in case I get a little rushed when applying it, as they easily correct any mistakes.  (I also learned that if you have unruly brows, simply apply a little bit of eye cream on the areas that won&#x27;t lie in place, wait a minute or two, then apply brow powder and you&#x27;ll find you have perfect brows).</li>
            <li> It completes my look. Once I put it on it makes my eyebrows stand out and have a better more defined shape.</li>
            <li> The only place that I could find this product</li>
            <li> Have used this product for awhile and found out they are discontinuing it.  Grateful that amazon had it</li>
            <li> I love the way the powder blends in with my natural brow.  Much better than an eyebrow pencil; it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost 40 years and it is the only &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking product for your brows.  Maybelline seems to think that the pencils and colored liners are better and have discontinued making the brown powder.  How wrong they are and one  could only hope that they have a change of mind and will once again bring back this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product&lt;br /&gt;For years. It took longer than I expected to be delivered though.</li>
            <li> works great, love it!</li>
            <li> This product was actually better than I expected.  It is perfect.  I will definitely get it again in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I use every day</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a bit lighter since I am blond but I use a lighter shade over it and it looks good.</li>
            <li> Love this eye brow make-up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for years but not as its intended purpose.  I have found that this color and formula are perfect for contouring.  I am fair/pale and have a hard time finding contour shades that are not orange or shimmery.  This is perfect brown with no shimmer and excellent in color payoff.  Of course, it is discontinued, but I will continue to buy until it is gone for good.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brow powder over any other brow makeup I have tried</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it where I bought it before.  So I checked with Amazon and was very happy to have found it.  I have no eyebrows and the powder fills in very well so that the eyebrows look natural.  I will continue to order it from Amazon in the future.  Hopefully you will still be carrying it.</li>
            <li> This is the handiest brow powder! Petite container hold brush so everythings compactly stored. Great for travel too!  You cant beat the price either!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Maybelline discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this in stores, I don&#x27;t do eyebrow pencil. I was very excited to find it. Yay!</li>
            <li> I have used this for twenty years and then Walgreen&#x27;s and CVS quit carrying it. Thank goodness for Amazon! I have very few problems with skin irritation, so you should test it for a day or two if this is an issue with you. I never could make a pencil of any type look other than drawn on, heavy and clown like. The little brush is dainty, makes small strokes and allows more control as you apply. My vanity is the softer look my face has with my eyebrows accented...I am almost 70, but the light brown works well for me! If you have an open drain, be sure to put a stopper in the sink. I once dropped my brush and it took awhile to retrieve and clean it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they discontinued this product!!  I could find nothing as light as this in a powder.  buying it at this sight was great.</li>
            <li> As expected, I used it for around 25 years.</li>
            <li> Love this matches my hair and looks very natural</li>
            <li> We chose the five star rating because we have not been able to find this pressed powder brow product in stores.  A brush is the best&lt;br /&gt;system for adding to, or enhancing brows.  If ladies can find only a pencil for brows, they will &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; them on, which is a very&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34; look.  So please, if one  must use a pencil, apply using short, feathered strokes for a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to the return of the pressed powder and brush  product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Sandee</li>
            <li> I am not into makeup....but I noticed that half of my eyebrows has faded so you can&#x27;t see them..  So a little brush of this and they are back!</li>
            <li> It is easy to have natural-looking brows with this powder and brush and not the harsh look the pencils give you. I have had several people ask me what I use and where do I get it. I like it so much I won&#x27;t use anything else. Unfortunately, I can  no longer find it in the stores  in my area.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to finally find this again.  I&#x27;ve been down to the end of my last one for almost a year and haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere until I got the idea of going online and found it here on Amazon.  The price was so outrageous, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s as scarce as hen&#x27;s teeth so I guess they charge what the market will bear, but I figure this one will last me another 10 years.  When I started using this 20 years ago it was only $1.99 but it&#x27;s worth either  price.  IIt&#x27;s the only make-up product I&#x27;ve ever found that looks natural and it&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day and even through the night it I happen to sleep in it.  It is applied dry with an eyebrow brush (I have a couple that I saved from old Maybelline products because they&#x27;re only about 1/4&amp;#34; wide), goes on nicely over bare unprimed skin or makeup.  This is the only makeup product I positively couldn&#x27;t go without  since I lost most of my eyesbrows due to medication use.</li>
            <li> not messy but the brush is a little too hard. I like how smooth it applies when i use my concealer brush. the coverage is great. better than brow pencils.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years....it&#x27;s the BEST !</li>
            <li> very natural and soft looking been using it for many years. doesnt cake or get oily. lasts all day and night.</li>
            <li> I could not find this in any store. It&#x27;s just what I wanted &amp; I was able to get the right shade too. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and was very disappointed when I could no longer find it in the drug stores where I live.  I then resorted to Amazon and lo and behold I found it there.  It really is the little things in life that can give you a boost.  Now I know where to go in the future.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years as I have no eyebrows and find pencils to hard to get smooth lines.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, lasts forever! Very satisfied with the color shade. I highly recommend over using an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural and professional. Easy use and does not require a ton of product to obtain result. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Brow powder is hard to find.  This is perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought 6 of these because none of the drug stores around here carry it any more. i like it more than the eyebrow pencils. it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> Love this...don&#x27;t ever stop carrying this, please!</li>
            <li> I have alopecia ( no eyebrows ) this product stays on all day and goes on easy.&lt;br /&gt;It saddens me to hear they discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for many years and it was discontinued  so im glad i found it on amazon now i have enough for a long time who knows they just might bring it back  ..  thanks for your help</li>
            <li> I used this Maybelline brow powder for many years and it is my best chose.  I feel sad that its not on the store shelves anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I did think that the shipping price was to high, $25.00 was more than I have ever paid for any order I have ever made.</li>
            <li> Sorry to see this discontinued in local stores. Thank goodness for Amazon. Perfect for those with light or thin brows.</li>
            <li> After ordering, receiving and trying this product for the first time this week, I liked it so much I ordered two more.  Since the reviews give me the impression that this product has been discontinued, I wanted to stock up while I can.  Wish I could count on it being around for awhile.</li>
            <li> Because I need to supplement eyebrows and this product is the best for me.  Would recommend to everyone over pencils.</li>
            <li> I love this product.have used it for years. The color is perfect for my blond brows (lt brown.) I was so happy to find it on Amazon, since it&#x27;s no longer in the stores.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years---makes a more natural  looking eyebrow.</li>
            <li> I think I used a product similar to this years ago but the brush was different and the product went on lighter.  This product went on too heavy and the brush is angled too sharply.  I had to sponge it off.  This isn&#x27;t a good choice for me although the color is good.</li>
            <li> Only problem is moisture removes it.  But the coverage and appearance are perfect.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and was unable to find it in the store, found on Amazon, a little pricey, but happy to get the brow powder!</li>
            <li> Just as expected! Wii do it again next time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyebrow powder in light brown for 14 years and I absolutely love it! I don&#x27;t use the brush it comes with, I wet a cotton qtip and then wet the powder and fill in my eyebrows. I cannot live without it! They recently discontinued it at the store I always shop at so it&#x27;s great to find it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline Ultra-Brow Powder with the little brush most of my life. I really like the way it goes on, and did not want to go to a pencil, etc.. I was very disappointed when I looked in all the stores near me, and  could not find it. I was so delighted when I did find it here.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years. It lasts for years. very natural, better than pencil</li>
            <li> Loved it for years. Turned several friends on to it now they are frantically searching for more. Why would you stop making it? Please reconsider.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is easy to apply and looks very natural as apposed to the pencil brow product.  Lately I have been unable to find in the drug stores, so I was very happy to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured. Happy to be able to get on line as I cannot find in stores!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow enhancer for those of us who have mostly colorless eyebrows.  An eyebrow pencil makes it looks as if&lt;br /&gt; the eyebrow has been drawn on.  This powder product looks the most natural</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for YEARS and am distressed that it is no longer available from the manufacturer.  Don&#x27;t know what I will do when they are all sold out.  Very pricey from this seller but I was over a barrel.</li>
            <li> I have never tried brow pencils or anything so this is perfect. Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> the best eye brow powder  but you charge me to much to ship it . you put it in one bag and I paid twenty five dollars postage  that was more than the eye brow powderI think you should send me a credit or give me some eye brow powder.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t you think that was to high for postage ?&lt;br /&gt;  Margie Renollet&lt;br /&gt;33 Noles Dr&lt;br /&gt;Fairview Height Ill 62208</li>
            <li> just the right shade.  so glad to have it to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> See original review.  It also was 5 stars  sorry posted it incorrectly.</li>
            <li> I wrote a note earlier, but will repeat that this is wonderful brow powder and does a bang up job as an eye shadow for the crease of your eye lid as well. I had breast cancer many many years ago and this was suggested for use when you lost your eyebrows as it didn&#x27;t rub off easily. It was true, it did not rub off easily at all (versus a wax based pencil that could smudge). I&#x27;ve been a fan ever since. My eyebrows grew back, but they&#x27;re just getting thin as I age.This fills in the gaps and gives my brows a more dense look, but invisibly. Most of my friends can&#x27;t tell I fill in my brows with powder unless I&#x27;ve told them.</li>
            <li> This brush on powder is so much easier to use than an eyebrow pencil.  Stays put, and looks good too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and it is very natural and does not look like I penciled my brows in like \\&quot;coloring with a coloring book\\&quot;. It is not fake looking in other words. Glad I found this -hope it is always available.</li>
            <li> Item is discontinued by Maybelline, so very happy I was able to purchase 3 at a reasonable price.  Arrived when stated on time.</li>
