            <li>Feel like I lost a good friend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to locate a product that is more neutral in pH range (6.6-7.2) which is more compatible to the hair and skin.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many a shampoo for fine not so full head of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and curly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s watery and does not leave your hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair shiny and , full of  shine and bounce.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight, fine, oily hair and my skin</li>
            <li>Tape had been wrapped around the top and glad it was because the lid was loose and shampoo filled the tape.  </li>
            <li>have fine straight oily hair, which dries out and breaks fast and easy (not like me).</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price IMO.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any appreciable difference in my hair after use, and the pH of the product tested extremely acidic (4.5),common in shampoos for good subsing, but it will damage the hair long-term.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is good for every other day use.  </li>
            <li>If you are frustrated trying to find a good product that delivers what it says I highly recommend this shampoo and a special benefit it smells great</li>
            <li>I can use this shampoo daily with a very light conditioner or</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve repeated in purchasing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely works!  </li>
            <li>Trustworthy, fast!</li>
            <li>I have used this product but have not been able to find it locally since my beauty salon no longer carries it.  </li>
            <li>I buy the large bottle</li>
            <li>Great for thin, fine hair, I have tried it all but always come back to this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Bought the real item from my hairdresser after I paid to have my highlights redone because this shampoo stripped my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it and wouldn&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t my absolute favorite either but its not strong at all.</li>
            <li>This one leaves my hair clean all day long without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Of course when I want even more volume I will use a mousse and plan on looking at what other products AG offers.</li>
            <li>My hair feels squeaky clean to the point where it dries out because the shampoo has taken off all the natural oils and my hair over compensates by making more oil to the point where after a few hours, my hair is already starting to look oily.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like so much is I seem to use a lot of shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t really lather up very well.</li>
            <li>is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>love product and paid half the price of my local store.</li>
            <li>and I get clean fluffy hair that lasts ALL day.</li>
            <li>I have a prime membership and have enjoyed Amazon immensely until this past year.</li>
            <li>Most volumizing shampoos and conditioners make my hair feel dirty and mucky even right after a shower.</li>
            <li>I have tried and tried to find a volumizing shampoo for my color treated flat straight hair and FINALLY found AG.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to Alterna products since and they tend to be gentler on my fine, thin hair.</li>

            <li> Showed the product to my stylist and she confirmed it is fake or has been tampered with.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I notice that it &amp;#34;volumizes&amp;#34; my thining hair but the other two characteristics have been enough for me to get and use it for years now.</li>
            <li> After you blow dry your hair you wont smell it at all.</li>
            <li> goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a pineapple coconut or something similar, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It does dry out my hair if I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Think wash does not weigh down ny curls or cause frizziness.  </li>
            <li> Quite the mess getting off and then cleaning up the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The reason it&#x27;s volumizing is that it does not clean your hair....</li>
            <li> I use it with the cream rinse and a little of that</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy</li>
            <li> I find my hair getting a little brittle with everyday use.  </li>
            <li> My bottle had leaked all over the box lost half the bottle!</li>
            <li> Also bought the thick rinse  from ag.  </li>
            <li> Smells very intoxicating...strong for those of you who hate smells.</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely, no spilling!</li>
            <li> The smell is not great.</li>
            <li> It makes my thin hair feel a bit fuller.  </li>
            <li> This is a fake.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell is not great. I also noticed that I lost a lot of hair in the shower as I was washing off the shampoo. My hair feels squeaky clean to the point where it dries out because the shampoo has taken off all the natural oils and my hair over compensates by making more oil to the point where after a few hours, my hair is already starting to look oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 4 years.  I have very straight, fine, oily hair and my skin is very sensitive.  My hair looks great with this shampoo and I can go one day without shampooing it.  It doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to flake or get irritated.  I use it with the cream rinse and a little of that goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> love product and paid half the price of my local store.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair.  Found this product in Canada and was very impressed with how much thicker it makes my hair feel.  Much easier to style as well and smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this product, been buying it at the salon. Paying 16.00 for 8 oz, bought 33.8 oz for 34.00 through amazon.  Also bought the thick rinse  from ag.  This product was the same comparison.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  Packaged nicely, no spilling!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any appreciable difference in my hair after use, and the pH of the product tested extremely acidic (4.5),common in shampoos for good subsing, but it will damage the hair long-term.  It&#x27;s best to locate a product that is more neutral in pH range (6.6-7.2) which is more compatible to the hair and skin.  Pureology meets that test, but it is quite a lot more expensive than this product.  Depends on your priority.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the conditioner that goes with it at Ulta. I LOVE it. Most volumizing shampoos and conditioners make my hair feel dirty and mucky even right after a shower. This one leaves my hair clean all day long without drying it out. It is a little pricy but it is totally worth every penny. The only thing I don&#x27;t like so much is I seem to use a lot of shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t really lather up very well. The smell isn&#x27;t my absolute favorite either but its not strong at all. After you blow dry your hair you wont smell it at all. I will definitely be repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> Smells very intoxicating...strong for those of you who hate smells. I love to smell girly, so I had no issues. I&#x27;ve switched to Alterna products since and they tend to be gentler on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years.  I found out about this product through a hair salon I was going to. It is perfect for my hair as I have very fine hair.  This shampoo gives me just the thickness I need . I love it and wouldn&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo by hairdresser uses when I have my hair cut.  I love it.  Thank you for asking..Barbara napper</li>
            <li> dries the hair, just okay product. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo but did not receive a pump to use with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Totally unimpressed with this shampoo...it&#x27;s watery and does not leave your hair feeling clean. The reason it&#x27;s volumizing is that it does not clean your hair....skip it.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for color treated hair. Also has no conditioner in it, which is the way I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair is fine and curly.  This shampoo leaves my hair shiny and , full of  shine and bounce.  Think wash does not weigh down ny curls or cause frizziness.  Thank you AG for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for extremely soft hair. Helps hold curls.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. My hair rinses out well and drys so thikk. This is a great product. I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> My bottle had leaked all over the box lost half the bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many a shampoo for fine not so full head of hair. This is the first one I&#x27;ve repeated in purchasing. It&#x27;s worth the price IMO.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine straight oily hair, which dries out and breaks fast and easy (not like me). I can use this shampoo daily with a very light conditioner or I like the spray in Moroccan oil and I get clean fluffy hair that lasts ALL day.</li>
            <li> wonderful shampoo for hair like mine. I don&#x27;t dread fixing my hair now . It does as they say.</li>
            <li> Love it , great smell &amp; lots of fullness.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tried to find a volumizing shampoo for my color treated flat straight hair and FINALLY found AG. Absolutely works!  Leaves my hair feeling great and I don&#x27;t even have to use mousse or gel to get volume and lift from my roots to the ends. Of course when I want even more volume I will use a mousse and plan on looking at what other products AG offers. If you are frustrated trying to find a good product that delivers what it says I highly recommend this shampoo and a special benefit it smells great</li>
            <li> Great for thin, fine hair, I have tried it all but always come back to this product.  Thikk Rinse is also a great produvct</li>
            <li> This shampoo is good for every other day use.  It does dry out my hair if I use it everyday.  I find my hair getting a little brittle with everyday use.  I love the smell.  It&#x27;s like a pineapple coconut or something similar, but not overwhelming.  I only smell it when I&#x27;m washing my hair, and it disappears after.</li>
            <li> Trustworthy, fast! Great! Would buy again in an instant!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  It makes my thin hair feel a bit fuller.  It also smells terrific.  I&#x27;d recommend this shampoo, along with thik rinse conditioner to anyone who has thin/thinning hair.  I buy the large bottle so it will last me a lot longer than the smaller size bottle.</li>
            <li> Tape had been wrapped around the top and glad it was because the lid was loose and shampoo filled the tape.  Quite the mess getting off and then cleaning up the bottle.  Lost some product.  Also the picture shows the pump dispenser as this is a big bottle and it wasn&#x27;t in the package.  Was dissppointed.</li>
            <li> This is a fake. Bought the real item from my hairdresser after I paid to have my highlights redone because this shampoo stripped my hair. Showed the product to my stylist and she confirmed it is fake or has been tampered with. I have a prime membership and have enjoyed Amazon immensely until this past year. I do not have any suggestions for Amazon to deal with and stop this type of fraud. Feel like I lost a good friend.</li>
            <li> Ever since my hairdresser introduced me to this shampoo, I&#x27;ve been ordering it online and using it. I like the feel it gives my color-treated hair, and I like the scent. I can&#x27;t say I notice that it &amp;#34;volumizes&amp;#34; my thining hair but the other two characteristics have been enough for me to get and use it for years now.</li>
            <li> I have used this product but have not been able to find it locally since my beauty salon no longer carries it.  It is a Canadian product.  It is a volumizing shampoo with a wonderful fragrance.  I just love it.</li>
