            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Herbal Essences for years, and this is probably my favorite kind.</li>
            <li>Smells good, I don&#x27;t feel like my hair gets as clean with this one though.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of it, it is almost like a honey-vanilla to me.</li>
            <li>The bottle has a.ice design and is visually appealing.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and</li>

            <li>Love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>I love my hair SO much more after using this.</li>
            <li>-smells ok, lathers well&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell lovely though .</li>
            <li>Plus love how it smells .</li>
            <li>I thought I had finally found the perfect shampoo on my hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft and smooth, and just looking wonderful.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, to which I haven&#x27;t found an herbal essence shampoo that doesn&#x27;t smell great, but I just particularly found this ones scent amazing.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my hair smell great, feel smooth and also quite strong.</li>
            <li>The color of it reminds me of a light caramel or butterscotch color.</li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; of course helped the overall health of my hair since all Herbal Essences products do!!</li>
            <li>I think this product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good and leaves my hair feelings soft and clean.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite go to shampoo!</li>
            <li>The shampoo also smells delightful, though I&#x27;m not sure the smell is honey per say.</li>
            <li>and my hair is just not getting clean.  </li>
            <li>I thought that maybe it was my conditioner, but I stopped using the shampoo and my hair became clean again.  </li>
            <li>Saddened by the discontinue of Drama Clean.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Tea-Lightfully Clean in that</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the upgrade to Drama Clean, but haven&#x27;t received it yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair feels so clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft, silky and smell great,and I Love the name !</li>
            <li>I always loved Herbal Essences shampoo and this one is no different!</li>
            <li>As for strengthening my hair, I can&#x27;t really ever tell, my hair is fairly strong to begin with.  </li>
            <li>It really adds volume to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite shampoos.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The old formulas from like 10 years ago worked better.</li>
            <li>the price it sells for, the shampoo is definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>Coming out the shower, my hair feels smooth and sleek, more so than when I used Long Term.</li>
            <li>I usually use color me happy</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t as flat anymore, and I feel more confident with my natural hair; I don&#x27;t feel like I have to straighten it or put it up every day.</li>
            <li>Drama Clean is the only shampoo that won&#x27;t just keep hair on the head, but makes it really strong.  </li>
            <li>Most shampoos will actually remove hair along the hairline.  </li>
            <li>If a shampoo will take out my hair, I know it within the first wash.  </li>
            <li>Why are there so many low reviews?</li>
            <li>First I was hesitant about the &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; flavor.</li>
            <li>When I first used the honey</li>
            <li>My hair became so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>but I switched to the long term relationship by herbal essence and it worked 50x better</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this particular Herbal Essences shampoo</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did much for my hair besides</li>
            <li>I Highly Recommend this !</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get a lather going from the shampoo, and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of an effect.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything for my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed it makes my hair really hydrated as well.  </li>
            <li>I was really disapointed</li>
            <li>Works great on thin hair and strengthens it in a matter of days .</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s barely ANY FRIZZ in my hair right now</li>
            <li>I bought a decent sized bottle of this on sale, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s purifying shampoo and keeps, at least my, hair folical clean so hair can grow and get strong.  </li>
            <li>although none really work for my hair anymore, their shampooe&#x27;s where better in the early 90&#x27;s now they weight your hair down.</li>
            <li>Dry, my hair is very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because it has a nicer smell that all the other too strong smelling HE shampoos and cond.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Herbal Essences customer, having used Long Term Relationship for years.</li>
            <li>I was worried that they had discontinued this line, because they&#x27;re always releasing new kinds</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-too many silicones, hair&#x27;s flat and weighted down.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this shampoo but it didn&#x27;t last too long sadly, but besides that, I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to ALL hair types - long, short, curly, straight, wavy.</li>
            <li>it is full of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Not sure that it makes my hair stronger than previous shampoos, but my hair is always nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I like the smell but the perfume does dry my scalp and makes it very irritated and itchy.</li>
            <li>nope...my hair was left extremely dry, brittle and coarse even after I applied a rich deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>anyway, in the mean time, took a chance on Honey, I&#x27;m Strong.  </li>
            <li>I barely need hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I have quite long, normal hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m strong shampoo and conditioner it completely transformed my poofy long thick frizzy wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Straight from the bottle, my roommate mentioned it smelled a little like melon.</li>

            <li> Straight from the bottle, my roommate mentioned it smelled a little like melon.</li>
            <li> I mean it lathers easy, a small amount goes far and it goes to your scalp and refreshes it as well.</li>
            <li> I swim everyday at least once, if not twice, and my hair still is smooth and silky with shine.</li>
            <li> on HR I really want more shampoo choices but not with all the silicones and SUPER FLAT SAD HAIR :(</li>
            <li> she was crying, I had to put her back in the shower and re wash it using my Deep moister shampoo and had to use a deep conditioning treatment ...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair to oily or dry.</li>
            <li> the longer I used it the more I broke out :(</li>
            <li> and if you have treated hair, that is like mine(long, thin and naturally oily)</li>

            <li> This shampoo is definitely one of my faves! I love the scent of it, it is almost like a honey-vanilla to me. The color of it reminds me of a light caramel or butterscotch color. It definitely makes my hair smell great, feel smooth and also quite strong. I always loved Herbal Essences shampoo and this one is no different! I would recommend it to others. I have quite long, normal hair and it works great!</li>
            <li> wonderful shampoo, smells delightful</li>
            <li> I like the smell but the perfume does dry my scalp and makes it very irritated and itchy.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this particular Herbal Essences shampoo and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all. It smells great and my hair feels unbelievably clean afterwards. I have also noticed less breakage when I am brushing my hair.In combination with their conditioner my hair feels, looks and smells.cleaner than with the store brands or 2in1&#x27;s. The bottle has a.ice design and is visually appealing. Wish it was bigger but that&#x27;s just me great product and awesome price thru subscribe and save with prime shipping :)</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this shampoo but it didn&#x27;t last too long sadly, but besides that, I really enjoyed it. I don&#x27;t think it did much for my hair besides make it smell nice.</li>
            <li> I do not like it. my hair become not smoothy after using it. but it is cheap and smells good</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product and the scent is Amazing ! I first bought this on a clearance and Loved it ! It makes my hair feel soft, silky and smell great,and I Love the name ! My hair feels fuller and bouncy after I use it ! I also seem to have less breakage as well ! I Highly Recommend this !</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite shampoos. It leaves my hair smelling great and looking amazing! Since using it, my hair is noticeably shinier and stronger. This is my new favorite go to shampoo! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Smells good, I don&#x27;t feel like my hair gets as clean with this one though. I usually use color me happy</li>
            <li> I love the scent and how great it cleans for the price. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I bought a decent sized bottle of this on sale, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I used it everyday for a week now and my hair is just not getting clean.  I don&#x27;t have oily hair, but the hair on top of my head is just flat out greasy and disgusting looking even though I shampoo with this every day and use it like I do any other shampoo.  I thought that maybe it was my conditioner, but I stopped using the shampoo and my hair became clean again.  I started using it again recently thinking it might be a fluke, but the greasiness started again and I&#x27;m using a completely different conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m just going to throw out the shampoo, since obviously that&#x27;s the problem.  VERY disappointed with the shampoo.  I definitely do NOT recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Herbal Essences for years, and this is probably my favorite kind. It leaves my hair super soft and smooth, and just looking wonderful. I was worried that they had discontinued this line, because they&#x27;re always releasing new kinds and I couldn&#x27;t find it at Target, but they still have it on their site! I highly recommend this to ALL hair types - long, short, curly, straight, wavy. It works wonders for all!</li>
            <li> This is to die for shampoo!!!  Does not strip my hair and leaves it with a nice silky feel!  Thank you Subscribe &amp; Save (with a great coupon too!)</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but that&#x27;s about all. I can&#x27;t get a lather going from the shampoo, and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of an effect. It doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old formulas from like 10 years ago worked better. They must have changed them.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing what else can I say! Great deal as well!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like herbal essences shampoos since my hair is weird and some of there shampoos had made my hair either to dry out to oily in the past but this specific type is awesome,I adore it. Not only does it smell amazing, to which I haven&#x27;t found an herbal essence shampoo that doesn&#x27;t smell great, but I just particularly found this ones scent amazing. It didn&#x27;t make my hair to oily or dry. It is very easy to use and by that I mean it lathers easy, a small amount goes far and it goes to your scalp and refreshes it as well. This I&#x27;d a great shampoo and if you have treated hair, that is like mine(long, thin and naturally oily) you will love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Great price for a good product</li>
            <li> Saddened by the discontinue of Drama Clean.  I have very difficult textured and natured hair.  Most shampoos will actually remove hair along the hairline.  Drama Clean is the only shampoo that won&#x27;t just keep hair on the head, but makes it really strong.  I only imagine it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s purifying shampoo and keeps, at least my, hair folical clean so hair can grow and get strong.  I ordered the Tea-Lightfully Clean in that I think it&#x27;s the upgrade to Drama Clean, but haven&#x27;t received it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, in the mean time, took a chance on Honey, I&#x27;m Strong.  Worked!!  If a shampoo will take out my hair, I know it within the first wash.  Most of my hair is still intact, so I&#x27;m happy!  Smells good and makes my temperamental hair manageable.  I barely need hairspray.  I also love the honey/apricot/cream, smell. :)  Showered hours ago and the shampoo smell is still lingering.  This shampoo is a bottle of wonderful. :)</li>
            <li> Love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel.  It really adds volume to my fine hair.  My hair feels so clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> Why are there so many low reviews? After using this shampoo and conditioner duo, my hair is shiny, strong, bouncy and beautiful. I love my hair SO much more after using this. My hair isn&#x27;t as flat anymore, and I feel more confident with my natural hair; I don&#x27;t feel like I have to straighten it or put it up every day. Used with Pantene BB creme, and Garnier Nutrisse Triple Moisture spray, your hair will be amazing in no time.</li>
            <li> I love the smell , but leaves a weird texture .</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; of course helped the overall health of my hair since all Herbal Essences products do!!</li>
            <li> I think this product is fantastic.  I swim everyday at least once, if not twice, and my hair still is smooth and silky with shine.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Herbal Essences customer, having used Long Term Relationship for years. I found Honey, I&#x27;m Strong and got it for the great price I found it at. Coming out the shower, my hair feels smooth and sleek, more so than when I used Long Term. Dry, my hair is very soft and smooth. The shampoo also smells delightful, though I&#x27;m not sure the smell is honey per say. Straight from the bottle, my roommate mentioned it smelled a little like melon. Regardless, it does smell nice. Herbal Essences also succeeds in creating shampoos that keep hair smelling wonderful for hours. Of the shampoos I&#x27;ve used from Herbal Essences, the scent I use always sticks for a nice amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;For the price it sells for, the shampoo is definitely worth purchasing. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I grabbed this because I can&#x27;t resist things that smell like honey.  I must say it makes my curls nice and shiny and sleek.  There&#x27;s barely ANY FRIZZ in my hair right now and that&#x27;s saying A LOT with my curly mop.  I&#x27;ve noticed people saying that they couldn&#x27;t get the formula to lather, and that&#x27;s quite the opposite for me.  I work this into my hair with nooo problems, but maybe it&#x27;s best suited for curly hair?  I noticed it makes my hair really hydrated as well.  As for strengthening my hair, I can&#x27;t really ever tell, my hair is fairly strong to begin with.  If you&#x27;re in the market for smoothing hair products, give this a go (especially curly heads) and I think you will like it!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that this shampoo didn&#x27;t work well on my hair at all.  It claims to be strengthening and nourishing, but nope...my hair was left extremely dry, brittle and coarse even after I applied a rich deep conditioner.  I could hardly pull the comb through my hair afterwards.  A waste of money and it is full of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because it has a nicer smell that all the other too strong smelling HE shampoos and cond. although none really work for my hair anymore, their shampooe&#x27;s where better in the early 90&#x27;s now they weight your hair down. I was really disapointed I wanted to like this but ti didnt work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-smells ok, lathers well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-too many silicones, hair&#x27;s flat and weighted down. This is not for anyone with thin/fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on HR I really want more shampoo choices but not with all the silicones and SUPER FLAT SAD HAIR :(</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my hair bouncy</li>
            <li> I got this for my Daughter, she has curly hair and I thought I could use it also, we sometimes share, well, I had a nightmare experience when my daughter got out the shower and was trying to comb her hair is was matted and felt like  the hair on a doll! she was crying, I had to put her back in the shower and re wash it using my Deep moister shampoo and had to use a deep conditioning treatment ...I have used some of the lines and not had his happen perhaps it was a just weird reaction with my daughter, she  has thick long wavy hair, so perhaps just not suited to that hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell lovely though .</li>
            <li> Works great on thin hair and strengthens it in a matter of days . Great quality shampoo and leaves your hair shiny also . Plus love how it smells .</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It smells so good and leaves my hair feelings soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Got this when it was on sale. First I was hesitant about the &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; flavor. I don&#x27;t like honey on my fingers let alone my hair. Smells great and my hair feels great in the shower. Definitely a good buy</li>
            <li> Love it - great smell, the bottle is cute.  Not sure that it makes my hair stronger than previous shampoos, but my hair is always nice and soft.</li>
            <li> When I first used the honey I&#x27;m strong shampoo and conditioner it completely transformed my poofy long thick frizzy wavy hair. My hair became so smooth and soft like I had just gotten out of a salon. It didn&#x27;t make my hair too oily or greasy either. And it smells amazing it smells just like warm honey. I thought I had finally found the perfect shampoo on my hair but I begin to notice breakouts on my face and the longer I used it the more I broke out :( I now have acne scars all over my face and I never had this issue with my skin before but I switched to the long term relationship by herbal essence and it worked 50x better and my skin is clearing up again. I went ahead and gave it 4 stars because it did wonders for my hair.</li>
