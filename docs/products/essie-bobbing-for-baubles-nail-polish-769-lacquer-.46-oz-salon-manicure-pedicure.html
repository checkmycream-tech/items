            <li>Definitely a new favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great navy with a slight greyish hue.  </li>
            <li>Long wearing, and such a perfect shade for fall/winter.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries ultra fast.</li>
            <li>The polish lasts for several days and looks really nice on your nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of an ambiguous gray blue color.</li>
            <li>Did not stay on at all, chipped off right away.</li>
            <li>I loved the color although it has a little more of a blue hue than the pictures show.</li>
            <li>I love it and get compliments constantly!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be even better in a few weeks when fall rolls around!</li>
            <li>The color was pretty but not what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want black nails but want a dark color this is the perfect one for you.</li>
            <li>you see when you are searching for a nice dark polish.</li>
            <li>I love dark nail polish do this is right up my alley..</li>
            <li>they sent me to my daughter because it was too much off a headache to exchange.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really need the second coat I did for full coverage,</li>
            <li>It is a little more green then gray but overall a great color.</li>
            <li>it is a mix between dark gray and dark blue, perfect for fall season.</li>
            <li>it only requires two coats and it dries pretty fast!</li>
            <li>My favorite dark polish ever!</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s a lovely navy blue with a hint of grey.  </li>
            <li>Not too dark, not too light.</li>
            <li>Not black but darker than gray.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;not as dark as black but still deep and rich, in my opinion dark is elegant and i would buy again.</li>
            <li>When I use a thick top coat, it last longer.</li>
            <li>And with a good base and top coat, the color stays on for longer than what is average for me.</li>
            <li>I cant tell if this color is a dark blue or blue grey, but I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dark navy, so beautiful and different than the typical dark reds or black</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a dark navy, so beautiful and different than the typical dark reds or black</li>
            <li> Great basic cream finish, dark but not too dark, just enough drama for the cold winter months but still wearable in summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark, but you can still tell that it&#x27;s blue.  </li>
            <li> Not really navy.</li>
            <li> Not really gray.</li>
            <li> With 2 coats, it is dark and not very distinct on your nails, but that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The color was what was pictured but was not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tight wade...</li>
            <li> I was sent a mint green color.  </li>
            <li> I ended up giving the mint green color</li>
            <li> so it was really hard to buy $5 nail polish.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so used to doing at least two coats, so I went ahead and did it.</li>
            <li> Essie polishes are quality and glide on without being too thick or thin, and I never experience bubbling.</li>
            <li> It chips off my nails in 3 days, but not too bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a beautiful charcoal, navy color.  I love it and get compliments constantly!  Essie polishes are quality and glide on without being too thick or thin, and I never experience bubbling.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear it people ask me what color it is! I had bought the mini version and had to order the big one.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I loved the color although it has a little more of a blue hue than the pictures show.</li>

            <li> I love this color - It&#x27;s a lovely navy blue with a hint of grey.  With 2 coats, it is dark and not very distinct on your nails, but that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  If you&#x27;re up close, you can appreciate the blue of the color.</li>
            <li> I love dark nail polish do this is right up my alley..&lt;br /&gt;not as dark as black but still deep and rich, in my opinion dark is elegant and i would buy again.</li>

            <li> This color is great for the Fall/Winter season. The polish lasts for several days and looks really nice on your nails.</li>
            <li> Nice color.  It&#x27;s dark, but you can still tell that it&#x27;s blue.  It chips off my nails in 3 days, but not too bad (I work with my hands a lot, constantly wash dishes and forget to put on gloves)  Can&#x27;t complain.  When I use a thick top coat, it last longer.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful! It&#x27;s kind of an ambiguous gray blue color. Not really navy. Not really gray. However, I find that Essie polishes tend to bubble for me. But for the exquisite color, I&#x27;ll take the bubbles.</li>
            <li> i love love love this color! it is a mix between dark gray and dark blue, perfect for fall season. it only requires two coats and it dries pretty fast! i will stock up on these!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want black nails but want a dark color this is the perfect one for you. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bouoght this to wear in the spring. Sort of mix up the trend towards brights. This did not disappoint. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Essie and LOVE this color.  I will be buying this color again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love the color. Not black but darker than gray. Definitely a new favorite of mine.</li>
