    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Meets my needs perfectly</li>
            <li>Awesome!  </li>
            <li>The mit was an awesome idea.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were impressed!  </li>
            <li>if you want a great tool to make you hair look like you just blew it out today (not yesterday!), I recommend this.</li>
            <li>Gives great volume to hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the brush is great for smoothing out my hair but lackluster at creating waves or adding volume to it.</li>
            <li>Great Styling Bush,</li>
            <li>Great value, thankyou</li>
            <li>All I got from the Revlon Heated Styling Brush is fly away hair.  </li>
            <li>This was a great detangler.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is great for polishing a second-day blowout.</li>
            <li>This gadget isn&#x27;t very handy for straightening purposes.  </li>
            <li>and it works great, although nothing is as good as someone else doing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product for smoothing and flipping.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly compact and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I have it to Good Will.  </li>
            <li>, Revlon&#x27;s Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush might be a very good option to achieve a smooth, face flattering look.</li>
            <li>wonderfully Looked like I had fresh washed and a blowout hair.  </li>
            <li>If anybody has tips or pointers, I&#x27;d love some feedback!</li>
            <li>Works great on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Yes, my hand gets somewhat warm but it doesn&#x27;t burn me.  </li>
            <li>liked--</li>
            <li>liked the form.</li>
            <li>I used it on my blowdried hair, and it smoothed it out nicely.</li>
            <li>This heated styling brush is a nice addition to my hair styling tools.</li>
            <li>It gave the ends of my hair a nice inward curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She has really enjoyed using it and is very satisfied with what it does.</li>
            <li>I loved the way the brush easily flowed through my hair with even the shorter pieces.</li>
            <li>It would have been better to include some kind of stand.</li>
            <li>This styler being as cheap as it is, I can&#x27;t imagine it would have the optimum ion coating....</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I think in the right hands this might be a great tool</li>
            <li>curling iron is a lot wider across at the heated end than most models - about 2 inches or so.</li>
            <li>It would take me more work just to create the curls and volume that I like.</li>
            <li>I bought this at ross for 15.00 and I love it..</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be perfect for the latter, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I DID get curl, but instead of defining or smoothing, I just ended up with more volume,</li>
            <li>This is a product that is best left be and not used in the home.</li>
            <li>This is more of a technique issue than a product issue.</li>
            <li>I was able to plug my hair dryer in one outlet and the brush in the one below it.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t use it for more than 10 minutes..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think those tines would be able to grab the hair like these bristles do.  </li>
            <li>There are many styling brushes out there that would be able to do that.  </li>
            <li>I would guess it would do better for curling.  </li>
            <li>This is heated brush is great if you want straight hair that curls under at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure there are much better products on the market that get the job done.</li>
            <li>I have seen her use a lot of hair products over the years, so for her to be this happy with it really says something.</li>
            <li>Im sure this company has many to choose from.</li>
            <li>I had heard good things from a friend about her heated styling brush, but she&#x27;d paid a lot more money for hers than I was willing to spend.</li>
            <li>For someone more familiar with how a styling brush works and can deal with the lack of temperature control,  it may be okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice for adding volume, but you do have to hold it just right to get the lift where you want it.</li>
            <li>I find it to be suited for longer hair and wider curls, to heat up well, and to be easy to</li>
            <li>They gripped my hair and it was easy to wrap the hair on there with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I have found that it is easy to use for my length.  </li>
            <li>Even in my own hands, it was impossibly hot.</li>
            <li>To me, this will just take up more of the space under the bathroom sink, precious real estate in most homes.  </li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m always trying out new products to make hair look good for days.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d also say, this might be more successful for someone with different hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair</li>
            <li>It features an on/off slider switch and a light to indicate it is powered on.</li>
            <li>This does smooth, but the volume and curling claims are a stretch.</li>
            <li>I just lightly hold my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>When the brush gets to the bottom you just keep rolling it under by cupping your gloved hand lightly over the brush.  </li>
            <li>It works best when your hair is completely dry and straight in order to achieve the type of curls or flips you want.</li>
            <li>Great for women with long hair.  </li>
            <li>I hold on to the top of the brush (which doesn&#x27;t get hot)</li>
            <li>Not my favorite hot tool.</li>
            <li>This Revlon styling brush is great for a quick curl or to add some body to flat hair.</li>
            <li>And, in what world do I need a special glove for my hair appliances?</li>
            <li>Good for straightening my unruly waves and getting them all in the same direction, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a replacement for a curling iron</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother with the glove because the tip is quite cool</li>
            <li>I still want to get my john Frieda hot air brush replaced, but until I do, this will work fine</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does the job.</li>
            <li>i did my hair in under 10 minutes, so I think I&#x27;ll just use this after a quick blowdry from now on if I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li>It heats evenly and quickly, but with no temp control I would be nervous about using it on a youngster.  </li>
            <li>used the glove that came with the brush the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>it also doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>
            <li>styling brush was successful in giving me glass-like shine with minimal heat.  </li>
            <li>It gets very hot and a heatproof glove is included to keep you from burning yourself but there is no control to adjust the temperature</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a reason a heat protecting glove is included, especially if you&#x27;re trying for more curl to your style!</li>
            <li>I plug mine in, wait a minute for it to be warm enough, and then quickly style my hair.</li>
            <li>Being professionally trained may have had something to do with it because even I had noticed the paucity of included instructions so if you are new to such a device, it might be helpful consulting with more experienced friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>My old trusty curling iron can do a lot better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I do have the time to style my hair and want to add nice curls or volume to it, the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to work well enough.</li>
            <li>you have slightly to moderately frizzy hair, this is a nice tool for smoothing the cuticle and flipping under the ends.  </li>
            <li>I brushed through my hair the day after I blew it out, and it gave it a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Other than that it seemed to do a good</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very large diameter, almost 2&amp;#34; as opposed to narrower 1&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li>I would spend a little more money and get a better one.</li>
            <li>brush does generate a tiny bit of static, but since I apply hairspray right afterwards it becomes a moot point.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast, within a minute.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this product and uses it every 2-3 days!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel so hot to me that I need that, because if it did I&#x27;d be worried about frying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this was just ok...</li>
            <li>The brush gets really hot and that is why the glove is provided.</li>
            <li>getting too hot</li>
            <li>Had higher expectations.</li>
            <li>I rarely use it, don&#x27;t see much of a point.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find the brush getting that hot or</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of the better products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Thought this was a hot air brush, bit it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get overly hot for me like some stated..</li>
            <li>The ones that blow hot hair may be better for getting actual curl because you are drying the hair into a curl shape...</li>
            <li>any surface\\&quot; when hot,</li>
            <li>First, the glove.  </li>
            <li>Though the bristles don&#x27;t get hot, you don&#x27;t want to touch them lest you mistakenly touch the ceramic.</li>
            <li>I plugged it in and let it get hot and followed the instructions</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t really seem particularly useful to me.  </li>
            <li>I occasionally use a curling iron for more defined curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and even if I use mousse, gel, etc.; it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair any better or easier than a blow dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li>I will say I wish the instructions had included more information about things like how long you have to let it heat up (if at all) and exactly what the glove is for.</li>
            <li>I currently use a straightener at times, or more likely a curling iron to smooth and/or define curls.</li>
            <li>ceramic barrel gets hot fast.</li>
            <li>The end of the brush stays cool, so it is easy to hold while styling, allowing two handed operation with the other hand on the handle.</li>
            <li>Since I love to blow my hair dry by bending over to give it maximum fluffiness, I just stayed bent overto use this brush.  </li>
            <li>I defiantly think this is geared towards a certain hair type.</li>
            <li>And, it certainly shouldn&#x27;t be packaged at a cut-rate price and sent out into the world.</li>
            <li>It is too large fory hair</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll admit, I don&#x27;t spend much time (any?)</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t get it to really &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>There is only an on/off switch, and a light indicator is lit up when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>to well water strips my color fast</li>
            <li>Because of the bristles on the wand, I really did not have to use the glove at all.</li>
            <li>And as soon as I walk around, it starts teasing up and looking really ratty.  </li>
            <li>Very shiny, glass-like hair, curled under at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>This updated design doesn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li>My hair has a bit of perm left on the bottom which makes it a bit frizzy and this brush works to get it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This just didn&#x27;t fill any real hair care need for me.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that I can either blow-dry straight, or air-dry wavy.</li>
            <li>I let it warm up for just a few minutes on a horizontal metal rack in the bathroom (towels removed) and tend to finish before it gets hotter than what I think my hair can take, although there is always the \\&quot;off\\&quot; switch.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the size of the hot cylinder, this brush cannot be used for tight curls - it is really designed more for more loose curls, or waves.</li>
            <li>The curling iron is wider than most other heated styling brushes, so that is a plus.  </li>
            <li>but then I&#x27;m used to those extreme heat curling wands that always burn me so this was ok for me.</li>
            <li>Or, better yet, consider your other options.</li>
            <li>: One thing I gleaned from reading other reviews is that you are probably going to need to use the included heat resistant glove because it appears to get a lot hotter than many are used to.</li>
            <li>Styling a section of hair too many times can eventually cause heat damage so be very careful, It also comes with a glove to protect yourself from burning your hand.</li>
            <li>If you have thinner or straight hair, I think this would do a decent job of giving you volume.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m still not sure</li>
            <li>If you are buying this for a young person, please beware that this becomes unbelievably hot and lacks a temperature control.</li>
            <li>I vacillated between a 3 and 4 star review and ultimately gave the Heated Styling Brush 4 stars because it&#x27;s not a bad product.  </li>
            <li>I find it nice and useful since it heats up quickly to smooth out the crazy hair look in the morning when I don&#x27;t have much time to spare on a normal workday.</li>
            <li>I just grab some hair by the bottom, put the brush underneath the hair at the top of my head, then slide it down, pulling the hair taught with my gloved hand.  </li>
            <li>However, it still ended up more with volume than smoothing and a slight curl, which is what I tried with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, there is no temperature control so it can get hot; hot enough that a heat-resistant glove is provided.</li>
            <li>can only advise extraordinary caution.</li>
            <li>The main problem I have with it:  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Revlon Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush for your hair or for someone else&#x27;s  hair in your house.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this styling brush.  </li>
            <li>can get some really nice waves and body from this brush, and as I said, I hardly know what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>on my hair in the morning, so this is all new to me.</li>
            <li>My hoy air brush burned out on me, and I ran to the corner store to buy a new one..</li>
            <li>You really do need to have a top piece to clamp down on the hair, like a traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li>If you own a round brush and a hair dryer you can achieve the same results as the heated styling brush, so that&#x27;s why I was leaning towards 3 stars, but that&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You would have to blow dry the hair straight first.  </li>
            <li>Your hair definitely has to be dry before using this, so you better have time to first blow dry, then style.  </li>
            <li>With the bulky design of the cylinder, it is harder to lay down (safely) than a more conventional design.</li>
            <li>My daughter has super long hair (all the way down her back) and she enjoyed using this styling brush to smooth out some waves and give a little curl at the bottom of her hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually easier that way because all your hair is hanging down free, away from your head!  </li>
            <li>Remington NEW Wet 2 Straight Ceramic Hair Straightener with 2\\&quot; Inch Ceramic Plates, All NEW Steam Vent Technology, Fast Heat Up &amp; Swivel Cord]]  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After two tries, two very VERY hot hands, and some crispy ends</li>
            <li>You can get slight curls, but it requires a lot more wrangling than a simple curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike a traditional curling iron, the brush grips individual hairs, so if you turn it under (or over) and wrap it to curl, it might NOT want to let go, and you&#x27;ll need that glove to untangle your hair from the very hot brush.</li>
            <li>Using those products means I can&#x27;t skip a day in washing my hair because it is super flat and greasy the second day.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long layered hair and don&#x27;t like to wash hair but every 3 days do</li>
            <li>Still, this one seems reasonably protective against BRIEF inadvertent contact with the heated core of the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since my definition of \\&quot;hair styling\\&quot; involves using the cheapest haircut coupon, I delegated the testing of this to a couple of friends who are professional hair stylists....</li>
            <li>My long, straight hair (a few inches past my shoulders) does great with this styling brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d think those with thick or curly hair would have even more issue with this.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no way you can make actual curls in your hair, as it does not get that hot, but hey....the less heat, the better condition your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just slightly bulky but heats up quickly and works well for smoothing or adding volume/waves to your hair.</li>
            <li>I found that the &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; glove was less than adequate - my fingers were still burning through the glove.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, the two pronged plug is attached to a very long cord which attaches to the brush handle via a swivel.  </li>
            <li>I like a 10 or 12 foot cord which you normally only see on high end products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not much use for precision curling, but this brush is a good cheap rescue tool for Bad Hair Day when there otherwise isn&#x27;t time to re-style.</li>
            <li>This curling \\&quot;styling brush\\&quot; looked different from the normal \\&quot;iron\\&quot;, so I ordered it to check out the design.</li>
            <li>:  I have very porous hair that takes forever to dry and is frizzy.  </li>
            <li>If you have ethnic ringlets or super-frizz, this tool likely does not have enough heat to take you from ringlets to straight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked slightly better on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is thick, but not as wavy or coarse.</li>
            <li>I had a very old curling iron that finally gave out and this was to replace it.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going for style, normally I&#x27;ll either get a blow out (if I have time and cash) or use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>At a $15ish price point, you can&#x27;t expect much out of a curling product, so be careful while using it.</li>
            <li>My usual routine is wash and air dry, or at the most a low heat blow dry with a round brush to smooth any frizz.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s first experience with the Revlon Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush was less than satisfactory.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and while the heated styling brush works well to simply brush through it slowly for smoothing with a slight turn under at the ends, I ripped out a few hairs trying to untangle it when I tried to make more of a wave or curl.</li>
            <li>Other than the ends of our hair having a oh-so-slight bend, this product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>So you only use it to protect your hand as you barely coax the hair around the brush.  </li>
            <li>I will say that they had a Hot Tools brush that had hard plastic tines instead of the soft plastic bristles on this tool.  </li>
            <li>It was rough, had internal snags, and was very uncomfortable, so I was happy to not need to use the knit accessory.  </li>
            <li>The glove it ships with does very little to protect your hands because it&#x27;s little more than a loofah glove, so don&#x27;t let the iron sit for too long before use.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Gives great volume to hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the brush is great for smoothing out my hair but lackluster at creating waves or adding volume to it.</li>
            <li> Great Styling Bush,</li>
            <li> Great value, thankyou</li>
            <li> All I got from the Revlon Heated Styling Brush is fly away hair.  </li>
            <li> This was a great detangler.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is great for polishing a second-day blowout.</li>
            <li> This gadget isn&#x27;t very handy for straightening purposes.  </li>
            <li> and it works great, although nothing is as good as someone else doing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good product for smoothing and flipping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly compact and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I have it to Good Will.  </li>
            <li> , Revlon&#x27;s Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush might be a very good option to achieve a smooth, face flattering look.</li>
            <li> wonderfully Looked like I had fresh washed and a blowout hair.  </li>
            <li> If anybody has tips or pointers, I&#x27;d love some feedback!</li>
            <li> Works great on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, my hand gets somewhat warm but it doesn&#x27;t burn me.  </li>
            <li> liked--</li>
            <li> liked the form.</li>
            <li> I used it on my blowdried hair, and it smoothed it out nicely.</li>
            <li> This heated styling brush is a nice addition to my hair styling tools.</li>
            <li> It gave the ends of my hair a nice inward curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has really enjoyed using it and is very satisfied with what it does.</li>
            <li> I loved the way the brush easily flowed through my hair with even the shorter pieces.</li>
            <li> It would have been better to include some kind of stand.</li>
            <li> This styler being as cheap as it is, I can&#x27;t imagine it would have the optimum ion coating....</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I think in the right hands this might be a great tool</li>
            <li> curling iron is a lot wider across at the heated end than most models - about 2 inches or so.</li>
            <li> It would take me more work just to create the curls and volume that I like.</li>
            <li> I bought this at ross for 15.00 and I love it..</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be perfect for the latter, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I DID get curl, but instead of defining or smoothing, I just ended up with more volume,</li>
            <li> This is a product that is best left be and not used in the home.</li>
            <li> This is more of a technique issue than a product issue.</li>
            <li> I was able to plug my hair dryer in one outlet and the brush in the one below it.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t use it for more than 10 minutes..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think those tines would be able to grab the hair like these bristles do.  </li>
            <li> There are many styling brushes out there that would be able to do that.  </li>
            <li> I would guess it would do better for curling.  </li>
            <li> This is heated brush is great if you want straight hair that curls under at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sure there are much better products on the market that get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have seen her use a lot of hair products over the years, so for her to be this happy with it really says something.</li>
            <li> Im sure this company has many to choose from.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things from a friend about her heated styling brush, but she&#x27;d paid a lot more money for hers than I was willing to spend.</li>
            <li> For someone more familiar with how a styling brush works and can deal with the lack of temperature control,  it may be okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice for adding volume, but you do have to hold it just right to get the lift where you want it.</li>
            <li> I find it to be suited for longer hair and wider curls, to heat up well, and to be easy to</li>
            <li> They gripped my hair and it was easy to wrap the hair on there with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I have found that it is easy to use for my length.  </li>
            <li> Even in my own hands, it was impossibly hot.</li>
            <li> To me, this will just take up more of the space under the bathroom sink, precious real estate in most homes.  </li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m always trying out new products to make hair look good for days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d also say, this might be more successful for someone with different hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair</li>
            <li> It features an on/off slider switch and a light to indicate it is powered on.</li>
            <li> This does smooth, but the volume and curling claims are a stretch.</li>
            <li> I just lightly hold my hair in place.  </li>
            <li> When the brush gets to the bottom you just keep rolling it under by cupping your gloved hand lightly over the brush.  </li>
            <li> It works best when your hair is completely dry and straight in order to achieve the type of curls or flips you want.</li>
            <li> Great for women with long hair.  </li>
            <li> I hold on to the top of the brush (which doesn&#x27;t get hot)</li>
            <li> Not my favorite hot tool.</li>
            <li> This Revlon styling brush is great for a quick curl or to add some body to flat hair.</li>
            <li> And, in what world do I need a special glove for my hair appliances?</li>
            <li> Good for straightening my unruly waves and getting them all in the same direction, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a replacement for a curling iron</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother with the glove because the tip is quite cool</li>
            <li> I still want to get my john Frieda hot air brush replaced, but until I do, this will work fine</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does the job.</li>
            <li> i did my hair in under 10 minutes, so I think I&#x27;ll just use this after a quick blowdry from now on if I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> It heats evenly and quickly, but with no temp control I would be nervous about using it on a youngster.  </li>
            <li> used the glove that came with the brush the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> it also doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>
            <li> styling brush was successful in giving me glass-like shine with minimal heat.  </li>
            <li> It gets very hot and a heatproof glove is included to keep you from burning yourself but there is no control to adjust the temperature</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a reason a heat protecting glove is included, especially if you&#x27;re trying for more curl to your style!</li>
            <li> I plug mine in, wait a minute for it to be warm enough, and then quickly style my hair.</li>
            <li> Being professionally trained may have had something to do with it because even I had noticed the paucity of included instructions so if you are new to such a device, it might be helpful consulting with more experienced friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> My old trusty curling iron can do a lot better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I do have the time to style my hair and want to add nice curls or volume to it, the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to work well enough.</li>
            <li> you have slightly to moderately frizzy hair, this is a nice tool for smoothing the cuticle and flipping under the ends.  </li>
            <li> I brushed through my hair the day after I blew it out, and it gave it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Other than that it seemed to do a good</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a very large diameter, almost 2&amp;#34; as opposed to narrower 1&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> I would spend a little more money and get a better one.</li>
            <li> brush does generate a tiny bit of static, but since I apply hairspray right afterwards it becomes a moot point.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very fast, within a minute.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this product and uses it every 2-3 days!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel so hot to me that I need that, because if it did I&#x27;d be worried about frying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this was just ok...</li>
            <li> The brush gets really hot and that is why the glove is provided.</li>
            <li> getting too hot</li>
            <li> Had higher expectations.</li>
            <li> I rarely use it, don&#x27;t see much of a point.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the brush getting that hot or</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely one of the better products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Thought this was a hot air brush, bit it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get overly hot for me like some stated..</li>
            <li> The ones that blow hot hair may be better for getting actual curl because you are drying the hair into a curl shape...</li>
            <li> any surface\\&quot; when hot,</li>
            <li> First, the glove.  </li>
            <li> Though the bristles don&#x27;t get hot, you don&#x27;t want to touch them lest you mistakenly touch the ceramic.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in and let it get hot and followed the instructions</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t really seem particularly useful to me.  </li>
            <li> I occasionally use a curling iron for more defined curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and even if I use mousse, gel, etc.; it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair any better or easier than a blow dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li> I will say I wish the instructions had included more information about things like how long you have to let it heat up (if at all) and exactly what the glove is for.</li>
            <li> I currently use a straightener at times, or more likely a curling iron to smooth and/or define curls.</li>
            <li> ceramic barrel gets hot fast.</li>
            <li> The end of the brush stays cool, so it is easy to hold while styling, allowing two handed operation with the other hand on the handle.</li>
            <li> Since I love to blow my hair dry by bending over to give it maximum fluffiness, I just stayed bent overto use this brush.  </li>
            <li> I defiantly think this is geared towards a certain hair type.</li>
            <li> And, it certainly shouldn&#x27;t be packaged at a cut-rate price and sent out into the world.</li>
            <li> It is too large fory hair</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll admit, I don&#x27;t spend much time (any?)</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t get it to really &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> There is only an on/off switch, and a light indicator is lit up when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> to well water strips my color fast</li>
            <li> Because of the bristles on the wand, I really did not have to use the glove at all.</li>
            <li> And as soon as I walk around, it starts teasing up and looking really ratty.  </li>
            <li> Very shiny, glass-like hair, curled under at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> This updated design doesn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li> My hair has a bit of perm left on the bottom which makes it a bit frizzy and this brush works to get it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t fill any real hair care need for me.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that I can either blow-dry straight, or air-dry wavy.</li>
            <li> I let it warm up for just a few minutes on a horizontal metal rack in the bathroom (towels removed) and tend to finish before it gets hotter than what I think my hair can take, although there is always the \\&quot;off\\&quot; switch.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the size of the hot cylinder, this brush cannot be used for tight curls - it is really designed more for more loose curls, or waves.</li>
            <li> The curling iron is wider than most other heated styling brushes, so that is a plus.  </li>
            <li> but then I&#x27;m used to those extreme heat curling wands that always burn me so this was ok for me.</li>
            <li> Or, better yet, consider your other options.</li>
            <li> : One thing I gleaned from reading other reviews is that you are probably going to need to use the included heat resistant glove because it appears to get a lot hotter than many are used to.</li>
            <li> Styling a section of hair too many times can eventually cause heat damage so be very careful, It also comes with a glove to protect yourself from burning your hand.</li>
            <li> If you have thinner or straight hair, I think this would do a decent job of giving you volume.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m still not sure</li>
            <li> If you are buying this for a young person, please beware that this becomes unbelievably hot and lacks a temperature control.</li>
            <li> I vacillated between a 3 and 4 star review and ultimately gave the Heated Styling Brush 4 stars because it&#x27;s not a bad product.  </li>
            <li> I find it nice and useful since it heats up quickly to smooth out the crazy hair look in the morning when I don&#x27;t have much time to spare on a normal workday.</li>
            <li> I just grab some hair by the bottom, put the brush underneath the hair at the top of my head, then slide it down, pulling the hair taught with my gloved hand.  </li>
            <li> However, it still ended up more with volume than smoothing and a slight curl, which is what I tried with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, there is no temperature control so it can get hot; hot enough that a heat-resistant glove is provided.</li>
            <li> can only advise extraordinary caution.</li>
            <li> The main problem I have with it:  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Revlon Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush for your hair or for someone else&#x27;s  hair in your house.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this styling brush.  </li>
            <li> can get some really nice waves and body from this brush, and as I said, I hardly know what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> on my hair in the morning, so this is all new to me.</li>
            <li> My hoy air brush burned out on me, and I ran to the corner store to buy a new one..</li>
            <li> You really do need to have a top piece to clamp down on the hair, like a traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li> If you own a round brush and a hair dryer you can achieve the same results as the heated styling brush, so that&#x27;s why I was leaning towards 3 stars, but that&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You would have to blow dry the hair straight first.  </li>
            <li> Your hair definitely has to be dry before using this, so you better have time to first blow dry, then style.  </li>
            <li> With the bulky design of the cylinder, it is harder to lay down (safely) than a more conventional design.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super long hair (all the way down her back) and she enjoyed using this styling brush to smooth out some waves and give a little curl at the bottom of her hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually easier that way because all your hair is hanging down free, away from your head!  </li>
            <li> Remington NEW Wet 2 Straight Ceramic Hair Straightener with 2\\&quot; Inch Ceramic Plates, All NEW Steam Vent Technology, Fast Heat Up &amp; Swivel Cord]]  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After two tries, two very VERY hot hands, and some crispy ends</li>
            <li> You can get slight curls, but it requires a lot more wrangling than a simple curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike a traditional curling iron, the brush grips individual hairs, so if you turn it under (or over) and wrap it to curl, it might NOT want to let go, and you&#x27;ll need that glove to untangle your hair from the very hot brush.</li>
            <li> Using those products means I can&#x27;t skip a day in washing my hair because it is super flat and greasy the second day.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty long layered hair and don&#x27;t like to wash hair but every 3 days do</li>
            <li> Still, this one seems reasonably protective against BRIEF inadvertent contact with the heated core of the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since my definition of \\&quot;hair styling\\&quot; involves using the cheapest haircut coupon, I delegated the testing of this to a couple of friends who are professional hair stylists....</li>
            <li> My long, straight hair (a few inches past my shoulders) does great with this styling brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d think those with thick or curly hair would have even more issue with this.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no way you can make actual curls in your hair, as it does not get that hot, but hey....the less heat, the better condition your hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just slightly bulky but heats up quickly and works well for smoothing or adding volume/waves to your hair.</li>
            <li> I found that the &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; glove was less than adequate - my fingers were still burning through the glove.  </li>
            <li> On a positive note, the two pronged plug is attached to a very long cord which attaches to the brush handle via a swivel.  </li>
            <li> I like a 10 or 12 foot cord which you normally only see on high end products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not much use for precision curling, but this brush is a good cheap rescue tool for Bad Hair Day when there otherwise isn&#x27;t time to re-style.</li>
            <li> This curling \\&quot;styling brush\\&quot; looked different from the normal \\&quot;iron\\&quot;, so I ordered it to check out the design.</li>
            <li> :  I have very porous hair that takes forever to dry and is frizzy.  </li>
            <li> If you have ethnic ringlets or super-frizz, this tool likely does not have enough heat to take you from ringlets to straight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked slightly better on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is thick, but not as wavy or coarse.</li>
            <li> I had a very old curling iron that finally gave out and this was to replace it.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going for style, normally I&#x27;ll either get a blow out (if I have time and cash) or use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> At a $15ish price point, you can&#x27;t expect much out of a curling product, so be careful while using it.</li>
            <li> My usual routine is wash and air dry, or at the most a low heat blow dry with a round brush to smooth any frizz.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s first experience with the Revlon Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush was less than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, and while the heated styling brush works well to simply brush through it slowly for smoothing with a slight turn under at the ends, I ripped out a few hairs trying to untangle it when I tried to make more of a wave or curl.</li>
            <li> Other than the ends of our hair having a oh-so-slight bend, this product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> So you only use it to protect your hand as you barely coax the hair around the brush.  </li>
            <li> I will say that they had a Hot Tools brush that had hard plastic tines instead of the soft plastic bristles on this tool.  </li>
            <li> It was rough, had internal snags, and was very uncomfortable, so I was happy to not need to use the knit accessory.  </li>
            <li> The glove it ships with does very little to protect your hands because it&#x27;s little more than a loofah glove, so don&#x27;t let the iron sit for too long before use.</li>
            <li> Rollers work best, but I hate the uneven kinks</li>
            <li> There is no stand included, so I had to carefully lay it down towards the sink, or the hot end would rest on the counter.</li>
            <li> In other words the wide side makes it faster because you are grabbing large pieces of hair.  </li>
            <li> The Revlon Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush left my wife&#x27;s hair looking flat and unflattering.</li>
            <li> It also is pretty useless for adding curl, or even much body.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this for moderate use of medium to long hair styles.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s straight or just a little wavy, and you don&#x27;t wash and blow dry it every day</li>
            <li> If I blow it dry, it is nicely straight and fluffy, but the ends are unfinished.  </li>
            <li> The cord is plenty long enough for maneuvering around your head (and I&#x27;m tall).</li>
            <li> I then bought a flat iron and basically ruined my hair since I don&#x27;t like to use the requisite thermal protection products that you need to protect your hair.  </li>
            <li> Finally, and this is all me and not the brush, I am used to an iron and trying to use a brush on my long hair ended up with it tangled in my hair.  </li>
            <li> think it wasn&#x27;t hot enough or perhaps thin enough.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always looking for new ways to tame it.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, static electricity went crazy.  </li>
            <li> My long hair gets all snarled in the brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not patient enough for careful styling with heat products</li>
            <li> I received this a week or so ago and tried it out on my granddaughters long hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really do not like about this styling brush is that there are no heat controls.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair except where it has turned gray-- in the front and sides.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use a plain old fashioned curling iron and blow dryer, and maybe a straightener if I needed one.  </li>
            <li> my hair seemed to dry out if I used it too long.  </li>
            <li> is the same look as a  flat iron but having used less heat.  </li>
            <li> This needs to be used on dry hair and</li>
            <li> This will do nothing to help dry the hair.  </li>
            <li> I woke up on third day and hair was looking messy and frizzy used this just to kinda straighten and flip back</li>
            <li> I tried very small sections of hair, bigger sections, just the ends, all of the hair, and it was a complete flop.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair (the bane of my existence), and this really flufffed up and made my hair look thicker!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a bad product.....</li>
            <li> This Revlon Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush is something I&#x27;m using just to tame the hair a bit and coax the waves into taking the general shape</li>
            <li> basically &amp;#34;teases&amp;#34; itself into a big ball of a mess.  </li>
            <li> Because of the wide size, this brush is for loose curls.  </li>
            <li> If I let it air dry, it drys in big uneven wavy tangles.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to hold my finger on it without burning myself, but it is not as hot as a curling or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This heated styling brush is great for smoothing out weird lumps of hair that are going crazy.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive way to add body, but be careful of burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not work well on wet hair at all.</li>
            <li> And I barely spent 5 minutes using it.  </li>
            <li> and I had to be careful not to burn</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to have spent my money on this product.  </li>
            <li> but as I found it impossible to leave the brush levitating in the air, I left it to cool on the above-mentioned towel rack with horizontal aluminum bars.  </li>
            <li> THe heatproof glove is a little bit of a strange addition</li>
            <li> /&gt;About the included glove: a truly heat resistant glove would likely be more expensive to manufacture, and possibly awkward to use due to the thickness of traditional heat insulators like rubber or silicone.  </li>
            <li> The design uses  small bristles surrounding a metal cage with the heating element separated from the rest in the middle of the cylinder.</li>
            <li> can be pretty scary for someone with a LOT of fine-textured hair with pronounced frizzing</li>
            <li> And, of course, with temperatures this extreme and uncontrollable, one wonders what type of damage is being done to one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think usage from the root area to the tips of hair might add a bit of volume and straighten the hair a bit, but there are other heated appliances that do that job, along with curl.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this brush does not have a temperature control and it got extremely hot</li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder length hair that typically holds curls for days, but this heated brush produced limp, flat, barely there</li>
            <li> This is my new secret gem styling tool to freshen up my not washed hair.  </li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the design was that it is hard to set down.</li>
            <li> I have medium coarse, thick wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re not an expect, for thick hair, it can only exacerbate existent problems.</li>
            <li> Besides the end result was less than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> but i keep losing bristles in my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> You just don&#x27;t have the pointy-striaght ends that you get when you don&#x27;t use a round brush when your hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So all in all, it works as described, but I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy it since the round brush/hair dryer approach already does the trick.</li>
            <li> (like I do with a round brush when I blow-dry).</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush was heavy and hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> It is about 2 inches past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> There is a weak hanging loop as well if you find that you need to display or store this very pink tool that way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use this styling tool only occasionally on seriously bad hair days when I have limited time to get out-the-door...</li>
            <li> Besides, the glove is not a very good one.</li>
            <li> It did become hot, but since I did not touch the base of the brush, I did not need to use the enclosed glove which had a note inside it</li>
            <li> tried this for curls, and it was honestly hard to figure out.</li>
            <li> I did not find that the glove stuck to my hair, as others complained about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the glove is even included, it does absolutely no good, and it makes using the product really clumsy and unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no funny business with a crazy cord that you have trouble plugging in.</li>
            <li> The chance of inadvertent burn is too serious.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and hard to style.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are a little scratchy but nothing too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, somewhat wavy should length hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> Even worse it burned her while she was using it.</li>
            <li> With a simple on/off switch, I waited for the ceramic base to heat, then used the brush on my hair as indicated by the instruction manual.  </li>
            <li> This is a poor design.  </li>
            <li> Nobody else wanted to try it because they thought the bristles were too sharp and painful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this brush does nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> In hasty hands, it could be dangerous.</li>
            <li> I think the lack of temperature control was a very bad idea.</li>

            <li> This curling \\&quot;styling brush\\&quot; looked different from the normal \\&quot;iron\\&quot;, so I ordered it to check out the design. I find it to be suited for longer hair and wider curls, to heat up well, and to be easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron is a lot wider across at the heated end than most models - about 2 inches or so. The design uses  small bristles surrounding a metal cage with the heating element separated from the rest in the middle of the cylinder. It heats up very fast, within a minute. The end of the brush stays cool, so it is easy to hold while styling, allowing two handed operation with the other hand on the handle. It features an on/off slider switch and a light to indicate it is powered on. They include an insulated glove, although I found I didn&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the size of the hot cylinder, this brush cannot be used for tight curls - it is really designed more for more loose curls, or waves. Other than that it seemed to do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the design was that it is hard to set down. There is no stand included, so I had to carefully lay it down towards the sink, or the hot end would rest on the counter. With the bulky design of the cylinder, it is harder to lay down (safely) than a more conventional design. It would have been better to include some kind of stand. Of course, you can lay it on the insulated glove - maybe that is why it is included!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: If you need wider curls, this might be the choice for you. Recommended for this use.</li>
            <li> I like the glove, prevents burning of hands.  Gives great volume to hair.  I have thin hair (the bane of my existence), and this really flufffed up and made my hair look thicker!  The curling iron is wider than most other heated styling brushes, so that is a plus.  In other words the wide side makes it faster because you are grabbing large pieces of hair.  Because of the wide size, this brush is for loose curls.  Great for women with long hair.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this product and uses it every 2-3 days!</li>
            <li> I had heard good things from a friend about her heated styling brush, but she&#x27;d paid a lot more money for hers than I was willing to spend. Now I&#x27;ll admit, I don&#x27;t spend much time (any?) on my hair in the morning, so this is all new to me. First off, I&#x27;m not sure what the glove is for. I hold on to the top of the brush (which doesn&#x27;t get hot) but I assume it&#x27;s for getting the hair on the brush? It doesn&#x27;t feel so hot to me that I need that, because if it did I&#x27;d be worried about frying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can get some really nice waves and body from this brush, and as I said, I hardly know what I&#x27;m doing. Good for straightening my unruly waves and getting them all in the same direction, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a replacement for a curling iron (I can&#x27;t get it to really &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; anything). I will say I wish the instructions had included more information about things like how long you have to let it heat up (if at all) and exactly what the glove is for.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this curling iron but I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck getting the desired results out of it.  I think the addition of the heat proof glove is genius.  My long hair gets all snarled in the brush and I do not achieve curls.  I may be doing something wrong and I will take it to my stylist next time I go and see if she can instruct me for better results.  If so, I will revise this review.  Meanwhile, I think in the right hands this might be a great tool but my hands don&#x27;t seem to get the concept.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. Meets my needs perfectly</li>
            <li> Not my favorite hot tool. This does smooth, but the volume and curling claims are a stretch. I have thick, shoulder length hair that typically holds curls for days, but this heated brush produced limp, flat, barely there waves that my sister described as, &amp;#34;like you tried to curl your hair but your hair refused.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t think this a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> I vacillated between a 3 and 4 star review and ultimately gave the Heated Styling Brush 4 stars because it&#x27;s not a bad product.  If you own a round brush and a hair dryer you can achieve the same results as the heated styling brush, so that&#x27;s why I was leaning towards 3 stars, but that&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the glove that came with the brush the very first time I used it.  It protected my hand from the heat.  Awesome!  But - the materials kept getting snagged on the wiry bristles of the brush.  Boo!  So now I just use the heated styling brush without the glove.  Yes, my hand gets somewhat warm but it doesn&#x27;t burn me.  I just lightly hold my hair in place.  Not a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does generate a tiny bit of static, but since I apply hairspray right afterwards it becomes a moot point.  The heated styling brush gives just the slightest turn to the bottom of the hair.  You won&#x27;t get curls - that is not the point of this brush.  You just don&#x27;t have the pointy-striaght ends that you get when you don&#x27;t use a round brush when your hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, it works as described, but I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy it since the round brush/hair dryer approach already does the trick.</li>
            <li> The heated ceramic part is about 1.5&amp;#34; in diameter and 3.75&amp;#34; in length. It heats up quickly. However, there is no temperature control so it can get hot; hot enough that a heat-resistant glove is provided. There is only an on/off switch, and a light indicator is lit up when it&#x27;s on. It is also dual, worldwide voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the brush is great for smoothing out my hair but lackluster at creating waves or adding volume to it. It would take me more work just to create the curls and volume that I like. My old trusty curling iron can do a lot better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have a mixed feeling about this heated styling brush. I find it nice and useful since it heats up quickly to smooth out the crazy hair look in the morning when I don&#x27;t have much time to spare on a normal workday. When I do have the time to style my hair and want to add nice curls or volume to it, the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to work well enough. Besides, the glove is not a very good one. I still get burned when I have it on.</li>
            <li> Short Attention Span Review: Inexpensive way to add body, but be careful of burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longer review: This Revlon styling brush is great for a quick curl or to add some body to flat hair. At a $15ish price point, you can&#x27;t expect much out of a curling product, so be careful while using it. There is no way to adjust the heat and no auto-off feature. I plug mine in, wait a minute for it to be warm enough, and then quickly style my hair. The glove it ships with does very little to protect your hands because it&#x27;s little more than a loofah glove, so don&#x27;t let the iron sit for too long before use.</li>
            <li> Well let me start off by saying that this is a heat styling brush and not meant to be used as a blow dryer. It does not work well on wet hair at all. It works best when your hair is completely dry and straight in order to achieve the type of curls or flips you want. This styling tool is very simple to use, you plug it in, turn it on and get to styling. There are no heat setting on this at all. Styling a section of hair too many times can eventually cause heat damage so be very careful, It also comes with a glove to protect yourself from burning your hand. Overall, I think this was just ok...I defiantly think this is geared towards a certain hair type.</li>
            <li> I think the lack of temperature control was a very bad idea. I have thick straight hair except where it has turned gray-- in the front and sides.  Gray hair (whether you color it or not) has a different consistency than regular hair and I had to use the styling brush for longer than I liked-- my hair seemed to dry out if I used it too long.  The brush gets really hot and that is why the glove is provided. I would suggest that Revlon ditch the glove and put in a thermostat.</li>
            <li> I bought this at ross for 15.00 and I love it.. I have pretty long layered hair and don&#x27;t like to wash hair but every 3 days do to well water strips my color fast so i&#x27;m always trying out new products to make hair look good for days.  I woke up on third day and hair was looking messy and frizzy used this just to kinda straighten and flip back and it worked wonderfully Looked like I had fresh washed and a blowout hair.  This is my new secret gem styling tool to freshen up my not washed hair.  I didn&#x27;t Have any issues with it getting too hot but then I&#x27;m used to those extreme heat curling wands that always burn me so this was ok for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl hair, just straightens, which I thought it would do both.</li>
            <li> I have medium coarse, thick wavy/curly hair. I currently use a straightener at times, or more likely a curling iron to smooth and/or define curls. I thought this product would be perfect for the latter, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it wasn&#x27;t hot enough or perhaps thin enough. I DID get curl, but instead of defining or smoothing, I just ended up with more volume, which I do not need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked slightly better on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is thick, but not as wavy or coarse. However, it still ended up more with volume than smoothing and a slight curl, which is what I tried with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I DID LIKE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the form. Because of the bristles on the wand, I really did not have to use the glove at all. They gripped my hair and it was easy to wrap the hair on there with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to create volume this might just be the product for you.</li>
            <li> Had higher expectations. I rarely use it, don&#x27;t see much of a point.  I have fine hair and even if I use mousse, gel, etc.; it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair any better or easier than a blow dryer and round brush. If anybody has tips or pointers, I&#x27;d love some feedback!</li>
            <li> This brush had a learning curve for me to know how to make curls.  I have medium length hair so I have found that it is easy to use for my length.  It will make curls, give your hair body.  Maybe if you have curly hair and want to straighten your hair, then you can with this Ceramic, ion styling brush.  I highly recommend this Revlon Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush for your hair or for someone else&#x27;s  hair in your house.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s first experience with the Revlon Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush was less than satisfactory. The brush was heavy and hard to maneuver. Even worse it burned her while she was using it. Whether this was a result of a design issue or a mistake she made, no product should be so risky to use. Besides the end result was less than satisfactory. The Revlon Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush left my wife&#x27;s hair looking flat and unflattering. This is a product that is best left be and not used in the home.</li>
            <li> This heated styling brush is great for smoothing out weird lumps of hair that are going crazy. It&#x27;s also nice for adding volume, but you do have to hold it just right to get the lift where you want it. This is more of a technique issue than a product issue. The heat resistant glove isn&#x27;t necessary. I used the brush without it and never burned myself. I didn&#x27;t find the brush getting that hot or my hand coming into contact with the hottest parts. The cord is plenty long enough for maneuvering around your head (and I&#x27;m tall). I also took this on a hotel stay, and the plug is a standard one so there&#x27;s no funny business with a crazy cord that you have trouble plugging in. I was able to plug my hair dryer in one outlet and the brush in the one below it. It heats up quickly and does the job.</li>
            <li> Great Styling Bush, but i keep losing bristles in my long, thick hair. Regardless, I&#x27;ve rebought this a couple of times. It&#x27;s definitely one of the better products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My hoy air brush burned out on me, and I ran to the corner store to buy a new one.. Thought this was a hot air brush, bit it wasn&#x27;t. I used it on my blowdried hair, and it smoothed it out nicely. No frizz or fuzz.. I have shoulder length wavy hair. i did my hair in under 10 minutes, so I think I&#x27;ll just use this after a quick blowdry from now on if I&#x27;m in a rush. It didn&#x27;t get overly hot for me like some stated.. But I didn&#x27;t use it for more than 10 minutes.. I still want to get my john Frieda hot air brush replaced, but until I do, this will work fine.. I didn&#x27;t use the glove..</li>
            <li> Great value, thankyou</li>
            <li> My hair:  I have very porous hair that takes forever to dry and is frizzy.  It is about 2 inches past my shoulders.  As I walk around, my hair swings and rubs against itself and basically &amp;#34;teases&amp;#34; itself into a big ball of a mess.  If I let it air dry, it drys in big uneven wavy tangles.  If I blow it dry, it is nicely straight and fluffy, but the ends are unfinished.  And as soon as I walk around, it starts teasing up and looking really ratty.  So....I must do something to &amp;#34;flatten&amp;#34; the hair cuticle.  For years I used rollers.  I then bought a flat iron and basically ruined my hair since I don&#x27;t like to use the requisite thermal protection products that you need to protect your hair.  Using those products means I can&#x27;t skip a day in washing my hair because it is super flat and greasy the second day.  Rollers work best, but I hate the uneven kinks you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no blowing whatsoever on this tool as it&#x27;s a styling brush and not a hot-air brush.  it also doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  I was unable to hold my finger on it without burning myself, but it is not as hot as a curling or flat iron.  There is a glove, that has a warning inside saying not to hold it against the brush or it will melt.  So you only use it to protect your hand as you barely coax the hair around the brush.  It works well.  I did not find that the glove stuck to my hair, as others complained about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This styling brush was successful in giving me glass-like shine with minimal heat.  The instructions say to roll your hair around it and hold for 10-15 seconds, but I like to keep moving instead.  I just grab some hair by the bottom, put the brush underneath the hair at the top of my head, then slide it down, pulling the hair taught with my gloved hand.  When the brush gets to the bottom you just keep rolling it under by cupping your gloved hand lightly over the brush.  Since I love to blow my hair dry by bending over to give it maximum fluffiness, I just stayed bent overto use this brush.  It&#x27;s actually easier that way because all your hair is hanging down free, away from your head!  Try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I ended up with is the same look as a  flat iron but having used less heat.  Very shiny, glass-like hair, curled under at the bottom.  There is absolutely no way you can make actual curls in your hair, as it does not get that hot, but hey....the less heat, the better condition your hair.  And I barely spent 5 minutes using it.  I never &amp;#34;held&amp;#34; it in place, but just continuously brushed sections with it, ending with it being rolled at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only give it 4 stars because the cord is too short at 6 foot.  I like a 10 or 12 foot cord which you normally only see on high end products.  It does have a swivel cord, is automatically dual voltage for travel, and there were no seams that caught and pulled out my hair.  Another plus is that it&#x27;s ceramic coated for ions, but I often wonder if there are different levels of ceramic coating:  cheap, thin coating as opposed to heavier thicker coating....  This styler being as cheap as it is, I can&#x27;t imagine it would have the optimum ion coating.... But, don&#x27;t know for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have slightly to moderately frizzy hair, this is a nice tool for smoothing the cuticle and flipping under the ends.  If you have ethnic ringlets or super-frizz, this tool likely does not have enough heat to take you from ringlets to straight.  You would have to blow dry the hair straight first.  And I&#x27;m still not sure it would be hot enough to give ethnic hair a glass-like appearance either....not without the help of chemical products.  You will have to experiment for yourself.  I bought mine at Target where they were on clearance for $16.  If I don&#x27;t like it after all, or find one I think is higher-end, I&#x27;ll return it.  I will say that they had a Hot Tools brush that had hard plastic tines instead of the soft plastic bristles on this tool.  I don&#x27;t think those tines would be able to grab the hair like these bristles do.  And that product was $99 at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product for smoothing and flipping.  Does not seem to have enough heat to actually curl.  There are many styling brushes out there that would be able to do that.  The ones that blow hot hair may be better for getting actual curl because you are drying the hair into a curl shape...</li>
            <li> All I got from the Revlon Heated Styling Brush is fly away hair.  This needs to be used on dry hair and unfortunately, static electricity went crazy.  I&#x27;ve tried this on two occasions and had similar experiences on both.  With a simple on/off switch, I waited for the ceramic base to heat, then used the brush on my hair as indicated by the instruction manual.  It did become hot, but since I did not touch the base of the brush, I did not need to use the enclosed glove which had a note inside it saying to only touch the heated element briefly or the glove would melt.  It was rough, had internal snags, and was very uncomfortable, so I was happy to not need to use the knit accessory.  On a positive note, the two pronged plug is attached to a very long cord which attaches to the brush handle via a swivel.  There is a weak hanging loop as well if you find that you need to display or store this very pink tool that way.  Unfortunately, this brush does nothing for my hair.  Nobody else wanted to try it because they thought the bristles were too sharp and painful.</li>
            <li> Works great on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to do my shampooing at bedtime and morning can be pretty scary for someone with a LOT of fine-textured hair with pronounced frizzing tendencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not patient enough for careful styling with heat products and I&#x27;m not ashamed to admit it.  This Revlon Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush is something I&#x27;m using just to tame the hair a bit and coax the waves into taking the general shape I&#x27;m after.  I let it warm up for just a few minutes on a horizontal metal rack in the bathroom (towels removed) and tend to finish before it gets hotter than what I think my hair can take, although there is always the \\&quot;off\\&quot; switch.  It is disconcerting that there&#x27;s no temperature control, but I guess that&#x27;s a tradeoff for the low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer warns against leaving it \\&quot;on any surface\\&quot; when hot, but as I found it impossible to leave the brush levitating in the air, I left it to cool on the above-mentioned towel rack with horizontal aluminum bars.  You&#x27;ll probably want to designate some similar heat resistant resting area before you start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the included glove: a truly heat resistant glove would likely be more expensive to manufacture, and possibly awkward to use due to the thickness of traditional heat insulators like rubber or silicone.  Still, this one seems reasonably protective against BRIEF inadvertent contact with the heated core of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not much use for precision curling, but this brush is a good cheap rescue tool for Bad Hair Day when there otherwise isn&#x27;t time to re-style.</li>
            <li> This gadget isn&#x27;t very handy for straightening purposes.  I would guess it would do better for curling.  Although it has one trouble - the brush doesn&#x27;t really grab your hair, so you need to push it on to the roller brush with the gloved hand.  This is a poor design.  You really do need to have a top piece to clamp down on the hair, like a traditional curling iron.  This updated design doesn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, somewhat wavy should length hair and I&#x27;m always looking for new ways to tame it.  If I&#x27;m going for style, normally I&#x27;ll either get a blow out (if I have time and cash) or use a flat iron. I have a [[ASIN:B00MAOST7A Remington NEW Wet 2 Straight Ceramic Hair Straightener with 2\\&quot; Inch Ceramic Plates, All NEW Steam Vent Technology, Fast Heat Up &amp; Swivel Cord]]  and it works great, although nothing is as good as someone else doing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I travel a lot and this is dual voltage so can go with me.  It&#x27;s fairly compact and lightweight.  However, I&#x27;m not sold overall.  First, the glove.  Why is there a glove you ask?  To be honest, I&#x27;m still not sure and I didn&#x27;t like wearing it.  Your hair definitely has to be dry before using this, so you better have time to first blow dry, then style.  Heat control seems to be an issue and I had to be careful not to burn myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also say, this might be more successful for someone with different hair.  My hair is very thick and hard to style.  If you have thinner or straight hair, I think this would do a decent job of giving you volume.  However, if you&#x27;re not an expect, for thick hair, it can only exacerbate existent problems.</li>
            <li> This is heated brush is great if you want straight hair that curls under at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely could be used for straightening. My hair has a bit of perm left on the bottom which makes it a bit frizzy and this brush works to get it silky smooth. I use mousse on the tips before styling to get the curled under effect to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very large diameter, almost 2&amp;#34; as opposed to narrower 1&amp;#34; brushes. So don&#x27;t expect curls out of this, only body and wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic barrel gets hot fast. Though the bristles don&#x27;t get hot, you don&#x27;t want to touch them lest you mistakenly touch the ceramic. I don&#x27;t bother with the glove because the tip is quite cool and I can hold it to guide the brush.</li>
            <li> This was a great detangler. I loved the way the brush easily flowed through my hair with even the shorter pieces. The mit was an awesome idea. It allowed me to ensure that the brush was as close as it could get to my scalp as possible.</li>
            <li> If you are buying this for a young person, please beware that this becomes unbelievably hot and lacks a temperature control. In hasty hands, it could be dangerous. Even in my own hands, it was impossibly hot. And, in what world do I need a special glove for my hair appliances? If the product is that unstable, it should probably be scrapped. And, it certainly shouldn&#x27;t be packaged at a cut-rate price and sent out into the world. And, of course, with temperatures this extreme and uncontrollable, one wonders what type of damage is being done to one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two tries, two very VERY hot hands, and some crispy ends, I had to toss this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only advise extraordinary caution. Or, better yet, consider your other options.</li>
            <li> Not good. Not good at all. My daughter and I attempted to use this heated styling brush over the course of two hours. Other than the ends of our hair having a oh-so-slight bend, this product did absolutely nothing. I tried very small sections of hair, bigger sections, just the ends, all of the hair, and it was a complete flop. Total disappointment. I am sure there are much better products on the market that get the job done. This isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife. She has really enjoyed using it and is very satisfied with what it does. I have seen her use a lot of hair products over the years, so for her to be this happy with it really says something.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair that&#x27;s straight or just a little wavy, and you don&#x27;t wash and blow dry it every day, Revlon&#x27;s Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush might be a very good option to achieve a smooth, face flattering look. Medium textured hair might do well, too. Please keep in mind there&#x27;s a reason a heat protecting glove is included, especially if you&#x27;re trying for more curl to your style! Unlike a traditional curling iron, the brush grips individual hairs, so if you turn it under (or over) and wrap it to curl, it might NOT want to let go, and you&#x27;ll need that glove to untangle your hair from the very hot brush. OUCH! I&#x27;d think those with thick or curly hair would have even more issue with this. My hair is fine, and while the heated styling brush works well to simply brush through it slowly for smoothing with a slight turn under at the ends, I ripped out a few hairs trying to untangle it when I tried to make more of a wave or curl. My hair is currently shoulder length and blunt cut, so perhaps shorter or layered styles would be easier? It&#x27;s also possible I&#x27;m just a klutz when it comes to hair styling. My usual routine is wash and air dry, or at the most a low heat blow dry with a round brush to smooth any frizz. I&#x27;ll probably use this styling tool only occasionally on seriously bad hair days when I have limited time to get out-the-door... but I&#x27;ll always have the glove on in case my hair gets tangled in it again.</li>
            <li> I received this a week or so ago and tried it out on my granddaughters long hair.I plugged it in and let it get hot and followed the instructions and, it didn&#x27;t do so well.It gets very hot and a heatproof glove is included to keep you from burning yourself but there is no control to adjust the temperature so you have too use it like that.We tried leaving it on for longer times and it did finally curl it but it just didn&#x27;t hold well.I would spend a little more money and get a better one.Im sure this company has many to choose from.</li>
            <li> Since my definition of \\&quot;hair styling\\&quot; involves using the cheapest haircut coupon, I delegated the testing of this to a couple of friends who are professional hair stylists....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were impressed!  Among their comments that I could understand, they both emphasized its ease of use and the fact that it did everything it claimed to do.  Being professionally trained may have had something to do with it because even I had noticed the paucity of included instructions so if you are new to such a device, it might be helpful consulting with more experienced friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: One thing I gleaned from reading other reviews is that you are probably going to need to use the included heat resistant glove because it appears to get a lot hotter than many are used to.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> No automatic shut-off feature?!!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to have spent my money on this product.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a bad product.....it just doesn&#x27;t really seem particularly useful to me.  The main problem I have with it:  No temp control.  It heats evenly and quickly, but with no temp control I would be nervous about using it on a youngster.  The chance of inadvertent burn is too serious.  I am not sure why the glove is even included, it does absolutely no good, and it makes using the product really clumsy and unwieldy.  This will do nothing to help dry the hair.  It also is pretty useless for adding curl, or even much body.  I think usage from the root area to the tips of hair might add a bit of volume and straighten the hair a bit, but there are other heated appliances that do that job, along with curl.  To me, this will just take up more of the space under the bathroom sink, precious real estate in most homes.  I&#x27;d rather use a plain old fashioned curling iron and blow dryer, and maybe a straightener if I needed one.  This just didn&#x27;t fill any real hair care need for me.</li>
            <li> I have it to Good Will.  It is too large fory hair</li>
            <li> This heated styling brush is a nice addition to my hair styling tools. It&#x27;s just slightly bulky but heats up quickly and works well for smoothing or adding volume/waves to your hair. My long, straight hair (a few inches past my shoulders) does great with this styling brush. My daughter has super long hair (all the way down her back) and she enjoyed using this styling brush to smooth out some waves and give a little curl at the bottom of her hair. THe heatproof glove is a little bit of a strange addition but I guess if you are worried about burning yourself, it could serve its purpose. The bristles on the brush are a little scratchy but nothing too uncomfortable. The only thing I really do not like about this styling brush is that there are no heat controls. You get up to one temperature and there is no way to adjust it based on your personal styling needs. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this for moderate use of medium to long hair styles.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this styling brush.  I had a very old curling iron that finally gave out and this was to replace it.  Unfortunately, this brush does not have a temperature control and it got extremely hot and I burned myself while trying to use it.  I found that the &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; glove was less than adequate - my fingers were still burning through the glove.  Finally, and this is all me and not the brush, I am used to an iron and trying to use a brush on my long hair ended up with it tangled in my hair.  For me, this heated brush is a pass.  For someone more familiar with how a styling brush works and can deal with the lack of temperature control,  it may be okay.</li>
            <li> So I tried this out. I have wavy hair that I can either blow-dry straight, or air-dry wavy. I occasionally use a curling iron for more defined curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for curls, and it was honestly hard to figure out. You can get slight curls, but it requires a lot more wrangling than a simple curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is great for polishing a second-day blowout. I brushed through my hair the day after I blew it out, and it gave it a nice shine. I even twirled the brush at the ends of my hair (like I do with a round brush when I blow-dry). It gave the ends of my hair a nice inward curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want a great tool to make you hair look like you just blew it out today (not yesterday!), I recommend this. If you&#x27;re looking for defined curls, I might suggest a simple curling iron.</li>
