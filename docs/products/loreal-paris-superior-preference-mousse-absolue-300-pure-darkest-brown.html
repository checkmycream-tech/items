    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>the color was great and it lasted!</li>
            <li>The color is absolutely perfect</li>
            <li>Best color I&#x27;ve ever used at home.  </li>
            <li>The condition of my hair never looked so great!</li>
            <li>but otherwise I love it!!!!!</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells great too!</li>
            <li>the reusable color is a wonderful concept.</li>
            <li>The hair dye is great</li>
            <li>I LOVED this product.</li>
            <li>but I am delighted with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every product cannot be good for everyone.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t become discouraged in selecting the best color for use with your current hair color because nothing sold under this label (Superior Preference Mousse) will be recommended for you!!!!  </li>
            <li>And, best of all you can use the color a second time to touch up your roots and have a perfect match.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t consider the effect to be &amp;#34;shiny.&amp;#34;  I would have liked some glossiness to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>and so I hope this will continue to be the case as I add more years.  </li>
            <li>It got some of my grays but it mostly just got my scalp.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s never happened with L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Cream, and that one also does a better job on my gray hair.</li>
            <li>its ok</li>
            <li>They need to work on this product some more.</li>
            <li>It applies easily</li>
            <li>The biggest deal breaker for me, however, was the insanely strong smell of ammonia that came out with every application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used dyes that have a strong ammonia smell before but this was unbareable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have had this kind of result with any haircolor I have used.</li>
            <li>I used the 300 Pure Darkest Brown to cover some brassy highlights and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>My hair was super shiny and the color is beautiful and not flat at all.  </li>
            <li>I was so nervous about the results because I don&#x27;t normally dye my own hair.</li>
            <li>Another pleasant result was the fact that all my gray/ white was well covered</li>
            <li>I was pleasant surprised to find that the color itself does produce a variety of shades as a finished product which does make the effect more natural.</li>
            <li>I have never hated a product so much.</li>
            <li>Easy apply but with absolutely horrid results.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to use and it dried so glossy and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I love how the 300 color matches my natural color.  </li>
            <li>and it was so much fun.</li>
            <li>So that was fun.</li>
            <li>The hair that it did color was nice, but only stayed for two washings.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to cover gray/ whitening hair, and the ability to re-use the original bottle rather than have to buy an entire new bottle just to redo the roots each month was very appealing.  </li>
            <li>This in my opinion is a great product as long as you follow instructions and stick to a color that is close to your natural.</li>
            <li>I have been dying my hair with semi-permanent dye for many years, but just recently switched to permanent dye because I&#x27;ve gotten a lot more gray hair (I&#x27;m 40 years old).</li>
            <li>Almost in tears I washed and dried my hair only to find that it looked amazing!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>My recent more careful reading of the box information also revealed a strange fact:  the user, irregardless of the original color of their hair, and irregardless of the color inside the box, is not recommended for them!!!!</li>
            <li>The first one I tried was John Frieda.</li>
            <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t like having to shake the bottle every time you press the applicator.</li>
            <li>I thought the mousse was a great consistency because it was thick and not runny.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this twice, thinking maybe I mistimed the first application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been touching up my roots for years and my hair color is a cool dark brown.  </li>
            <li>So this time I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Mousse Absolute</li>
            <li>yes my dad really likes this hair dye.</li>
            <li>This one really worked for us because since is reusable</li>
            <li>shines but not that much.</li>
            <li>Also very drippy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I figure that the stickiness is some kind of artifact related to the initial use and perhaps facilitates the conditioning effect.  </li>
            <li>I do not like the conditioner in this Preference Mousse Absolute as much as in the normal Preference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit confuse about all the negative reviews the one we bought worked really good, I&#x27;m ordering a few more and maybe try it on my hair to update review.</li>
            <li>I definitely like how easy it is to apply the mousse, but I felt that the dye faded faster than with regular dyes.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try the new mousse dyes I&#x27;ve been seeing.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, I have read the label more carefully and discovered that this is a color product which actually intends to produce color highlights/ shades when applied.  </li>
            <li>The overwhelming smell is hard to take as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was sooooo shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the burning was so intense in my nose that I had to hold my breath and then LEAVE THE ROOM after every spray.</li>
            <li>My hair is now soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This color despite following directions exactly fails to do more than lightly soften (and that&#x27;s being generous) the gray.</li>
            <li>I have bought seven boxes of the Loreal Superior Preference 300 Mousse in the past year and a half.  </li>
            <li>I had to open the window in the bathroom and walk around the house to get some fresh air after every single squirt of the mousse.</li>
            <li>Turns out I had only been applying the developer foam the whole time because it had not mixed with the color when I pressed the button.</li>
            <li>For example, the stickiness mentioned by several other users turned out to occur only after applying the conditioner at the end of the original application.  </li>
            <li>Although I was somewhat hesistant due to some of the reviews, I figured I did not have much to lose, and as it turns out, I lost nothing.  </li>
            <li>I had been having trouble getting full coverage with other products that promised gray coverage.  </li>

            <li> Suppose I will have to live with it, but I hope L&#x27;Oreal enhances the color options by breaking the colors down with choices to select &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Left in my hair for 40 minutes, grey roots still shine.</li>
            <li> But for a color billed as Pure Darkest Brown, I was disappointed in the strong redness that comes through.  </li>
            <li> The stickiness completely disappeared once my hair dried.  </li>
            <li> It does not cover grey at all, no matter the timing.</li>
            <li> I never have this issue, nor have I ever had a hair dye not color my grey.</li>
            <li> Does not cover grey.</li>
            <li> It did miss a single strand of hair here and there</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried it, and it&#x27;s been a huge disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> The color was good but the lasting residue on my hair is awful.</li>
            <li> My hair still remains well conditioned, which surprises me when I think of my other hair color experiences.  </li>
            <li> This is a waste of time and money, I appied it as stated in the instructions and it did nothing, not even came close to covering any grey hair, all it did was burn the heck out of my skin.</li>
            <li> I usually do some sort of reseach before any purchase (for an obvious reason).  </li>
            <li> You do have to be a little careful to wipe off the tip before shaking</li>
            <li> But if it does not color, then it is not worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> Just colored my hair last night after having not colored my hair for at least six months.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dripping down my face as I write this review.</li>
            <li> if there is a rating for half star, i would have picked that.  </li>
            <li> I use color to cover my gray--never a problem with any color previously.  </li>
            <li> This worked so well on my very dark almost black hair.</li>
            <li> The color was a little darker at the ends than the roots</li>
            <li> There is a little reddish tint to it in the sun that I like a lot.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair with a weird film.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have hard to color hair or greys</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s common sense.  </li>
            <li> Despite all the negative reviews I gave this product a try.</li>
            <li> Except that now I also had sticky thick residue on my hair that required additional washing.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> All stores because I bought them at different stores thinking I would avoid another bad batch.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I almost passed out from the smell!</li>
            <li> While the color was processing it looked almost black, I was convinced that I was going to hate it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an expensive product to try if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, which could happen.</li>
            <li> but i bought the wrong color</li>
            <li> but to me the brown looks a tad fake.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s evenly applied due to the consistancy.  </li>
            <li> Having to dye my hair every 5 weeks gets really annoying</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE MONEY!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and will be getting a refund on this product.</li>
            <li> AWFUL PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product!!</li>
            <li> This is not just the worst jar color I&#x27;ve ever used, it&#x27;s the worst beauty product I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the worst hair color I have ever used.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Headline says it all.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE MONEY!!!!!!!  AWFUL PRODUCT.  DOES&#x27;T WORK. SMELL TERRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;Just pay money and damege your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair with semi-permanent dye for many years, but just recently switched to permanent dye because I&#x27;ve gotten a lot more gray hair (I&#x27;m 40 years old). Having to dye my hair every 5 weeks gets really annoying so I decided to try the new mousse dyes I&#x27;ve been seeing. The first one I tried was John Frieda. It was okay. I definitely like how easy it is to apply the mousse, but I felt that the dye faded faster than with regular dyes. So this time I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Mousse Absolute and I will not be using it again. First of all, I don&#x27;t like having to shake the bottle every time you press the applicator. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal I guess, but after using the John Frieda where I didn&#x27;t have to shake before each application, I thought it was a bit of a hassle. The biggest deal breaker for me, however, was the insanely strong smell of ammonia that came out with every application. I mean, I almost passed out from the smell! It was the strongest ammonia smell I have ever gotten from a dye. I had to open the window in the bathroom and walk around the house to get some fresh air after every single squirt of the mousse. Buyer Beware!!</li>
            <li> I wanted something to cover gray/ whitening hair, and the ability to re-use the original bottle rather than have to buy an entire new bottle just to redo the roots each month was very appealing.  Although I was somewhat hesistant due to some of the reviews, I figured I did not have much to lose, and as it turns out, I lost nothing.  For example, the stickiness mentioned by several other users turned out to occur only after applying the conditioner at the end of the original application.  The stickiness completely disappeared once my hair dried.  On the next regular shampoo I used the conditioner again, but hey, no stickiness at all!  So I figure that the stickiness is some kind of artifact related to the initial use and perhaps facilitates the conditioning effect.  My hair still remains well conditioned, which surprises me when I think of my other hair color experiences.  However, I don&#x27;t consider the effect to be &amp;#34;shiny.&amp;#34;  I would have liked some glossiness to my hair.  Another pleasant result was the fact that all my gray/ white was well covered and so I hope this will continue to be the case as I add more years.  I had been having trouble getting full coverage with other products that promised gray coverage.  I was pleasant surprised to find that the color itself does produce a variety of shades as a finished product which does make the effect more natural. Since using this product, I have read the label more carefully and discovered that this is a color product which actually intends to produce color highlights/ shades when applied.  But for a color billed as Pure Darkest Brown, I was disappointed in the strong redness that comes through.  I prefer &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; browns.  Suppose I will have to live with it, but I hope L&#x27;Oreal enhances the color options by breaking the colors down with choices to select &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; vs &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; shades of each color.  My recent more careful reading of the box information also revealed a strange fact:  the user, irregardless of the original color of their hair, and irregardless of the color inside the box, is not recommended for them!!!! That just doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all.  So don&#x27;t become discouraged in selecting the best color for use with your current hair color because nothing sold under this label (Superior Preference Mousse) will be recommended for you!!!!  Kinda unbelieveable, huh?</li>
            <li> I love how the 300 color matches my natural color.  I like that you can use a portion of the canister at a time.  I do not like the conditioner in this Preference Mousse Absolute as much as in the normal Preference.</li>
            <li> Save your money. It got some of my grays but it mostly just got my scalp. Seriously. I have brown splotches around my part. That&#x27;s never happened with L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Cream, and that one also does a better job on my gray hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible product!! I have bought seven boxes of the Loreal Superior Preference 300 Mousse in the past year and a half.  Four of them were defective.  I returned three and threw the fourth out because I no longer had the receipt.  After all the time and effort of hour to two hours it took me to color my hair, let it set and then wash it out, there was no color on my hair.  It was the same as when I had started.  Except that now I also had sticky thick residue on my hair that required additional washing.  I think Loreal should pull these boxes off the store shelves.  All stores because I bought them at different stores thinking I would avoid another bad batch.  I kept trying them because I like the idea of the mousse, it is easier to handle and apply.  But if it does not color, then it is not worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair with a weird film. It was almost eye burningly smelly also. The color was good but the lasting residue on my hair is awful.</li>
            <li> I came to amazon because my dad....yes my dad really likes this hair dye. This one really worked for us because since is reusable we can save it for reapplication we got 3 applications for my dad (obviously would be 1 or 2 for women) the color was great and it lasted! I&#x27;m a bit confuse about all the negative reviews the one we bought worked really good, I&#x27;m ordering a few more and maybe try it on my hair to update review.</li>
            <li> This worked so well on my very dark almost black hair. It was so easy to use and it dried so glossy and gorgeous. The color is absolutely perfect I can&#x27;t believe how well it turned out and it was so much fun. I will use this again next time.</li>
            <li> Best color I&#x27;ve ever used at home.  I&#x27;ve been touching up my roots for years and my hair color is a cool dark brown.  I used the 300 Pure Darkest Brown to cover some brassy highlights and it was amazing.  My hair was super shiny and the color is beautiful and not flat at all.  It covered all the brassy highlights and my gray hair with out damaging it.  I thought the mousse was a great consistency because it was thick and not runny.  You do have to be a little careful to wipe off the tip before shaking but that&#x27;s common sense.  And, best of all you can use the color a second time to touch up your roots and have a perfect match.  I love this product and will definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassie - Columbia Maryland</li>
            <li> Despite all the negative reviews I gave this product a try. I used 300 darkest brown. I was so nervous about the results because I don&#x27;t normally dye my own hair. While the color was processing it looked almost black, I was convinced that I was going to hate it. Almost in tears I washed and dried my hair only to find that it looked amazing!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s was sooooo shiny and soft. The condition of my hair never looked so great! The color was a little darker at the ends than the roots but otherwise I love it!!!!! The conditioner smells great too! There is a little reddish tint to it in the sun that I like a lot. This in my opinion is a great product as long as you follow instructions and stick to a color that is close to your natural.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time and money, I appied it as stated in the instructions and it did nothing, not even came close to covering any grey hair, all it did was burn the heck out of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is not just the worst jar color I&#x27;ve ever used, it&#x27;s the worst beauty product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the smell. I dye my hair next to two open windows, and it still burned my eyes when I applied it. Not only that, but the burning was so intense in my nose that I had to hold my breath and then LEAVE THE ROOM after every spray. I&#x27;ve used dyes that have a strong ammonia smell before but this was unbareable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, after I had finished coloring my roots, I waited about 20 mins to check on the progress. Nothing. Turns out I had only been applying the developer foam the whole time because it had not mixed with the color when I pressed the button. So that was fun. Another 10 mins of running in and out of the bathroom to avoid burning my corneas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s dripping down my face as I write this review. I have never hated a product so much. Never again.</li>
            <li> if there is a rating for half star, i would have picked that.  This is most useless product I ever bought.  I usually do some sort of reseach before any purchase (for an obvious reason).  This one i got fooled.  Smells horrible, can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s evenly applied due to the consistancy.  At the end no color difference at ALL.  L&#x27;Oreal should be ashamed of putting ths product in the market.</li>
            <li> After seeing commercials on TV I thought I would give this a try. I like the convenience of using just what you need of the product to color my hair. This was the ONLY part that was spot on. Easy apply but with absolutely horrid results. I did not cover my gray roots whatsoever. This is the first time I have had this kind of result with any haircolor I have used. I am very disappointed and will be getting a refund on this product.</li>
            <li> Just colored my hair last night after having not colored my hair for at least six months. I LOVED this product. My hair is now soft and manageable. It covered the roots. It did miss a single strand of hair here and there but I am delighted with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an expensive product to try if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, which could happen. Everyone raves about Pantene shampoo and I&#x27;ve tried it, and it&#x27;s been a huge disappointment for me. Every product cannot be good for everyone. I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> I used this twice, thinking maybe I mistimed the first application. It does not cover grey at all, no matter the timing. The hair that it did color was nice, but only stayed for two washings. I never have this issue, nor have I ever had a hair dye not color my grey. The overwhelming smell is hard to take as well. Would never recommend this to anyone. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the worst hair color I have ever used. It applies easily but that&#x27;s where it ends--it doesn&#x27;t color, even after 35 minutes of wait time, and it&#x27;s beastly to wash out. I use color to cover my gray--never a problem with any color previously.  This color despite following directions exactly fails to do more than lightly soften (and that&#x27;s being generous) the gray. Don&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> The hair dye is great but i bought the wrong color but did it anyways. its ok but to me the brown looks a tad fake. shines but not that much. They need to work on this product some more. &amp;#34;loreal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Does not cover grey. Left in my hair for 40 minutes, grey roots still shine. Also very drippy.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have hard to color hair or greys the reusable color is a wonderful concept.</li>
