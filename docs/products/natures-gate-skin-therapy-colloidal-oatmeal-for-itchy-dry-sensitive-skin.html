            <li>Love this lotion!!!!</li>
            <li>This is great lotion!</li>
            <li>The best part is that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and includes no animal ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizing lotion!</li>
            <li>It does a very good job.</li>
            <li>So happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this lotion!!</li>
            <li>and this is the best, most soothing lotion I have tried.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and provides good protection.</li>
            <li>I love Nature&#x27;s Gate products!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>While fragrance free or unscented, this lotion has a pleasant herbal smell when being applied.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion and have not seen it in the store for years.  </li>
            <li>Also nice is that it is virtually odor free.</li>
            <li>nice clean scent to it</li>
            <li>It smells nice and clean and is not oily.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is pretty good but not the best.&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s scalp gets easily irritated and this shampoo does the trick without causing any reaction.  </li>
            <li>Very good lotion for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It was creamy, easily absorbed, moisturized very well, and had a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I did a little online research and found this wonderful lotion on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is so much more natural and effective than using Aquaphor or petroleum jelly as an insulating medium against the air.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of their heavier formulas, but it soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>It is great for dry hands and the oatmeal helps when you have itchy skin too.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good natural lotion.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unscented so even more gentle.</li>
            <li>The lotion is not oily so it soaks into the skin rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The only kind of lotion that doesn&#x27;t burn my chapped hands.</li>
            <li>only wish that it had a better rating on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database, but 2 is still pretty good.</li>
            <li>Unlike pure oatmeal, though, it also moisturizes in the case where you have a good old-fashioned case of dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li>Works great for sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I just add a pinch of extra colloidal oatmeal to this lotion and it works even better.</li>
            <li>It is effective, probably due to the gingko which enhances blood flow.</li>
            <li>Any fabric that&#x27;s touching your skin for very long while it&#x27;s drying has to be peeled off.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many shampoos for dry scalps, this is mild and leaves my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great for dry, rough, damaged skin....</li>
            <li>My girlfriend had a Lotta problems with dry skin this have seemed to help her a lot good deal on the 3 pack local health food store wanted 13 dollars a bottle</li>
            <li>I have it on periodic delivery from Amazon and delivery is always fast and efficient.  </li>
            <li>it does not leave a greasey or oily feel on my skin and dries fast.</li>
            <li>(very sensitive)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Prior to 2011, this was an exceptional lotion for dry eczema skin.</li>
            <li>My experience has been that this lotion feeds the skin and encases it with a protective, soothing barrier that helps to keep the skin from becoming dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>the main ingredients are water and safflower oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and use it daily on my arms and legs, as I get really dry skin there.  </li>
            <li>This \\&quot;new</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy the new formula again.</li>
            <li>I use this on my son with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>(but it does have a scent so it won&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re very sensitive to fragrance).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using it for a long time and recommended it to many dry skin sufferers.</li>
            <li>I do not know if this is the old formula or the new</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is because I wish it was a little more emollient</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the natural lotions here and in England-</li>
            <li>I am going to see if I can find some old bottles at the health food store.</li>
            <li>It draws toxins to the skin&#x27;s surface, just as an oatmeal bath will, but this is not nearly as messy.</li>
            <li>and I use black soap lotion (Nubian Heritage is the brand I think) instead as it is much thicker, much stronger lotion</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m back to searching for a lotion I can live with again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve relied on the old formula of this lotion for several years--best lotion for my painfully dry skin, and it was very soothing for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t do much for very dry skin or already irritated skin</li>
            <li>I have very dry or very irritated skin</li>
            <li>I wholeheartedly recommended the previous formula, but I feel the exact opposite with the \\&quot;new</li>
            <li>This Colloidal Oatmeal product is very soothing on dry skin and about the only thing that keeps my skin liveable.  </li>
            <li>We really like it and we like that we are avoiding chemicals found in other lotions.</li>
            <li>it takes little effort to apply and absorbs pretty quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, but thought \\&quot;Hey, I love the old and how bad can the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; be anyway?\\</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about a zillion lotions over the years, so I&#x27;m speaking from long experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My itchy skin has driven me nuts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Come on Nature&#x27;s Gate why did you monkey around with perfection?!</li>
            <li> it works well on mildly dry skin or for preventing dry skin</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry feet.</li>
            <li> Provides moisture to dry skin without leaving skin greasy and without any perfumy smell</li>
            <li> I have skin keratosis issues and I have very dry, rough, patchy skin conditions....</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the product is so thick that about a quarter to a third of it remains in the bottom and has to be shaken out.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer who said that it feels like rubbing Elmer&#x27;s glue on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product to reduce coldness in my arms and legs due to a malfunction in my autonomic nervous systems.  </li>
            <li> After using this for one week, twice daily, I saw a dramatic improvement in my eczema and overall skin texture.  </li>
            <li> They changed the formula (new, improved) in 2011 and it is thin, watery and leaves a tight feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> It has neither a perfumy nor a medicinal odor to it, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about walking down the street smelling like either a hospital or a fashion college.</li>
            <li> I like it for my dry scalp as well and dandruff is a thing of the past for me.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t have greasy hands an hour or even half an hour after applying like you</li>
            <li> it has little to no scent</li>
            <li> And it leaves my skin feeling stiff and tight when it has dried.  </li>
            <li> This is my go-to lotion for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> you have to press down hard while turning...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin, it doesn&#x27;t absorb well, takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> the new formula, just released in early 2011, is terrible.  </li>
            <li> If I could leave a negative review, I would.  </li>
            <li> My skin just soaks it in, and no more itch!</li>
            <li> It is now light and runny, difficult to absorb, leaves my skin sticky, and has a nasty scent.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it can glue like glue and be of some use to me, because it fails as a lotion.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m having a bad flare up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It is terrible!</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s completely awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to love this lotion!! It was creamy, easily absorbed, moisturized very well, and had a pleasant scent. This \\&quot;new improved\\&quot; formula is anything but! It is now light and runny, difficult to absorb, leaves my skin sticky, and has a nasty scent. I agree with the other reviewer who said that it feels like rubbing Elmer&#x27;s glue on the skin. It is terrible! I wholeheartedly recommended the previous formula, but I feel the exact opposite with the \\&quot;new improved\\&quot; formula, as I wholeheartedly DO NOT recommend it any longer!!</li>
            <li> The only kind of lotion that doesn&#x27;t burn my chapped hands.</li>
            <li> This Colloidal Oatmeal product is very soothing on dry skin and about the only thing that keeps my skin liveable.  I have it on periodic delivery from Amazon and delivery is always fast and efficient.  The only downside is that the product is so thick that about a quarter to a third of it remains in the bottom and has to be shaken out.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for dry, rough, damaged skin....nice clean scent to it and it does the job superbly....I have skin keratosis issues and I have very dry, rough, patchy skin conditions....not complicating the issues is no perfume or scent added.  Love this lotion!!!!</li>
            <li> Prior to 2011, this was an exceptional lotion for dry eczema skin. I&#x27;d been using it for a long time and recommended it to many dry skin sufferers. They changed the formula (new, improved) in 2011 and it is thin, watery and leaves a tight feeling on the skin. Terrible! I&#x27;ve tried all the natural lotions here and in England- none work like this did. I won&#x27;t buy the new formula again. I am going to see if I can find some old bottles at the health food store.</li>
            <li> This is great lotion! It&#x27;s one of their heavier formulas, but it soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> Since it only cost me 70 cents at my local grocery store. Of course the sent it nothing to rave about but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought this today from a local store (not via amazon) and I could not open the bottle so I did a search and found that to open you have to press down hard while turning...then it just POPPed up and I like the feel of it and the thickness of it. I do not know if this is the old formula or the new but I like it. one reason I bought this brand was it does not have any petroleum or mineral oil (which is a petroleum product also). the main ingredients are water and safflower oil. it does not leave a greasey or oily feel on my skin and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve relied on the old formula of this lotion for several years--best lotion for my painfully dry skin, and it was very soothing for my psoriasis. I&#x27;ve tried about a zillion lotions over the years, so I&#x27;m speaking from long experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the new formula, just released in early 2011, is terrible.  If I could leave a negative review, I would.  It&#x27;s thin, it doesn&#x27;t absorb well, takes forever to dry.  Any fabric that&#x27;s touching your skin for very long while it&#x27;s drying has to be peeled off.  And it leaves my skin feeling stiff and tight when it has dried.  It&#x27;s like wearing Elmer&#x27;s Glue.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I guess I&#x27;m back to searching for a lotion I can live with again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and have not seen it in the store for years.  So happy to find it on Amazon.  I bought the 3 pack.  It is great for dry hands and the oatmeal helps when you have itchy skin too.</li>
            <li> My experience has been that this lotion feeds the skin and encases it with a protective, soothing barrier that helps to keep the skin from becoming dry and itchy.  What relief it has provided!  It is so much more natural and effective than using Aquaphor or petroleum jelly as an insulating medium against the air.  While fragrance free or unscented, this lotion has a pleasant herbal smell when being applied.</li>
            <li> This lotion works on the same principle as that of using oatmeal to stop the itching of poison ivy. It draws toxins to the skin&#x27;s surface, just as an oatmeal bath will, but this is not nearly as messy. Unlike pure oatmeal, though, it also moisturizes in the case where you have a good old-fashioned case of dry cracked skin. Also nice is that it is virtually odor free. It has neither a perfumy nor a medicinal odor to it, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about walking down the street smelling like either a hospital or a fashion college. The lotion is not oily so it soaks into the skin rather quickly. You won&#x27;t have greasy hands an hour or even half an hour after applying like you might with some hand lotions. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this on my son with very sensitive skin.  This is the only lotion that I use on my son.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s scalp gets easily irritated and this shampoo does the trick without causing any reaction.  I like it for my dry scalp as well and dandruff is a thing of the past for me.  Unlike many shampoos for dry scalps, this is mild and leaves my hair shiny and soft.  I love Nature&#x27;s Gate products!</li>
            <li> Very good lotion for very dry skin.</li>

            <li> My itchy skin has driven me nuts for a long time. I did a little online research and found this wonderful lotion on Amazon. My skin just soaks it in, and no more itch!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good natural lotion.  It absorbs well and provides good protection. I keep a bottle next to my sink to use after washing.  It helps keep my hands from cracking in the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that it had a better rating on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database, but 2 is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and use it daily on my arms and legs, as I get really dry skin there.  It smells nice and clean and is not oily.  The best part is that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and includes no animal ingredients.  This is my go-to lotion for everyday use.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, but thought \\&quot;Hey, I love the old and how bad can the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; be anyway?\\&quot; It&#x27;s completely awful! It does have the look, feel, and smell of glue. Perhaps it can glue like glue and be of some use to me, because it fails as a lotion. Come on Nature&#x27;s Gate why did you monkey around with perfection?!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I have chronic eczema and this is the best, most soothing lotion I have tried. If I&#x27;m having a bad flare up I just add a pinch of extra colloidal oatmeal to this lotion and it works even better. It has never irritated my skin, it&#x27;s affordable, and it works every time! it&#x27;s unscented so even more gentle.</li>
            <li> Works great for sensitive and dry skin.  We really like it and we like that we are avoiding chemicals found in other lotions.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizing lotion! Provides moisture to dry skin without leaving skin greasy and without any perfumy smell</li>
            <li> This has helped my eczema.  For years I have been using topic steroids to alleviate the eczema patches on my torso which left me with papery skin.  After using this for one week, twice daily, I saw a dramatic improvement in my eczema and overall skin texture.  I haven&#x27;t had to use topical steroids in over a month.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is because I wish it was a little more emollient so I didn&#x27;t have to use it twice daily.</li>
