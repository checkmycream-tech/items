            <li>If you are anything like me and need a GOOD floss....</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>this is a good buy</li>
            <li>Oral-B Satin floss is also good, but it tends to snag on the bottoms of my molars, so I still prefer the Glide</li>
            <li>The flavor is a strong mint that lasts!!</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, too!!!</li>
            <li>It is kind to my gums and teeth and fingers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mint flavored, glides very easily between teeth.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this dental floss.</li>
            <li>and it was okay.</li>
            <li>helps me do a better job.  </li>
            <li>and I love it for two reasons.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to wind it many times around my fingers to floss (to hold the floss in place.)</li>
            <li>I also love being able to order it in quantity from Amazon since i do go through quite a bit of it.</li>
            <li>Your better off trying to floss with cooked sphagetti.</li>

            <li>This multi-pack order is extremely convenient for me &amp; a good value &amp; of course, the famous Amazon great delivery helps.</li>
            <li>It is strong and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It whitens, it slides in and out of your teeth easily, and it has a minty taste.</li>
            <li>The floss is also strong.</li>
            <li>Amazon packages these nicely and it ships fast!</li>
            <li>It needs to be smooth</li>
            <li>This floss holds together a lot better, and it rarely tears on me.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty refreshing too..</li>
            <li>; none of that stuff really gives any significant additional benefits.  </li>

            <li>If you want to get your teeth whitened, you&#x27;ll have to pay a lot of money at a reputable dentist to have it it done properly.  </li>

            <li>Which is exactly what every floss in the world is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s wider and flatter than typical flosses, so it doesn&#x27;t dig into your fingers when you wrap it around them, making it much more comfortable on the hands to floss.  </li>
            <li>The flossing helps make my mouth fresh &amp; clean and the whitening adds a little healthy flair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s called 3-D floss for that reason and it makes flossing your teeth so much easier.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>I knew that would make my gums sore, so I set out to find a more gentle floss than your everyday generic mint-waxed floss.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to use the glide floss over regular floss for me.  </li>
            <li>Lastly I want a flavor that I really like.  </li>
            <li>but it needs to be thick enough to be effective.</li>
            <li>incredibly easily in and out of the spaces between teeth, without ever getting stuck or needing to be forced.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overly thick but it also doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>Like that this also has a small hint of scope in it to make my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Crest Glide since I first tried it several years ago; my dentists have given me other brands, but I invariably never use them.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really care about whether it has scope or any other marketing gimmicks</li>

            <li> I really do follow my dentist recommendation to floss, at least once, every day.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 months and plan to keep with it as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> I waste less floss because I don&#x27;t have to pull as much out</li>
            <li> My dentist recently suggested that I start flossing 2 or 3 times a day to help prevent a few almost-cavities from become actual cavities.  </li>

            <li> problem I usually have is that the floss constantly breaks (almost every time I use it, with the one above).</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty tough and with stand my razor sharp plaque that I&#x27;ve been working on.</li>

            <li> show that little * text in the back.  </li>
            <li> This makes it possible to have a lot of control over how gently or firmly to floss; now I can floss three times a day without any discomfort.  </li>
            <li> buying this I just got less floss than usual Glide packages of similar shape, which started at 54.7 yards (50 meters), then went to 43.7 yards and now 38.2 yards because it is &amp;#34;3D whitening&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine always seemed to be dark between the teeth.</li>
            <li> They all do things that (supposedly) whiten teeth, whether it be lots of small ridges, rough surfaces, or coating of baking soda.  </li>
            <li> least the other whitening flosses try.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the store</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping off my fingers or cutting into them.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me some random floss</li>
            <li> Needless to say I needed to find something that worked.</li>
            <li> Sadly this listing does not indicate the whitening comes from flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I am not going to lie, I absolutely hate to floss my teeth.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful purchase! My teeth look so beautiful because of this product. I received my purchase in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this dental floss. It&#x27;s mint flavored, glides very easily between teeth. They come in individual packages. I haven&#x27;t noticed any actual whitening though, so I might change my recurring order for the non-whitening Glide floss if it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> So I am not going to lie, I absolutely hate to floss my teeth. However after going to the dentist and being called out on it I decided that something had to be done. My dentist gave me some random floss and it was okay. Then I bought some floss that broke apart, lacked flavor and got caught in my teeth. Needless to say I needed to find something that worked. When I found this floss it was amazing!!!!! It is strong and easy to use. The flavor is a strong mint that lasts!! If you are anything like me and need a GOOD floss.... This is the floss for you!!</li>
            <li> Glide floss is the greatest. It is kind to my gums and teeth and fingers. I&#x27;ve used it for several years &amp; always get A+++ check ups with my dentist!!!  The flossing helps make my mouth fresh &amp; clean and the whitening adds a little healthy flair.  I have some manual dexterity challenges &amp; the Glide helps me do a better job.  This multi-pack order is extremely convenient for me &amp; a good value &amp; of course, the famous Amazon great delivery helps.</li>
            <li> My dentist recently suggested that I start flossing 2 or 3 times a day to help prevent a few almost-cavities from become actual cavities.  I knew that would make my gums sore, so I set out to find a more gentle floss than your everyday generic mint-waxed floss.  I settled on this one and I love it for two reasons.  First, it&#x27;s wider and flatter than typical flosses, so it doesn&#x27;t dig into your fingers when you wrap it around them, making it much more comfortable on the hands to floss.  Second, it slides (glides, even!) incredibly easily in and out of the spaces between teeth, without ever getting stuck or needing to be forced.  This makes it possible to have a lot of control over how gently or firmly to floss; now I can floss three times a day without any discomfort.  The one thing I can&#x27;t evaluate it its claim to be whitening, because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough that I would be likely to see any whitening effects yet.    Bottom line: It&#x27;s absolutely worth the extra cost.  I will never go back to non-Glide floss.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use the glide floss over regular floss for me.  Like that this also has a small hint of scope in it to make my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> This floss is great at helping to whiten teeth. Mine always seemed to be dark between the teeth. Good price.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the store this is a good buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Glide since I first tried it several years ago; my dentists have given me other brands, but I invariably never use them.  The Glide floss doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my teeth, doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums, and doesn&#x27;t break as easily as some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Oral-B Satin floss is also good, but it tends to snag on the bottoms of my molars, so I still prefer the Glide floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really care about whether it has scope or any other marketing gimmicks; none of that stuff really gives any significant additional benefits.  If you want to use mouthwash, actually use mouthwash and swish for 60 seconds.  If you want to get your teeth whitened, you&#x27;ll have to pay a lot of money at a reputable dentist to have it it done properly.  I got this particular floss because it was the cheapest variant of the Glide floss when I purchased it, but the Crest Glide floss is certainly my favorite, and I&#x27;ll happily keep using it until something better comes out, or they choose to discontinue it for some reason.</li>
            <li> It whitens, it slides in and out of your teeth easily, and it has a minty taste. This floss is the \\&quot;thickest\\&quot; floss I have ever seen. It&#x27;s called 3-D floss for that reason and it makes flossing your teeth so much easier. I waste less floss because I don&#x27;t have to pull as much out and I don&#x27;t need to wind it many times around my fingers to floss (to hold the floss in place.) It doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums at all, (and it doesn&#x27;t hurt your fingers to wind it around your fingers.) Amazon packages these nicely and it ships fast! I recommend purchasing them in bulk from Amazon because this floss can be quite pricey. I first purchased it for about $5/pack from CVS. In bulk, $21.97 for 8 packs &#x3D; $2.75/pack so you save about 50%. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Omg everything I expected and more! Shipping was quick, too!!! I would definitely purchase again!!! I like buying in bulk and this is the perfect product to but in bulk! Amazing savings!</li>
            <li> I really do follow my dentist recommendation to floss, at least once, every day.  For that reason I am very fussy about the floss. It needs to be smooth so it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in between my teeth but it needs to be thick enough to be effective. Lastly I want a flavor that I really like.  This one with the Scope flavor fits every preference. I also love being able to order it in quantity from Amazon since i do go through quite a bit of it.</li>
            <li> Your better off trying to floss with cooked sphagetti. This floss kept shredding only after 2 used. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> This is a very effective product, a must have  for flossing your beautiful teeth.</li>
            <li> Okay as floss.  The whitening aspect is just a sales gimic.</li>
            <li> This work wonders for me! I floss after every meal so that&#x27;s around 8 meals a day and this product works flawlessly. They&#x27;re pretty tough and with stand my razor sharp plaque that I&#x27;ve been working on. Just one cartridge lasts me a long time!! They&#x27;re pretty refreshing too..</li>
            <li> First the value, at the grocery store this floss sales for $5 or $6. I got 8 packs for $27.92! I have beautiful white teeth because I whitened, but the gels never gets to the tight spot between my teeth, so there was yellow discoloration. Well only after a week of flossing with this the discoloration was gone. The floss is also strong. It isn&#x27;t overly thick but it also doesn&#x27;t break easily. I also don&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping off my fingers or cutting into them. I love this floss. I have been using it for 2 months and plan to keep with it as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> Lies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought all the whitening floss I could find to see how I like them.  They all do things that (supposedly) whiten teeth, whether it be lots of small ridges, rough surfaces, or coating of baking soda.  How does this one whiten teeth?  The little blurb on the back of the package tells you: &amp;#34;by removing plaque which can lead to unsightly tartar&amp;#34;.  Which is exactly what every floss in the world is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some show that little * text in the back.  Some listings give it as part of the listing.  Sadly this listing does not indicate the whitening comes from flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By buying this I just got less floss than usual Glide packages of similar shape, which started at 54.7 yards (50 meters), then went to 43.7 yards and now 38.2 yards because it is &amp;#34;3D whitening&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least the other whitening flosses try.</li>
            <li> this floss breaks all the time in the most inopportune times while flossing, leaving fragments of floss between your teeth.  Do not use if you have crowded teeth!!!</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth and assuages my vanity!</li>
            <li> I like this floss MUCH better than other Glide products (like this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XDQ76M/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_title)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I usually have is that the floss constantly breaks (almost every time I use it, with the one above). This floss holds together a lot better, and it rarely tears on me.</li>
            <li> I just got dental implants and the mouthwash that you have to use causes staining on all teeth. This floss really helps to keep it at bay.</li>
