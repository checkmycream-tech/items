            <li>Very effective moisturizer and I</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that my skin is also feeling MOISTURIZED!</li>
            <li>Sooooo nice!  </li>
            <li>The smell was also not anything to pleasant either for being something that was non-scented.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer as it is non-irritating and not too greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-It is made with good ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a good price.</li>
            <li>Good brand.</li>
            <li>Good BODY moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>But I thought I can bear the smell if it is good on my skin.</li>
            <li>It was a great price and a nice sized jar.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Nice day cream for a fair price.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and this price sure beat out 90+ dollars!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I have!    </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>and it smells good (very light scent) .</li>
            <li>I have to say i&#x27;m very happy with it, my skin always feel great after using it, I&#x27;ll likely be buying it again after I run out</li>
            <li>It will be a great moisturizer for summer, but for winter I prefer Jason Vitamin E 5,000, which has a bit more oil to make sure my skin is moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>Make-up goes on over it very easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know there is a moisturizer out there that is healthy for your skin, instead of clogging up your pores.    </li>
            <li>Perfect for my sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>, I put it in an old clinique pump bottle that I cleaned out and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Price too good to be true...</li>
            <li>Sincerely,  A. Sorin</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it during the day in the winter, but I mostly use it at night.</li>
            <li>skin type is oily with most of the oil being on my T-zone.</li>
            <li>For the combination of price &amp; quality &amp; gentleness, it&#x27;s one of the better face lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x60;s great cream for 4 dollars, and if you have an oily skin, because it doesn&#x60;t really moisturize.</li>
            <li>I have tried two Desert Essence face products and have enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li>I am going to try more Desert Essence products and pass them on to my family.</li>
            <li>Love this, creamy and great texture, good rating on EWG skin deep guide.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give your skin that quenched thirst feeling that many moisturizers do, but I guess it is ok.</li>
            <li>Coupled with the awesome low price, I couldn&#x27;t resist, I decided I&#x27;d give it a go.</li>
            <li>It means a lot to me to get such wonderful help when needed!</li>
            <li>Love This product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave that oily look because I have oily skin too and most moisturizers leave me looking like a grease</li>
            <li>If you use this on your face, you may break out more.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My favorite face lotion, also use for hands on occasion.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just trying this moisturizer and am really pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>love it, been using it for years exclusively.  </li>
            <li>i was finally able to find it on amazon</li>
            <li>i love this truly, all-natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This company was fast, efficient, and courteous!  </li>
            <li>If you want soft and lovely skin this is a great purchase for the price and results.</li>
            <li>If you, LIKE ME, enjoy having the occasional great customer service than order form these guys!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if your looking for a nice moisturizer!</li>
            <li>i normally make my own but have stopped because this is so nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lite and good to wear under foundation.</li>
            <li>This cream works great on my face, keeps it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is light and milky, spreads and dissolves into your skin super easily!</li>
            <li>We used to love this moisturizer - it was so cool and soothing and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It feels kind of sticky when you first  apply it</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is cheap, natural, doesn&#x27;t clog skin, and makes me look like i have this flawless look only this moisturizer has been able to provide me!</li>
            <li>Lightly scented, fairly light moisturizer for bedtime routine (it would proabaly make a better morning moisturizer if you also use a sunscreen or makeup with a significant SPF).</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>and I was quickly taken care of and not charged twice!</li>
            <li>On a positive note, i did finally find an awesome moisturizer that is working wonders for me..</li>
            <li>Kiss My Face&#x27;s Potent and Pure line) that seem to do a better job at brightening and improving my skin tone/appearance.</li>
            <li>You feel it absorbed into the skin, and not sitting on top of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Could not use under my makeup because it caused the makeup not to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This product is marketed as non-toxic, fragrance free, gluten free and vegan.</li>
            <li>Smooth and light weight texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light smell-wise, which I like.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>I recommend you try, cheap and you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li>Light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great buy.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, almost no fragrance, and not oily.</li>
            <li>Most have too much fragrance or too many chemicals.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, all natural ingredients , and feels good</li>
            <li>However, for use on your body it is a good natural alternative.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a very economical product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no icky chemicals here, and no concerns about what i am putting on my face, love it!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>The price is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I use their Thoroughly Clean face wash</li>
            <li>A great natural lotion free of chemicals that is decently priced.</li>
            <li>no matter how clean they are.</li>
            <li>My skin immediately turned bright red and felt on fire.</li>
            <li>After a minute or so, my face started to break out in a bright red rash and my skin was on fire.  </li>
            <li>Sure doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li>I was looking on EWG Skin Deep for a safe moisturizer with a decent price point and good ratings, and this was it.  </li>
            <li>Kinda makes my face feel super oily.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and no residue.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I just use it else where even though I was hoping to find a nice and fairly priced daily facial cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth the cheap price and seemingly good for you brand.</li>
            <li>It almost feels like it gets absorbed too quickly and that I need to rehydrate my skin again within an hour or two.</li>
            <li>We both love it and it works so well, even for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I hope they will improve their product so we with sensitive faces may love it again.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice moisturizer especially for summer.</li>
            <li>I thought because it was organic I would be better for my slightly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is rich, goes on very smoothly, and keeps my entire face moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>It used to be a great gentle moisturizer for my sensitive face, but now I can only apply it on other parts of my body &amp; had to resume the search for the perfect natural face</li>
            <li>it is so soft to put on , you can feel it right away, i love it.</li>
            <li>The reviews were right again....</li>
            <li>soaks right in.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>This creme absorbs pretty quickly into my skin but it feels like it leaves somewhat of a residue afterward that may be clogging my pores in this hot summer.  </li>
            <li>Both the &#x27;facial moisturizer&#x27; and the &#x27;age reversal eye cream&#x27; are non greasy, quickly absorbed and have a very light scent that is not bothersome.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first jar on special at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable for this quality of cream.</li>
            <li>([...]) and at first, I noticed that I felt a bit of a burn and discomfort from both products.</li>
            <li>i use moisturizers all the time , for 40 years now , and for the price of dessert essence you get more than enough for your money.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t like how sticky it feels when I first apply it</li>
            <li>No, but seriously, I am in love with this product because it is the only face moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The first things I ordered were destroyed in the mail</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out from it and it keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazingly fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I like it so much!</li>
            <li>this is my favorite daily moisturizer for my face..</li>
            <li>most recent purchase made my entire face burn and turn bright red.</li>
            <li>It has a low skin deep rating, which is always good.</li>
            <li>Now while it has the same cool, soothing, non-greasy feel to it, is gives both me and my husband a rash!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product because I needed a few dollars to push me into free shipping and figured it was something worth trying.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a nice and fairly cheap moisturizer, but not good for use with acne treatment.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, this may work better for you.</li>
            <li>The company shipped my products quickly and everything was taken care professionally.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s tough for me to find a good moisturizer that won&#x27;t leave me super oily.</li>
            <li>It spreads nicely and has little fragrance.</li>
            <li>I appreciated for given me the opportunity to express my opinion.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t feel like your skin really absorbs it</li>
            <li>I use them when I have to, but they make me shudder when they are really greasy.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizing cream because it does not have any Fragrance added and is perfectly gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my face very well...</li>
            <li>I usually really like Dessert Essence products</li>
            <li>It really smells like pee.</li>
            <li>The reviews seemed promising.</li>
            <li>And works really well.</li>
            <li>They all seemed to leave my skin oily by mid-day, and aside from the grease, my skin really wasn&#x27;t &#x27;glowing&#x27; as some claimed, or feeling any smoother, etc.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I have VERY acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This one is organic, creamy and works really well on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very water-based and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or dries out too fast.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s gentle to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>It keeps me from being greasy, and I can slather as much of it on as I need without breaking out.</li>
            <li>My face goes from super oily to super dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good value at least from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use this one mainly at night and all though it can leave me a bit oily if I use too much if I use it in the morning</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like overpowering scents on most beauty products, honestly, certainly not ones going on my FACE!    </li>
            <li>It definitely moisturizes, but isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin totally hydrated while drying super fast.</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be surprised at how much you like it!</li>
            <li>The tub of it is very very light, I actually thought it might be empty when I first picked it up.</li>
            <li>My skin is more supple and less scaly.  </li>
            <li>High quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I tried using the products separately as well as together, and thought that maybe it was normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for some kind of product to use for daily moisturizing, and I somehow came up with the idea of less processed moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have used so many harsh products in the past and my face feels so much better now.</li>
            <li>I have finally found a petroleum-free, fragrance-free moisturizer that is gentle, non-greasy and very affordable.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>WOW!   </li>
            <li>I have normal - dry skin in the winter, and this lotion soaks right in without feeling oily.  </li>
            <li>I also felt it left my skin unusually oily and increased my acne.  </li>
            <li>It took weeks for my skin to stop feeling sensitive and</li>
            <li>like that this is a natural product.</li>
            <li>Luxurious,  soft  and</li>
            <li>Now, my skin is baby soft all the time and those lines have completely disappeared for now.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that also tends to break out</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It feels pretty lightweight (once it sets on your skin).&lt;br /&gt;-The product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>So I wanted to try something natural and herbal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural moisturizer for my sensitive skin for awhile now</li>
            <li>I had been using another, also natural, with no harmful substances.  </li>
            <li>It really is the \\&quot;Essential</li>
            <li>I do not need to use that much product each time I moisturize (when compared to traditional moisturizers.)    </li>
            <li>So, I tried Desert Essence because it came up on a when I was researching &amp;#34;lotion for sensitive skin.&amp;#34; I will never buy anything else if I can help it, and I&#x27;ve recommended it to others already.</li>
            <li>makes my face soft not greasy at all</li>
            <li>i am frequently told i do not look my age</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty normal on the other areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s disappointing because the texture is very nice</li>
            <li>Finally, it does not bother my skin at all, and I have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product as well as the 32-oz face wash and almond facial scrub!</li>
            <li>I live in northern Arizona where the humidity is very low.  </li>
            <li>its soaks into my skin like no other moisturizer..</li>
            <li>- a reasonably good-smelling lotion  - a slightly oily moisturizer that can feel a bit greasy or leave some shine  - good on sensitive skin, or skin recovering from a lot of sun/dryness,  - BUT not a good idea for acne-prone skin due to the oil    </li>
            <li>Desert Essence Essential Moisturizer is packed with lots of natural ingredients and has no added fragrances</li>
            <li>Barely any scent.  </li>
            <li>The product is thick and goes on smoothly.    </li>
            <li>My skin is not really dry so for me it is a bit heavy under makeup, but if you have dry skin it would probably work fine for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 4 years and, even though I may occasionally try something new, I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>I have dry, flaky skin, so the moisturizer is not heavy enough for winter conditions.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very nice product!  </li>
            <li> * Good price!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy.......</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product that I have re-ordered twice already so that I don&#x27;t ever run out when I need it.</li>
            <li> your skin will look GREAT.</li>
            <li> For the money it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for I think 2 years now i like it great under makeup or not.</li>
            <li> Great as day cream or night cream.</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Very effective moisturizer and I</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that my skin is also feeling MOISTURIZED!</li>
            <li> Sooooo nice!  </li>
            <li> The smell was also not anything to pleasant either for being something that was non-scented.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer as it is non-irritating and not too greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is made with good ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a good price.</li>
            <li> Good brand.</li>
            <li> Good BODY moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> But I thought I can bear the smell if it is good on my skin.</li>
            <li> It was a great price and a nice sized jar.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Nice day cream for a fair price.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and this price sure beat out 90+ dollars!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I have!    </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this cream!</li>
            <li> and it smells good (very light scent) .</li>
            <li> I have to say i&#x27;m very happy with it, my skin always feel great after using it, I&#x27;ll likely be buying it again after I run out</li>
            <li> It will be a great moisturizer for summer, but for winter I prefer Jason Vitamin E 5,000, which has a bit more oil to make sure my skin is moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Make-up goes on over it very easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know there is a moisturizer out there that is healthy for your skin, instead of clogging up your pores.    </li>
            <li> Perfect for my sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> , I put it in an old clinique pump bottle that I cleaned out and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Price too good to be true...</li>
            <li> Sincerely,  A. Sorin</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it during the day in the winter, but I mostly use it at night.</li>
            <li> skin type is oily with most of the oil being on my T-zone.</li>
            <li> For the combination of price &amp; quality &amp; gentleness, it&#x27;s one of the better face lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x60;s great cream for 4 dollars, and if you have an oily skin, because it doesn&#x60;t really moisturize.</li>
            <li> I have tried two Desert Essence face products and have enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li> I am going to try more Desert Essence products and pass them on to my family.</li>
            <li> Love this, creamy and great texture, good rating on EWG skin deep guide.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give your skin that quenched thirst feeling that many moisturizers do, but I guess it is ok.</li>
            <li> Coupled with the awesome low price, I couldn&#x27;t resist, I decided I&#x27;d give it a go.</li>
            <li> It means a lot to me to get such wonderful help when needed!</li>
            <li> Love This product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave that oily look because I have oily skin too and most moisturizers leave me looking like a grease</li>
            <li> If you use this on your face, you may break out more.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My favorite face lotion, also use for hands on occasion.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just trying this moisturizer and am really pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> love it, been using it for years exclusively.  </li>
            <li> i was finally able to find it on amazon</li>
            <li> i love this truly, all-natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This company was fast, efficient, and courteous!  </li>
            <li> If you want soft and lovely skin this is a great purchase for the price and results.</li>
            <li> If you, LIKE ME, enjoy having the occasional great customer service than order form these guys!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if your looking for a nice moisturizer!</li>
            <li> i normally make my own but have stopped because this is so nice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lite and good to wear under foundation.</li>
            <li> This cream works great on my face, keeps it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light and milky, spreads and dissolves into your skin super easily!</li>
            <li> We used to love this moisturizer - it was so cool and soothing and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It feels kind of sticky when you first  apply it</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is cheap, natural, doesn&#x27;t clog skin, and makes me look like i have this flawless look only this moisturizer has been able to provide me!</li>
            <li> Lightly scented, fairly light moisturizer for bedtime routine (it would proabaly make a better morning moisturizer if you also use a sunscreen or makeup with a significant SPF).</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> and I was quickly taken care of and not charged twice!</li>
            <li> On a positive note, i did finally find an awesome moisturizer that is working wonders for me..</li>
            <li> Kiss My Face&#x27;s Potent and Pure line) that seem to do a better job at brightening and improving my skin tone/appearance.</li>
            <li> You feel it absorbed into the skin, and not sitting on top of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could not use under my makeup because it caused the makeup not to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This product is marketed as non-toxic, fragrance free, gluten free and vegan.</li>
            <li> Smooth and light weight texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light smell-wise, which I like.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> I recommend you try, cheap and you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> Light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great buy.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, almost no fragrance, and not oily.</li>
            <li> Most have too much fragrance or too many chemicals.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, all natural ingredients , and feels good</li>
            <li> However, for use on your body it is a good natural alternative.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a very economical product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no icky chemicals here, and no concerns about what i am putting on my face, love it!</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> The price is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I use their Thoroughly Clean face wash</li>
            <li> A great natural lotion free of chemicals that is decently priced.</li>
            <li> no matter how clean they are.</li>
            <li> My skin immediately turned bright red and felt on fire.</li>
            <li> After a minute or so, my face started to break out in a bright red rash and my skin was on fire.  </li>
            <li> Sure doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li> I was looking on EWG Skin Deep for a safe moisturizer with a decent price point and good ratings, and this was it.  </li>
            <li> Kinda makes my face feel super oily.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and no residue.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just use it else where even though I was hoping to find a nice and fairly priced daily facial cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the cheap price and seemingly good for you brand.</li>
            <li> It almost feels like it gets absorbed too quickly and that I need to rehydrate my skin again within an hour or two.</li>
            <li> We both love it and it works so well, even for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I hope they will improve their product so we with sensitive faces may love it again.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice moisturizer especially for summer.</li>
            <li> I thought because it was organic I would be better for my slightly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is rich, goes on very smoothly, and keeps my entire face moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> It used to be a great gentle moisturizer for my sensitive face, but now I can only apply it on other parts of my body &amp; had to resume the search for the perfect natural face</li>
            <li> it is so soft to put on , you can feel it right away, i love it.</li>
            <li> The reviews were right again....</li>
            <li> soaks right in.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> This creme absorbs pretty quickly into my skin but it feels like it leaves somewhat of a residue afterward that may be clogging my pores in this hot summer.  </li>
            <li> Both the &#x27;facial moisturizer&#x27; and the &#x27;age reversal eye cream&#x27; are non greasy, quickly absorbed and have a very light scent that is not bothersome.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first jar on special at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel soft and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable for this quality of cream.</li>
            <li> ([...]) and at first, I noticed that I felt a bit of a burn and discomfort from both products.</li>
            <li> i use moisturizers all the time , for 40 years now , and for the price of dessert essence you get more than enough for your money.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t like how sticky it feels when I first apply it</li>
            <li> No, but seriously, I am in love with this product because it is the only face moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The first things I ordered were destroyed in the mail</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out from it and it keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Amazingly fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I like it so much!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite daily moisturizer for my face..</li>
            <li> most recent purchase made my entire face burn and turn bright red.</li>
            <li> It has a low skin deep rating, which is always good.</li>
            <li> Now while it has the same cool, soothing, non-greasy feel to it, is gives both me and my husband a rash!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product because I needed a few dollars to push me into free shipping and figured it was something worth trying.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a nice and fairly cheap moisturizer, but not good for use with acne treatment.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this may work better for you.</li>
            <li> The company shipped my products quickly and everything was taken care professionally.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s tough for me to find a good moisturizer that won&#x27;t leave me super oily.</li>
            <li> It spreads nicely and has little fragrance.</li>
            <li> I appreciated for given me the opportunity to express my opinion.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t feel like your skin really absorbs it</li>
            <li> I use them when I have to, but they make me shudder when they are really greasy.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizing cream because it does not have any Fragrance added and is perfectly gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my face very well...</li>
            <li> I usually really like Dessert Essence products</li>
            <li> It really smells like pee.</li>
            <li> The reviews seemed promising.</li>
            <li> And works really well.</li>
            <li> They all seemed to leave my skin oily by mid-day, and aside from the grease, my skin really wasn&#x27;t &#x27;glowing&#x27; as some claimed, or feeling any smoother, etc.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I have VERY acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This one is organic, creamy and works really well on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very water-based and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or dries out too fast.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s gentle to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> It keeps me from being greasy, and I can slather as much of it on as I need without breaking out.</li>
            <li> My face goes from super oily to super dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good value at least from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this one mainly at night and all though it can leave me a bit oily if I use too much if I use it in the morning</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like overpowering scents on most beauty products, honestly, certainly not ones going on my FACE!    </li>
            <li> It definitely moisturizes, but isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin totally hydrated while drying super fast.</li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;ll be surprised at how much you like it!</li>
            <li> The tub of it is very very light, I actually thought it might be empty when I first picked it up.</li>
            <li> My skin is more supple and less scaly.  </li>
            <li> High quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried using the products separately as well as together, and thought that maybe it was normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for some kind of product to use for daily moisturizing, and I somehow came up with the idea of less processed moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have used so many harsh products in the past and my face feels so much better now.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a petroleum-free, fragrance-free moisturizer that is gentle, non-greasy and very affordable.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> WOW!   </li>
            <li> I have normal - dry skin in the winter, and this lotion soaks right in without feeling oily.  </li>
            <li> I also felt it left my skin unusually oily and increased my acne.  </li>
            <li> It took weeks for my skin to stop feeling sensitive and</li>
            <li> like that this is a natural product.</li>
            <li> Luxurious,  soft  and</li>
            <li> Now, my skin is baby soft all the time and those lines have completely disappeared for now.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that also tends to break out</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It feels pretty lightweight (once it sets on your skin).&lt;br /&gt;-The product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to try something natural and herbal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural moisturizer for my sensitive skin for awhile now</li>
            <li> I had been using another, also natural, with no harmful substances.  </li>
            <li> It really is the \\&quot;Essential</li>
            <li> I do not need to use that much product each time I moisturize (when compared to traditional moisturizers.)    </li>
            <li> So, I tried Desert Essence because it came up on a when I was researching &amp;#34;lotion for sensitive skin.&amp;#34; I will never buy anything else if I can help it, and I&#x27;ve recommended it to others already.</li>
            <li> makes my face soft not greasy at all</li>
            <li> i am frequently told i do not look my age</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty normal on the other areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing because the texture is very nice</li>
            <li> Finally, it does not bother my skin at all, and I have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product as well as the 32-oz face wash and almond facial scrub!</li>
            <li> I live in northern Arizona where the humidity is very low.  </li>
            <li> its soaks into my skin like no other moisturizer..</li>
            <li> - a reasonably good-smelling lotion  - a slightly oily moisturizer that can feel a bit greasy or leave some shine  - good on sensitive skin, or skin recovering from a lot of sun/dryness,  - BUT not a good idea for acne-prone skin due to the oil    </li>
            <li> Desert Essence Essential Moisturizer is packed with lots of natural ingredients and has no added fragrances</li>
            <li> Barely any scent.  </li>
            <li> The product is thick and goes on smoothly.    </li>
            <li> My skin is not really dry so for me it is a bit heavy under makeup, but if you have dry skin it would probably work fine for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 years and, even though I may occasionally try something new, I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I have dry, flaky skin, so the moisturizer is not heavy enough for winter conditions.</li>
            <li> I found that my usual light moisturizer was not adequate.  </li>
            <li> It feels as if I brushed egg whites on my face and let it dry...</li>
            <li> I can only use it in the dry, winter months when I need added moisture.</li>
            <li> This cream sinks after a while in the skin, but I have the same feeling of dry skin later.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have tried a fairly wide variety of facial moisturizers.</li>
            <li> No reason to look elsewhere and  hope they continue this for a long time.</li>
            <li> But when I put it on it was very greasy and thick, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> the next day I used it on one half of my face with the same result.</li>
            <li> Have tried all different kinds of moisturizers, most of which are really bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> now, it&#x27;s dry, itchy, yucka skin.  </li>
            <li> Every day my skin looked just as dry.  </li>
            <li> above average lotion.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, and hence very sensitive skin, and I have had a hard time finding moisturizers that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I get paid very little in my customer service job, so I notice when a person has good service and bad service.</li>
            <li> not sure why my face reacted this way, but I&#x27;m really sad that it did, because I had been searching high and low for an all natural facial product, and all of my searching on Amazon pointed to this.</li>
            <li> we put it on and within 15 minutes both our faces are red and blotchy and have a slight burning feel.</li>
            <li> Not to dry nor too wet .</li>
            <li> Half of my face turned red with rush... will not use it again</li>
            <li> Another high expectations, and high disappointment.</li>
            <li> it only takes a little bit.......</li>
            <li> If I could put minus 5 stars, I would do it.  </li>
            <li> it started to tingle and burn and was really red for a few hours.</li>
            <li> but it turned my face red and burned like heck on my arms and legs where ever I had a small scratch.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again as there are other natural/organic products (e.g.,</li>
            <li> Get that, not this you will not be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I curiously picked up the little 4 oz jar of face moisturizer and started reading the captions.</li>
            <li> I had put a very little amount of cream on my face and in a few seconds my face was on fire and all red.</li>
            <li> and I just think it was too average to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have failed to see much of a difference between moisturizers which cost 20 bucks and ones which cost 5.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 hours for my rash to go down.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave you oily or feeling weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I had a slight chemical burn after using it when I had already used the scrub, pads, and then tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I initially wanted to go with Kiss My Face, but was unable to find it at the local Sprout&#x27;s Market (despite it being a \\&quot;certified\\&quot; carrier, smh).</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very subtle (and natural - geranium oil) and the cream is moisturizing without being heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin, but after washing it gets tight.</li>
            <li> little lines went where?  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling a little bit greasy.</li>
            <li> Burns a little if I use a lot.</li>
            <li> It is not scented, so I used a little orange oil to give it a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused with the facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It started out as just a prickly pink, then went itchy and red, and eventually broke out into a severe burn, and was extremely painful and peeled for several days.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/dry skin and have had trouble keeping breakouts under control while not drying out patches of my skin.</li>
            <li> and I use it twice a day almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Now I use it for the body, after adding few drops or aromatherapy oils.</li>
            <li> My Face product would suddenly appear from thin air, my eyes gazed upon the Desert Essence products.</li>
            <li> These leaves me looking smooth, like I&#x27;m wearing base almost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday for years.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> and I am just a little bit past halfway through with it</li>
            <li> Face creams can be expensive, this one I think is about average on price but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It goes on very light and doesn&#x27;t leave that awful oily residue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am not satisfied with this products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was moving around the time i purchased this and couldn&#x27;t try it until recently.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer in the past with no issues.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.  </li>
            <li> A 4 oz cannister usually lasts me about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> &amp; there&#x27;s hardly any fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is thick and does not rub in well, leaving a whiter look to my face (although this gradually goes away).  </li>
            <li> This is a descent, thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got tired of trying medications because they usually will harm the liver over an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> and I saw some faint wrinkles showing up on my skin from the damage I was doing to it with harsh chemicals in the acne moisturizers and gels.</li>
            <li> However, the product is not good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Firstly the cream smelled really weird, bad weird.</li>
            <li> I did not get the product I ordered - was disappointed they did not offer to replace with the actual product ordered in exchange for the item received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and, in the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve had a horrible rash that burns like my face is on fire.</li>
            <li> After research, I realized that it contains sodium hydroxide (or lye) which is extremely caustic.  </li>
            <li> raw Shea butter!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Desert Essence changed the formula of this product somehow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there was something wrong with the one I bought</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reacted to any chemicals before, so it was really really weird for me.</li>
            <li> This is not a perfect miracle moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the moment I put it on my face</li>
            <li> However, after a few days of using this product, I ended up getting a severe burn all over my face, and broke out into a very painful rash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up having a horrible allergic reaction after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I am so sad to have to start the hunt for another moisturizer now :(</li>
            <li> We bought another jar just in case it was a bad batch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not just exaggerating a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I got really bad rash.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> It was AWFUL.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that because it&#x27;s been 30 days I cant even return this piece of junk.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am not satisfied with this products. I had put a very little amount of cream on my face and in a few seconds my face was on fire and all red. Even after I washed my face with the soap it was still burning. If I could put minus 5 stars, I would do it.  I appreciated for given me the opportunity to express my opinion. Sincerely,  A. Sorin</li>
            <li> I did not like the texture of this moisturizer.  It is thick and does not rub in well, leaving a whiter look to my face (although this gradually goes away).  I also felt it left my skin unusually oily and increased my acne.  Price too good to be true...</li>
            <li> I was using this product along with Desert Essence Tea Tree Cleansing Pads ([...]) and at first, I noticed that I felt a bit of a burn and discomfort from both products. I tried using the products separately as well as together, and thought that maybe it was normal. However, after a few days of using this product, I ended up getting a severe burn all over my face, and broke out into a very painful rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started out as just a prickly pink, then went itchy and red, and eventually broke out into a severe burn, and was extremely painful and peeled for several days. It took weeks for my skin to stop feeling sensitive and raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why my face reacted this way, but I&#x27;m really sad that it did, because I had been searching high and low for an all natural facial product, and all of my searching on Amazon pointed to this.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so it&#x27;s tough for me to find a good moisturizer that won&#x27;t leave me super oily. I use this one mainly at night and all though it can leave me a bit oily if I use too much if I use it in the morning it is perfect and one jar lasts me for months. Highly recommended if your looking for a nice moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Very effective moisturizer and I like that this is a natural product.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, and hence very sensitive skin, and I have had a hard time finding moisturizers that don&#x27;t irritate my skin. Most have too much fragrance or too many chemicals. Not this one. I have been using this for about 4 years and, even though I may occasionally try something new, I always come back to this one. The fragrance is very subtle (and natural - geranium oil) and the cream is moisturizing without being heavy or greasy. It absorbs quickly and feels refreshing. My skin is not really dry so for me it is a bit heavy under makeup, but if you have dry skin it would probably work fine for that purpose. I sometimes use it during the day in the winter, but I mostly use it at night. And the price is very reasonable for this quality of cream. I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know there is a moisturizer out there that is healthy for your skin, instead of clogging up your pores.    Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews about this product ...........figured this many people couldn&#x27;t be wrong......and this price sure beat out 90+ dollars!  Had oily skin forever......now, it&#x27;s dry, itchy, yucka skin.  Sure doesn&#x27;t take much but WOW!   Luxurious,  soft  and little lines went where?  The reviews were right again....used  everywhere.......BABY SKIN !!!    I&#x27;m so happy.......this stuff really works n&#x27; it only takes a little bit....... intend to have one ahead!   Oh, go ahead ....give it a try,  you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> I have finally found a petroleum-free, fragrance-free moisturizer that is gentle, non-greasy and very affordable.  I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i use moisturizers all the time , for 40 years now , and for the price of dessert essence you get more than enough for your money. it is so soft to put on , you can feel it right away, i love it.</li>
            <li> Feels sticky going on and then when the stickiness is gone, my skin feels like I didn&#x27;t put any moisturizer on it at all. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> We used to love this moisturizer - it was so cool and soothing and not greasy at all. Now while it has the same cool, soothing, non-greasy feel to it, is gives both me and my husband a rash! We bought another jar just in case it was a bad batch and we are still having the same problem...we put it on and within 15 minutes both our faces are red and blotchy and have a slight burning feel. We don&#x27;t use soap on our face so there is no chemical reaction happening or anything...I don&#x27;t know if they changed their formula or what, but I am so sad to have to start the hunt for another moisturizer now :(</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/dry skin and have had trouble keeping breakouts under control while not drying out patches of my skin. I am so happy with this product that I have re-ordered twice already so that I don&#x27;t ever run out when I need it. I use it in the morning and at night. The jojoba oil just works so well with my skin and the moisturizer soaks right in. I am in my mid 20s and I saw some faint wrinkles showing up on my skin from the damage I was doing to it with harsh chemicals in the acne moisturizers and gels. Now, my skin is baby soft all the time and those lines have completely disappeared for now. I use only the Desert Essence face wash, face scrub and this moisturizer, and I no longer get breakouts like I used to.    I highly reccommend this product as well as the 32-oz face wash and almond facial scrub!</li>
            <li> no icky chemicals here, and no concerns about what i am putting on my face, love it! i even bought three</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle-aged guy.  This cream works great on my face, keeps it soft and smooth.  I like that it isn&#x27;t smelly or greasy.</li>
            <li> I like this. It makes my face feel soft and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. I use it after I have washed my face for the night.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Desert Essence changed the formula of this product somehow. It used to be a great gentle moisturizer for my sensitive face, but now I can only apply it on other parts of my body &amp; had to resume the search for the perfect natural face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;My most recent purchase made my entire face burn and turn bright red. It&#x27;s disappointing because the texture is very nice &amp; there&#x27;s hardly any fragrance. I hope they will improve their product so we with sensitive faces may love it again.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer as it is non-irritating and not too greasy.  I have sensitive skin that also tends to break out and this product has improved my complexion.</li>
            <li> Face creams can be expensive, this one I think is about average on price but a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s thicker than some but the texture works since it&#x27;s in the jar. Would also like to see this product with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have had this moisturizer for about 6 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is oily with most of the oil being on my T-zone. My skin is pretty normal on the other areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It feels pretty lightweight (once it sets on your skin).&lt;br /&gt;-The product lasts a long time. I have had it for about 6 months and I am just a little bit past halfway through with it and I use it twice a day almost everyday. So it&#x27;s a very economical product.&lt;br /&gt;-It is made with good ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-It feels kind of sticky when you first  apply it and I just did not like that at all.&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t feel like your skin really absorbs it that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this moisturizer is very, very basic. It has a good price. However, I don&#x27;t like how sticky it feels when I first apply it and I just think it was too average to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Desert Essence products. I have very sensitive skin and I find that D.E. products cause no reaction at all. I use their Thoroughly Clean face wash every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand moisturizers. I use them when I have to, but they make me shudder when they are really greasy. This moisturizer is the perfect companion for the face wash. It goes on very light and doesn&#x27;t leave that awful oily residue. You feel it absorbed into the skin, and not sitting on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have skin that is happiest when left alone, when not hit with chemicals in cleansers and creams, give Desert Essence a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there was something wrong with the one I bought but it turned my face red and burned like heck on my arms and legs where ever I had a small scratch. I took it back.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this cream often. We both love it and it works so well, even for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, all natural ingredients , and feels good</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizing cream because it does not have any Fragrance added and is perfectly gentle on my face. If you want soft and lovely skin this is a great purchase for the price and results.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented, fairly light moisturizer for bedtime routine (it would proabaly make a better morning moisturizer if you also use a sunscreen or makeup with a significant SPF). No miracles, but I would definitely use it again. For the combination of price &amp; quality &amp; gentleness, it&#x27;s one of the better face lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like cosmetic products or anything on my face for that matter....But, my skin needs care, of course, so I tried this after many expensive and \\&quot;wholesome\\&quot; products and this is the ONLY one that works for me! I&#x27;d recommend this and the face wash to anyone!</li>
            <li> Another high expectations, and high disappointment. Yes, that&#x60;s great cream for 4 dollars, and if you have an oily skin, because it doesn&#x60;t really moisturize. I have a combination skin, but after washing it gets tight. This cream sinks after a while in the skin, but I have the same feeling of dry skin later. It has no glide.   Now I use it for the body, after adding few drops or aromatherapy oils. I won&#x60;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because of the &#x27;low hazard&#x27; rating on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep site. It definitely moisturizes, but isn&#x27;t anything special. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again as there are other natural/organic products (e.g., Kiss My Face&#x27;s Potent and Pure line) that seem to do a better job at brightening and improving my skin tone/appearance.</li>
            <li> Nice day cream for a fair price. Good brand.</li>
            <li> It works great! Especially in combination with desert essence face wash and desert essence cleansing pads. I will definitely continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I discovered dessert essence when I was looking up herbs for how to treat acne.  It&#x27;s a bit of a frustration being in my 30&#x27;s and having the same issue a teenager would.  I didn&#x27;t develop any acne until I was 21.  From there on, it&#x27;s been ups and downs. I got tired of trying medications because they usually will harm the liver over an extended period of time. So I wanted to try something natural and herbal. I started with Tea Tree Oil and it cleaned up my skin a lot! I purchased the pads they have, and between the two, it did an excellent job clearing up the scorched skin.   I&#x27;m a little confused with the facial moisturizer.  Is it best to use it alone? Day or night? I had a slight chemical burn after using it when I had already used the scrub, pads, and then tea tree oil. I was hoping this would be the next step into repairing the damage the acne has done on my skin over the years.</li>
            <li> Works well for night time use. Could not use under my makeup because it caused the makeup not to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have tried two Desert Essence face products and have enjoyed using them. Both the &#x27;facial moisturizer&#x27; and the &#x27;age reversal eye cream&#x27; are non greasy, quickly absorbed and have a very light scent that is not bothersome. I am going to try more Desert Essence products and pass them on to my family.</li>
            <li> Kinda makes my face feel super oily. Doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my face very well... My face goes from super oily to super dry. It feels as if I brushed egg whites on my face and let it dry... Not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> This is a descent, thick moisturizer. I usually really like Dessert Essence products so I was excited to try it. It leaves my skin feeling a little bit greasy. It also smells like pee, literally. I&#x27;m not just exaggerating a bad smell. It really smells like pee. If they could fix the smell, I would probably give this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural moisturizer for my sensitive skin for awhile now and i thought this stuff was going to be awesome. The reviews seemed promising. I&#x27;ve seen this at my local health food store being sold for 20 bucks, so i figured it had to be legit. The instant i put it on my face it started to tingle and burn and was really red for a few hours. Total bummer. I should have known if it&#x27;s not edible you shouldn&#x27;t put it on your face! On a positive note, i did finally find an awesome moisturizer that is working wonders for me.. raw Shea butter!!! No additives, no preservatives, simplicity is best. Get that, not this you will not be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!! Unfortunately I was moving around the time i purchased this and couldn&#x27;t try it until recently. It was AWFUL. My skin immediately turned bright red and felt on fire. This product is marketed as non-toxic, fragrance free, gluten free and vegan. What they don&#x27;t advertise is that it also contains sodium hydroxide, also known as LYE. It took about 3 hours for my rash to go down. The worst part is that because it&#x27;s been 30 days I cant even return this piece of junk. It&#x27;s not worth the cheap price and seemingly good for you brand. STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li> Love this, creamy and great texture, good rating on EWG skin deep guide. Use it daily and will get again.</li>
            <li> use every day for skin and hair. High quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> This creme absorbs pretty quickly into my skin but it feels like it leaves somewhat of a residue afterward that may be clogging my pores in this hot summer.  It almost feels like it gets absorbed too quickly and that I need to rehydrate my skin again within an hour or two. I have combination skin by the way.</li>
            <li> I did not get the product I ordered - was disappointed they did not offer to replace with the actual product ordered in exchange for the item received.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give your skin that quenched thirst feeling that many moisturizers do, but I guess it is ok. It has a low skin deep rating, which is always good.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer in the past with no issues. Bought it from Amazon and it caused an allergic reaction on my face. They either changed their recipe or Amazon is selling a different version. Will never trust this product again.</li>
            <li> A great natural lotion free of chemicals that is decently priced. I can only use it in the dry, winter months when I need added moisture. It&#x27;s too oily for my skin in the summer time and I have to switch to an oil-free moisturizer with a SPF.  Update: The lotion I ordered back in March did NOT have parabens. I&#x27;m looking at the ingredients now (July) I see Methylparaben. Did they change their formula? If so I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> Very nice product!  Smooth and light weight texture. Recommend by a friend and I recommended to others. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice moisturizer especially for summer. I&#x27;m fifty something and this moisturizer works well. It has the added bonus of being really low on the toxicity scale (per Environmental Working Group). It&#x27;s also a good value at least from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my daily moisturizer. And works really well. Not to dry nor too wet . Just right.</li>
            <li> above average lotion.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have tried a fairly wide variety of facial moisturizers. I have failed to see much of a difference between moisturizers which cost 20 bucks and ones which cost 5. They all seemed to leave my skin oily by mid-day, and aside from the grease, my skin really wasn&#x27;t &#x27;glowing&#x27; as some claimed, or feeling any smoother, etc. I feel like some even worsened my pores! I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for some kind of product to use for daily moisturizing, and I somehow came up with the idea of less processed moisturizers. I researched some and compared/contrasted ingredients, reviews, prices, etc. all that. I initially wanted to go with Kiss My Face, but was unable to find it at the local Sprout&#x27;s Market (despite it being a \\&quot;certified\\&quot; carrier, smh). As I stood there in the beauty section staring glumly at the shelves, wishing a Kiss My Face product would suddenly appear from thin air, my eyes gazed upon the Desert Essence products. I curiously picked up the little 4 oz jar of face moisturizer and started reading the captions. Coupled with the awesome low price, I couldn&#x27;t resist, I decided I&#x27;d give it a go. I&#x27;m so glad I have!    This moisturizer is light and milky, spreads and dissolves into your skin super easily! A little goes a long way! I can honestly say that my skin is also feeling MOISTURIZED! Imagine that, from a moisturizer! Who would of thunk it, eh? No, but seriously, I am in love with this product because it is the only face moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy by the end of the day. It&#x27;s light smell-wise, which I like. I don&#x27;t like overpowering scents on most beauty products, honestly, certainly not ones going on my FACE!    So do give this product a try! WORTH IT! Look at that price, look at that ingredient list, just give it a go! You know you want to!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product because I needed a few dollars to push me into free shipping and figured it was something worth trying. I have to say i&#x27;m very happy with it, my skin always feel great after using it, I&#x27;ll likely be buying it again after I run out but with tiny amount needed to use this stuff the jar will probably last me a year.</li>
            <li> I get paid very little in my customer service job, so I notice when a person has good service and bad service. This company was fast, efficient, and courteous!  The first things I ordered were destroyed in the mail and I was quickly taken care of and not charged twice! I would reorder from these guys ANYTIME!!! If you, LIKE ME, enjoy having the occasional great customer service than order form these guys! Thank you ! It means a lot to me to get such wonderful help when needed! FIVE HUNDRED STARS!&lt;br /&gt;Aundrea</li>
            <li> This stuff perplexes me. The tub of it is very very light, I actually thought it might be empty when I first picked it up. But when I put it on it was very greasy and thick, which I don&#x27;t like. I ended up having a horrible allergic reaction after using it for a few days. I&#x27;ve never reacted to any chemicals before, so it was really really weird for me.</li>
            <li> This is not a perfect miracle moisturizer. I used it as a day moisturizer for over a month and for me it was:    - a reasonably good-smelling lotion  - a slightly oily moisturizer that can feel a bit greasy or leave some shine  - good on sensitive skin, or skin recovering from a lot of sun/dryness,  - BUT not a good idea for acne-prone skin due to the oil    All in all, it&#x27;s a nice and fairly cheap moisturizer, but not good for use with acne treatment.</li>
            <li> Love This product. Cheap. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I have VERY acne prone skin. The slightest thing will break me out. These leaves me looking smooth, like I&#x27;m wearing base almost. It&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave that oily look because I have oily skin too and most moisturizers leave me looking like a grease monkey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is cheap, natural, doesn&#x27;t clog skin, and makes me look like i have this flawless look only this moisturizer has been able to provide me! No reason to look elsewhere and  hope they continue this for a long time. I recommend you try, cheap and you won&#x27;t regret it your skin will look GREAT.</li>
            <li> Good BODY moisturizer. If you use this on your face, you may break out more.  I noticed this with myself and then realized that nowhere on the package does it say &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;non-comedogenic&amp;#34;. However, for use on your body it is a good natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I always use this cream. I don&#x27;t break out from it and it keeps my skin soft and smooth. Absorbs quickly and no residue.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer.  I had been using another, also natural, with no harmful substances.  Every day my skin looked just as dry.  With Desert Essence, I can see that it&#x27;s moisturizing.  My skin is more supple and less scaly.  And, it&#x27;s not greasy!  I can&#x27;t believe I found this for the price.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Have tried all different kinds of moisturizers, most of which are really bad for your skin. This one is organic, creamy and works really well on my face. For the money it&#x27;s a great buy. I will keep buying it from now on! This is my third jar and counting. Try it and I think you&#x27;ll be surprised at how much you like it!</li>
            <li> Too greasy for my face. Ended up using it as body moisturizer to use it up. If you have dry skin, this may work better for you.</li>
            <li> I like using this on my hands and body, but for some reason it stings my face after applying it.  Then it feels bumpy and irritated.  Not sure why.  I just use it else where even though I was hoping to find a nice and fairly priced daily facial cream.  I&#x27;ll have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s very water-based and not oily at all. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I&#x27;ve used it everyday for years.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has been one of the best ones yet. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or dries out too fast. The company shipped my products quickly and everything was taken care professionally. Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. I use it on my face every morning before I put on makeup.  I like it because I tend to have a greasier face, but this moisturizer does not put any grease on my face.  I recommend this to anyone.  A 4 oz cannister usually lasts me about 6 months.  The price is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Amazingly fast shipping! Great product.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s very lite and good to wear under foundation. It spreads nicely and has little fragrance.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Burns a little if I use a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I&#x27;ve always had a fussy complexion.  Desert Essence Essential Moisturizer is packed with lots of natural ingredients and has no added fragrances so it&#x27;s gentle to my skin.  It really is the \\&quot;Essential Moisturizer\\&quot; for my skin. FIVE STARS!</li>
            <li> My husband I have used this product for years.  It&#x27;s an excellent daily moisturizer.  Light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> My favorite face lotion, also use for hands on occasion.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It is great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great buy.    * Good price!    * The product is thick and goes on smoothly.    * It does NOT leave an oily residue.    * I do not need to use that much product each time I moisturize (when compared to traditional moisturizers.)    * Finally, it does not bother my skin at all, and I have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for I think 2 years now i like it great under makeup or not. Great as day cream or night cream.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It is so creamy and non-greasy. Perfect for my sensitive, combination skin. Please do not discontinue!! I use it year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I put it in an old clinique pump bottle that I cleaned out and it works perfectly. That way I don&#x27;t have to worry about bacteria building up from constantly dipping my fingers in it -- no matter how clean they are.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just trying this moisturizer and am really pleased with the quality. It&#x27;s light, almost no fragrance, and not oily. I have dry, flaky skin, so the moisturizer is not heavy enough for winter conditions. Desert Essence is also committed to cruelty-free, enviro-conscious products. It will be a great moisturizer for summer, but for winter I prefer Jason Vitamin E 5,000, which has a bit more oil to make sure my skin is moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I wanted an organic moisturizing cream. Firstly the cream smelled really weird, bad weird. But I thought I can bear the smell if it is good on my skin. Unfortunately the moment I put it on my face I got really bad rash. But I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and the next day I used it on one half of my face with the same result. Half of my face turned red with rush... will not use it again</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used so many harsh products in the past and my face feels so much better now. No greasy feeling and no extra shine.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first jar on special at Whole Foods. It was a great price and a nice sized jar. However, the product is not good for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and, in the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve had a horrible rash that burns like my face is on fire. I could not figure out what it was until I used some of the moisturizer tonight (to soothe the rash.  After a minute or so, my face started to break out in a bright red rash and my skin was on fire.  I immediately washed it off and applied an ice pack.  It still is inflamed but not stinging anymore.  After research, I realized that it contains sodium hydroxide (or lye) which is extremely caustic.  I don&#x27;t know what the manufacturers were thinking!</li>
            <li> This lotion is a miracle. I break out from everything! I have been trying different lotions for 20 some years. So, I tried Desert Essence because it came up on a when I was researching &amp;#34;lotion for sensitive skin.&amp;#34; I will never buy anything else if I can help it, and I&#x27;ve recommended it to others already. It makes your skin totally hydrated while drying super fast. It keeps me from being greasy, and I can slather as much of it on as I need without breaking out. I wear it under makeup and put it on before bed. It is the best lotion ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff did not work well at all. I thought because it was organic I would be better for my slightly sensitive skin. But instead it burned and caused my face to break out into red splotches and left it feeling greasy. The smell was also not anything to pleasant either for being something that was non-scented.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! makes my face soft not greasy at all but yet moisturizes  and it smells good (very light scent) . I have purchased another I like it so much!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is wonderful.  I live in northern Arizona where the humidity is very low.  I found that my usual light moisturizer was not adequate.  I bought Desert Essence moisturizer initially in a health food store but went onto Amazon to purchase my second jar.  This cream is rich, goes on very smoothly, and keeps my entire face moisturized all day.  Make-up goes on over it very easily.  It is not scented, so I used a little orange oil to give it a fragrance.  Sooooo nice!  I love this cream!</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  I have normal - dry skin in the winter, and this lotion soaks right in without feeling oily.  Barely any scent.  I was looking on EWG Skin Deep for a safe moisturizer with a decent price point and good ratings, and this was it.  I am happy with my purchase and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> love it, been using it for years exclusively.  i am frequently told i do not look my age</li>
            <li> this is my favorite daily moisturizer for my face.. its soaks into my skin like no other moisturizer.. grateful i was finally able to find it on amazon</li>
            <li> Great stuff and no PEG! A fraction of the cost of the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; designer moisturizers, and works just as well.</li>
            <li> i love this truly, all-natural moisturizer.  i normally make my own but have stopped because this is so nice.  doesn&#x27;t leave you oily or feeling weighed down.  I highly recommend it.</li>
