            <li> Guys I really don&#x27;t think this is organic. I used all of dr. adorable and had to buy another bottle I found some cheaper at swansons website that is usda organic has the greenish tint and a slight smell of avocado. Dr. Adorable is more like olive oil is not usda stamped on bottle is not greenish in color or have a smell. Do yourselves some research and save you some $. Buy from Swanson&lt;br /&gt;God bless :)</li>
            <li> I am adding to some of Veg., I love this~!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product in my hair and am quite pleased with the result.&lt;br /&gt;It is not too heavy and makes my curly hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Good oil but wish it were in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer - works for hair and skin - nice for massage - my only problem is I don&#x27;t care for the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many oils for use in making my own organic mayonnaise.  This organic avocado oil has far surpassed the taste and lightness of any other oil I have tried.  Delicious!!</li>
            <li> Use for hair and skin. Great Product.</li>
            <li> I use this oil to mix with essential oils and really love it.  It is very soothing to the skin and a little goes a long way.  My only tiny complaint is that without the essential oils, it has a smell that is mildly unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again, as I love the consistency and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Delicious &amp; nutritiotious!</li>
            <li> Love buying my oils and butters from Dr. Adorable when they are available.  Once of my 1st purchases of oils or butters I purchased came from this excellent seller, so when I need I always search them first.</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I use it to take off my make up and also in any oil blends and lotions that I make. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t have any scent, soaks right into my skin and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The oil appears to be good quality. I recommend it despite the lack of other reviews so far. Don&#x27;t let the simple label and lack of big brand name deter you.</li>
            <li> I like the oil as a moisturizer for under my eyes.  I have sensitive skin and  the oil is not irritating to my face but I find my day/night face cream leaves a more smooth refined look.</li>
            <li> smells and feels like vegetable oil</li>
            <li> I made cream with it and it was very good. Love it.</li>
            <li> Cold pressed avocado oil is green not yellow.  I own an avocado orchard in San Diego and press oil.  Just thought you should know...</li>
            <li> Decent oil, works well for making lotions and creams.</li>
