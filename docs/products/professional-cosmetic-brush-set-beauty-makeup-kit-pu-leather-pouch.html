            <li>These brushes pick up a good amount of product and have not shed yet</li>

            <li>Good on price.</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that this came in 2 days.</li>
            <li>mines arrived in perfectly good condition and did not have any smell (like the plastic smell)</li>
            <li>I think this kit is a good buy.</li>
            <li>The bristles are good quality</li>
            <li>, The quality is incredible and the price is the best, This is definitely worth the buy and very cheap.</li>
            <li>I realized if I wanted to look good and get the best out of my makeup I needed the right tools.</li>

            <li>These brushes are very elegant and I will continue to buy Louise Maelys products.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps people who aren&#x27;t sure what the brushes are used for, the best thing to do is try them out and see what you are comfortable with.</li>

            <li>These are really the best affordable brushes you can find.</li>

            <li>Wifes liked these, but she had to air them out for a couple of days before she could use them.</li>
            <li>There were nice makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great set for a beginner since it&#x27;s not terribly expensive, and it&#x27;s also good for travel.  </li>

            <li>She says they are very easy to use and loves the length of the handles.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the quality of these brushes so far!</li>
            <li>Plus, since the hair is synthetic, these would be suitable for vegans.  </li>
            <li>Plus, since the hair is synthetic, these would be suitable for vegans.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the brushes themselves have been wonderful so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the perfect set to achieve professional make-up artist results at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I go through a lot of makeup brushes, being in opera and theater, and these are very economical as well as good quality.  </li>

            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I received these brushes today, and I am extremely satisfied.</li>

            <li>What an incredible set of brushes for a really low price!</li>
            <li>That would be great for all the non professional users to have a guide to go by and learn what all the brushes can be used for.</li>

            <li>this brushes is the only one that makes me happy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any bristle shedding and the bristles were securely fastened to the handles.  </li>

            <li>definitely worth buying !</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>If it lasts 6-9 months for me  was worth it!</li>

            <li>The makeup brushes are amazing and so soft!</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and I love them!</li>
            <li>I received the brushes a few days before estimated delivery, which I have to say is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Great set of brushes, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>such a good brush set</li>
            <li>and these brushes are just full of quality.</li>
            <li>They are soft and effective.</li>

            <li>so you can find which one works best for you, or have several (for example to use many colors of eyeshadow without getting them muddied up with other colors.)</li>
            <li>I spent hours researching the best makeup brushes and I&#x27;m so happy I chose these instead of spending a ridiculous amount of money on Mac or Bobbi Brown sets.</li>
            <li>so they are easy to use and they look pretty in my brush holder.</li>
            <li>I strongly believe every woman should have this brushes they could save so much money if they do!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need to buy another brush because you get every single kind that exists with this kit!</li>
            <li>but they are a great price for such a large set.</li>
            <li>Both my daughter loved these they are so great and very affordable, better quality then the expensive sets!</li>
            <li>Love these soft brushes!</li>
            <li>So soft, easy and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes, multiples in most, which is nice especially the eye brushes having a couple shadow brushes to work with at once.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing I&#x27;ve  bought 2 extra sets as gifts.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these brushes they are so soft and don&#x27;t shed one bit.</li>
            <li>So far I am enjoying these brushes.</li>
            <li>Having been semi-professionally \\&quot;in the black\\&quot; myself during college, I well know from personal experience that having one&#x27;s own set of tools, quality tools at that, is a needful thing for stage work.  </li>
            <li>The case itself is quite nice and sturdy although it did initially arrive with that \\&quot;plastic smell\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I am having a lot of fun with this brush set.</li>
            <li>For the price, I feel that this is a steal, and worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am having a lot of fun experimenting with each brush.</li>
            <li>Cute, soft and pick up makeup well.</li>
            <li>The paint on the handles was even and they were comfortable to hold (and sized appropriately for their respective applications).  </li>
            <li>So many soft brushes.</li>
            <li>My sister also loved the pink and gold brushes.</li>
            <li>think my favorite brush so far is the blush size.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth the money.,</li>
            <li>And today you love having exactly the right brush for your makeup - you are particular about how you apply makeup and want the right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all for different looks, and they are truly worth it!!!</li>
            <li>These are high quality soft brushes that come in their own carrying case.</li>
            <li>think this is an excellent kit for a makeup student, professional artist, or amateur like me who doesn&#x27;t mind experimenting and learning.</li>
            <li>Spent a lot of time looking for the right set of makeup brushes and when I got them in the mail, I was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>the only downside is their strong odor ( just wash them ) other than that they&#x27;re great .</li>
            <li>But first time it has a smell of fresh paint.</li>
            <li>The brushes are SO soft and all are full size (the handles are like paint brushes!).</li>
            <li>certainly recommend it for all aspiring makeup artists!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how large this set was when i got it in the mail!</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft, easy to work with.</li>
            <li>The brushes don’t shed bristles, are soft and durable, easy to use and hold.  </li>
            <li>Love these brushes so much, I usethem every day and haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li>I immediately washed every single brush with baby shampoo and warm water and slim to</li>
            <li>Lipstick brushes are usually stiff and somewhat pointed to get a nice precise line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lipstick brushes are usually stiff and somewhat pointed to get a nice precise line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The variety is nice and there are several brushes that can do the same thing so you can switch out colors easily without washing the brush in between.</li>
            <li>have a few favorites that have been working well and clean up nicely as well.</li>
            <li>There are also two empty slots in the roll-up in case you have a couple of your own to add.</li>
            <li>This creates a nice full eyelash effect without looking like you are wearing heavy eyeliner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast also!</li>
            <li>Personally I have no need for this many brushes.  </li>
            <li>As I am giving this to my teenage daughter who is much more into hair and makeup than I am</li>
            <li>More than enough for me to do all kinds of make up</li>
            <li>the brushes are exactly as they look on the site.</li>
            <li>I have Mac brushes that cost more for one brush than this entire kit costs and you can&#x27;t tell a difference!</li>
            <li>I took a sharpie and labeled each brush for type/use (you can find descriptions by googling &amp;#34;makeup brush uses&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>The brushes don&#x27;t offend you with what to use them for - at this point you know exactly which brush to use when.</li>
            <li>This particular version is super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li>This is my first makeup brush set.</li>
            <li>But does have a smell at first.</li>
            <li>That said, one of the first things I noticed about the brushes is that they are not labeled as to use.</li>
            <li>One of the first things I did was tug on bristles to see if there&#x27;d be fallout;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Offering a variety of edges and tips for smooth applications for a professional looking finish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchasing a kit like this is much more inexpensive than going out and buying individual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell of the bag was strong but nothing major.</li>
            <li>I also like that the carry case has a fold over flat to stop the brushes from falling out the top.</li>
            <li>The brushes are extremely soft and the bristles do NOT fall out, which is what I was originally worried about.</li>
            <li>These brushes have brought the fun back into my makeup routine as I am just enjoying experimenting with new looks</li>
            <li>This set has a wide variety of brushes (32) and that the brushes are soft and good quality.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are also nice and soft yet dense which I personally prefer them to be.</li>
            <li>The large flat and rounded top brush is used for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The large flat and rounded top brush is used for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and came exactly on the date that it was scheduled and ahead of estimated time.</li>
            <li>I put them threw some pretty rigorous makeup trainings today &amp; they held up as well as my comparable (much pricier) vegan (synthetic) brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and full.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but these are really nice brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>The brush hair is super soft and i have not seen any shedding</li>
            <li>She says they are super soft, dont shed</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with the quality, having gone over all the brush heads, looking for any bristle imperfections or loose fittings and finding none.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are comfortable, soft, and have a very professional look.</li>
            <li>Any big fluffy brush works great for any powder you want to cover a large area (setting powder, blush &amp; bronzer.)</li>
            <li>They are so soft, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is a gift for my wife, she real loves this</li>
            <li>,it has everything you would need in a brush set,high quality,and the brushes are so soft,it comes with a leather roll bag,it&#x27;s very convenient,great for traveling with.</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>really  sofe picks up the make so in a heartbeat  </li>
            <li>It contains the whole list of brushes my wife wants.</li>
            <li>so i will give it time to really see).</li>
            <li>I was able to wash the brushes with baby shampoo somewhat roughly and they were not damaged at all.</li>
            <li>(so I didn&#x27;t put on too much and end up looking like a clown).  </li>
            <li>But there aren&#x27;t really any blending eyeshadow brushes in this kit.</li>
            <li>These are just as nice as the basic brushes you can buy individually</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a good set especially if you are looking for a wide variety of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the powder brush I recommend using as an all over bronzer brush ( picks up good amount of product not too much or to little but just enough to even out your skin if your foundation is your exact color and mutes you out a bit).</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s an article how to make your own brush cleaner to keep these brushes lasting a long time.</li>
            <li>My wife said it much felt better compared to her previous brushes.</li>
            <li>This set has multiples of many (most are at least slightly different)</li>
            <li>This set has multiples of many (most are at least slightly different)</li>
            <li>thought these were pretty soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;she said used it frequently, they are super soft and high quality,&lt;br /&gt;amazing</li>
            <li>/rounded on top brushes are used to lay down eyeshadow color.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great product for everyone, especially those just starting to enter into the make up world.</li>
            <li>I ended up choosing this particular set after spending far too much time shopping &amp; researching on here for this particular item!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my better half’s observations of the set.  </li>
            <li>I rated it a 4 only because it took a month to arrive, other than that I love them!</li>
            <li>Also they came in a decent case which rolls up for storage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The handles are long and thick enough for comfortable use and the fan brush is super nice.</li>
            <li>the biggest and fluffiest is usually reserved for face powder, and the smaller ones for more precise areas (cheeks, contours.)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>High quality brush set , affordable price</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like (smae as the other reviews) is that it does not say what kind of brush it is and what it is used for.</li>
            <li>I am only WASHING these brushes this morning (as you should wash anything before first use) and already two of the brush heads have popped off!</li>
            <li>There are big, fluffy brushes, contour brushes, brushes that would be suitable for HD powder application, fine eyeshadow contour brushes, larger eyeshadow blending brushes, and eyeliner brushes</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re soft very gentle and they look professional.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very close to professional ones.</li>
            <li>However, it completely dissipated within a day, and now this gift is ready for wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a couple of cheaper brush sets on Amazon, but I think these were worth the extra $7 or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even being rough with them or anything, just a gentle wash with a mild soap and my Sigma brush glove.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend needed new brushes for work and these  are what I purchased for her.</li>
            <li>I think the average person would do just fine with either the 7 or 19 piece set.  </li>
            <li>the brushes are very soft they have not shed  </li>
            <li>I have so many different brand brushes from vary expensive to pretty cheap ones</li>
            <li>Very soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li>brushes are very soft, synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li>Rather a bit of blush on the brush and applied to the skin makes a very natural glow that I don&#x27;t have to then buff out.</li>
            <li>roll case is soft PU leather; it rolls easily and lies flat when open.</li>
            <li>a while (if I don&#x27;t send em back first).</li>
            <li>So soft and don&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>With 32 brushes that fit into a soft PU leather roll case, it has that specific brush for your cheeks, eyes, brows and lips - for all your entire</li>
            <li>no regrets!!!!</li>
            <li>So smaller ones for eyeshadow, medium ones for blush or to apply powder around the nose, large ones for face powder, etc.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I used the largest brushes (including the large fan brush) to apply finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, I used the largest brushes (including the large fan brush) to apply finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I threw my old ones away, some of which cost almost as much as this entire set.</li>
            <li>They are silky soft and hold the makeup well.</li>
            <li>So I haven&#x27;t even used them yet, but so far I&#x27;m not amused.</li>
            <li>You really can use some brushes for several different things, it really depends on what works for</li>
            <li>You really can use some brushes for several different things, it really depends on what works for</li>
            <li>but the brow brush is soft and well shaped.  </li>
            <li>Really soft, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Came a day early ..</li>
            <li>The bristles are synthetic (at this price point you weren&#x27;t expecting natural bristles).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I swear it will makes you feel like you are a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and durable.  </li>
            <li>Worth every buck you spent.</li>
            <li>I have used this cleaner and it works just as good as expensive brush cleaner : http://www.xsparkage.com/stop-wasting-money-diy-brush-cleaner/</li>
            <li>The other brushes are smaller and should be fine.)  </li>
            <li>I like this brush set,  the little eye brushes are as soft as the coastal scents brushes, but the big ones are very soft, also there is a semi- strong new leather scent to the package as soon as you open the packaging.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set, for personal and professional purposes.</li>
            <li>They have a slight smell when you receive them, but a quick wash will do.</li>
            <li>a little  expensive  but its worth  it its  good quality</li>
            <li>Use any small, precise brush for applying lipstick or concealer.</li>
            <li>Small flat top brushes are used for eyeliner.</li>

            <li> The other type of person these would be great for is someone like me, who wears makeup most days, but who doesn&#x27;t like to wash brushes very often -- there are more brushes here, so you can go more days between</li>
            <li> I loved them so much I had to order another set after getting and using the first.</li>
            <li> definitely worth buying !</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> If it lasts 6-9 months for me  was worth it!</li>
            <li> They are super soft and nicely shaped so there is certainly a brush for every kind of make-up</li>
            <li> The makeup brushes are amazing and so soft!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and I love them!</li>
            <li> I received the brushes a few days before estimated delivery, which I have to say is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> such a good brush set</li>
            <li> and these brushes are just full of quality.</li>
            <li> They are soft and effective.</li>
            <li> Soft, easy to handle, and love the case.  </li>
            <li> so you can find which one works best for you, or have several (for example to use many colors of eyeshadow without getting them muddied up with other colors.)</li>
            <li> so you can find which one works best for you, or have several (for example to use many colors of eyeshadow without getting them muddied up with other colors.)</li>
            <li> I spent hours researching the best makeup brushes and I&#x27;m so happy I chose these instead of spending a ridiculous amount of money on Mac or Bobbi Brown sets.</li>
            <li> so they are easy to use and they look pretty in my brush holder.</li>
            <li> I strongly believe every woman should have this brushes they could save so much money if they do!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need to buy another brush because you get every single kind that exists with this kit!</li>
            <li> but they are a great price for such a large set.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter loved these they are so great and very affordable, better quality then the expensive sets!</li>
            <li> Love these soft brushes!</li>
            <li> So soft, easy and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes, multiples in most, which is nice especially the eye brushes having a couple shadow brushes to work with at once.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing I&#x27;ve  bought 2 extra sets as gifts.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes they are so soft and don&#x27;t shed one bit.</li>
            <li> So far I am enjoying these brushes.</li>
            <li> Having been semi-professionally \\&quot;in the black\\&quot; myself during college, I well know from personal experience that having one&#x27;s own set of tools, quality tools at that, is a needful thing for stage work.  </li>
            <li> The case itself is quite nice and sturdy although it did initially arrive with that \\&quot;plastic smell\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I am having a lot of fun with this brush set.</li>
            <li> For the price, I feel that this is a steal, and worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am having a lot of fun experimenting with each brush.</li>
            <li> Cute, soft and pick up makeup well.</li>
            <li> The paint on the handles was even and they were comfortable to hold (and sized appropriately for their respective applications).  </li>
            <li> So many soft brushes.</li>
            <li> My sister also loved the pink and gold brushes.</li>
            <li> think my favorite brush so far is the blush size.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth the money.,</li>
            <li> And today you love having exactly the right brush for your makeup - you are particular about how you apply makeup and want the right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all for different looks, and they are truly worth it!!!</li>
            <li> These are high quality soft brushes that come in their own carrying case.</li>
            <li> think this is an excellent kit for a makeup student, professional artist, or amateur like me who doesn&#x27;t mind experimenting and learning.</li>
            <li> Spent a lot of time looking for the right set of makeup brushes and when I got them in the mail, I was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> the only downside is their strong odor ( just wash them ) other than that they&#x27;re great .</li>
            <li> But first time it has a smell of fresh paint.</li>
            <li> The brushes are SO soft and all are full size (the handles are like paint brushes!).</li>
            <li> certainly recommend it for all aspiring makeup artists!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how large this set was when i got it in the mail!</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft, easy to work with.</li>
            <li> The brushes don’t shed bristles, are soft and durable, easy to use and hold.  </li>
            <li> Love these brushes so much, I usethem every day and haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> I immediately washed every single brush with baby shampoo and warm water and slim to</li>
            <li> Lipstick brushes are usually stiff and somewhat pointed to get a nice precise line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lipstick brushes are usually stiff and somewhat pointed to get a nice precise line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The variety is nice and there are several brushes that can do the same thing so you can switch out colors easily without washing the brush in between.</li>
            <li> have a few favorites that have been working well and clean up nicely as well.</li>
            <li> There are also two empty slots in the roll-up in case you have a couple of your own to add.</li>
            <li> This creates a nice full eyelash effect without looking like you are wearing heavy eyeliner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast also!</li>
            <li> Personally I have no need for this many brushes.  </li>
            <li> As I am giving this to my teenage daughter who is much more into hair and makeup than I am</li>
            <li> More than enough for me to do all kinds of make up</li>
            <li> the brushes are exactly as they look on the site.</li>
            <li> I have Mac brushes that cost more for one brush than this entire kit costs and you can&#x27;t tell a difference!</li>
            <li> I took a sharpie and labeled each brush for type/use (you can find descriptions by googling &amp;#34;makeup brush uses&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t offend you with what to use them for - at this point you know exactly which brush to use when.</li>
            <li> This particular version is super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> This is my first makeup brush set.</li>
            <li> But does have a smell at first.</li>
            <li> That said, one of the first things I noticed about the brushes is that they are not labeled as to use.</li>
            <li> One of the first things I did was tug on bristles to see if there&#x27;d be fallout;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Offering a variety of edges and tips for smooth applications for a professional looking finish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchasing a kit like this is much more inexpensive than going out and buying individual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell of the bag was strong but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I also like that the carry case has a fold over flat to stop the brushes from falling out the top.</li>
            <li> The brushes are extremely soft and the bristles do NOT fall out, which is what I was originally worried about.</li>
            <li> These brushes have brought the fun back into my makeup routine as I am just enjoying experimenting with new looks</li>
            <li> This set has a wide variety of brushes (32) and that the brushes are soft and good quality.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are also nice and soft yet dense which I personally prefer them to be.</li>
            <li> The large flat and rounded top brush is used for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The large flat and rounded top brush is used for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and came exactly on the date that it was scheduled and ahead of estimated time.</li>
            <li> I put them threw some pretty rigorous makeup trainings today &amp; they held up as well as my comparable (much pricier) vegan (synthetic) brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and full.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but these are really nice brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> The brush hair is super soft and i have not seen any shedding</li>
            <li> She says they are super soft, dont shed</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with the quality, having gone over all the brush heads, looking for any bristle imperfections or loose fittings and finding none.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are comfortable, soft, and have a very professional look.</li>
            <li> Any big fluffy brush works great for any powder you want to cover a large area (setting powder, blush &amp; bronzer.)</li>
            <li> They are so soft, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is a gift for my wife, she real loves this</li>
            <li> ,it has everything you would need in a brush set,high quality,and the brushes are so soft,it comes with a leather roll bag,it&#x27;s very convenient,great for traveling with.</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> really  sofe picks up the make so in a heartbeat  </li>
            <li> It contains the whole list of brushes my wife wants.</li>
            <li> so i will give it time to really see).</li>
            <li> I was able to wash the brushes with baby shampoo somewhat roughly and they were not damaged at all.</li>
            <li> (so I didn&#x27;t put on too much and end up looking like a clown).  </li>
            <li> But there aren&#x27;t really any blending eyeshadow brushes in this kit.</li>
            <li> These are just as nice as the basic brushes you can buy individually</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a good set especially if you are looking for a wide variety of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the powder brush I recommend using as an all over bronzer brush ( picks up good amount of product not too much or to little but just enough to even out your skin if your foundation is your exact color and mutes you out a bit).</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s an article how to make your own brush cleaner to keep these brushes lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> My wife said it much felt better compared to her previous brushes.</li>
            <li> This set has multiples of many (most are at least slightly different)</li>
            <li> This set has multiples of many (most are at least slightly different)</li>
            <li> thought these were pretty soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;she said used it frequently, they are super soft and high quality,&lt;br /&gt;amazing</li>
            <li> /rounded on top brushes are used to lay down eyeshadow color.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great product for everyone, especially those just starting to enter into the make up world.</li>
            <li> I ended up choosing this particular set after spending far too much time shopping &amp; researching on here for this particular item!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my better half’s observations of the set.  </li>
            <li> I rated it a 4 only because it took a month to arrive, other than that I love them!</li>
            <li> Also they came in a decent case which rolls up for storage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The handles are long and thick enough for comfortable use and the fan brush is super nice.</li>
            <li> the biggest and fluffiest is usually reserved for face powder, and the smaller ones for more precise areas (cheeks, contours.)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> High quality brush set , affordable price</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like (smae as the other reviews) is that it does not say what kind of brush it is and what it is used for.</li>
            <li> I am only WASHING these brushes this morning (as you should wash anything before first use) and already two of the brush heads have popped off!</li>
            <li> There are big, fluffy brushes, contour brushes, brushes that would be suitable for HD powder application, fine eyeshadow contour brushes, larger eyeshadow blending brushes, and eyeliner brushes</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re soft very gentle and they look professional.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very close to professional ones.</li>
            <li> However, it completely dissipated within a day, and now this gift is ready for wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a couple of cheaper brush sets on Amazon, but I think these were worth the extra $7 or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even being rough with them or anything, just a gentle wash with a mild soap and my Sigma brush glove.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend needed new brushes for work and these  are what I purchased for her.</li>
            <li> I think the average person would do just fine with either the 7 or 19 piece set.  </li>
            <li> the brushes are very soft they have not shed  </li>
            <li> I have so many different brand brushes from vary expensive to pretty cheap ones</li>
            <li> Very soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li> brushes are very soft, synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li> Rather a bit of blush on the brush and applied to the skin makes a very natural glow that I don&#x27;t have to then buff out.</li>
            <li> roll case is soft PU leather; it rolls easily and lies flat when open.</li>
            <li> a while (if I don&#x27;t send em back first).</li>
            <li> So soft and don&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> With 32 brushes that fit into a soft PU leather roll case, it has that specific brush for your cheeks, eyes, brows and lips - for all your entire</li>
            <li> no regrets!!!!</li>
            <li> So smaller ones for eyeshadow, medium ones for blush or to apply powder around the nose, large ones for face powder, etc.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I used the largest brushes (including the large fan brush) to apply finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, I used the largest brushes (including the large fan brush) to apply finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I threw my old ones away, some of which cost almost as much as this entire set.</li>
            <li> They are silky soft and hold the makeup well.</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t even used them yet, but so far I&#x27;m not amused.</li>
            <li> You really can use some brushes for several different things, it really depends on what works for</li>
            <li> You really can use some brushes for several different things, it really depends on what works for</li>
            <li> but the brow brush is soft and well shaped.  </li>
            <li> Really soft, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Came a day early ..</li>
            <li> The bristles are synthetic (at this price point you weren&#x27;t expecting natural bristles).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I swear it will makes you feel like you are a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and durable.  </li>
            <li> Worth every buck you spent.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleaner and it works just as good as expensive brush cleaner : http://www.xsparkage.com/stop-wasting-money-diy-brush-cleaner/</li>
            <li> The other brushes are smaller and should be fine.)  </li>
            <li> I like this brush set,  the little eye brushes are as soft as the coastal scents brushes, but the big ones are very soft, also there is a semi- strong new leather scent to the package as soon as you open the packaging.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set, for personal and professional purposes.</li>
            <li> They have a slight smell when you receive them, but a quick wash will do.</li>
            <li> a little  expensive  but its worth  it its  good quality</li>
            <li> Use any small, precise brush for applying lipstick or concealer.</li>
            <li> Small flat top brushes are used for eyeliner.</li>
            <li> B00LGOYE88 Multifunction Fabrics Makeup Brush Handbag]]for when she begins the inevitable pairing down of the 32pcs to a more concise, practical selection along with room for other bits and bobs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are solid,  beautifully fluffy and very useful set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> This set is a complete set with multiple eye shadow brushes!</li>
            <li> Not a single one.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:c6c49037dbfbbcd46657a8a693c09be1]]This is an intended gift for a young niece who recently has become enthralled with theatrical makeup.  </li>
            <li> High quality, minimal to zero shedding.  </li>
            <li> I used a few of them to apply different colors of eyeshadow and they picked up the pigment pretty well (I was using pressed powder eyeshadows).  </li>
            <li> The big fluffy fan brush is usually used to brush away eyeshadow fallout but can also be used to apply highlight to the top of the cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> dry the brushes in a cup upside down  the only brush that broke was the spooly i just recommended these for personal use because they will last much longer</li>
            <li> The smaller flat in profile</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll use all of them, but there is certainly a brush for every need.</li>
            <li> Short of actually doing a video (which would be very long)</li>
            <li> but if they do just put a tiny bit of glue on the handle and put the metal ferrule back on, hold it for a minute and then let it dry.</li>
            <li> We were completely shocked when they showed up a 4 days before we expected (super excited about that)!!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I really would have preferred a small label, like &amp;#34;angled eyeliner brush,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Brush handles are a bit too long for my taste, especially on the powder brushes.</li>
            <li> does what however only minor issue.  </li>
            <li> but again only minor issue.</li>
            <li> My only question with this brush set is going to be long term durability.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how nice these actually are.</li>
            <li> but I was able to glue them back into place which was inconvenient when it happened.</li>
            <li> shipping took a long time though.</li>
            <li> They have long handles too</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> The package arrived weeks earlier than expected, living in the United States, which was a surprise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no professional, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t had a chance to see if they will stand up long term</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and heavy...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this purchase I gave 4 stars due to no blending brush no list about brushes and uses and such a long wait for delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading countless reviews on amazon, as well as other sites I decided to pick the Louise Maelys 32pc makep brush set</li>
            <li> They applied the pigment about the same as other brushes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with that issue should wash their brushes carefully and lay flat to dry.</li>
            <li> Each brush was individually wrapped and the larger fluffy brushes have a mesh cover which can be reused.</li>
            <li> There is no need to buy expensive brushes, these are soft and apply makeup liquid and dry very well.</li>
            <li> They are usually used for &amp;#34;tight lining&amp;#34; which means putting eyeliner directly into the lash line rather than on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> The roll bag (&amp;#34;PU leather&amp;#34; from the item title is polyurethane, by the way) makes it so you can pack these into not very much space.  </li>
            <li> I used another to apply blush (loose powder this time).  </li>
            <li> Smaller fluffy brushes are used for blending eyeshadow or concealer.&lt;br</li>

            <li> (Be careful with the fan brushes when you&#x27;re rolling the bag up</li>

            <li> hands down the softest non shedding brushes</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t brushes that lay down a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> (There are also a few items in here for use with the eyebrows and other parts of the face.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These appeared well made.  </li>

            <li> $50 for a high quality brush seems silly.</li>
            <li> The ferrules are all tight so the brushes don&#x27;t shed or wobble.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very nice and soft. They feel well made. Very happy</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes they are so soft and don&#x27;t shed one bit. If you&#x27;re looking for brushes these are the ones to buy. Shipping was fast and came exactly on the date that it was scheduled and ahead of estimated time. I&#x27;m a happy customer!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this brushes because the comments were good, I love this brushes very soft and good quality for this price.</li>
            <li> such a good brush set</li>
            <li> Amazing quality brushes and the price is super good. They are silky soft and hold the makeup well. I was shocked at how nice these actually are. Definitely worth it!! No bristle loss noted either.</li>
            <li> I just got this set yesterday. So I haven&#x27;t even used them yet, but so far I&#x27;m not amused. I am only WASHING these brushes this morning (as you should wash anything before first use) and already two of the brush heads have popped off! What the heck?! I&#x27;m not even being rough with them or anything, just a gentle wash with a mild soap and my Sigma brush glove. Maybe I just got a bad set. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update after I&#x27;ve used them a while (if I don&#x27;t send em back first).</li>
            <li> Product is fine....shipping took a long time though.</li>
            <li> I rated it a 4 only because it took a month to arrive, other than that I love them!</li>
            <li> I received the brushes a few days before estimated delivery, which I have to say is pretty awesome. The brushes are soft and I love them! The only thing is that one of the brush&#x27;s bristles had an indentation from the plastic around it being mmessed up.. made me a little unhappy but it&#x27;s not too bad. The smell of the bag was strong but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I love love love my new brushes ! I was reading their reviews and I was iffy about them but when I received them I was completely satisfied  the only downside is their strong odor ( just wash them ) other than that they&#x27;re great . I would definitely recommend them .</li>
            <li> What an incredible set of brushes for a really low price! If you can imagine a brush size, it is in here. There are plenty to choose from for lips, eyes, and face. They are super soft and nicely shaped so there is certainly a brush for every kind of make-up application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few favorites that have been working well and clean up nicely as well. If you use them all (or most) having the storage roll-up is great to keep them all together. Otherwise, you can take out a few and store the rest of them in the roll-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles are long and thick enough for comfortable use and the fan brush is super nice. There are also two empty slots in the roll-up in case you have a couple of your own to add. I also like that the carry case has a fold over flat to stop the brushes from falling out the top. If you&#x27;ve ever bought a single brush at the pharmacy, they are expensive. These are just as nice as the basic brushes you can buy individually but they are a great price for such a large set. Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but these are really nice brushes for the price. The bristles are thick and soft and feel like the expensive department store versions. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of brushes also. Not sure if I&#x27;ll use all of them, but there is certainly a brush for every need. They have long handles too so they are easy to use and they look pretty in my brush holder. The case will be nice for travel, also.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She is very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I like this brush set,  the little eye brushes are as soft as the coastal scents brushes, but the big ones are very soft, also there is a semi- strong new leather scent to the package as soon as you open the packaging. From just looking at these brushes they seem a good quality. Time will tell,</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are nicely packaged and very soft!!! I am truly happy that I purch these!!!</li>
            <li> These are a great buy!! Really good quality.</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift so I can&#x27;t speak for performance but I did notice a very heavy chemical smell when I received these.</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes! The variety is nice and there are several brushes that can do the same thing so you can switch out colors easily without washing the brush in between. None of mine have come off the handle but if they do just put a tiny bit of glue on the handle and put the metal ferrule back on, hold it for a minute and then let it dry. I took some photos to show how nice these brushes are up close. Also they came in a decent case which rolls up for storage. Each brush was individually wrapped and the larger fluffy brushes have a mesh cover which can be reused. The care they put into these was refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people are confused about what some of these brushes are for. Short of actually doing a video (which would be very long) I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to demonstrate so I&#x27;ll attempt to explain a few of the brush varieties and what they are used for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a rule of thumb:&lt;br /&gt;1. Any big fluffy brush works great for any powder you want to cover a large area (setting powder, blush &amp; bronzer.) the biggest and fluffiest is usually reserved for face powder, and the smaller ones for more precise areas (cheeks, contours.)&lt;br /&gt;2. The big fluffy fan brush is usually used to brush away eyeshadow fallout but can also be used to apply highlight to the top of the cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;3. The smaller flat in profile/rounded on top brushes are used to lay down eyeshadow color. It works best for cream eyeshadow but can also be used to pack on powder color.&lt;br /&gt;4. Smaller fluffy brushes are used for blending eyeshadow or concealer.&lt;br /&gt;5. Small flat top brushes are used for eyeliner. They are usually used for &amp;#34;tight lining&amp;#34; which means putting eyeliner directly into the lash line rather than on the eyelid. This creates a nice full eyelash effect without looking like you are wearing heavy eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;6. You can use any small, pointed brush for applying eyeliner (gel, cream or liquid.)&lt;br /&gt;7. Use any small, precise brush for applying lipstick or concealer. You should pick one or two lipstick brushes and stick to that use alone because lipstick is difficult to completely remove from a brush. Lipstick brushes are usually stiff and somewhat pointed to get a nice precise line.&lt;br /&gt;8. Small slanted (angled) brushes are used for filling in and shaping the eyebrows. (Use eyebrow cream or even a similar color/slightly lighter matte eyeshadow to fill in brows.)&lt;br /&gt;9. The spoolie is used for combing out the eyelashes or eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;10. The tiny brush/comb combo is also used to comb the eyelashes and eyebrows, also to soften out the brow color (spoolie does this too.)&lt;br /&gt;11. The small sponge-tip tool (that looks like a small pencil eraser) is used to smudge eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;12. The sponge-tip applicator is used for eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;13. The large flat and rounded top brush is used for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this set contains more than 13 brushes. This set has multiples of many (most are at least slightly different) so you can find which one works best for you, or have several (for example to use many colors of eyeshadow without getting them muddied up with other colors.) I hope this helps people who aren&#x27;t sure what the brushes are used for, the best thing to do is try them out and see what you are comfortable with. You really can use some brushes for several different things, it really depends on what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;(This set was provided for testing and review.)ipstick or concealer.

            <li> Great buy for the money. Some of the brushes are so-so but you get so many you can just not use them.</li>
            <li> I was actually shocked by it&#x27;s quality. They are so soft, definitely worth the price. Shipping was fast also!</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE them (: I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Very soft and great brushes, I love these</li>
            <li> The fibers are a bit rougher than I expected but they seem to be contained and mounted to the head firmly. Brush handles are a bit too long for my taste, especially on the powder brushes. They do arrive in a cheap case that smells of plastic but it airs out within a day. There are a lot of size options but not a ton of variety in shapes to the brushes. The fan brush has already started loosing fibers so that&#x27;s a bit disappointing but the brow brush is soft and well shaped.  It&#x27;s a nice kit to pick and choose from.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re amazing ! they&#x27;re soft very gentle and they look professional. a weird little smell but leave it open over night and it goes away. definitely worth buying !</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous!!! These brushes are very close to professional ones. No fall out, easy to clean, and soooo many options!  I&#x27;ve tried them all for different looks, and they are truly worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes, but not what I expected. This is more of a beginners set of brushes. Really soft, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> What a nice set of cosmetic brushes.  These are high quality soft brushes that come in their own carrying case. I can find no issues with any of these brushes.  They are well made. At less than $1 per brush I don&#x27;t think there is anything anyone could complain about with this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of the 32 Piece set.  I think the average person would do just fine with either the 7 or 19 piece set.  Personally I have no need for this many brushes.  As I am giving this to my teenage daughter who is much more into hair and makeup than I am I assume she&#x27;ll put it to good use.</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing.  High quality, minimal to zero shedding.  I can&#x27;t wait to put them to work.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a great price. Some shedding occurred which happens with all brushes. Anyone with that issue should wash their brushes carefully and lay flat to dry. Otherwise they glue holding the bristles is going to weaken. Very soft brushes, multiples in most, which is nice especially the eye brushes having a couple shadow brushes to work with at once. Also nice if you forgot to clean one you wanted. I work as a product consultant and custom makeup artist and have recommended these brushes to clients.</li>
            <li> I like it. The only thing i wish it would of came with is a description for each brush. That would be a plus. Bristles are soft, easy to work with.</li>
            <li> very impressed with this product. may buy more to gift out.</li>
            <li> This review is for the 32 piece set with pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my better half’s observations of the set.  This set has a wide variety of brushes (32) and that the brushes are soft and good quality.  The polyurethane (PU) bag is ok but did have an odor like sometimes items made of PU tend to do, but the odor did go away after a bit.  The brushes don’t shed bristles, are soft and durable, easy to use and hold.  These are good makeup applying brushes.  They are also easy to clean. The case rolls into a compact package making it easily portable.  For the price, this is a good set especially if you are looking for a wide variety of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the 32pc set for my fiance and she couldn&#x27;t be happier with her section of brushes heres her review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading countless reviews on amazon, as well as other sites I decided to pick the Louise Maelys 32pc makep brush set and i couldn&#x27;t be happier with my choice. The shipping was amazing fast. We were completely shocked when they showed up a 4 days before we expected (super excited about that)!!!&lt;br /&gt; I chose these particular brush set because of the beautiful color of the brushes and the reviews of very minimal to no shedding and the fact that everyone said how excellent the quality was for the price and everyone was correct they are awesome!!!! These brushes have brought the fun back into my makeup routine as I am just enjoying experimenting with new looks just so I can use these brushes. there are no labels on the brushes but you can look up which brush is for which online. These are really the best affordable brushes you can find. Forget MAC and bobbi brown brushes go for these. Im sure glad I did and a special thanks to my fiancé for a most awesome new years gift.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use this brush but it meets my expectation as to softness and I tugged on the brush heads it does not shred. When I use it in the future I will let you know how it performs.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes so much, I usethem every day and haven&#x27;t had any problems so far. So soft and don&#x27;t shed! LOVE</li>
            <li> the brushes are very soft they have not shed  i have already washed them they still did not shed on me tip:dry the brushes in a cup upside down  the only brush that broke was the spooly i just recommended these for personal use because they will last much longer</li>
            <li> Came a day early .. Very pleased</li>
            <li> I love this soft nice brushes, thank you</li>
            <li> These are solid,  beautifully fluffy and very useful set of makeup brushes. I&#x27;ve been working on my brush collection for a while now. I realized if I wanted to look good and get the best out of my makeup I needed the right tools. This is a GREAT set. Affordable, good quality and good costumer service. I cannot afford to spend an arm and a leg on brushes at the moment. $50 for a high quality brush seems silly.</li>
            <li> BEST INVESTMENT EVER. These brushes pick up a good amount of product and have not shed yet (fingers crossed) I have had them since Last week and they work great. For the powder brush I recommend using as an all over bronzer brush ( picks up good amount of product not too much or to little but just enough to even out your skin if your foundation is your exact color and mutes you out a bit). The brushes work amazing, I wash them once a week with purity and leave a flawless application if used correctly.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes today, and I am extremely satisfied. They are well packaged and softer than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of cheaper brush sets on Amazon, but I think these were worth the extra $7 or so.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing I&#x27;ve  bought 2 extra sets as gifts.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter loved these they are so great and very affordable, better quality then the expensive sets!</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome!  I returned the one brush I bough from MAC for $37.00 and have more brushes than I can use. The quality is better than the brush I returned. Great deal!</li>
            <li> Soft, easy to handle, and love the case.  I go through a lot of makeup brushes, being in opera and theater, and these are very economical as well as good quality.  I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
            <li> For all these brushes you can&#x27;t beat the price! These brushes are super soft, made very strong, and apply all makeup on perfect every time!</li>
            <li> It is a gift for my wife, she real loves this and so happy got these makeup brushes,&lt;br /&gt;she said used it frequently, they are super soft and high quality,&lt;br /&gt;amazing brushes at a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with these brushes I received, for the price they are and amount of brushes you get its deffinetly worth it. The reason why I didn&#x27;t give them a 5 star is because they do smell but it does go away after a bit. There is also no blending blush. Otherwise from that, good buy</li>
            <li> This set is better then i thought it would be,it has everything you would need in a brush set,high quality,and the brushes are so soft,it comes with a leather roll bag,it&#x27;s very convenient,great for traveling with.I bought the 32 piece set,and i can&#x27;t believe how many pieces you get for the money,this is a great value,you can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.It came well packed,i had no problems with delivery.When you open the package,you can smell the leather bag,and it&#x27;s so soft,the brushes are wrapped in plastic,so as not to get dirty.I really like this set.I would recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the quality of these brushes! I threw my old ones away, some of which cost almost as much as this entire set. These brushes apply makeup precisely and flawlessly. Excellent buy, very happy!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and fluffy. They work great. I loved them so much I had to order another set after getting and using the first. And they came in a great leather folio. If you love a great makeup brush and a great deal, definitely get these. Not one negative thing about them. Seriously.</li>
            <li> Like it! So soft, easy and comfortable to hold. But first time it has a smell of fresh paint. After a week it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. Some seem to be repeated due to small differences but enough brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes are of acceptable quality.  Good on price. So far I am enjoying these brushes.</li>
            <li> So my sister  purchased  this brushes ... we were  both speechless  their  amazing  really  sofe picks up the make so in a heartbeat  i went to purchase  this babys a little  expensive  but its worth  it its  good quality</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Love these soft brushes! More than enough for me to do all kinds of make up</li>
            <li> My gf just received her sets and she&#x27;s loves them, work amazing!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes, and so soft. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> It contains the whole list of brushes my wife wants. My wife said it much felt better compared to her previous brushes. The price is acceptable.</li>
            <li> hands down the softest non shedding brushes</li>
            <li> the brushes are exactly as they look on the site. I have no complaints of this brush set. Worth every buck you spent. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Was a Christmas Gift for my niece who does hair and make-up for weddings. She says they are very easy to use and loves the length of the handles. Brushes are wonderful quality for this price.</li>
            <li> Have been waiting for these makeup brushes, can&#x27;t wait to try them. There are so many different shapes and styles, what a beautiful set of brushes for such a great price.. I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t disappoint.Spent a lot of time looking for the right set of makeup brushes and when I got them in the mail, I was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that this came in 2 days. When the brushes did come, i was highly impressed with it. This is a make up lovers dream. The brush hair is super soft and i have not seen any shedding (I just got them so i will give it time to really see). The only thing I do not like (smae as the other reviews) is that it does not say what kind of brush it is and what it is used for. That would be great for all the non professional users to have a guide to go by and learn what all the brushes can be used for. Other than that it is a great product for everyone, especially those just starting to enter into the make up world.</li>
            <li> I am about to order this for my self the price is very good and also the color is super cute but I wanted to know do these brushes have the names on it like what it is called like the number</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:c6c49037dbfbbcd46657a8a693c09be1]]This is an intended gift for a young niece who recently has become enthralled with theatrical makeup.  Having been semi-professionally \\&quot;in the black\\&quot; myself during college, I well know from personal experience that having one&#x27;s own set of tools, quality tools at that, is a needful thing for stage work.  I ordered this set as well as [[ASIN:B00LGOYE88 Multifunction Fabrics Makeup Brush Handbag]]for when she begins the inevitable pairing down of the 32pcs to a more concise, practical selection along with room for other bits and bobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with the quality, having gone over all the brush heads, looking for any bristle imperfections or loose fittings and finding none.  Not a single one.  The case itself is quite nice and sturdy although it did initially arrive with that \\&quot;plastic smell\\&quot;.  However, it completely dissipated within a day, and now this gift is ready for wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly recommend it for all aspiring makeup artists!</li>
            <li> I know nothing about make up brushes. My girlfriend needed new brushes for work and these  are what I purchased for her. She says they are super soft, dont shed and she probably wont use them all...sounds to me like she thinks they are great.</li>
            <li> The best brushes I have bought! So soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my brushes :) they are very soft&lt;br /&gt;Only negative : No brush index/guide to identify  which brush does what.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, they are all soft excellent quality fantastic price, price of product including postage was below buying locally and got so many more brushes.  Only problem was no blending brush and no description of which brush does what however only minor issue.  Postage was spot on the expected day of delivery and I couldn&#x27;t track postage but again only minor issue. I would recommend this purchase I gave 4 stars due to no blending brush no list about brushes and uses and such a long wait for delivery.</li>
            <li> I have so many different brand brushes from vary expensive to pretty cheap ones and this are amazing anyone would think I spend a small fortune for all this brushes!!! I strongly believe every woman should have this brushes they could save so much money if they do!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!! Quality is if they were hundreds of dollars like those sigma brushes! Worth the buy! But you get MORE than what you paid for! You get duplicate eyeshadow brushes for those eyeshadow palettes you might have!!! AMAZING! Must buy and the bag is even more awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I spent hours researching the best makeup brushes and I&#x27;m so happy I chose these instead of spending a ridiculous amount of money on Mac or Bobbi Brown sets. I have Mac brushes that cost more for one brush than this entire kit costs and you can&#x27;t tell a difference! The brushes arrived in two days and the case was sealed as well as each individual brush. I immediately washed every single brush with baby shampoo and warm water and slim to none bristles fell out. The brushes are SO soft and all are full size (the handles are like paint brushes!). I took a sharpie and labeled each brush for type/use (you can find descriptions by googling &amp;#34;makeup brush uses&amp;#34;). I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need to buy another brush because you get every single kind that exists with this kit! I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the brush quality before buying them because of how low the price was. However, I was extremely pleased. The package arrived weeks earlier than expected, living in the United States, which was a surprise. The leather case is very durable, nice leather. The brushes are extremely soft and the bristles do NOT fall out, which is what I was originally worried about. The shafts of the bushes were plastic, though. That was not a problem for me at all. I was able to wash the brushes with baby shampoo somewhat roughly and they were not damaged at all. Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking lower price means worse quality!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful! Great value for a great product! Very soft and great for precise application.</li>
            <li> This was absolutely phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I bought these on the 11th and they arrived today!! I absolutely LOVE these brushes! I love the fact there was 32 brushes including a smudging brush! Worth buying!!</li>
            <li> these are amazing brushes.</li>
            <li> Im in love with my brushes! I am a pro makeup artist and really think these brushes were a good buy, I would recommend this brush set to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love them!! I got them yesterday and I&#x27;m so excited to use them!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I&#x27;m no professional, but they get the job done. I have only used them for a short while and in that time I have not notice any shedding with these brushes. I gave it a four star rating because, the brushes could use some labelling as to what they are used for.</li>
            <li> This cosmetic brush set is phenomenal. They come in a really convenient attractive leather rolling case, that makes for an easy travel set. The brushes are comfortable, soft, and have a very professional look. I am having a lot of fun with this brush set. For the price, I feel that this is a steal, and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this makeup kit. I am having a lot of fun experimenting with each brush. I have used a lot of different make brushes. and these brushes are just full of quality. I highly recommend this set, for personal and professional purposes.</li>
            <li> The makeup brushes are amazing and so soft!</li>
            <li> A quiz. Were you the person that had the 120 color Crayola crayon box? I bet you were if you are looking at this set of brushes. You loved having exactly the right color for the picture. And today you love having exactly the right brush for your makeup - you are particular about how you apply makeup and want the right tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this roll of brushes is the 120 color crayon box. The brushes are very nice. The ferrules are all tight so the brushes don&#x27;t shed or wobble. The brushes don&#x27;t offend you with what to use them for - at this point you know exactly which brush to use when. The handles are lightweight wood with nice gold paint. The bristles are synthetic (at this price point you weren&#x27;t expecting natural bristles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roll case is soft PU leather; it rolls easily and lies flat when open. Brushes are easy to remove and replace. PU leather is made from leather hides that don&#x27;t meet quality standards. They are cut thin and then coated with polyurethane for a durable finish. It is a nice most natural product. This particular version is super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> these r the best brushes ever! i purchased one and the they i received it  i ordered another one ! mines arrived in perfectly good condition and did not have any smell (like the plastic smell) what so ever! they are easy to use/wash and hold the products really good! i will keep buying these brushes if the quality/price stay the same :D</li>
            <li> This is my first makeup brush set. I have been using it for a month now and they worked quite well. The brushes are soft and full. The bristles doesn&#x27;t fall out when you wash them. They have a slight smell when you receive them, but a quick wash will do. They work well and are cheap. Good buy!</li>
            <li> Soft bristles feels n looks good quality. But does have a smell at first. Kinda smells like paint. But if you leave it out for awhile the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> I have bought many kinds of cosmetic brushes. this brushes is the only one that makes me happy. I like its two tone hair. Cute, soft and pick up makeup well. They even not lost hair when I washed them with cold water. It’s a great selection of these brushes for a super great price and high quality.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush set!!  Every brush you will ever need for your makeup!</li>
            <li> This review is for the gold handled brushes with the black case (&amp;#34;32pcs Gold&amp;#34; if you click on the pictures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great set for a beginner since it&#x27;s not terribly expensive, and it&#x27;s also good for travel.  The roll bag (&amp;#34;PU leather&amp;#34; from the item title is polyurethane, by the way) makes it so you can pack these into not very much space.  (Be careful with the fan brushes when you&#x27;re rolling the bag up so you don&#x27;t bend the bristles.  The other brushes are smaller and should be fine.)  The other type of person these would be great for is someone like me, who wears makeup most days, but who doesn&#x27;t like to wash brushes very often -- there are more brushes here, so you can go more days between brush washing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can look up the item name in your favorite search engine to find some tutorials (including videos) if you want to know what each brush is officially for.  For my own purposes, I tend to just choose one that is about the size I&#x27;m looking for and go with it.  So smaller ones for eyeshadow, medium ones for blush or to apply powder around the nose, large ones for face powder, etc.  (There are also a few items in here for use with the eyebrows and other parts of the face.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These appeared well made.  I didn&#x27;t get any bristle shedding and the bristles were securely fastened to the handles.  The paint on the handles was even and they were comfortable to hold (and sized appropriately for their respective applications).  Also, there was no plastic or chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought these were pretty soft.  I used a few of them to apply different colors of eyeshadow and they picked up the pigment pretty well (I was using pressed powder eyeshadows).  They applied the pigment about the same as other brushes I&#x27;ve used.  I used another to apply blush (loose powder this time).  It also was good at picking up pigment and it was easy to tap the excess pigment off (so I didn&#x27;t put on too much and end up looking like a clown).  Finally, I used the largest brushes (including the large fan brush) to apply finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these were scratchy and none irritated my skin.  Plus, since the hair is synthetic, these would be suitable for vegans.  Although I won&#x27;t be mistaking these for my individual brushes that cost about twenty-five dollars each, as a set at this price point, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.n).

            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and need lots of brushes. These a great! I&#x27;m going to order another one.  There are 32 brushes but 7 of them, there are 2 each. Kit includes foundation,  concealer and contour brushes. I think this kit is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Love these! If you are looking for something with a lot of eye and lip brushes this is it!</li>
            <li> High quality brush set , affordable price no regrets!!!!</li>
            <li> I ended up choosing this particular set after spending far too much time shopping &amp; researching on here for this particular item! I am impressed with the quality of these brushes so far! I knew immediatly upon opening, touching, &amp; examining them that I as going to be ordering more for my family &amp; friends (another spare for myself) before they are gone! Although I haven&#x27;t had a chance to see if they will stand up long term I put them threw some pretty rigorous makeup trainings today &amp; they held up as well as my comparable (much pricier) vegan (synthetic) brushes. My only question with this brush set is going to be long term durability. For this price though? Who cares! If it lasts 6-9 months for me  was worth it! The plus side is synthetics tend to have less bacterial growth &amp; no animals were harmed in the making of them of course! These brushes are also nice and soft yet dense which I personally prefer them to be. Which I usually pay $32 for the smallest brush in here individually! These come out to $1 a piece! The roll up case is not lacking in quality either.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Very soft and no shedding. Would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome. So many soft brushes. When I opened the package, it had some smell. But just need to leave it for while. I have washed all the brushes. no shed. Great brushes! My sister also loved the pink and gold brushes. I think she will buy one too. five stars.</li>
            <li> Wifes liked these, but she had to air them out for a couple of days before she could use them.</li>
            <li> Worst brushes ever.....OMG....awful.</li>
            <li> I was sent these for review, and I&#x27;ll never buy into the theory that receiving items for review somehow obligates me to leave a glowing review. You can check my other reviews to see the truth of this statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me explain that I&#x27;m not a makeup artist. I&#x27;m just a woman who loves makeup and is always looking for the next best thing to help it go on the skin the way I want it to. That said, one of the first things I noticed about the brushes is that they are not labeled as to use. I really would have preferred a small label, like &amp;#34;angled eyeliner brush,&amp;#34; etc. to help me sort out this bunch of brushes because I&#x27;m no pro when it comes to makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the brushes themselves have been wonderful so far. One of the first things I did was tug on bristles to see if there&#x27;d be fallout; nope. I also held them up to see that they were uniformly cut, and they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All brushes are very soft, synthetic brushes. There are several blush-size brushes as well as several identically shaped eyeshadow brushes. I like this. I&#x27;ve just pulled out ones I need now and put the rest in storage for someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my favorite brush so far is the blush size. These aren&#x27;t brushes that lay down a lot of makeup. Rather a bit of blush on the brush and applied to the skin makes a very natural glow that I don&#x27;t have to then buff out. The blush is blended as I go. There are big, fluffy brushes, contour brushes, brushes that would be suitable for HD powder application, fine eyeshadow contour brushes, larger eyeshadow blending brushes, and eyeliner brushes galore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an excellent kit for a makeup student, professional artist, or amateur like me who doesn&#x27;t mind experimenting and learning.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and heavy... Only reason I rated it 4 stars is because one brush is missing from the set.</li>
            <li> When you unroll this set I swear it will makes you feel like you are a professional makeup artist. This kit has every brush you can imagine and more. With 32 brushes that fit into a soft PU leather roll case, it has that specific brush for your cheeks, eyes, brows and lips - for all your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offering a variety of edges and tips for smooth applications for a professional looking finish. No matter if you are using powder, liquid or cream products, you can lightly dust, blend, mix, form and contour your features. The bristles are good quality and I have not noticed any shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing a kit like this is much more inexpensive than going out and buying individual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect set to achieve professional make-up artist results at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review sample.</li>
            <li> This set is a complete set with multiple eye shadow brushes! I loveeeeeee this set, The quality is incredible and the price is the best, This is definitely worth the buy and very cheap. There is no need to buy expensive brushes, these are soft and apply makeup liquid and dry very well. I couldn&#x27;t believe how large this set was when i got it in the mail! These brushes are very elegant and I will continue to buy Louise Maelys products. Here&#x27;s an article how to make your own brush cleaner to keep these brushes lasting a long time. I have used this cleaner and it works just as good as expensive brush cleaner : http://www.xsparkage.com/stop-wasting-money-diy-brush-cleaner/</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and durable.  A couple of the heads came off during use but I was able to glue them back into place which was inconvenient when it happened.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES!! They are soft and effective. But there aren&#x27;t really any blending eyeshadow brushes in this kit. But it&#x27;s worth the money.,</li>
            <li> There were nice makeup brushes.</li>
