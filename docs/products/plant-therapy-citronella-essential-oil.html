            <li>This oil has a pleasant smell and works well in my oil warmer.</li>
            <li>I am very confident that those products are excellent, but I did not want to spend a lot on something that I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong, and it works well!</li>
            <li>and I poured the mix in a spray bootle and It works amazingly good.</li>
            <li>it did good.</li>
            <li>Seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li>The oil smells good and does the job.</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Citronella oil smells good, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price</li>
            <li>Super great product and service!</li>
            <li>The price couldn&#x27;t make me more happy...</li>
            <li>Good fragrance and effective insect repellant.</li>
            <li>We bought two more bottles to have on hand!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Will buy more!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed, delightful citronella oil.</li>
            <li>They got to me in fairly quick time, were wrapped well, and the oils themselves are of very good quality.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I liked the speedy delivery</li>
            <li>It has a good odor, more akin to lemon than that chemical smell the candles have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s humane and cost effective.</li>
            <li>Nice size, nice price point.</li>
            <li>Great potent oil  Works better than  candles etc</li>
            <li>Smells nice and does keep the bugs away.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working nicely.  </li>
            <li>Citronella, vanilla and basil or eucalyptus oil as effective as DEET for mosquitoes in research.</li>
            <li>Easy, pleasant and effective.  </li>
            <li>Super fast deliver, great price and awesome scent product!</li>
            <li>I sprayed the dog and watched the gnats fly right off!</li>
            <li>Great smelling and soothing thank you for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t honestly claim to be able to test purity or how the oil was processed, but it does work well.</li>
            <li>Old wax works best so it smokes a lot.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but still haven&#x27;t found the right combo to truly fight mosquitos using this.</li>
            <li>If anything, a very light scent remains.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t love the smell, but I guess it works.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m unsure as to how potent this is?</li>
            <li>but if I did something to lessen products power I&#x27;d gladly give 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I went to the park many times since then and could have enjoyed the nature as I wanted.</li>
            <li>and I have not noticed any more scratches or hair on the seat.</li>
            <li>Smells ok.</li>
            <li>So yes I love this product.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>Also, makes you smell pretty amazing, too!</li>
            <li>Mosquitoes usually love me, but they don&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li>I still see mosquitoes and have mosquito bites, though not as many as I would have by July.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I just love the product.  </li>
            <li>belong to &#x27;club&#x27; (for lack of better description).  </li>
            <li>Living very close to a pond, this is great to use around my patio area to keep the bugs and mosquitos away</li>
            <li>seems to be an okay product</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Will for sure buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will love it...  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work to keep my dogs from jumping, but diluted with water and put in a spray bottle it does seem to help them to keep from jumping on anyone.</li>
            <li>Keeping the bugs away :)</li>
            <li>love this  just ordered more</li>
            <li>Also safe on my dogs.</li>
            <li>Though they seem to be ok, the citronella vapors could be stronger.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This oil has so many uses including insect repellant.</li>
            <li>Always check to make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic to anything in here, but otherwise go for it.</li>
            <li>and I would assume it better for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>make sure you cover all your exposed skin or they will bite you.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Works pretty good in candles.</li>
            <li>The portable diffuser/humidifier worked great and was pleasantly surprised how well this oil worked!</li>
            <li>This oil did a pretty good job without being to strong to irritate my allergies.</li>
            <li>I love using it to make my own bug proof spray, you know exactly what is in it</li>
            <li>This is excellent in homemade mosquito spray along with other items</li>
            <li>But the scent washes out easily once you wash your clothes.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this has a strong citronella scent</li>
            <li>Strong smell</li>
            <li>5-10 drops to two pounds of wax created quite a strong scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, I just realized I don&#x27;t like the smell of citronella.  </li>
            <li>We use this oil in a tea light diffuser.</li>
            <li>They make fly spray for horses already containing this oil but want double the price.</li>
            <li>I add a bottle of this to a gallon of fly spray and it helps keep the gnats and mosquitoes from dining on my horses at night and possibly infecting them w/</li>
            <li>Had the vehicle already in pieces before I realized it, but I set an oil burner filled with this by my front bumper and watched would-be attackers flee.  </li>
            <li>Over all did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>All of them smell very nice, and the citronella mixed with skin oil kept the mosquitos away.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and the packaging was super cute.</li>
            <li>Very strong smelling, very concentrated, would buy again.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that you had some I bought two.</li>
            <li>This is going to be great to use in the vaporizer with other oils to give an uplifting, fresh scent to the room!</li>
            <li>The park was full of mosquitoes and they were all around me</li>
            <li>Very concentrated and potent.  </li>
            <li>I received my order very promptly and it smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Was a fast delivery - and it was used as intended- smelled fabulous!</li>
            <li>Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>The works great with the other oils..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like they hit a wall and fly off the other way.</li>
            <li>Much more potent than what I can find locally</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, too.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great bottle of Citronella essential oil...  </li>
            <li>I received the citronella eo quickly and unharmed.</li>
            <li>Scent lasts a good long while.</li>
            <li>and there are no bad chemicals absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>by itself it is very strong, but mixed with Tea Tree Oil and Olive Oil, it is pleasant enough to spray even in a room...</li>
            <li>The products was exactly what it was supposed to be!  </li>
            <li>definitely order more!</li>
            <li>I found spraying this around the window seals and door frames it did help with the spider and ant problem I was having its just a bit strong in smell but enough windows open its okay and after leaves a nice mellow citrus scent.</li>
            <li>It was amazing mosquitoes were everywhere like a cloud, following me and my wife but even if sometimes some landed on our arms</li>
            <li>Used this to make my own citronella candles to keep bugs away while I am outside.</li>
            <li>I make my own products and got a reciepe for Mosquito spray with essential oils on Pinterest.</li>
            <li>Bought this to try and make my own citronella candles for outside.  </li>
            <li>Love the citronella scent and so far it seems to be keeping the bulk of mosquitoes out of our gazebo.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to many ingredients in store bought bug sprays.  </li>
            <li>So far we have been pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also sprayed around my windows that don&#x27;t have screens with success also.</li>
            <li>I can smell it when I first put it on, but the smell dissipates quickly and is unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to douse yourself and your environment in DNA-distorting, headache-causing, lung-offending, heavy-duty chemicals, this is about as good as other methods I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>it was just right.</li>
            <li>On top of that, there is a moat that hugs the back of our home.</li>
            <li>It really does the trick at keeping the mosquitoes away!</li>
            <li>and it has been pretty efficient (mosquitoes are pretty voracious during those damp summer days in Indiana).</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Okay, I have been playing around with essential oils and trying home remedies instead of using chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I diluted mine with lots of water and the smell of citronella in my bathroom is still intense!</li>
            <li>Really helped with Mosquitos!</li>
            <li>In an area where there are a lot of mosquitoes it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>It does the job and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>They have higher quality oils.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase from this company.</li>
            <li>The packaging was very well done!</li>
            <li>Perhaps next time I make them, I&#x27;ll have to use more.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t pretty.  </li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner, exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It works as a mosquito repellant very well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because after the first day it doesn&#x27;t even smell like citronella anymore when you walk through the area, but it seems like the mosquitos still notice it.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and product is high quality.</li>
            <li>It does fade pretty fast though</li>
            <li>I got this to mix with Vaseline as a natural fly deterrent for my horses nose and other sensitive skin areas...</li>
            <li>are pure when they are not</li>
            <li>I bought this purely as a way to keep Mosquitos out of my house.</li>
            <li>Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>They infested our front door and window screens and the killer/repellant sprays we tried did not work and evaporated fast in the Arizona</li>
            <li>REALLY,</li>
            <li>I spray my whole body with it each time I go in the woods or work in my yard</li>
            <li>I really does work well, freshens things up really well.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to mosquito bites and they are really attracted to me.</li>
            <li>It really keeps mosquitos off of me and my kids.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of citronella anyway.</li>
            <li>It worked well and fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well for what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I stayed the whole weekend and did not get one tick on me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really helps to keep mosquitos away from my porch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few recipes but the citronella doesn&#x27;t seem effective.</li>
            <li>For my purposes, it would be good to have larger bottles available at a lower unit cost than the very small 1/3 oz. size.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product for only for the visible part of my skin and the mosquitoes bited me right through my shirt</li>
            <li>I have been using it to make my own homemade insect repellent and it works great.</li>
            <li>The price was very competitive and the packaging was not excessive</li>
            <li>I really put this to the test one day when I was working on my car and coincidentally parked right next to a mosquito nest.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this two products.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this highly to anyone.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I will purchase from them again when looking for any essentail oils, as the this product seems to be of high quality.</li>
            <li>And even after both mixtures were made, I still have over 80% of the oil in this container, so should be able to repeat several times as necessary through the warm months until at least the mosquitos die off in the fall and winter.</li>
            <li>I found this product after a friend who goes camping frequently recommended it to me and found it to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the cap is cheap so make sure you screw it on tight and secure to prevent any evaporation.</li>
            <li>We live by a golf course.</li>
            <li>I live in an apartment</li>
            <li>I have bought other plant therapy essential oils and have been pleased with all of them.</li>
            <li>Works well in oil burner or applied directly to the body for mosquito repellant!</li>
            <li>so far it seems to be working well!</li>
            <li>We live in the tropics and the bugs were eating us alive.  </li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong with just 10 drops, and it worked quite well until we forgot to spray for a week and our windows were COVERED in spiders and dead insects.</li>
            <li>I diffuse this when I leave my windows and doors open - We live in an area of mosquitos and this really helps keep them out of the house</li>
            <li>this oil is very high quality, and I would definitely recommend the Plant Therapy brand.  </li>
            <li>i wanted to put something in the backporch to deter the mosquitos from getting near the door.  </li>
            <li>Do not put this directly on your skin.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderfully natural and not chemical.</li>
            <li>I will be using it to make a natural product for my family during the warmer months to keep bugs away.</li>
            <li>The size of the bottle is also very convenient for travel and I will be taking it with me on my next vacation!</li>
            <li>We do spray about every 4 hours so the next batch I might add a few more drops.</li>
            <li>Very Happy hate mosquitos and needed this to make a spray</li>
            <li>Living in a place that is dry and hot tends to bring a lot of insects indoors into the home</li>
            <li>I got a small babyfood-sized glass jar and put about 2 spoonfuls of olive oil in them, then added several drops of this potent citronella oil (probably 15-20 drops).</li>
            <li>High quality oil and definitely helps keep the bugs at bay</li>
            <li>I got another small jar and filled it with 3 spoonfuls of water, then added in another 15-20 drops of citronella oil.</li>
            <li>Mixing Cedarwood and Citronella I together, makes a wonderful natural insect repellent.</li>
            <li>I only made one so far</li>
            <li>My patio awning and windows were constantly covered with cobwebs due to the large number of spiders always invading the patio.</li>
            <li>I can tell it&#x27;s great quality and won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>It along with other essential oils work very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and 1/10th the cost and lasts a long time</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This oil has a pleasant smell and works well in my oil warmer.</li>
            <li> I am very confident that those products are excellent, but I did not want to spend a lot on something that I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong, and it works well!</li>
            <li> and I poured the mix in a spray bootle and It works amazingly good.</li>
            <li> it did good.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> The oil smells good and does the job.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Citronella oil smells good, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>

            <li> Good value for the price</li>
            <li> Super great product and service!</li>
            <li> The price couldn&#x27;t make me more happy...</li>
            <li> Good fragrance and effective insect repellant.</li>
            <li> We bought two more bottles to have on hand!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> Will buy more!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed, delightful citronella oil.</li>
            <li> They got to me in fairly quick time, were wrapped well, and the oils themselves are of very good quality.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I liked the speedy delivery</li>
            <li> It has a good odor, more akin to lemon than that chemical smell the candles have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s humane and cost effective.</li>
            <li> Nice size, nice price point.</li>
            <li> Great potent oil  Works better than  candles etc</li>
            <li> Smells nice and does keep the bugs away.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working nicely.  </li>
            <li> Citronella, vanilla and basil or eucalyptus oil as effective as DEET for mosquitoes in research.</li>
            <li> Easy, pleasant and effective.  </li>
            <li> Super fast deliver, great price and awesome scent product!</li>
            <li> I sprayed the dog and watched the gnats fly right off!</li>
            <li> Great smelling and soothing thank you for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t honestly claim to be able to test purity or how the oil was processed, but it does work well.</li>
            <li> Old wax works best so it smokes a lot.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but still haven&#x27;t found the right combo to truly fight mosquitos using this.</li>
            <li> If anything, a very light scent remains.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t love the smell, but I guess it works.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m unsure as to how potent this is?</li>
            <li> but if I did something to lessen products power I&#x27;d gladly give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I went to the park many times since then and could have enjoyed the nature as I wanted.</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed any more scratches or hair on the seat.</li>
            <li> Smells ok.</li>
            <li> So yes I love this product.</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> Also, makes you smell pretty amazing, too!</li>
            <li> Mosquitoes usually love me, but they don&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> I still see mosquitoes and have mosquito bites, though not as many as I would have by July.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I just love the product.  </li>
            <li> belong to &#x27;club&#x27; (for lack of better description).  </li>
            <li> Living very close to a pond, this is great to use around my patio area to keep the bugs and mosquitos away</li>
            <li> seems to be an okay product</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Will for sure buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will love it...  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work to keep my dogs from jumping, but diluted with water and put in a spray bottle it does seem to help them to keep from jumping on anyone.</li>
            <li> Keeping the bugs away :)</li>
            <li> love this  just ordered more</li>
            <li> Also safe on my dogs.</li>
            <li> Though they seem to be ok, the citronella vapors could be stronger.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses including insect repellant.</li>
            <li> Always check to make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic to anything in here, but otherwise go for it.</li>
            <li> and I would assume it better for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> make sure you cover all your exposed skin or they will bite you.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Works pretty good in candles.</li>
            <li> The portable diffuser/humidifier worked great and was pleasantly surprised how well this oil worked!</li>
            <li> This oil did a pretty good job without being to strong to irritate my allergies.</li>
            <li> I love using it to make my own bug proof spray, you know exactly what is in it</li>
            <li> This is excellent in homemade mosquito spray along with other items</li>
            <li> But the scent washes out easily once you wash your clothes.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this has a strong citronella scent</li>
            <li> Strong smell</li>
            <li> 5-10 drops to two pounds of wax created quite a strong scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, I just realized I don&#x27;t like the smell of citronella.  </li>
            <li> We use this oil in a tea light diffuser.</li>
            <li> They make fly spray for horses already containing this oil but want double the price.</li>
            <li> I add a bottle of this to a gallon of fly spray and it helps keep the gnats and mosquitoes from dining on my horses at night and possibly infecting them w/</li>
            <li> Had the vehicle already in pieces before I realized it, but I set an oil burner filled with this by my front bumper and watched would-be attackers flee.  </li>
            <li> Over all did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> All of them smell very nice, and the citronella mixed with skin oil kept the mosquitos away.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and the packaging was super cute.</li>
            <li> Very strong smelling, very concentrated, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that you had some I bought two.</li>
            <li> This is going to be great to use in the vaporizer with other oils to give an uplifting, fresh scent to the room!</li>
            <li> The park was full of mosquitoes and they were all around me</li>
            <li> Very concentrated and potent.  </li>
            <li> I received my order very promptly and it smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Was a fast delivery - and it was used as intended- smelled fabulous!</li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> The works great with the other oils..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like they hit a wall and fly off the other way.</li>
            <li> Much more potent than what I can find locally</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, too.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great bottle of Citronella essential oil...  </li>
            <li> I received the citronella eo quickly and unharmed.</li>
            <li> Scent lasts a good long while.</li>
            <li> and there are no bad chemicals absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> by itself it is very strong, but mixed with Tea Tree Oil and Olive Oil, it is pleasant enough to spray even in a room...</li>
            <li> The products was exactly what it was supposed to be!  </li>
            <li> definitely order more!</li>
            <li> I found spraying this around the window seals and door frames it did help with the spider and ant problem I was having its just a bit strong in smell but enough windows open its okay and after leaves a nice mellow citrus scent.</li>
            <li> It was amazing mosquitoes were everywhere like a cloud, following me and my wife but even if sometimes some landed on our arms</li>
            <li> Used this to make my own citronella candles to keep bugs away while I am outside.</li>
            <li> I make my own products and got a reciepe for Mosquito spray with essential oils on Pinterest.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try and make my own citronella candles for outside.  </li>
            <li> Love the citronella scent and so far it seems to be keeping the bulk of mosquitoes out of our gazebo.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to many ingredients in store bought bug sprays.  </li>
            <li> So far we have been pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also sprayed around my windows that don&#x27;t have screens with success also.</li>
            <li> I can smell it when I first put it on, but the smell dissipates quickly and is unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to douse yourself and your environment in DNA-distorting, headache-causing, lung-offending, heavy-duty chemicals, this is about as good as other methods I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> it was just right.</li>
            <li> On top of that, there is a moat that hugs the back of our home.</li>
            <li> It really does the trick at keeping the mosquitoes away!</li>
            <li> and it has been pretty efficient (mosquitoes are pretty voracious during those damp summer days in Indiana).</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have been playing around with essential oils and trying home remedies instead of using chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I diluted mine with lots of water and the smell of citronella in my bathroom is still intense!</li>
            <li> Really helped with Mosquitos!</li>
            <li> In an area where there are a lot of mosquitoes it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> It does the job and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> They have higher quality oils.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from this company.</li>
            <li> The packaging was very well done!</li>
            <li> Perhaps next time I make them, I&#x27;ll have to use more.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t pretty.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner, exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It works as a mosquito repellant very well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny because after the first day it doesn&#x27;t even smell like citronella anymore when you walk through the area, but it seems like the mosquitos still notice it.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and product is high quality.</li>
            <li> It does fade pretty fast though</li>
            <li> I got this to mix with Vaseline as a natural fly deterrent for my horses nose and other sensitive skin areas...</li>
            <li> are pure when they are not</li>
            <li> I bought this purely as a way to keep Mosquitos out of my house.</li>
            <li> Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> They infested our front door and window screens and the killer/repellant sprays we tried did not work and evaporated fast in the Arizona</li>
            <li> REALLY,</li>
            <li> I spray my whole body with it each time I go in the woods or work in my yard</li>
            <li> I really does work well, freshens things up really well.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to mosquito bites and they are really attracted to me.</li>
            <li> It really keeps mosquitos off of me and my kids.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of citronella anyway.</li>
            <li> It worked well and fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well for what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I stayed the whole weekend and did not get one tick on me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really helps to keep mosquitos away from my porch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few recipes but the citronella doesn&#x27;t seem effective.</li>
            <li> For my purposes, it would be good to have larger bottles available at a lower unit cost than the very small 1/3 oz. size.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product for only for the visible part of my skin and the mosquitoes bited me right through my shirt</li>
            <li> I have been using it to make my own homemade insect repellent and it works great.</li>
            <li> The price was very competitive and the packaging was not excessive</li>
            <li> I really put this to the test one day when I was working on my car and coincidentally parked right next to a mosquito nest.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this two products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this highly to anyone.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I will purchase from them again when looking for any essentail oils, as the this product seems to be of high quality.</li>
            <li> And even after both mixtures were made, I still have over 80% of the oil in this container, so should be able to repeat several times as necessary through the warm months until at least the mosquitos die off in the fall and winter.</li>
            <li> I found this product after a friend who goes camping frequently recommended it to me and found it to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cap is cheap so make sure you screw it on tight and secure to prevent any evaporation.</li>
            <li> We live by a golf course.</li>
            <li> I live in an apartment</li>
            <li> I have bought other plant therapy essential oils and have been pleased with all of them.</li>
            <li> Works well in oil burner or applied directly to the body for mosquito repellant!</li>
            <li> so far it seems to be working well!</li>
            <li> We live in the tropics and the bugs were eating us alive.  </li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong with just 10 drops, and it worked quite well until we forgot to spray for a week and our windows were COVERED in spiders and dead insects.</li>
            <li> I diffuse this when I leave my windows and doors open - We live in an area of mosquitos and this really helps keep them out of the house</li>
            <li> this oil is very high quality, and I would definitely recommend the Plant Therapy brand.  </li>
            <li> i wanted to put something in the backporch to deter the mosquitos from getting near the door.  </li>
            <li> Do not put this directly on your skin.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderfully natural and not chemical.</li>
            <li> I will be using it to make a natural product for my family during the warmer months to keep bugs away.</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is also very convenient for travel and I will be taking it with me on my next vacation!</li>
            <li> We do spray about every 4 hours so the next batch I might add a few more drops.</li>
            <li> Very Happy hate mosquitos and needed this to make a spray</li>
            <li> Living in a place that is dry and hot tends to bring a lot of insects indoors into the home</li>
            <li> I got a small babyfood-sized glass jar and put about 2 spoonfuls of olive oil in them, then added several drops of this potent citronella oil (probably 15-20 drops).</li>
            <li> High quality oil and definitely helps keep the bugs at bay</li>
            <li> I got another small jar and filled it with 3 spoonfuls of water, then added in another 15-20 drops of citronella oil.</li>
            <li> Mixing Cedarwood and Citronella I together, makes a wonderful natural insect repellent.</li>
            <li> I only made one so far</li>
            <li> My patio awning and windows were constantly covered with cobwebs due to the large number of spiders always invading the patio.</li>
            <li> I can tell it&#x27;s great quality and won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It along with other essential oils work very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and 1/10th the cost and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Along with other essential oils and witch hazel, this repellent worked wonderfully, and I do not have to worry about wrecking my kidneys with DEET!  </li>
            <li> The oil smells super strong and my cats hate it.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other all natural scents.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We filled a spray bottle with half olive oil and half tap water, with about 10 drops (maybe more, in my anger) of the citronella oil and shook it vigorously.</li>
            <li> i got an empty cat food tin and poured some of the oil into that and set in back porch.  </li>
            <li> Spent two days in the summer at Blue springs park in Florida.</li>
            <li> It also made a good repellent when mixed with a suntan lotion and cedarwood oil while walking around in deep woods.</li>
            <li> I mixed up a little bug spray to take camping from the instructions on the back</li>
            <li> I make my own natural insect repellent.</li>
            <li> but I did not suffer any single bites.</li>
            <li> and I did not suffer any single byte.</li>
            <li> but I put a few drops in a spray bottle with water and the smell is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> From the previous reviews (which made me purchase it) must be for a different species of</li>
            <li> I rub a little on where the bugs are biting and they never come back.</li>
            <li> after 10 days of daily use of this Citronella essential oil I can testify that it does NOTHING WHATSOEVER to keep the blood thirsty suckers</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops per burner.</li>
            <li> Although it can make things slippery (be careful!), we repeated this every 3 or 4 days for about 12 days and included the walls surrounding our door.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with coconut oil, sprayed it on and no more problems with bugs.</li>
            <li> I bought it (and other products) to make homemade bug spray.</li>
            <li> Though the scent is strong, it&#x27;s not as bad as that bug spray</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s an essential oil, so they all are not cheap.</li>
            <li> the bugs make it hard to sit outside in the evenings.</li>
            <li> I used this with coconut oil to make my own mosquito repellent and it worked wonders.  </li>
            <li> I made our own mosquito spray repellent with lemongrass and this.  </li>
            <li> It is much less expensive than the MLM brands, and the company is very helpful and a pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li> used about half the bottle, so it  is a little pricey if you count shipping.</li>
            <li> I just sprinkle it on every few days</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes they were -gone-.</li>
            <li> I walk my dog every day in a heavily wooded area and wanted to keep them away with something that didn&#x27;t smell so offensive.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a few oils through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I use it when I hike and with plain wax in a melter outback to repel bugs.</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> Although the spray we made to get rid of bugs did attract an excessive amount of fire ants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this product would work against mosquitos or not.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with several other oils to use as a bug repellent and it worked well.</li>
            <li> The campsite within range of our burners was well protected against the blood suckers.</li>
            <li> I got this to make bug repellent later in the year, but since it&#x27;s cold right now, I decided to use it in my homemade deodorant.</li>
            <li> Seriously with the amount of words..............</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t compare it with the deet crap product I have bought in walmart and was as ineffective at as it is possible to be.</li>
            <li> Planning to use on the dogs as a natural flea repellent.</li>
            <li> I mix this with the lemongrass oil and water into a spray bottle to use as a natural insect repellent.</li>
            <li> I am so looking forward to putting this in a bar for a natural bug repellent.</li>
            <li> We had terrible mosquitos outside our sliding glass doors that were getting inside- just a few drops of this around the frame and they were GONE!</li>
            <li> Went ahead and mixed this with some candle wax for homemade outdoor insect repellent when we went camping.</li>
            <li> We had seemingly dozens of very bad mosquitoes outside our front door that would always come in the house whenever you came in or went out.</li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;m doing something wrong but scent lasts minutes.</li>
            <li> too complicated to use</li>
            <li> After reading other customers reviews of this item I also purchased it to use as an insect repellent.</li>
            <li> They have been terrible this year where I live, but I hate spraying that poison stuff all over my skin for protection.  </li>
            <li> Mosquitoes still bite my family and I but not as bad as they were.</li>
            <li> The bad thing here is that these mosquitos can have West Nile or can cause heartworms in your indoor</li>
            <li> (:(</li>
            <li> The purchase was made to help discourage the annoying gnats we have in this area.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of citronella</li>
            <li> so I also bought this product &amp;#34;Repel 100 Insect Repellent, 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Three oils combined for my homemade mosquito repellent, worked well..  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to make a home-made mosquito and bug repellent.  </li>
            <li> Although we always us DEET insect repellent as well.</li>
            <li> none of them have dared to byte, they seemed disgusted jajaja...</li>
            <li> and I have a terrible reaction to ant bites and mosquito bites.</li>

            <li> I use this to dissuade my cats from eating the xmas tree (and whatever else). The oil smells super strong and my cats hate it. It does fade pretty fast though so I have to reapply. It kind of stinks up the house and I don&#x27;t love the smell, but I guess it works.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm for repelling mosquitoes</li>
            <li> Its a great product! Mosquitoes still bite my family and I but not as bad as they were. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this Essential Oil to help keep mosquitos away this summer. I have bought other plant therapy essential oils and have been pleased with all of them.</li>
            <li> I liked the speedy delivery but I&#x27;m unsure as to how potent this is? I&#x27;ve tried quite a few recipes but the citronella doesn&#x27;t seem effective. Not sure why or if I&#x27;m doing something wrong but scent lasts minutes. Not longer. So I&#x27;m recommending product but if I did something to lessen products power I&#x27;d gladly give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Keeps the bugs away! Used this to make my own citronella candles to keep bugs away while I am outside.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Although the spray we made to get rid of bugs did attract an excessive amount of fire ants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to attract ants - 5 stars.</li>
            <li> this oil works perfect.  mosquitos keep getting into my house.  i wanted to put something in the backporch to deter the mosquitos from getting near the door.  i ordered this oil out of desperation.  i got an empty cat food tin and poured some of the oil into that and set in back porch.  it works!  the porch smells a bit like citronella, but i haven&#x27;t seen any mosquitos in the house.  perfect</li>
            <li> Tested in Santa Ana Park in Texas during summer: I mixed the product &amp;#34;Citronella Essential Oil. 10 ml (1/3 oz)&amp;#34; with olive oil and water and I poured the mix in a spray bootle and It works amazingly good. The park was full of mosquitoes and they were all around me but I did not suffer any single bites. It works really great and I can&#x27;t compare it with the deet crap product I have bought in walmart and was as ineffective at as it is possible to be. The first time I used this product for only for the visible part of my skin and the mosquitoes bited me right through my shirt so I also bought this product &amp;#34;Repel 100 Insect Repellent, 4 oz. Pump Spray, 1 Bottle &amp;#34; and it did good. To resume the second time I went to the park, I used the citronella oil on the visible part of my skin(arms, legs, neck, face) and I used the Repel 100  on my clothes only and I did not suffer any single byte. It was amazing mosquitoes were everywhere like a cloud, following me and my wife but even if sometimes some landed on our arms none of them have dared to byte, they seemed disgusted jajaja... I went to the park many times since then and could have enjoyed the nature as I wanted. I highly recommend this two products.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with several other oils to use as a bug repellent and it worked well. I know there are problems with companies claiming oils are pure when they are not and I can&#x27;t honestly claim to be able to test purity or how the oil was processed, but it does work well. This makes me think it is a high-quality oil and I have no concerns with its effectiveness or authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite happy with it!</li>
            <li> I make my own products and got a reciepe for Mosquito spray with essential oils on Pinterest. The works great with the other oils..</li>
            <li> I used it to keep cats from sleeping on my motorcycle seat under the cover. I just sprinkle it on every few days and I have not noticed any more scratches or hair on the seat.</li>
            <li> We live by a golf course. On top of that, there is a moat that hugs the back of our home. At the start of this summer, they decided to drain the moat for repairs and then refill it but delayed replacing the mosquito eating fish and running the water pump. Boom! Mosquito infestation! They infested our front door and window screens and the killer/repellant sprays we tried did not work and evaporated fast in the Arizona heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We filled a spray bottle with half olive oil and half tap water, with about 10 drops (maybe more, in my anger) of the citronella oil and shook it vigorously. We sprayed the door (wooden) and around the screens and waited. Within a few minutes they were -gone-. Although it can make things slippery (be careful!), we repeated this every 3 or 4 days for about 12 days and included the walls surrounding our door. The mosquitoes have not returned since. We bought two more bottles to have on hand!</li>
            <li> Smells ok. Works pretty good in candles.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is having a problem with masquitoes.  My daughter told me about a mix and it worked for her family, so I got what I needed and it works great.  I live in an apartment so I put it on everytime I take my dog for a walk.  I am&lt;br /&gt;so allergic to there bite that the bite grows to the size of a baseball.  REALLY, and the itch is off the charts.  So yes I love this product. And the person who made the Bug off receipes.</li>
            <li> Great product and smells good too.  It really does the trick at keeping the mosquitoes away!</li>
            <li> We live in the tropics and the bugs were eating us alive.  We purchased local citronella products only to find they had no citronella in them.  Then, I searched the internet for a bug repellant recipe.  It called for Citronella and I purchased This brand.  Glad I did. I mixed it with coconut oil, sprayed it on and no more problems with bugs. Easy, pleasant and effective.  I would recommend this highly to anyone.  It has greatly increased our quality of life.</li>
            <li> The products was exactly what it was supposed to be!  I bought it (and other products) to make homemade bug spray. It worked great!</li>
            <li> This is excellent in homemade mosquito spray along with other items</li>
            <li> Mixed with apple cider vinegar and water repellants misquotes for about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I meant to purchase. Hoping to find a use or might ask my friend to use to make soap for next season&#x27;s camping season.</li>
            <li> too complicated to use</li>
            <li> Living in a place that is dry and hot tends to bring a lot of insects indoors into the home I found spraying this around the window seals and door frames it did help with the spider and ant problem I was having its just a bit strong in smell but enough windows open its okay and after leaves a nice mellow citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Three oils combined for my homemade mosquito repellent, worked well..  I would order this product again. Shipping was excellent  Seriously with the amount of words..............</li>
            <li> I used this with coconut oil to make my own mosquito repellent and it worked wonders.  Took it camping in the woods and didn&#x27;t get bit at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to make a home-made mosquito and bug repellent.  Along with other essential oils and witch hazel, this repellent worked wonderfully, and I do not have to worry about wrecking my kidneys with DEET!  Also, makes you smell pretty amazing, too!</li>
            <li> We use this oil in a tea light diffuser. Clears the mosquitoes out of our room before we go to bed. Seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> I mix about a quarter cup of witch hazel and 20 drops of citronella in a spray bottle. I spray my whole body with it each time I go in the woods or work in my yard and it has been pretty efficient (mosquitoes are pretty voracious during those damp summer days in Indiana). The oil smells good and does the job. Mosquitoes usually love me, but they don&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> Works great in my body butter to help repel mosquitos. Scent lasts a good long while. I have also used this on cotton balls around my home and it seems to help keep the skeeters away when we have bbq&#x27;s etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> Very concentrated and potent.  Product was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I use this when i make sprays and candles to help keep the mosquitoes away. I continue to add drops until i get the desired smell I am looking for. Works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make a home remedy flea and tick spray for my dogs (and me) while out in the parks.  It along with other essential oils work very well. The price was very competitive and the packaging was not excessive it was just right. Arrived within the allotted time frame. Good quality product. I would recommend .</li>
            <li> Made Homemade Citronella Candles with oil &amp;they turned out great!</li>
            <li> I use this when I go into to the woods.  I rub a little on where the bugs are biting and they never come back.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try and make my own citronella candles for outside.  I only made one so far and it&#x27;s working great!  Love the citronella scent and so far it seems to be keeping the bulk of mosquitoes out of our gazebo.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
            <li> I made our own mosquito spray repellent with lemongrass and this.  It&#x27;s natural and 1/10th the cost and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Okay, I have been playing around with essential oils and trying home remedies instead of using chemicals.  Anyway, this has a strong citronella scent and I have been mixing this with baking soda and lavender oil for a carpet freshener in the room with our dogs.  I really does work well, freshens things up really well.</li>
            <li> been using this stuff to use up all the extra candle wax around here. works awesome and smells great. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It smells like citronella. I have not used it yet. Planning to use on the dogs as a natural flea repellent.</li>
            <li> After reading other customers reviews of this item I also purchased it to use as an insect repellent. My patio awning and windows were constantly covered with cobwebs due to the large number of spiders always invading the patio. Some would occasionally get inside the house. Once I started using the product I immediately noticed the difference, no cobwebs, spiders outside or inside. I use 10 drops of the oil, 5 drops of dishwashing detergent to 1 quart of water in a spray bottle, shake and spray once a week.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to many ingredients in store bought bug sprays.  Combine this with some vanilla, lavender, and lemon juice, and the bugs will not bother you.</li>
            <li> Do not put this directly on your skin. I diluted mine with lots of water and the smell of citronella in my bathroom is still intense! Lasted for days. I still see mosquitoes and have mosquito bites, though not as many as I would have by July. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s an essential oil, so they all are not cheap. I&#x27;ll try it again and maybe mix with witch hazel or something that&#x27;s an equal deterrent to mosquitoes.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t repel mosquitoes.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Arrived quickly and the packaging was super cute. Love it!</li>
            <li> This oil has a pleasant smell and works well in my oil warmer. It does seem to repell insects.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Really helped with Mosquitos!</li>
            <li> I just love the product.  I purchased it to make insect repellant (without all the chemicals).  It works GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> belong to &#x27;club&#x27; (for lack of better description).  I am very confident that those products are excellent, but I did not want to spend a lot on something that I wasn&#x27;t sure was going to work.  I wanted to diffuse citronella out doors on the patio table.  The portable diffuser/humidifier worked great and was pleasantly surprised how well this oil worked! I am allergic to mosquito bites and they are really attracted to me. I did not have an issue with mosquitos those nights! (or with flies or moths either!)  will purchase from this company again. Hope you have lavender oil, because we go through a lot of that, and the &#x27;club&#x27; prices might break the bank over that one!</li>
            <li> I use this product on everything animal related, plus I use it on myself. I mix it with other all natural scents. I make my own natural insect repellent.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I don&#x27;t like candles, so I bought this when our home seemed to be having an Asian beetle problem. I rubbed this on the wood trim around the screen door and the beetles seemed to no longer like the house after breaking into it for days. I saw them outside, but they stayed away from the screen (there was a space between the screen and the door they used to infiltrate), which was their chief entry point. It has a good odor, more akin to lemon than that chemical smell the candles have. In the summer I plan to use dab this on my kid&#x27;s socks and clothes for outside playtimes.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  I have been using it to make my own homemade insect repellent and it works great.</li>
            <li> I diffuse this when I leave my windows and doors open - We live in an area of mosquitos and this really helps keep them out of the house</li>
            <li> When mixed with teak oil keeps wasps away</li>
            <li> this oil is very high quality, and I would definitely recommend the Plant Therapy brand.  It is much less expensive than the MLM brands, and the company is very helpful and a pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li> Went ahead and mixed this with some candle wax for homemade outdoor insect repellent when we went camping. In an area where there are a lot of mosquitoes it worked pretty well. It also made a good repellent when mixed with a suntan lotion and cedarwood oil while walking around in deep woods. Although we always us DEET insect repellent as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this to make bug spray. Strong smell, so even diluted it&#x27;s still great! I use outdoors to keep flies, mosquitoes, gnats, etc....away and this works great!</li>
            <li> Living very close to a pond, this is great to use around my patio area to keep the bugs and mosquitos away</li>
            <li> The citronella oil was just what I ordered. It seemed to work to keep away mosquitoes just as well as I rememeber when my grandmother would put it on us.</li>
            <li> seems to be an okay product</li>
            <li> It does the job and is exactly as described. Smells wonderfully natural and not chemical.</li>
            <li> Works well in oil burner or applied directly to the body for mosquito repellant! Will buy more!</li>
            <li> by itself it is very strong, but mixed with Tea Tree Oil and Olive Oil, it is pleasant enough to spray even in a room...does work on keep those pesky mosquitoes at bay!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love using it to make my own bug proof spray, you know exactly what is in it and there are no bad chemicals absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> We are currently building a vacation house in Fiji, and I did a lot of research on non chemical options for Mosquito control.&lt;br /&gt;Now after 10 days of daily use of this Citronella essential oil I can testify that it does NOTHING WHATSOEVER to keep the blood thirsty suckers away!&lt;br /&gt;DEET is not an option for us, but what does work is a e r o guard, but it is chemical based. For prevention of dengue fever it is a must for children and people with impaired health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citronella oil smells good, but that&#x27;s about it. From the previous reviews (which made me purchase it) must be for a different species of Mosquito?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this for mosquitos and to keep my dog out of things. Just a drop or two and she stayed away from spots she tried to chew on or dig up. It&#x27;s humane and cost effective.</li>
            <li> Perfect for making an anti-varmint spray. It seems to be doing the job.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It really keeps mosquitos off of me and my kids.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I use it in my diffuser when I see mosquitos in my house.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose. Great smelling and soothing thank you for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> We use this to mix up a homemade batch of bug spray. It works! We even sprayed it on our dogs! Nice size, nice price point. Will for sure buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> Keeps mosquitoes away.  That was what I was hoping for.  It works.....</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to add to my horses&#x27; fly spray. They make fly spray for horses already containing this oil but want double the price. I add a bottle of this to a gallon of fly spray and it helps keep the gnats and mosquitoes from dining on my horses at night and possibly infecting them w/ any number of illnesses horses can get from their bits.</li>
            <li> Super great product and service!</li>
            <li> I prefer Eden&#x27;s garden. They have higher quality oils.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but still haven&#x27;t found the right combo to truly fight mosquitos using this.</li>
            <li> I use citronella oil for candle making. 5-10 drops to two pounds of wax created quite a strong scent. Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Much more potent than what I can find locally and it&#x27;s a great price. My only complaint is that the cap is cheap so make sure you screw it on tight and secure to prevent any evaporation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, I just realized I don&#x27;t like the smell of citronella.  Works to keep my cat out of the plants, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed, delightful citronella oil. Great price for the amount. I use it when I hike and with plain wax in a melter outback to repel bugs. It arrived quickly, too.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and product.</li>
            <li> Great potent oil  Works better than  candles etc</li>
            <li> I mix this with the lemongrass oil and water into a spray bottle to use as a natural insect repellent. It smells amazing and keeps the Florida insects away!</li>
            <li> This is a must have in the summer with bugs...it does the trick.  Excellent valu!</li>
            <li> Used with outdoor candles. Excellent for keeping bugs away.</li>
            <li> I got this to mix with Vaseline as a natural fly deterrent for my horses nose and other sensitive skin areas...so far it seems to be working well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will love it...  I am still waiting for it to be delivered:(:(</li>
            <li> This worked great.  I put it in candle wax, and burn it outside to get rid of bugs.  Old wax works best so it smokes a lot.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work to keep my dogs from jumping, but diluted with water and put in a spray bottle it does seem to help them to keep from jumping on anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil, price, and service!  Would buy again!  Keeping the bugs away :)</li>
            <li> I Used this product in an oil burner on my outdoor patio to repel bugs! It worked great! Not diluted</li>
            <li> I Used this product in an oil burner on my outdoor patio to repel bugs! It worked great!  Not diluted.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and does keep the bugs away.  Used this in a cleaning solution in our kitchen as we keep a lot of produce.  The fruit flies have not come back!</li>
            <li> I received my order very promptly and it smells fantastic!  Thanks for a great bottle of Citronella essential oil...  I will be using it to make a natural product for my family during the warmer months to keep bugs away.</li>
            <li> I mix this in with some carrier oil (like olive oil) and rub it on my skin to keep the mosquitos away. This seems to do the job!</li>
            <li> Very Happy hate mosquitos and needed this to make a spray I was so excited that you had some I bought two.</li>
            <li> High quality oil and definitely helps keep the bugs at bay</li>
            <li> love this  just ordered more</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from this company. I will purchase from them again when looking for any essentail oils, as the this product seems to be of high quality.</li>
            <li> I got this to make bug repellent later in the year, but since it&#x27;s cold right now, I decided to use it in my homemade deodorant. I really like the smell of citronella anyway. I can smell it when I first put it on, but the smell dissipates quickly and is unnoticeable.  Happy girl here!</li>
            <li> Just started using essential oils. With the heat in Florida the bugs make it hard to sit outside in the evenings. Mixing Cedarwood and Citronella I together, makes a wonderful natural insect repellent. Also safe on my dogs.</li>
            <li> This oil did not work for the purpose intended.  Supposedly, if you mix this with some water and put it into a spray bottle and spray yourself, you can keep pests away.  I know my citronella candles work, so I figured this would be awesome. I walk my dog every day in a heavily wooded area and wanted to keep them away with something that didn&#x27;t smell so offensive.  Plus I have asthma and don&#x27;t like spraying some of that stuff on.  I SWEAR that the bugs actually like this stuff.  Waste of money.  Buy the stuff from the store.</li>
            <li> Super fast deliver, great price and awesome scent product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product during the summer when I was in the midst of a candle making frenzy trying to protect myself from bugs. This oil did a pretty good job without being to strong to irritate my allergies. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Was a fast delivery - and it was used as intended- smelled fabulous!</li>
            <li> The purchase was made to help discourage the annoying gnats we have in this area. So far we have been pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I would receive a box soaked in oil. To my amazement the package arrived undamaged and the contents were intact! Not a drop spilled. The packaging was very well done! Kudos to the one that packed that box! Good job! Very strong smelling, very concentrated, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I really put this to the test one day when I was working on my car and coincidentally parked right next to a mosquito nest.  Had the vehicle already in pieces before I realized it, but I set an oil burner filled with this by my front bumper and watched would-be attackers flee.  &amp;#34;Bzzz...  Ah, it&#x27;s burning!  Run Away!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is going to be great to use in the vaporizer with other oils to give an uplifting, fresh scent to the room! I can tell it&#x27;s great quality and won&#x27;t be disappointed. The price couldn&#x27;t make me more happy...</li>
            <li> Used two 1/3-oz. bottles of this oil to make a batch of candles for the patio.  Though they seem to be ok, the citronella vapors could be stronger.  Perhaps next time I make them, I&#x27;ll have to use more.  For my purposes, it would be good to have larger bottles available at a lower unit cost than the very small 1/3 oz. size.</li>
            <li> I mixed up a little bug spray to take camping from the instructions on the back and it was great! It worked well and fast. I sprayed the dog and watched the gnats fly right off! I also used the oil to create a barrier for our tent.</li>
            <li> I bought this purely as a way to keep Mosquitos out of my house. It&#x27;s working very well. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Use it around the house. Love it.</li>
            <li> We had terrible mosquitos outside our sliding glass doors that were getting inside- just a few drops of this around the frame and they were GONE! I take it on camping trips and travel now to repel pests. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few oils through Amazon.com. They got to me in fairly quick time, were wrapped well, and the oils themselves are of very good quality. I did grapefruit, citronella and eucalyptus. All of them smell very nice, and the citronella mixed with skin oil kept the mosquitos away.</li>
            <li> The product appears excellent however there was a lot of oil in the packaging bag and not the bottle then the product arived.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell attract people!  I used for repelling no-see-ums.  It works, but only for short time.  When the oil evaporates, the repel dies.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  Works very well for what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> Used to make homemade bug spray! Worked great!</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed, which was making outdoor candles. The product arrived just as promised.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about what this would smell like but I put a few drops in a spray bottle with water and the smell is barely noticeable.  I&#x27;ve used several times outside spraying it around the area we were sitting and it&#x27;s working nicely.  You can actually see the bugs coming and it&#x27;s like they hit a wall and fly off the other way. We do spray about every 4 hours so the next batch I might add a few more drops. I&#x27;ve also sprayed around my windows that don&#x27;t have screens with success also. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best!&lt;br /&gt;It works for mosquitos,&lt;br /&gt;It works for keep dogs aside of my plants.&lt;br /&gt;It works works works.&lt;br /&gt;Very good price, excellent quality and customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Love how it smells too.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of citronella but it definitely serves its purpose!!!!!! The scent is very strong, and it works well!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get rid of the mosquitoes.  They seem sort of deterred by the stench of this stuff.  It isn&#x27;t pretty.  But it works about as well as grated garlic or something.  If you don&#x27;t want to douse yourself and your environment in DNA-distorting, headache-causing, lung-offending, heavy-duty chemicals, this is about as good as other methods I&#x27;ve tried.  It does seem to do SOMETHING... if they&#x27;re hungry, though, they&#x27;ll get you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to dilute with water and spray on the porch of a friend who likes to sit out and is pestered by the \\&quot;mosquito\\&quot;....it works....</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner, exactly what I needed. Trying it to repel a dog from marking in the house.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil because I have a lot of skin allergies and I have a terrible reaction to ant bites and mosquito bites. I found this product after a friend who goes camping frequently recommended it to me and found it to be very helpful.  The size of the bottle is also very convenient for travel and I will be taking it with me on my next vacation!</li>
            <li> arrive on time and 100%pure!</li>
            <li> I received the citronella eo quickly and unharmed. I am so looking forward to putting this in a bar for a natural bug repellent. I have yet to do it but soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders. I&#x27;ve purchased alot of oils from them.</li>
            <li> It works as a mosquito repellant very well!</li>
            <li> We had seemingly dozens of very bad mosquitoes outside our front door that would always come in the house whenever you came in or went out. The bad thing here is that these mosquitos can have West Nile or can cause heartworms in your indoor pets-- once the mosquitos are inside they are a big problem and you are like a fish in a barrel. So, I bought this Citronella 10ml Essential Oil and did two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I got a small babyfood-sized glass jar and put about 2 spoonfuls of olive oil in them, then added several drops of this potent citronella oil (probably 15-20 drops). Then I mixed this all up with a toothpick and left it on the ground uncovered just outside the front door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I got another small jar and filled it with 3 spoonfuls of water, then added in another 15-20 drops of citronella oil. I then just used a cotton ball and soaked it in the blended mixture and then applied it all around our front door frame, which is painted wood. No damage or peeling or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been no mosquitos since... It&#x27;s funny because after the first day it doesn&#x27;t even smell like citronella anymore when you walk through the area, but it seems like the mosquitos still notice it. If anything, a very light scent remains. But no mosquitos! And even after both mixtures were made, I still have over 80% of the oil in this container, so should be able to repeat several times as necessary through the warm months until at least the mosquitos die off in the fall and winter.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance and effective insect repellant. Citronella, vanilla and basil or eucalyptus oil as effective as DEET for mosquitoes in research.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for use on my body or bath or anything like that. We use them to ward off big river spiders on our windows and in our house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed 10 drops of oil with about 12 oz of tap water into a spray bottle and sprayed the outsides of our windows and doors once a week. The smell is quite strong with just 10 drops, and it worked quite well until we forgot to spray for a week and our windows were COVERED in spiders and dead insects.</li>
            <li> Use this on our pool area to deter bugs.  Mix with alcohol and water and mist on cushions and tables.  Works like the candles without the fire danger.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I put a dab of this on a cotton ball and pin it to my hat or shirt. Works well in repelling insects</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I will order again.</li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know Macmillan plants can get scintilla from</li>
            <li> This is a great product. This oil has so many uses including insect repellant. It is definitely a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price; I use it in a bug deterant concoction and it has helped keep the mosquitos away.</li>
            <li> I went camping about a month ago. I brought three of these bottles with me. I stayed the whole weekend and did not get one tick on me. Always check to make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic to anything in here, but otherwise go for it. I like this product.</li>
            <li> Added this and tea tree oil to inexpensive dollar tree burners. Spent two days in the summer at Blue springs park in Florida. The campsite within range of our burners was well protected against the blood suckers. It only takes a few drops per burner. Delivery was quick and product is high quality. used about half the bottle, so it  is a little pricey if you count shipping. Over all did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works great!!!</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this product would work against mosquitos or not.  They have been terrible this year where I live, but I hate spraying that poison stuff all over my skin for protection.  I started using this instead, and it seems to be working about as well as the poison sprays out there on the market.  Though the scent is strong, it&#x27;s not as bad as that bug spray and I would assume it better for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you cover all your exposed skin or they will bite you.&lt;br /&gt;One note, if you get it on your clothes, they will smell it until you wash them. But the scent washes out easily once you wash your clothes.</li>
            <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It really helps to keep mosquitos away from my porch.</li>
