    <ol>
            <li>As a highlighter, Touch&amp;eacute; &amp;Eacute;clat Radiant Touch is one of the best I have used.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a wonderful tool in your arsenal against the dreaded years creeping up, or just to refresh your face after a night out.</li>
            <li>This is the best lightweight concealing product out there.</li>
            <li>great product and price</li>
            <li>so I am very glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE finding it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Plus amazon has great prices and quick delivery!</li>
            <li>I used this product before &amp; liked the way it covers spots.</li>
            <li>Love it ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better then any thing we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>Many shades to match your skin color.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT CONCEALER, UNDER EYE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other lightners under my eyes, but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>Dear makeup loving friends,&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing four YSL touché Éclat at these bargain prices, two from Amazon, (this seller was the first), and two from EBay</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and stays all day.</li>
            <li>It makes me look fresh and awake :)</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and secure.  </li>
            <li>I like the minimal look in my make-up as my skin grows older, the best use for this highlighter is to use it in places on your face to deflect or to add highlights.</li>
            <li>The genuine product is smooth as silk and very luminizing.</li>
            <li>, I am here to let you know that there is no such thing as a cheap deal on authentic Touché Eclats.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spend the extra $15 for a genuine $40 touché éclat from a reputable seller, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>I did a quick comp with the real touché éclat.</li>
            <li>The first arrived...</li>
            <li>This one is not dry and goes on smooth</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>Side by side they&#x27;re clearly different, with the cheap one a lotlonger without any shaping, making for a messier application.</li>
            <li>Took it to Saks 5th Ave because it didn&#x27;t seem like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best...pricey but way worth it!</li>
            <li>The original is fairly short, and flattened on both sides.</li>
            <li>A tube lasts me a little more than a year</li>
            <li>Gently covers dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles without caking.</li>
            <li>To my horror I realized the cheap one had glaring inconsistencies.</li>
            <li>Next, the fake is a good quarter inch or more longer, lighter gold, slightly different cheaper looking fonts.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to every woman who wants to look radiant!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but definitely not the end all be all of concealers.</li>
            <li>I keep thinking I will find a better cover up for dark circles, I keep going back to this one.</li>
            <li>I decided to get a couple of different colors for the summer, and to use as general highlighters as they were so cheap, rather than as just the miracle eye bag concealer they&#x27;ve been for me for so long, so went on a spree buying these $20-25 touché Eclats.</li>
            <li>Was I sent old stock?</li>
            <li>I was in a hurry to get out the door as my friends were waiting downstairs to go, but I wanted to try the new darker color with my more tanned skin, so after priming and priming and priming for what went on forever (close to one hundred clicks - usually ten to fifteen for a new one), this thick goop appeared.</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t have been using the real product so long and had one in my drawer for comparison, I would have been duped just like hundreds (thousands?) are clearly being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was exactly as advertised and was a lot cheaper here than other sites.  </li>
            <li>I use it to touch up areas under my eyes, to highlight areas near my nares, highlight above my upper lip, near the corner of my eye, which seems to give it a lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I received an answer within a half hour &amp; an offer to replace it the next day if it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Have you seen models or celebrities with photos that display highlighter under eyes and other areas on their face?</li>
            <li> It also conceals small broken capillaries very well.  </li>
            <li> I have tried cheaper alternatives than Touche Eclat for covering dark areas and highlighting, but none work as well.  </li>
            <li> at least I&#x27;ve never noticed any scent at all, and this scent was overpowering, especially for use around the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On those mornings when I&#x27;m still half asleep with dark circles under my eyes this product is a miracle.</li>
            <li> As said in a previous review, this item is not genuine Touche Eclat.</li>
            <li> it hides the dark circles around the eyes and makes the eye area look luminous!  </li>
            <li> Odd color, sticky, poor coverage.  </li>
            <li> As a junior in mechanical engineering, sleep is hard to come by.</li>
            <li> Thick and perfumed, no luminizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fake has a longer round plastic applicator.</li>
            <li> It makes them look very strange, very bad make-up choice.</li>
            <li> The fake is like cheapo concealer in a tube.</li>
            <li> They explained how to identify the fake product just by its exterior.  </li>
            <li> For starters, there is a photocopy of instructions in the box in an ugly font on the cheapest almost newspaper quality paper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;VERY ANNOYING</li>
            <li> VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> Worst of all is the product itself.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for years in the under the eye area as a brightner.  It also conceals small broken capillaries very well.  A tube lasts me a little more than a year and I LOVE finding it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love it ... it hides the dark circles around the eyes and makes the eye area look luminous!  I would definitely recommend this product to every woman who wants to look radiant!</li>
            <li> I really like this and so does my mother and sister. It goes on smoothly and stays all day. It&#x27;s better then any thing we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> As a highlighter, Touch&amp;eacute; &amp;Eacute;clat Radiant Touch is one of the best I have used. I use it to touch up areas under my eyes, to highlight areas near my nares, highlight above my upper lip, near the corner of my eye, which seems to give it a lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have also noted is that this highlighter does not show under your makeup. Have you seen models or celebrities with photos that display highlighter under eyes and other areas on their face? It makes them look very strange, very bad make-up choice. I have seen this highlighter used above brows for an instant lift, though I have not used it as such. May try it next time I use it. I like the minimal look in my make-up as my skin grows older, the best use for this highlighter is to use it in places on your face to deflect or to add highlights. Those areas are yours to choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 06-02-14</li>
            <li> I have used other lightners under my eyes, but this one is the best.  The others always seem to look too dry.  This one is not dry and goes on smooth</li>
            <li> I love this product....I purchased it on QVC for years, but they&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;stopped selling it so I am very glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> great product and price</li>
            <li> I have tried cheaper alternatives than Touche Eclat for covering dark areas and highlighting, but none work as well.  I am a devoted YSL Touche Eclat fan!</li>
            <li> Simply the best...pricey but way worth it! Many shades to match your skin color. Lasts about 3-4 months using daily.</li>
            <li> As said in a previous review, this item is not genuine Touche Eclat. No idea what the ingredients truly are.</li>
            <li> Gently covers dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles without caking. Adds brightness to face. This is the only product I use for my face. Lasts and does not cause eye irritation. Plus amazon has great prices and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I keep thinking I will find a better cover up for dark circles, I keep going back to this one.</li>
            <li> Dear makeup loving friends,&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing four YSL touché Éclat at these bargain prices, two from Amazon, (this seller was the first), and two from EBay, I am here to let you know that there is no such thing as a cheap deal on authentic Touché Eclats. I have been using the product for over ten years, and adore it. I decided to get a couple of different colors for the summer, and to use as general highlighters as they were so cheap, rather than as just the miracle eye bag concealer they&#x27;ve been for me for so long, so went on a spree buying these $20-25 touché Eclats. Oh oh. The first arrived...I was in a hurry to get out the door as my friends were waiting downstairs to go, but I wanted to try the new darker color with my more tanned skin, so after priming and priming and priming for what went on forever (close to one hundred clicks - usually ten to fifteen for a new one), this thick goop appeared. I tried to schmear it around, but what a disaster! I ran out the door baffled. Was I sent old stock? Is the #1 such a different consistency to the #2? What about the cloying perfume? The touché éclat is unscented or at least I&#x27;ve never noticed any scent at all, and this scent was overpowering, especially for use around the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home I did a quick comp with the real touché éclat. To my horror I realized the cheap one had glaring inconsistencies. For starters, there is a photocopy of instructions in the box in an ugly font on the cheapest almost newspaper quality paper. Definitely never seen in any YSL product I&#x27;ve ever bought before. This was only in the one from this seller. The others had NONE. Red flag. Next, the fake is a good quarter inch or more longer, lighter gold, slightly different cheaper looking fonts. Removing the cap, the applicator is totally different. The original is fairly short, and flattened on both sides. The fake has a longer round plastic applicator. Side by side they&#x27;re clearly different, with the cheap one a lotlonger without any shaping, making for a messier application. Worst of all is the product itself. The genuine product is smooth as silk and very luminizing. The fake is like cheapo concealer in a tube. Thick and perfumed, no luminizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra $15 for a genuine $40 touché éclat from a reputable seller, you won&#x27;t regret it. They&#x27;re a wonderful tool in your arsenal against the dreaded years creeping up, or just to refresh your face after a night out. If I hadn&#x27;t have been using the real product so long and had one in my drawer for comparison, I would have been duped just like hundreds (thousands?) are clearly being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just thought you should know. I have the pics showing differences. Perhaps if I find the time and there&#x27;s enough interest, I&#x27;ll move them to my Mac to post here.</li>
            <li> I used this product before &amp; liked the way it covers spots. Had a problem starting it &amp; contacted the sellers. I received an answer within a half hour &amp; an offer to replace it the next day if it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This is the best lightweight concealing product out there. Once you start using it you will never want to be without it.</li>
            <li> Took it to Saks 5th Ave because it didn&#x27;t seem like the real thing.  They explained how to identify the fake product just by its exterior.  Odd color, sticky, poor coverage.  &amp;#34;Ya get what ya pay for&amp;#34;  I guess.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and secure.  It was exactly as advertised and was a lot cheaper here than other sites.  Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT CONCEALER, UNDER EYE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY ANNOYING AS WHEN YOU PURCHASE&lt;br /&gt;NEVER INDICATES WHAT SHADE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOUGHT TWICE, THINKING I WAS BUYING #1 LIGHT&lt;br /&gt;WHEN THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILL NOT BE WASTING MY MONEY AGAIN UNLESS&lt;br /&gt;THEY SPECIFY THE SHADE. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but definitely not the end all be all of concealers.</li>
            <li> As a junior in mechanical engineering, sleep is hard to come by. On those mornings when I&#x27;m still half asleep with dark circles under my eyes this product is a miracle. It makes me look fresh and awake :)</li>
