            <li> This was my first purchase from Amazon:  a Christmas present to myself when I won a  $25.00 gift certificate from AOL.  I bought this on Christmas Day, 2012, purchased \\&quot;new\\&quot;:  it wasn&#x27;t exactly new but rather appeared to be a \\&quot;tester\\&quot;;  the plastic wrapper had been reapplied with scotch tape and a little was missing.  But it smelled great, the price was right with the gift certificate, and I still have half a bottle left so it wasn&#x27;t watered down.</li>
