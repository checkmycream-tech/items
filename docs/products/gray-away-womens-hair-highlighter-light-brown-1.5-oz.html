            <li>The price of this product is great compared to others more than twice the price.</li>
            <li>Washes away easily but doesn&#x27;t rub off easily, and it stretches out the time in-between my hair color visits!!!</li>

            <li>But I&#x27;m happy that this product is available.</li>
            <li>Covers gray amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I  like the product but wish it had a sprayer bottle instead of the kind it  is.  </li>
            <li>Works nice stays in until a shampooing.</li>
            <li>Cannot return it because it is a hazardous item???</li>
            <li>It works perfectly and is absolutely GREAT to get you through that last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no scent  just a wonderful cover up  until i&#x27;m ready to color my hair.</li>
            <li>I received the order in good time, over all I am well satisfied with the product and the  company who sold it to me.  </li>
            <li>a light spray on your roots is all it takes for wonderful color which is quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use but effective for a good cover of the gray hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this pride to , the best on the market</li>
            <li>Root Concealer is my new best friend!  </li>
            <li>My new best friend!  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and the color blends good with my hair color.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have tried markers, crayons, mascara type touch ups, and this, by far, is the best for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of root concealer products and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I think it blends wonderful with my hair tone and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Meets expectation, appreciate the price, easy to use!</li>
            <li>Gray Away is the easy answer!</li>
            <li>Another VERY high priced color was the perfect color, but Gray Away light brown worked well &amp;</li>
            <li>I ended up choosing the light brown, and glad I did, since it&#x27;s fairly dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for quick cover.  </li>
            <li>Just bought 3 more cans.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This Gray Away covers better, and you can do anytime.</li>
            <li>Gray away works great and matchs my color really well.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>LOVE product.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect answer to temporary fixes, especially when you are traveling</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be sure to have it when I job travel.</li>
            <li>Though I might prefer the product that costs more than twice this price; I don&#x27;t like it that much more to make me choose it over this.</li>
            <li>this sure saves money &amp; time.</li>
            <li>Be sure when you spray it on to hold the container about a foot away.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li>I purchased this product more to cover areas around/in the part in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for covering gray, especially at the &amp;#34;part&amp;#34; in your hair and around the frame of your face!  </li>
            <li>It is better than what i though.</li>
            <li>I get better coverage using the brush</li>
            <li>This product is okay in a pinch.</li>
            <li>Maybe they could make spray thing better.</li>
            <li>Love the straw spay director on this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Was not all the pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>much better than the more expense Bumble product i have used.  </li>
            <li>This also looks a lot better, as you don&#x27;t see it on your hair.</li>
            <li>It does make your hair a bit &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; feeling, but to touch up that last week before coloring, it is a great option!</li>
            <li>Love it for touch-ups in between.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and washed out very easily.</li>
            <li>spray does cover the greys very nicely, but I found this color tended to rub off much easier than the Style Edit spray.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t wash your hair every single day, it would be best to to use a pillow case that you don&#x27;t care about, or a hair cap, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with a brown</li>
            <li>Product does work great for covering root grays in between colorings &amp; I find it looks natural.</li>
            <li>This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality ....</li>
            <li>ok i haven&#x27;t use it, but i&#x27;m pretty sure my mom will love it,</li>
            <li>The spray is easy to control and there is never any over-spray.</li>
            <li>I very quickly brush it on a section of grays &amp; then repeat.</li>
            <li>It works easily and stays on until you wash your hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and covers gray roots well in between hair coloring.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spray and it washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use as a touch up between coloring.  </li>
            <li>WHILE I THOUGHT THIS PRODUCT WOULD BE EASY, IT WAS UNTIL MAYBE</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the effect looked great and natural with the light brown on my medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li>It laundered out of the lighter pillow cover just fine.</li>
            <li>I try to barely press it to just get light coverage of the roots where my hair parts, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Love this for quick fixes</li>
            <li>More like 4 if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
            <li>Although that one is also pretty good, I like this product much better because it offers better coverage and is faster to use.  </li>
            <li>spray lightly.  </li>
            <li>Yes although the light brown is darker than I thought.  </li>
            <li>I use the light brown color in this</li>
            <li>you for such immediate delivery and great service.</li>
            <li>I use light brown for medium brown hair color.  </li>
            <li>I hemmed and hawed between ordering the light brown and the black/dark brown.</li>
            <li>I ordered light brown, received the can</li>
            <li>this is more reasonable, but hoping more like it come out</li>
            <li>It is such a good product I wish people knew what a help it would be to so many.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for little touchups in between colors!</li>
            <li>Does not leave any mark on your skin, just clean it and that&#x27; s it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 5 or 6 similar products and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to get the right amount of color spray but the coverage is excellent.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that has a real, non-fake looking color, applies quickly and easily and covers roots beautifully.</li>
            <li>Works great, as  I expected</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be any easier for good results when covering gray until next treatment..</li>
            <li>Delays the need for full hair dying.</li>
            <li>Looks good and actually gives her body as well.</li>
            <li>I love it and it works vey well and covers my very gray hair.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much, color stays on until I shampoo, and it gives me more time.  </li>
            <li>I always feel old when I can see gray roots and Gray Away quickly and effectively sprays it away.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to point and spray exactly where needed.  </li>
            <li>The first can I bought at Walmart was fine.  </li>
            <li>Need a quick fix for graying roots?</li>
            <li>If only it was carried in stores with more regularity and variety it would be of an even greater help in getting it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Belinda Pate</li>
            <li>It cover quickly and even all my gray hair .</li>
            <li>It looks so natural and is super easy to apply!</li>
            <li>Great color (dark brown)</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use, stays on all day, complete cover of gray, easy to blend into the color area.</li>
            <li>It was better than going to work with grey roots, and I&#x27;m pleased with that.</li>
            <li>The only thing is if it&#x27;s an outdoor event make sure there is no precipitation, the color will run off the hair if exposed to water!</li>
            <li>I bought the light brown and it blended perfectly with my dark blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine if you were using it all over it wouldn&#x27;t last very long but for me, it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>It does give good coverage, but the light brown is really dark!</li>
            <li>I bought Light Brown, which is indicates it&#x27;s for medium Brown - Light Brown - Blonde hair), because I have medium to light brown hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is light brown, and it&#x27;s darker than my hair, but blends really well.</li>
            <li>My roots look great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Was going to order several at a time to get free shipping on $30 or more but company did not qualify.  </li>
            <li>so the excess washes out and it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>product really worth having.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The application was easier and more natural looking.</li>
            <li>This one has advantages making it worth the money.</li>
            <li>If you are spraying more all over, you won&#x27;t get anywhere near 40 applications.</li>
            <li>and it dries pretty quickly; doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li>spray it right on my part line and front hair line.</li>
            <li>It has a nice narrow litte nozzel so it&#x27;s easy to get the color right where you want it.</li>
            <li>Works great but be aware there is very little product here.  </li>
            <li>I am about 90% gray and my hair grows super fast.</li>
            <li>The product is quite good in that it is less sticky than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>The light brown color is very natural.</li>
            <li>Came sooner than I expected, and I love this product!</li>
            <li>So easy, quickly covers entire hairline and &#x27;part&#x27; roots.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>It works really well for that 1-2 week period before it&#x27;s time for the trip to the salon!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Gray Away does work, but would not be my first choice.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like my hair color, it comes it</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more to keep on hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of wet when it goes on, which is not how it is shown on TV.</li>
            <li>Keeps coverage exactly where you want it.  </li>
            <li>works well, but leaves your hair a funny, sticky texture</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This product really works, and because of its \\&quot;focused\\&quot; spray, it doesn&#x27;t get all over everything - just right where you point it.</li>
            <li>have used more expensive products, and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was a more natural product as I am sensitive to chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Works great and gives me about an extra month before having to spend the big bucks to get my hair professionally colored.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy, easy to use and covers the gray entirely!!</li>
            <li>Wouldnt use it for large amounts of growth.</li>
            <li>Very good seller, not excellent product</li>
            <li>It was hard to get good</li>
            <li>Works really well to hide my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff really extends the time between trips to the salon.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much in the can though.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Works well if I don&#x27;t over spray and much easier than the type I was using that I had to put on and leave for 15 min then shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This is really a medium brown color.</li>
            <li>My hair grows fast</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I should</li>
            <li>Gray away works very well.</li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>and this really helps areas like that.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>the price was MUCH</li>
            <li>Once carefully styled it was okay, and no one seemed to notice.  </li>
            <li>but the sprayer wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>I have horribly fast growing hair</li>
            <li>If you just have a center part you are covering, then you will love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands, but you will not find one better than this brand.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it covers the gray completely, but it makes it pretty unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>I now how have a whole new freedom for coloring my hair when it is convenient for me.  </li>
            <li>Spray itself is easy to control although you need to be careful not to get too close to the root line.  </li>
            <li>Because Gray Away is more sticky, it was more difficult to get the tissue flakes out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only wish this came in larger cans, because I like to use all over on windy days when more than just the hair part becomes visible.</li>
            <li>I felt the @ $22 shipping for re order to high.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I read the ingredients and discovered the main ingredients were butane, hydrochlorofluorines, and other strong toxic chemicals</li>
            <li>It does what it says but requires a little skill to make your hair look ok.</li>
            <li>It is okay, buy leaves your hair a Little sticky.</li>
            <li>also found this spray to be a bit more sticky than Style Edit, as well as little harder to precisely control the spray.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but works great</li>
            <li>It gets me thru a few more weeks between color treatments.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue like most.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for the other colors, but the light brown gray away has changed my life.</li>
            <li>Masks the lighter shades of new hair growth and the skunky look.  </li>
            <li>Love it but need medium to dark brown color!!</li>
            <li>Once you get the technique down it works fine</li>
            <li>my hair color grows out very fast by the end of the second week my sides are turning gravy.</li>
            <li>The light brown color even blends well with my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>When I applied it to my light brown hair, it looked like I had dark brown spots on my head.</li>
            <li>I think it would be hard to use very accurately for gray at the temple</li>
            <li>I wish they could have created the same effect with more minerals and less unnatural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Quick, not messy, covers gray roots instantly and lasts until next shampoo.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again as it is half the cost and a better product than my old favourite Rita Kazan.</li>
            <li>and it was way smaller than expected, but I applied it and it seemed to work great, although the spray was VERY powerful and a little hard to control.  </li>
            <li>My roots are largely white, and this conceals them really well between colorings.</li>
            <li>I have naturally silver colored hair, and dye it a medium brown.</li>
            <li>Works so far.  </li>
            <li>This completely covers the gray and extends the time between appointments.  </li>
            <li>but you get twice as much for a third of the price.  </li>
            <li>I can wait longer before touch ups and it looks and feels completely natural.  </li>
            <li>now i just spray it with gravy away and it last so much longer.</li>
            <li>holding can far to near.  </li>
            <li>This color stays on well and looks quite natural.  </li>
            <li>This product fits my busy life.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty dark hair but bought the light brown after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li>The brown seems to blend in very well for several shades from dark blonde to light brown.  </li>
            <li>No mess -</li>
            <li>The light brown is actually DARK brown and that is the only brown offered.</li>
            <li>It is fairly dark and I wish there was a color in between blonde and light brown</li>
            <li>Most other brands I&#x27;ve purchased give you 2 to 3 times as much product for about the same price (or less).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, but I would suggest buying it in Walgreens, CVS or Walmart where it&#x27;s only $10, not $15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally use the following color:</li>
            <li>It helps cover my grays when that little silver line shows up so quickly after I color my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love it, it covers my roots well enough that I can go at least six weeks between colorings instead of four weeks.</li>
            <li>Product is very comparable to a more expensive brand I purchased from Sephora!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just can&#x27;t be that hard and there should be a huge market for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this product was a little more improved from my last order, and I like it much more, not that anything was wrong with the last Gray Away Root Concealer</li>
            <li>The braid extension was an obnoxious red color and I needed it natural brown.</li>
            <li>Well, shortly after applying I developed a killer headache and scalp itching which lasted 5 days.  </li>
            <li>What a HOT MESS this stuff makes...don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Using too much will make your hair too dark in that area wher you sprayed.</li>
            <li>Lasts very long and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It will add a few weeks to the time before you have to go get your hair done professionally again, and for disabled individuals, it is a Godsend (we might be getting older, but we still don&#x27;t like our roots to show!!!).</li>
            <li>I just dry my hair as usual, then part it and spray quickly from back to front.  </li>

            <li> Clairol Perfect 10 By Nice &#x27;N Easy Hair Color 005a Medium Ash Brown.  </li>
            <li> Works great and is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> The price of this product is great compared to others more than twice the price.</li>
            <li> Washes away easily but doesn&#x27;t rub off easily, and it stretches out the time in-between my hair color visits!!!</li>

            <li> Covers gray amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I  like the product but wish it had a sprayer bottle instead of the kind it  is.  </li>
            <li> Works nice stays in until a shampooing.</li>
            <li> Cannot return it because it is a hazardous item???</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and is absolutely GREAT to get you through that last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no scent  just a wonderful cover up  until i&#x27;m ready to color my hair.</li>
            <li> I received the order in good time, over all I am well satisfied with the product and the  company who sold it to me.  </li>
            <li> a light spray on your roots is all it takes for wonderful color which is quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use but effective for a good cover of the gray hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this pride to , the best on the market</li>
            <li> Root Concealer is my new best friend!  </li>
            <li> My new best friend!  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and the color blends good with my hair color.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have tried markers, crayons, mascara type touch ups, and this, by far, is the best for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of root concealer products and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I think it blends wonderful with my hair tone and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Meets expectation, appreciate the price, easy to use!</li>
            <li> Gray Away is the easy answer!</li>
            <li> Another VERY high priced color was the perfect color, but Gray Away light brown worked well &amp;</li>
            <li> I ended up choosing the light brown, and glad I did, since it&#x27;s fairly dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for quick cover.  </li>
            <li> Just bought 3 more cans.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This Gray Away covers better, and you can do anytime.</li>
            <li> Gray away works great and matchs my color really well.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> LOVE product.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect answer to temporary fixes, especially when you are traveling</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be sure to have it when I job travel.</li>
            <li> Though I might prefer the product that costs more than twice this price; I don&#x27;t like it that much more to make me choose it over this.</li>
            <li> this sure saves money &amp; time.</li>
            <li> Be sure when you spray it on to hold the container about a foot away.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li> I purchased this product more to cover areas around/in the part in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product for covering gray, especially at the &amp;#34;part&amp;#34; in your hair and around the frame of your face!  </li>
            <li> It is better than what i though.</li>
            <li> I get better coverage using the brush</li>
            <li> This product is okay in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Maybe they could make spray thing better.</li>
            <li> Love the straw spay director on this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Was not all the pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> much better than the more expense Bumble product i have used.  </li>
            <li> This also looks a lot better, as you don&#x27;t see it on your hair.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair a bit &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; feeling, but to touch up that last week before coloring, it is a great option!</li>
            <li> Love it for touch-ups in between.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and washed out very easily.</li>
            <li> spray does cover the greys very nicely, but I found this color tended to rub off much easier than the Style Edit spray.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wash your hair every single day, it would be best to to use a pillow case that you don&#x27;t care about, or a hair cap, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with a brown</li>
            <li> Product does work great for covering root grays in between colorings &amp; I find it looks natural.</li>
            <li> This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality ....</li>
            <li> ok i haven&#x27;t use it, but i&#x27;m pretty sure my mom will love it,</li>
            <li> The spray is easy to control and there is never any over-spray.</li>
            <li> I very quickly brush it on a section of grays &amp; then repeat.</li>
            <li> It works easily and stays on until you wash your hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and covers gray roots well in between hair coloring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to spray and it washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use as a touch up between coloring.  </li>
            <li> WHILE I THOUGHT THIS PRODUCT WOULD BE EASY, IT WAS UNTIL MAYBE</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the effect looked great and natural with the light brown on my medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li> It laundered out of the lighter pillow cover just fine.</li>
            <li> I try to barely press it to just get light coverage of the roots where my hair parts, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Love this for quick fixes</li>
            <li> More like 4 if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
            <li> Although that one is also pretty good, I like this product much better because it offers better coverage and is faster to use.  </li>
            <li> spray lightly.  </li>
            <li> Yes although the light brown is darker than I thought.  </li>
            <li> I use the light brown color in this</li>
            <li> you for such immediate delivery and great service.</li>
            <li> I use light brown for medium brown hair color.  </li>
            <li> I hemmed and hawed between ordering the light brown and the black/dark brown.</li>
            <li> I ordered light brown, received the can</li>
            <li> this is more reasonable, but hoping more like it come out</li>
            <li> It is such a good product I wish people knew what a help it would be to so many.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for little touchups in between colors!</li>
            <li> Does not leave any mark on your skin, just clean it and that&#x27; s it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 5 or 6 similar products and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get the right amount of color spray but the coverage is excellent.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that has a real, non-fake looking color, applies quickly and easily and covers roots beautifully.</li>
            <li> Works great, as  I expected</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be any easier for good results when covering gray until next treatment..</li>
            <li> Delays the need for full hair dying.</li>
            <li> Looks good and actually gives her body as well.</li>
            <li> I love it and it works vey well and covers my very gray hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much, color stays on until I shampoo, and it gives me more time.  </li>
            <li> I always feel old when I can see gray roots and Gray Away quickly and effectively sprays it away.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to point and spray exactly where needed.  </li>
            <li> The first can I bought at Walmart was fine.  </li>
            <li> Need a quick fix for graying roots?</li>
            <li> If only it was carried in stores with more regularity and variety it would be of an even greater help in getting it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Belinda Pate</li>
            <li> It cover quickly and even all my gray hair .</li>
            <li> It looks so natural and is super easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Great color (dark brown)</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use, stays on all day, complete cover of gray, easy to blend into the color area.</li>
            <li> It was better than going to work with grey roots, and I&#x27;m pleased with that.</li>
            <li> The only thing is if it&#x27;s an outdoor event make sure there is no precipitation, the color will run off the hair if exposed to water!</li>
            <li> I bought the light brown and it blended perfectly with my dark blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine if you were using it all over it wouldn&#x27;t last very long but for me, it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li> It does give good coverage, but the light brown is really dark!</li>
            <li> I bought Light Brown, which is indicates it&#x27;s for medium Brown - Light Brown - Blonde hair), because I have medium to light brown hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is light brown, and it&#x27;s darker than my hair, but blends really well.</li>
            <li> My roots look great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Was going to order several at a time to get free shipping on $30 or more but company did not qualify.  </li>
            <li> so the excess washes out and it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> product really worth having.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The application was easier and more natural looking.</li>
            <li> This one has advantages making it worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you are spraying more all over, you won&#x27;t get anywhere near 40 applications.</li>
            <li> and it dries pretty quickly; doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li> spray it right on my part line and front hair line.</li>
            <li> It has a nice narrow litte nozzel so it&#x27;s easy to get the color right where you want it.</li>
            <li> Works great but be aware there is very little product here.  </li>
            <li> I am about 90% gray and my hair grows super fast.</li>
            <li> The product is quite good in that it is less sticky than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> The light brown color is very natural.</li>
            <li> Came sooner than I expected, and I love this product!</li>
            <li> So easy, quickly covers entire hairline and &#x27;part&#x27; roots.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> It works really well for that 1-2 week period before it&#x27;s time for the trip to the salon!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, Gray Away does work, but would not be my first choice.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like my hair color, it comes it</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of wet when it goes on, which is not how it is shown on TV.</li>
            <li> Keeps coverage exactly where you want it.  </li>
            <li> works well, but leaves your hair a funny, sticky texture</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product really works, and because of its \\&quot;focused\\&quot; spray, it doesn&#x27;t get all over everything - just right where you point it.</li>
            <li> have used more expensive products, and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> so I thought it was a more natural product as I am sensitive to chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Works great and gives me about an extra month before having to spend the big bucks to get my hair professionally colored.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy, easy to use and covers the gray entirely!!</li>
            <li> Wouldnt use it for large amounts of growth.</li>
            <li> Very good seller, not excellent product</li>
            <li> It was hard to get good</li>
            <li> Works really well to hide my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff really extends the time between trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much in the can though.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Works well if I don&#x27;t over spray and much easier than the type I was using that I had to put on and leave for 15 min then shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This is really a medium brown color.</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I should</li>
            <li> Gray away works very well.</li>
            <li> thanks again</li>
            <li> and this really helps areas like that.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> the price was MUCH</li>
            <li> Once carefully styled it was okay, and no one seemed to notice.  </li>
            <li> but the sprayer wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> I have horribly fast growing hair</li>
            <li> If you just have a center part you are covering, then you will love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but you will not find one better than this brand.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it covers the gray completely, but it makes it pretty unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> I now how have a whole new freedom for coloring my hair when it is convenient for me.  </li>
            <li> Spray itself is easy to control although you need to be careful not to get too close to the root line.  </li>
            <li> Because Gray Away is more sticky, it was more difficult to get the tissue flakes out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only wish this came in larger cans, because I like to use all over on windy days when more than just the hair part becomes visible.</li>
            <li> I felt the @ $22 shipping for re order to high.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I read the ingredients and discovered the main ingredients were butane, hydrochlorofluorines, and other strong toxic chemicals</li>
            <li> It does what it says but requires a little skill to make your hair look ok.</li>
            <li> It is okay, buy leaves your hair a Little sticky.</li>
            <li> also found this spray to be a bit more sticky than Style Edit, as well as little harder to precisely control the spray.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but works great</li>
            <li> It gets me thru a few more weeks between color treatments.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue like most.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the other colors, but the light brown gray away has changed my life.</li>
            <li> Masks the lighter shades of new hair growth and the skunky look.  </li>
            <li> Love it but need medium to dark brown color!!</li>
            <li> Once you get the technique down it works fine</li>
            <li> my hair color grows out very fast by the end of the second week my sides are turning gravy.</li>
            <li> The light brown color even blends well with my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> When I applied it to my light brown hair, it looked like I had dark brown spots on my head.</li>
            <li> I think it would be hard to use very accurately for gray at the temple</li>
            <li> I wish they could have created the same effect with more minerals and less unnatural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Quick, not messy, covers gray roots instantly and lasts until next shampoo.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again as it is half the cost and a better product than my old favourite Rita Kazan.</li>
            <li> and it was way smaller than expected, but I applied it and it seemed to work great, although the spray was VERY powerful and a little hard to control.  </li>
            <li> My roots are largely white, and this conceals them really well between colorings.</li>
            <li> I have naturally silver colored hair, and dye it a medium brown.</li>
            <li> Works so far.  </li>
            <li> This completely covers the gray and extends the time between appointments.  </li>
            <li> but you get twice as much for a third of the price.  </li>
            <li> I can wait longer before touch ups and it looks and feels completely natural.  </li>
            <li> now i just spray it with gravy away and it last so much longer.</li>
            <li> holding can far to near.  </li>
            <li> This color stays on well and looks quite natural.  </li>
            <li> This product fits my busy life.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty dark hair but bought the light brown after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> The brown seems to blend in very well for several shades from dark blonde to light brown.  </li>
            <li> No mess -</li>
            <li> The light brown is actually DARK brown and that is the only brown offered.</li>
            <li> It is fairly dark and I wish there was a color in between blonde and light brown</li>
            <li> Most other brands I&#x27;ve purchased give you 2 to 3 times as much product for about the same price (or less).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, but I would suggest buying it in Walgreens, CVS or Walmart where it&#x27;s only $10, not $15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use the following color:</li>
            <li> It helps cover my grays when that little silver line shows up so quickly after I color my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I love it, it covers my roots well enough that I can go at least six weeks between colorings instead of four weeks.</li>
            <li> Product is very comparable to a more expensive brand I purchased from Sephora!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just can&#x27;t be that hard and there should be a huge market for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this product was a little more improved from my last order, and I like it much more, not that anything was wrong with the last Gray Away Root Concealer</li>
            <li> The braid extension was an obnoxious red color and I needed it natural brown.</li>
            <li> Well, shortly after applying I developed a killer headache and scalp itching which lasted 5 days.  </li>
            <li> What a HOT MESS this stuff makes...don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Using too much will make your hair too dark in that area wher you sprayed.</li>
            <li> Lasts very long and looks natural.</li>
            <li> It will add a few weeks to the time before you have to go get your hair done professionally again, and for disabled individuals, it is a Godsend (we might be getting older, but we still don&#x27;t like our roots to show!!!).</li>
            <li> I just dry my hair as usual, then part it and spray quickly from back to front.  </li>
            <li> hair is dark brown, I didn&#x27;t want something so dark it would cover black hair, so I tried the Light Brown.</li>
            <li> for me, I only use it where my hair parts so this \\&quot;small\\&quot; bottle has lasted me a very long time.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was a little nervous but by the second time I had the idea and did not have any trouble at all.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I wish I could squeak out the very last bit when I&#x27;m at the end of the canister (but all I get is air, no product), and I wish the bottle were bigger.</li>
            <li> In fact I was a little surprised at</li>
            <li> Really cover the gray, I do not give the five stars because it leave the hair like if you are using a hard harr spray, if yo do not care that I recomend this product, I will be using it for ever</li>
            <li> Only negative is high shipping.  </li>
            <li> except it sprays a dark spot if I&#x27;m not careful, around the face where there&#x27;s grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Colors over the grey growing in at the part in my wife&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I live in a small town and when I do find it in my color</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the spray opposed to root coverup mascaras and crayons but with only 2 colors to choose from, it&#x27;s highly doubtful that it would blend into to your hair color.</li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars for performance, but only 3 stars for value; hence the 4 star average rating.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure how long it lasts because I only got it recently and have not covered a lot of hair with it, just my part and sideburns.</li>
            <li> The sizes are to small and don&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> When that happens, you end up with a dark, circular, and obvious area of color.</li>
            <li> so the price goes way down or the product gets larger.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t come off unless washed out unlike a similar product that is sold for less on this website.  </li>
            <li> She is happier between salon appointments and no longer spends the big bucks every month or less.  </li>
            <li> It did what it promised but the bottle emptied faster than I expected, and when I sprayed it, it got on my forehead and earlobes and wasn&#x27;t the easiest to get off</li>
            <li> With Style Edit, if the color doesn&#x27;t come out quite evenly, or when I want to color close to my hair line and ears, I make a tissue wet, put some spray on it, then rub it into those areas.</li>
            <li> It also lasts as long as the larger cans due to it&#x27;s very small nossle, which sprays only where you want it, not on the hair all around it.</li>
            <li> It makes a big mess, sprays everywhere and the color is not true to its description.</li>
            <li> Gets me thru the last few days before its time to color the roots!  </li>
            <li> Works just as expected &amp; described !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the other comments but</li>
            <li> so I have to dye the roots every other week.  </li>
            <li> I usually get a white line at my part 2 weeks after coloring.  </li>
            <li> If you check GrayAway.com you can find 2 other colors (Blond &amp; Auburn).</li>
            <li> how well it conceals and blends with my other hair color.</li>
            <li> I do wonder how healthy/safe it truly is for you, so I would only use it sparingly on small areas.</li>
            <li> This stuff covers the parts of my head where the cow licks expose my scalp.</li>
            <li> The only reason this did not get 5 stars is it leaves your hair a little stiff.  </li>
            <li> Also, the colour is a little darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> For my other half..... tsk, tsk.</li>
            <li> A little skeptical if it would cover or even match my hair but the product did exactly what I needed to be done</li>
            <li> I used one squirt - it squirts, does not spray, and puts out way too much...and dark brown.</li>
            <li> It looked horrible and would not possibly work on light brown or dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dark hair and color my hair every 4 weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly dark.</li>
            <li> It also is a power and if you scratch your head you have dark brown powder under your fingernails.</li>
            <li> Your Gray Hair Care Fill in Powder w/ Procapil- Dark Brown&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I just use dark colored pillow covers.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Light Brown&amp;#34; is black.</li>
            <li> This one I  purchase sprayed on black and sticky.  </li>
            <li> HALF WAY THRU</li>
            <li> Cans not full</li>
            <li> Two issues - one was the color -- it is not light brown, but dark brown, so the color for me is way off.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a product that could cover gray hair without looking like paint, but it really does work on the small areas for which I needed it.  </li>
            <li> No matter what spray one uses, it does take a little practice &amp; finesse to get the spray not to forcefully come out with a lot of pressure.</li>
            <li> When I tried this with Gray Away, little bits of tissue would end up rubbing off and sticking to my hair, resulting in a dandruff-like appearance.</li>
            <li> it could be a little cheaper</li>
            <li> The spray comes out way to strong, and looks fake and weird.</li>
            <li> However, the color is very dark.  </li>
            <li> (I would suggest you try the medium brown unless you have very dark hair.</li>
            <li> But I use it every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> This is not meant to take the place of coloring your hair nor is it to be used on your entire head (for those of you who rated this product poorly.)</li>
            <li> Makes your hair messy</li>
            <li> Initally I was disappointed to have paid so much for such a small can of spray.</li>
            <li> The only other option is ridiculously expensive</li>
            <li> Does leave a bit of residue on the hair making the texture of sprayed hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> Smells like spray paint and makes the hair a bit stiff, bit</li>
            <li> Also doen&#x27;t feel stiff.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff, as all others I tried did.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t go overboard with spraying it...</li>
            <li> I do this in three or four areas, then style as usual.  </li>
            <li> i purchases is it was so small  </li>
            <li> I wish the size of the can was larger as it is a bit expensive for the amount that is in the can.</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> you get a dark area on your scalp that shows through if your hair is thin.</li>
            <li> It does dull your hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake or run, even during a serious workout.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is 100% gray.  </li>
            <li> Works just as well as Rita Hazan and less expensive!</li>
            <li> I hate paying for a $120 hair color every 3 weeks when by totally gray hair starts showing.  </li>
            <li> This is a real disappointment and not what I expected at all..  </li>
            <li> Way too expensive and too difficult to return.</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s difficult to spray without getting it on your skin or scalp, which the instructions tell you not to do.  </li>
            <li> And when it does get on skin, it&#x27;s really difficult to get off.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the problem-solver I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li> This stuff is weird...</li>
            <li> so unfortunately I can&#x27;t use the stuff and just wanted to warn anyone else who is bothered by chemicals.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thin there</li>
            <li> it puts a weird substance in your hair and makes it look all griddy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty and it is the easiest to apply.  </li>
            <li> It enables me to stretch the time between (expensive!)</li>
            <li> but it smelt so bad i had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> i was very very mad for</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it worked so well!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very, very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> (cause I hate when those gray roots start to show)!!  </li>
            <li> THE SRAY WAS THE WORST.</li>
            <li> It dries immediately and has no smell (unlike some of the horrible smells of the crayon-like root concealers), it doesn&#x27;t look waxy or anything.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What a HOT MESS this stuff makes...don&#x27;t like how it applies at all...</li>
            <li> I  like the product but wish it had a sprayer bottle instead of the kind it  is.  Joanne</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t come off unless washed out unlike a similar product that is sold for less on this website.  A bit pricey for the size.</li>
            <li> Quick, not messy, covers gray roots instantly and lasts until next shampoo. Couldn&#x27;t be any easier for good results when covering gray until next treatment..</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It takes a little practice to get the right amount of color spray but the coverage is excellent. I&#x27;ll use this seller again.</li>
            <li> I have tried markers, crayons, mascara type touch ups, and this, by far, is the best for me. So easy, quickly covers entire hairline and &#x27;part&#x27; roots. The light brown color even blends well with my dark brown hair. Just bought 3 more cans.</li>
            <li> Works great but be aware there is very little product here.  If you get on your skin, it will show but seems to wipe off fairly well.  The brown seems to blend in very well for several shades from dark blonde to light brown.  Would give 5 stars for performance, but only 3 stars for value; hence the 4 star average rating.</li>
            <li> Works great for my roots in between hair coloring.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great for in between appointments!</li>
            <li> The gray away root concealer works great.  If you need to touch your roots up until you color your hair again it covers great.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive and too difficult to return.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites!  Works really well to hide my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It gets me thru a few more weeks between color treatments.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Gets me thru the last few days before its time to color the roots!  Does leave a bit of residue on the hair making the texture of sprayed hair stiff.  Wouldnt use it for large amounts of growth.</li>
            <li> Colors over the grey growing in at the part in my wife&#x27;s hair. Delays the need for full hair dying.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but you will not find one better than this brand.  Just don&#x27;t go overboard with spraying it...spray lightly.  It will add a few weeks to the time before you have to go get your hair done professionally again, and for disabled individuals, it is a Godsend (we might be getting older, but we still don&#x27;t like our roots to show!!!).</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom in between colorings.  Looks good and actually gives her body as well.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected &amp; described !</li>
            <li> It does what it says but requires a little skill to make your hair look ok. If you hold it too close you get a dark area on your scalp that shows through if your hair is thin. Using too much will make your hair too dark in that area wher you sprayed. Once you get the technique down it works fine</li>
            <li> I bought Light Brown, which is indicates it&#x27;s for medium Brown - Light Brown - Blonde hair), because I have medium to light brown hair. I used one squirt - it squirts, does not spray, and puts out way too much...and dark brown. It looked horrible and would not possibly work on light brown or dark blonde hair. Also, it is not returnable. Beware!</li>
            <li> This is great to use in between colorings..Can actually get you through another 2 or 3 weeks without a trip to the beauty salon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of root concealer products and this is the best so far. The light brown perfectly  matches my medium brown hair. My roots are largely white, and this conceals them really well between colorings. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  After it arrived, my sister ordered in her color.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect. The light brown color is very natural. The spray is easy to control and there is never any over-spray. It doesn&#x27;t flake or run, even during a serious workout. Like other reviewers I wish I could squeak out the very last bit when I&#x27;m at the end of the canister (but all I get is air, no product), and I wish the bottle were bigger. But that&#x27;s solved by ordering 2 at a time which is the price I was paying for 1 larger bottle of Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s version - which has some flaws.</li>
            <li> This stuff covers the parts of my head where the cow licks expose my scalp. This stuff really extends the time between trips to the salon. There isn&#x27;t much in the can though.</li>
            <li> Love this for quick fixes</li>
            <li> it works , but I&#x27;m allergic to it...lol</li>
            <li> Expensive, but works great</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Gave it as a present to a friend, she likes it.</li>
            <li> is the best I&#x27;ve found to cover the gray and lengthen the time between dyes, I recommend it a lot</li>
            <li> Yes although the light brown is darker than I thought.  I actually have thought about trying the blond as my hair has some highlights.  But I use it every few weeks.  Works well if I don&#x27;t over spray and much easier than the type I was using that I had to put on and leave for 15 min then shampoo.  This Gray Away covers better, and you can do anytime.</li>
            <li> Great--I totally recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It helps cover my grays when that little silver line shows up so quickly after I color my hair.  Gray away works great and matchs my color really well. I will definitely buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT!!!  Buys me a couple weeks in between my $250 color at the salon -(  GREAT stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> Washes away easily but doesn&#x27;t rub off easily, and it stretches out the time in-between my hair color visits!!! (Keeping my hair healthier too might I add!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray it right on my part line and front hair line. I have naturally silver colored hair, and dye it a medium brown. I use the light brown color in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used more expensive products, and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> Great for covering part line, hair line and side burns for those times you need to get your hair colored but just don&#x27;t have the time. This is not meant to take the place of coloring your hair nor is it to be used on your entire head (for those of you who rated this product poorly.) I find it to be perfect for what is was made for.</li>
            <li> I love this product...it works!!!!  I only have to dye my hair once a month instead of twice a month!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!! Cans not full</li>
            <li> Two issues - one was the color -- it is not light brown, but dark brown, so the color for me is way off.  In addition, it&#x27;s difficult to spray without getting it on your skin or scalp, which the instructions tell you not to do.  And when it does get on skin, it&#x27;s really difficult to get off.  Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the problem-solver I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Light Brown&amp;#34; is black.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair messy</li>
            <li> Works like a hairspray.  Just hold and spray around any place like your part where you can see regrowth.  Only negative is high shipping.  Was going to order several at a time to get free shipping on $30 or more but company did not qualify.  I felt the @ $22 shipping for re order to high.  LOVE product.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says; I can cover my roots before my salon appointment. It looks so natural and is super easy to apply! Will definitely buy this again!!</li>
            <li> I have used every product anyone as recommended for covering my gray in between my coloring.  This is the best.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty and it is the easiest to apply.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price.  Spray itself is easy to control although you need to be careful not to get too close to the root line.  Also, the colour is a little darker than I expected. On the good side this product is not sticky and does not transfer to your pillow, etc.  I will definitely buy again as it is half the cost and a better product than my old favourite Rita Kazan.</li>
            <li> This is really a medium brown color. When I applied it to my light brown hair, it looked like I had dark brown spots on my head. I liked the feel of the spray opposed to root coverup mascaras and crayons but with only 2 colors to choose from, it&#x27;s highly doubtful that it would blend into to your hair color.</li>
            <li> For my other half..... tsk, tsk.</li>
            <li> The first can I bought at Walmart was fine.  This one I  purchase sprayed on black and sticky.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love it and it works vey well and covers my very gray hair.  It washes out when you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Product does work great for covering root grays in between colorings &amp; I find it looks natural. ***A trick I use to make application easier &amp; to extend product is that I spray it on a large, stiff, short head makeup brush.  I very quickly brush it on a section of grays &amp; then repeat.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this pride to , the best on the market</li>
            <li> Works nice stays in until a shampooing.</li>
            <li> ok i haven&#x27;t use it, but i&#x27;m pretty sure my mom will love it,</li>
            <li> It is the perfect answer to temporary fixes, especially when you are traveling</li>
            <li> I bought this to paint a braid that I cut from a hair weave to attach to an updo for a wedding. The braid extension was an obnoxious red color and I needed it natural brown. I used this root concealer to blend the fishtail braid and it worked great! The only thing is if it&#x27;s an outdoor event make sure there is no precipitation, the color will run off the hair if exposed to water!</li>
            <li> The picture looked to be 15 oz, was really only 1.5 oz.  Same item at Walmart is only $9.99, not $15.99.  Cannot return it because it is a hazardous item??? BUMMER!</li>
            <li> I rate this product with five stars basically because it works.  I always feel old when I can see gray roots and Gray Away quickly and effectively sprays it away.  It takes three seconds and stays until it is washed out. I just dry my hair as usual, then part it and spray quickly from back to front.  I do this in three or four areas, then style as usual.  No mess - no drips - just gray out!!!!  I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for gray root coverage.&lt;br /&gt;My roots start to show after only 2 weeks of coloring...this product is the solution I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Stuff works great.  I have pretty dark hair but bought the light brown after reading other reviews.  It works perfectly and is absolutely GREAT to get you through that last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED:  This stuff is the BEST!!!!  I don&#x27;t know about the other comments but for me, I only use it where my hair parts so this \\&quot;small\\&quot; bottle has lasted me a very long time.  I have fairly dark hair and color my hair every 4 weeks (cause I hate when those gray roots start to show)!!  It works really well for that 1-2 week period before it&#x27;s time for the trip to the salon!  I just ordered a 2nd bottle only because it works so well and I don&#x27;t want to run out.  I&#x27;d imagine if you were using it all over it wouldn&#x27;t last very long but for me, it&#x27;s perfect.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works easily and stays on until you wash your hair</li>
            <li> Color match is very good.  I like that it lasts through 2 hair washes, but not that it feels a bit sticky on my hair on day 1.</li>
            <li> Good product. I knew I couldn&#x27;t take off work to have my hair colored before Christmas. I found this at Bed Bath and Beyond, and bought it. It&#x27;s fairly dark. My hair is light brown, and it&#x27;s darker than my hair, but blends really well. I am real happy with it. except it sprays a dark spot if I&#x27;m not careful, around the face where there&#x27;s grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about the same as the more expensive 24.99 brand at the make up stores. I wish it came in blondish colors, cause I have my part dyed blonde. But I&#x27;m happy that this product is available. I&#x27;m going to be sure to have it when I job travel. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This stuff is weird...it puts a weird substance in your hair and makes it look all griddy and dirty.  Don&#x27;t do it dudes. I say you just get regular hair dye for the roots.  This is sooo not recommendable.</li>
            <li> This is a nightmare to use. It makes a big mess, sprays everywhere and the color is not true to its description.</li>
            <li> show two products and only does one</li>
            <li> it is perfect for my thinning and gray hair.without the spray i look like im bald, but after i put the spray on it looks like i have hair.</li>
            <li> This item blends well with my hair color (medium brown) and covers well. It&#x27;s easy to use and covers gray roots well in between hair coloring. I do recommend this product and will continue to reorder it.</li>
            <li> It gets me through from one hair appointment to the next and blends with my hair color.  It also is a power and if you scratch your head you have dark brown powder under your fingernails.</li>
            <li> It covers the gray until you can dye your hair.  My hair grows fast so I have to dye the roots every other week.  This product allows me to dye my hair just once a month.  I spray it on at night and then wash my hair the next morning so the excess washes out and it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> I hope this product continues to be made!  Keeps hair looking great between colorings.  Helps to extend your time between colorings! The price of this product is great compared to others more than twice the price. Though I might prefer the product that costs more than twice this price; I don&#x27;t like it that much more to make me choose it over this. Meets expectation, appreciate the price, easy to use!</li>
            <li> This product changed my life. I am about 90% gray and my hair grows super fast. I can only get about 2.5 weeks out of a color job at my hair stylist before I start hiding under hats. The hair appointments not only cost a fortune, they take forever. Now I can stretch it out by an extra week or two. This works so well I can not even believe it.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it worked so well! I cannot believe how well it matches. If you have gray or white hair that is in spots like mine (around my face) this sure saves money &amp; time.</li>
            <li> Life saver. This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Very good seller, not excellent product</li>
            <li> did not work, returned it!</li>
            <li> Works great and is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> The only reason this did not get 5 stars is it leaves your hair a little stiff.  But it did the job I would by this again</li>
            <li> Gray Away Root Concealer is my new best friend!  I bought the light brown and it blended perfectly with my dark blonde hair.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and washed out very easily. Be sure when you spray it on to hold the container about a foot away.  The first time I used it I was a little nervous but by the second time I had the idea and did not have any trouble at all.  I have not had any problem with it getting on my fingers or on the pillowcase and it does not feel sticky.  I love this stuff.  It enables me to stretch the time between (expensive!) hair coloring appointments.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT. THANKS !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered qty 2, received qty 1.  Beware. Ripoff.  I will retract if I receive the 2nd can.  I&#x27;m waiting, sir.</li>
            <li> Works so far.  I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I should but when I do, it works the way it should.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and the color blends good with my hair color.</li>
            <li> Good for quick cover.  It does dull your hair.</li>
            <li> This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality .... I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while now and I love it, it covers my roots well enough that I can go at least six weeks between colorings instead of four weeks. It&#x27;s easy to spray and it washes off easily. I even fooled my hair dresser when I walked into the shop she told me it wasn&#x27;t time to do my hair yet cause she didn&#x27;t see any gray.</li>
            <li> A great product. Amazing, as it is perfect in any type of climate. Never runs!  Lasts for weeks with no touch-up necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Just a light spray on your roots is all it takes for wonderful color which is quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;A product really worth having.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such immediate delivery and great service.</li>
            <li> i purchases is it was so small  i was very very mad for is price i will not buy is again you will see by. from now oh p.s. junior</li>
            <li> A little skeptical if it would cover or even match my hair but the product did exactly what I needed to be done</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is 100% gray.  I usually get a white line at my part 2 weeks after coloring.  This completely covers the gray and extends the time between appointments.  However, the color is very dark.  I use light brown for medium brown hair color.  It is the same as Rita Hazen&#x27;s root concealer but you get twice as much for a third of the price.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.</li>
            <li> This product really works, and because of its \\&quot;focused\\&quot; spray, it doesn&#x27;t get all over everything - just right where you point it. It did a great job covering my part and \\&quot;sideburns.\\&quot; I would highly recommend it, but I would suggest buying it in Walgreens, CVS or Walmart where it&#x27;s only $10, not $15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I&#x27;m not sure how long it lasts because I only got it recently and have not covered a lot of hair with it, just my part and sideburns. However, I would buy it again. (I would suggest you try the medium brown unless you have very dark hair. If you have reddish hair, I guess you&#x27;re stuck with medium brown, too, but I don&#x27;t know how it would work. Hopefully, they will come out with a reddish brown soon.)</li>
            <li> Works great, as  I expected</li>
            <li> It did what it promised but the bottle emptied faster than I expected, and when I sprayed it, it got on my forehead and earlobes and wasn&#x27;t the easiest to get off</li>
            <li> Great coverage, great price!  Works just as well as Rita Hazan and less expensive!</li>
            <li> Great in between salon visits.</li>
            <li> It is okay, buy leaves your hair a Little sticky.</li>
            <li> Great for inbetween visits to the salon</li>
            <li> Great root cover. The only other option is ridiculously expensive ( Rita Hazan)  this is more reasonable, but hoping more like it come out so the price goes way down or the product gets larger. The sizes are to small and don&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> This is a real disappointment and not what I expected at all..  I tried to get it on evenly and couldn&#x27;t.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for covering the gray roots at my part until it&#x27;s time to color again. Great coverage and it dries pretty quickly; doesn&#x27;t rub off. I wouldn&#x27;t spray it all over my head like it shows in the commercial. Smells like spray paint and makes the hair a bit stiff, bit it&#x27;s great for spot coverage!</li>
            <li> Came sooner than I expected, and I love this product!</li>
            <li> Lasts very long and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Gray away works very well. I am happy with the results and it stays put but washes away when needed.I use the light brown and am very happy with it. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> I can wait longer before touch ups and it looks and feels completely natural.  I&#x27;m so glad I got it!</li>
            <li> my hair color grows out very fast by the end of the second week my sides are turning gravy. now i just spray it with gravy away and it last so much longer. i  use to use a product from qvc but it smelt so bad i had to stop using it. i was so happy when i found gravy away on line. no scent  just a wonderful cover up  until i&#x27;m ready to color my hair. thank you gravy away please don&#x27;t get lost like some products do when something works so good . thanks again</li>
            <li> I had ordered this along with Style Edit spray because I wanted to try something different. My hair is a dyed, darker brown color. I normally use the following color: Clairol Perfect 10 By Nice &#x27;N Easy Hair Color 005a Medium Ash Brown.  I hemmed and hawed between ordering the light brown and the black/dark brown. I ended up choosing the light brown, and glad I did, since it&#x27;s fairly dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray does cover the greys very nicely, but I found this color tended to rub off much easier than the Style Edit spray. If you don&#x27;t wash your hair every single day, it would be best to to use a pillow case that you don&#x27;t care about, or a hair cap, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with a brown pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found this spray to be a bit more sticky than Style Edit, as well as little harder to precisely control the spray. No matter what spray one uses, it does take a little practice &amp; finesse to get the spray not to forcefully come out with a lot of pressure. When that happens, you end up with a dark, circular, and obvious area of color. With Style Edit, if the color doesn&#x27;t come out quite evenly, or when I want to color close to my hair line and ears, I make a tissue wet, put some spray on it, then rub it into those areas. When I tried this with Gray Away, little bits of tissue would end up rubbing off and sticking to my hair, resulting in a dandruff-like appearance. Because Gray Away is more sticky, it was more difficult to get the tissue flakes out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Gray Away does work, but would not be my first choice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product more to cover areas around/in the part in my hair.  My hair is very thin there and this really helps areas like that.</li>
            <li> My new best friend!  Great product.  Easy to use as a touch up between coloring.  Masks the lighter shades of new hair growth and the skunky look.  Reasonably priced.  Lasts quite a while when using just for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else in between coloring! It looks exactly like my hair color, it comes it 4 different colors. Is the  best thing I&#x27;ve seen on the market! Debbie Fielding</li>
            <li> Good product..only. issue is if you touch it and rub your scalp it comes off on your fingers.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for covering gray, especially at the &amp;#34;part&amp;#34; in your hair and around the frame of your face!  I wish the size of the can was larger as it is a bit expensive for the amount that is in the can.</li>
            <li> Great product. Covers gray amazingly well. Delivery time excellent.</li>
            <li> It is better than what i though. Great for on te go or between hair color. Does not leave any mark on your skin, just clean it and that&#x27; s it.</li>
            <li> It met every expectation~!! I just wish Gray Away had a red/burgundy color because that is my haircolor~!! Another VERY high priced color was the perfect color, but Gray Away light brown worked well &amp; the price was MUCH better~!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a product that could cover gray hair without looking like paint, but it really does work on the small areas for which I needed it.  I don&#x27;t know how it would cover big sections, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t look like paint.  It&#x27;s easy to point and spray exactly where needed.  I order extra cans, as i don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a lot in each one.</li>
            <li> Works great! I use only between hair color dye visits to conceal gray.  I only wish this came in larger cans, because I like to use all over on windy days when more than just the hair part becomes visible. I think it blends wonderful with my hair tone and looks natural. Very easy to apply. I will definitely purchase more to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> The light brown is actually DARK brown and that is the only brown offered. I am very, very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Tried this spray as a touch up between coloring my hair.  It was hard to get good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Tried holding can far to near.  I get better coverage using the brush touch  up hair color.</li>
            <li> This product is okay in a pinch. I bought it to be prepared for when those roots seem to show through overnight. It&#x27;s kind of wet when it goes on, which is not how it is shown on TV. It does give good coverage, but the light brown is really dark! Once carefully styled it was okay, and no one seemed to notice.  It was better than going to work with grey roots, and I&#x27;m pleased with that.</li>
            <li> I like the color but the sprayer wasn&#x27;t much. It didn&#x27;t spray where I wanted the color to go. Maybe too big of a sprayer. Maybe they could make spray thing better.</li>
            <li> I hate paying for a $120 hair color every 3 weeks when by totally gray hair starts showing.  This is so easy to use, stays on all day, complete cover of gray, easy to blend into the color area.</li>
            <li> Love the straw spay director on this product.  Keeps coverage exactly where you want it.  I do wish, however, that it was a bit larger size for the money.</li>
            <li> Guys!! this is the best thing since sliced bread.  My wife uses this regularly and you never see her gray hair.  She is happier between salon appointments and no longer spends the big bucks every month or less.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Really cover the gray, I do not give the five stars because it leave the hair like if you are using a hard harr spray, if yo do not care that I recomend this product, I will be using it for ever</li>
            <li> Love it but need medium to dark brown color!!</li>
            <li> It worked great, and so mu;ch cheaper than one I had purchased on QVC.  However, someone told me there was a lot of toxic products in it.....now I wonder how good it is for the scalp.</li>
            <li> my mother loves it she uses it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time we buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it could be a little cheaper</li>
            <li> The product prevent me from using hair dye, but colors my hair just the same.  Once it drys it does not come off.  I love it.  I would definately recommend the product to others.</li>
            <li> this is also great to hide thinning hair bald spots.&lt;br /&gt;great product compared to all the rest I have tried.</li>
            <li> 1.  I did not request this color .&lt;br /&gt;2.  I have always only purchased the black/dark brown&lt;br /&gt;3. I have called in the error without any response from you for sending&lt;br /&gt;  unwanted product back or receiving a package label to return the unwanted product.&lt;br /&gt;4. I have made two separate attempts reporting the error.&lt;br /&gt;5.  I would appreciate your help in solving this problem which was a possible mistake.</li>
            <li> WHILE I THOUGHT THIS PRODUCT WOULD BE EASY, IT WAS UNTIL MAYBE HALF WAY THRU THE CAN THE SRAY WAS THE WORST. GOT ALL OVER MY FACE AND CLOTHES</li>
            <li> Product is very comparable to a more expensive brand I purchased from Sephora!&lt;br /&gt;Helps get you to the next color appointment!!</li>
            <li> Need a quick fix for graying roots? Gray Away is the easy answer! Just spray the gray away. My spouse swears by it!</li>
            <li> This works great for temporary touching up between coloring!</li>
            <li> This color stays on well and looks quite natural.  I can&#x27;t say it covers the gray completely, but it makes it pretty unnoticeable.  It &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; the gray hair with the non-gray hair.  The result is that the gray no longer looks gray.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and, for me, it is a lifesaver!  If only it was carried in stores with more regularity and variety it would be of an even greater help in getting it. I live in a small town and when I do find it in my color I have to buy several or go online and wait for it. It is such a good product I wish people knew what a help it would be to so many.  Thanks for such a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Belinda Pate</li>
            <li> This product fits my busy life.  No time to color?  This product saves the day(s) until I can color.  Don&#x27;t need much, color stays on until I shampoo, and it gives me more time.  Love it!  I also use a powder, &amp;#34;Cover Your Gray Hair Care Fill in Powder w/ Procapil- Dark Brown&amp;#34;  at the hairline around my face.  The combo is excellent for my purposes.  Keep it coming!</li>
            <li> Was not all the pleased with this. Yes it covers the gray and does a good job if it. I just don&#x27;t like how it goes on. I will finish using it.</li>
            <li> works well, but leaves your hair a funny, sticky texture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this product was a little more improved from my last order, and I like it much more, not that anything was wrong with the last Gray Away Root Concealer it seem it has been improved.  I received the order in good time, over all I am well satisfied with the product and the  company who sold it to me.  When needed will order again.</li>
            <li> It cover quickly and even all my gray hair . I love it</li>
            <li> much better than the more expense Bumble product i have used.  The application was easier and more natural looking. Also doen&#x27;t feel stiff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for little touchups in between colors! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d call it &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; brown though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 5 or 6 similar products and this one is by far the best. Initally I was disappointed to have paid so much for such a small can of spray. Most other brands I&#x27;ve purchased give you 2 to 3 times as much product for about the same price (or less). This one has advantages making it worth the money. It does not make your head itch or ache (yes, one did) and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff, as all others I tried did. It also lasts as long as the larger cans due to it&#x27;s very small nossle, which sprays only where you want it, not on the hair all around it. This also looks a lot better, as you don&#x27;t see it on your hair. It&#x27;s only on the roots where it&#x27;s supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark brown, I didn&#x27;t want something so dark it would cover black hair, so I tried the Light Brown. Surprisingly, it&#x27;s the perfect color for me. If you check GrayAway.com you can find 2 other colors (Blond &amp; Auburn). Great product, try it!</li>
            <li> Great color (dark brown) I use this as soon as the greys start to come in. It has a nice narrow litte nozzel so it&#x27;s easy to get the color right where you want it.</li>
            <li> I had been using Style Edit when my beautician suggested this as a lower cost alternative.  It works as well as Style Edit, however, it does rub off on my pilllow cover.  This is not a big enough problem for me to stop using it, however.  I just use dark colored pillow covers.  It laundered out of the lighter pillow cover just fine.</li>
            <li> Works great and gives me about an extra month before having to spend the big bucks to get my hair professionally colored.  I&#x27;ve also used another product which is similar to mascara.  Although that one is also pretty good, I like this product much better because it offers better coverage and is faster to use.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Best in between cover ever and so easy.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try, after seeing it on TV. It works exactly as described. In fact I was a little surprised at how well it conceals and blends with my other hair color. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> No doubt the best spray to cover gray I have ever used.  It&#x27;s non-greasy, easy to use and covers the gray entirely!!</li>
            <li> I have tried all the root concealer products I could find on the market. None were acceptable. This is the only one that has a real, non-fake looking color, applies quickly and easily and covers roots beautifully. I have horribly fast growing hair and I turned totally gray in my 20s. Dealing with roots has been a 25-year misery for me. No more. I never could understand why someone couldn&#x27;t invent a simple colored spray. It just can&#x27;t be that hard and there should be a huge market for it. Well, someone finally did. I can&#x27;t speak for the other colors, but the light brown gray away has changed my life. I now how have a whole new freedom for coloring my hair when it is convenient for me.  Thank you thank you thank you to whomever finally created this product. I will never bother trying another.</li>
            <li> This product totally saves me from needing to color my hair quite so often.  I try to barely press it to just get light coverage of the roots where my hair parts, and it works great.  It is fairly dark and I wish there was a color in between blonde and light brown but for now I&#x27;ll take it.  I do wonder how healthy/safe it truly is for you, so I would only use it sparingly on small areas. It dries immediately and has no smell (unlike some of the horrible smells of the crayon-like root concealers), it doesn&#x27;t look waxy or anything.  I think it would be hard to use very accurately for gray at the temple so I limit it to the part-line.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but effective for a good cover of the gray hair.</li>
            <li> Threw it in the garbage. The spray comes out way to strong, and looks fake and weird.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores so I ordered it online.  Matches my color!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  It does make your hair a bit &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; feeling, but to touch up that last week before coloring, it is a great option!</li>
            <li> the product serves it&#x27;s purpose!  I use it when my root starts to show!  i am very happy and satisfied with this product.  I will continue to order it!</li>
            <li> A great product! I use this between my coloring.  It saves me money and matches my hair color perfectly!  My roots look great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Love it for touch-ups in between.</li>
            <li> My wife is very satisfied.!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I&#x27;ve tried many a product to conceal the gray once it starts to appear, and this product seems to work the best for me...it stays in until you wash it out, and I don&#x27;t have to dye my hair as often.</li>
            <li> I read how this contained minerals so I thought it was a more natural product as I am sensitive to chemicals.  I ordered light brown, received the can and it was way smaller than expected, but I applied it and it seemed to work great, although the spray was VERY powerful and a little hard to control.  Well, shortly after applying I developed a killer headache and scalp itching which lasted 5 days.  I read the ingredients and discovered the main ingredients were butane, hydrochlorofluorines, and other strong toxic chemicals so unfortunately I can&#x27;t use the stuff and just wanted to warn anyone else who is bothered by chemicals.  Otherwise, the effect looked great and natural with the light brown on my medium brown hair.  I wish they could have created the same effect with more minerals and less unnatural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The product is quite good in that it is less sticky than others I have tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue like most. But the bottle is 1.7 oz. If you just have a center part you are covering, then you will love it. If you are spraying more all over, you won&#x27;t get anywhere near 40 applications. More like 4 if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
