            <li>When I am done straightening, I do not have any fly aways either.</li>
            <li>It should be great for YOUR hair too.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re better off going to Sally&#x27;s and talking to someone there for what&#x27;s best in stock for what you want.</li>
            <li>Smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Good smoothing serum,</li>

            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>that amazingly:  </li>
            <li>The best part is I still have body in my hair -- it&#x27;s not just stick straight with no style to it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It is probably the best product so far I ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and when it gets longer it is prone to frizzing.</li>
            <li>it looks like I straightened it and is very smooth.</li>
            <li>, I love that leaving it soft, silky and shiny, very good this line.</li>
            <li>Also if you use the shampoo &amp; conditioner it works better :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usuing this more for frizz control and to shape my hair than the straightening benefit.</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;straight haired&amp;#34; girl friends love it too.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair nice and smooth after blow drying without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for many years, couldn&#x27;t beat the price at the time so...  </li>
            <li>I on&#x27;t use it more than once a week.  </li>
            <li>I will continue using it and hope for better results.</li>
            <li>I love this product - along with the shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better stuff in the John Frieda line an</li>
            <li>I love that this has 2 benefits.  </li>
            <li>Tried so many products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite Frizz Ease products.</li>
            <li>It made my hair more smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I was a Fructis user, but for 3/4 bucks more, Freida makes it worth, just give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>I think its a great value because similar products from a salon cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very shiny and looks very healthy.</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth, I have very, very fine hair but a metric crapton of it.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but it seems to be lightening my hair</li>
            <li>Very fast !!</li>
            <li>After just one day of using this product (along with the Smooth Start Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner), I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>My hair stays nice and straight until I wash again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this to straighten my hair; nothing can protect 100% against the North Carolina humidity, but this is light and prevents frizz.</li>
            <li>So i use this product to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>Straightens hair and leaves it light and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>When you work it through your hair not only does it get rid of the frizzies, but it makes your hair nice and shiny too!</li>
            <li>Smells really familiar to something..</li>
            <li>and I LOVE this stuff for blowing my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Manages the Frizz and gives you a nice soft shine.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty hard to find a good Straighten hair cream for a good price.</li>
            <li>My hair is almost completely frizz-free and looks smooth, shiny and healthy, even in the humidity.  </li>
            <li>I am use to put just a slight touch of this cream of my hair and they turn out to be great.</li>
            <li>I have a big beautiful curly Natural  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not really expensive, which I like too!</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this when achieving a straight hairstyle.</li>
            <li>Worth a try, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try for $6.  </li>
            <li>It sure seems to do its job; makes my hair silky and smooth, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t do away with all frizz/flyaways in my case.</li>
            <li>I have to adjust that amount regularly as my hair grows, and I use too much too often (resulting in a greasy look), but overall it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This product works great to tame my unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a matter of finding the right amount that works for you hair type and style.</li>
            <li>If you use the right amount, doesn&#x27;t make your hair look too greasy, but holds in place all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, and it has a very mild, nice smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products but have never found something that works for me.  </li>
            <li>I told my sisters about this product since I really like it!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for to control my &#x27;baby hairs&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I first used it with a blow dryer</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT NEVER FAILS ME.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely loads better than not using it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first use I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>My normally frizzy hair is silky smooth and straight with it.</li>
            <li>and then i used a flat iron and it left my hair nice without frizz!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of this products lately and this one works the best for my fine hair by not weighing it down and making it greasy yet giving it some manageability.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t perfect but it keeps my hair straighter and less frizzy than all of the other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is not the best frizz fixing hair especially if you have course, thick hair.</li>
            <li>A nickel or quarter sized dollop smoothed on to the temples and throughout my hair helps get rid of the curl and frizz and make my long hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>I apply it, then blow dry, and my hair looks way better than without it.</li>
            <li>Works great on wet hair, dry hair etc.  </li>
            <li>it works well, im not 100% frizz free, but it really does help especially with the straightening.</li>
            <li>Does the job well..tames my very unruly hair..</li>
            <li>really just a pea-sized amount does plenty.</li>
            <li>You do not have to use much at all.</li>
            <li>i really know the difference.</li>
            <li>I recommend Beyond the Zone Straight Shot from Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>I would NOT recommend this if you are looking for something that will make your hair straight through air drying.</li>
            <li>Get it if you plan on using the blow dryer since i think the creme gets activated by the blow dryer if not then i recomment using another product i really dont like</li>
            <li>blow drying my hair too much</li>
            <li>If you use too much it can be goopy or greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t stick straight, but it does just have some body</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think the stuff works</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see the difference when I use it or not.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use too much of it</li>
            <li>Seriously, so much hair...</li>
            <li>This product works  really well</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I had used too much of the creme</li>
            <li>I regularly use this product with my L&#x27;Oreal Xtreme Straighter Creme (and coconut oil) and my hair stays smooth and keeps from my frizz to sprout throughout the work day.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff- makes even the curliest hair soft, and makes flat ironing a breeze.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, helps hair dry straight</li>
            <li>and this I can put in and blow dry straight easily.</li>
            <li>BaByliss Pro BABP2800 Porcelain Ceramic 2000-Watt Dryer, Black]] (which I LOVE) and a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have tried every smoothing product on the market and this one works better than the much more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I recently cut my hair and it is very short on the sides and longer on top (fohawk).</li>
            <li>Suggest for hair that  cannot be controlled in high humidity</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations were too high</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this John Frieda product.</li>
            <li>This works better than any expensive straightening cream bumble and bumble or redken can make, save the $ and use this, it&#x27;s amazing and hair stays straight without a flat iron.</li>
            <li>but it does control the frizz and kept my naturally curly hair straight for two days.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it came in a bigger container because I go through it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>(yep, the Fro is coming back in style) and this product keeps my hair moist, conditioned, and super soft.</li>
            <li>I have medium fine curly hair, and living in New Orleans with the high humidity leaves me with a mess of frizz.  </li>
            <li>I recommend giving this a try if you have shared my frustrations with wild, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I could definitely tell a difference.</li>
            <li>This is the second time using this and my first time ordering via Amazon.</li>
            <li>Hope this remains cheap because it is a hidden gem.</li>
            <li>I can usually never get my hair completely straight, and the wings will start to pop back up as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>When I forget to use it, it makes a huge difference and my hair is frizzy and fluffy.</li>
            <li>but I did not get the results I had hoped for on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair never stays straight, especially if there is any moisture in the air.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy frizzy hair</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread easily through hair, so if you use even a little too much, your hair becomes very greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li>This one does not and it really helps protect my hair from my flat iron.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent spent!</li>
            <li>Once I add enough so that the sides are saturated, brush it straight and let it dry then brush it out, it&#x27;s perfectly straight and looks like it did when I walked out of the salon.</li>
            <li>I do recommend that unless you have very dry hair, use less conditioner, or skip conditioner altogether when using this as it seems to work a lot better.  </li>
            <li>If I do use more than what is needed, it will dry and flake a little, but combs out.  </li>
            <li>My hair is also super soft and not weighed down at all!</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, so when I blow dry it straight, it gets frizzy, this helps.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length hair that I blow dry, and when I used this product for the first time, I did not have to use my flat iron afterward, and normally I do, even after blow drying with a straightening product.  </li>
            <li>really does keep hair from getting frizzy and knotted, recommend this for anyone with long hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cheap too (around $5, little less - I found it on sale)</li>
            <li>It seems slightly heavier than the old version but it works better than the more expensive versions I have tried recently.  </li>
            <li>A small dab will go a long way so don&#x27;t think you will have to use more than a quarter size.</li>
            <li>However, with this product I can get my hair totally pin straight &amp; it lasts till the next time I wash it.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair that is really unmanageable in the humid summer months - frizzy, dry, dull, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thick hair cut in a bob.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>and then I comb it through my hair and dry it straight with a hair dryer - no flat iron</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 6 am now, and though parts of my hair are still wet as usual, the parts of my hair that are dry look AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I have naturally thick curly hair and tried many different products to try to make my short sides lay flat without any flaking and residue or looking like</li>
            <li>it left it feeling not so soft and different.</li>
            <li>Instead of getting silky or straight hair, it nearly doubled the drying time and my ends felt stiff.</li>
            <li>This magical stuff makes long, thick and curly hair manageable!</li>
            <li>I towel dry, add product, brush through, then blow dry straight with a brush.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers said, this product is for BLOW DRYING your hair straight, NOT using a flat iron on it.</li>
            <li>My hair goes down to the middle of my back and is fairly straight.  </li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li>and I  live in FL with extreme humidity.</li>
            <li>I have very naturally curly hair that is extremely susceptible to frizz.  </li>

            <li> My hair is almost completely frizz-free and looks smooth, shiny and healthy, even in the humidity.  </li>
            <li> I am use to put just a slight touch of this cream of my hair and they turn out to be great.</li>
            <li> I have a big beautiful curly Natural  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not really expensive, which I like too!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this when achieving a straight hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Worth a try, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try for $6.  </li>
            <li> It sure seems to do its job; makes my hair silky and smooth, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t do away with all frizz/flyaways in my case.</li>
            <li> I have to adjust that amount regularly as my hair grows, and I use too much too often (resulting in a greasy look), but overall it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This product works great to tame my unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a matter of finding the right amount that works for you hair type and style.</li>
            <li> If you use the right amount, doesn&#x27;t make your hair look too greasy, but holds in place all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, and it has a very mild, nice smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products but have never found something that works for me.  </li>
            <li> I told my sisters about this product since I really like it!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for to control my &#x27;baby hairs&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I first used it with a blow dryer</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT NEVER FAILS ME.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely loads better than not using it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first use I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> My normally frizzy hair is silky smooth and straight with it.</li>
            <li> and then i used a flat iron and it left my hair nice without frizz!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of this products lately and this one works the best for my fine hair by not weighing it down and making it greasy yet giving it some manageability.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t perfect but it keeps my hair straighter and less frizzy than all of the other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is not the best frizz fixing hair especially if you have course, thick hair.</li>
            <li> A nickel or quarter sized dollop smoothed on to the temples and throughout my hair helps get rid of the curl and frizz and make my long hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> I apply it, then blow dry, and my hair looks way better than without it.</li>
            <li> Works great on wet hair, dry hair etc.  </li>
            <li> it works well, im not 100% frizz free, but it really does help especially with the straightening.</li>
            <li> Does the job well..tames my very unruly hair..</li>
            <li> really just a pea-sized amount does plenty.</li>
            <li> You do not have to use much at all.</li>
            <li> i really know the difference.</li>
            <li> I recommend Beyond the Zone Straight Shot from Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this if you are looking for something that will make your hair straight through air drying.</li>
            <li> Get it if you plan on using the blow dryer since i think the creme gets activated by the blow dryer if not then i recomment using another product i really dont like</li>
            <li> blow drying my hair too much</li>
            <li> If you use too much it can be goopy or greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t stick straight, but it does just have some body</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think the stuff works</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the difference when I use it or not.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use too much of it</li>
            <li> Seriously, so much hair...</li>
            <li> This product works  really well</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I had used too much of the creme</li>
            <li> I regularly use this product with my L&#x27;Oreal Xtreme Straighter Creme (and coconut oil) and my hair stays smooth and keeps from my frizz to sprout throughout the work day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff- makes even the curliest hair soft, and makes flat ironing a breeze.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, helps hair dry straight</li>
            <li> and this I can put in and blow dry straight easily.</li>
            <li> BaByliss Pro BABP2800 Porcelain Ceramic 2000-Watt Dryer, Black]] (which I LOVE) and a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have tried every smoothing product on the market and this one works better than the much more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair and it is very short on the sides and longer on top (fohawk).</li>
            <li> Suggest for hair that  cannot be controlled in high humidity</li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations were too high</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this John Frieda product.</li>
            <li> This works better than any expensive straightening cream bumble and bumble or redken can make, save the $ and use this, it&#x27;s amazing and hair stays straight without a flat iron.</li>
            <li> but it does control the frizz and kept my naturally curly hair straight for two days.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it came in a bigger container because I go through it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> (yep, the Fro is coming back in style) and this product keeps my hair moist, conditioned, and super soft.</li>
            <li> I have medium fine curly hair, and living in New Orleans with the high humidity leaves me with a mess of frizz.  </li>
            <li> I recommend giving this a try if you have shared my frustrations with wild, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I could definitely tell a difference.</li>
            <li> This is the second time using this and my first time ordering via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hope this remains cheap because it is a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> I can usually never get my hair completely straight, and the wings will start to pop back up as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> When I forget to use it, it makes a huge difference and my hair is frizzy and fluffy.</li>
            <li> but I did not get the results I had hoped for on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair never stays straight, especially if there is any moisture in the air.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spread easily through hair, so if you use even a little too much, your hair becomes very greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> This one does not and it really helps protect my hair from my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent spent!</li>
            <li> Once I add enough so that the sides are saturated, brush it straight and let it dry then brush it out, it&#x27;s perfectly straight and looks like it did when I walked out of the salon.</li>
            <li> I do recommend that unless you have very dry hair, use less conditioner, or skip conditioner altogether when using this as it seems to work a lot better.  </li>
            <li> If I do use more than what is needed, it will dry and flake a little, but combs out.  </li>
            <li> My hair is also super soft and not weighed down at all!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, so when I blow dry it straight, it gets frizzy, this helps.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length hair that I blow dry, and when I used this product for the first time, I did not have to use my flat iron afterward, and normally I do, even after blow drying with a straightening product.  </li>
            <li> really does keep hair from getting frizzy and knotted, recommend this for anyone with long hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheap too (around $5, little less - I found it on sale)</li>
            <li> It seems slightly heavier than the old version but it works better than the more expensive versions I have tried recently.  </li>
            <li> A small dab will go a long way so don&#x27;t think you will have to use more than a quarter size.</li>
            <li> However, with this product I can get my hair totally pin straight &amp; it lasts till the next time I wash it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair that is really unmanageable in the humid summer months - frizzy, dry, dull, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thick hair cut in a bob.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> and then I comb it through my hair and dry it straight with a hair dryer - no flat iron</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 6 am now, and though parts of my hair are still wet as usual, the parts of my hair that are dry look AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick curly hair and tried many different products to try to make my short sides lay flat without any flaking and residue or looking like</li>
            <li> it left it feeling not so soft and different.</li>
            <li> Instead of getting silky or straight hair, it nearly doubled the drying time and my ends felt stiff.</li>
            <li> This magical stuff makes long, thick and curly hair manageable!</li>
            <li> I towel dry, add product, brush through, then blow dry straight with a brush.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, this product is for BLOW DRYING your hair straight, NOT using a flat iron on it.</li>
            <li> My hair goes down to the middle of my back and is fairly straight.  </li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li> and I  live in FL with extreme humidity.</li>
            <li> I have very naturally curly hair that is extremely susceptible to frizz.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much, you will get greasy, flat hair and too little will get you nowhere.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, coarse, long, thick, and super frizzy.</li>
            <li> If you can find the delicate balance and use the right amount, this product does help with frizz and makes hair straighter.</li>
            <li> My hair (African American 3b/3c) is long, thick, natural and very curly...</li>
            <li> My hair is normally frizzy; when I use this, my hair is less frizzy.</li>
            <li> However, this helps to tame my hair and make it much easier to manage and style after blow drying.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t damage your hair from blow drying or flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> I use it to calm down my tight curls into loose &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; waves.  </li>
            <li> So last night, I decided to use a dime sized amount in my hair, but I didn&#x27;t blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my hair soft and to have less friz, which it does just that.  </li>
            <li> I have medium-length frizzy and wavy hair that gets really hard to manage once I&#x27;ve blow-dried it because it reacts so much to heat.</li>
            <li> have long (mid-back) hair and</li>
            <li> I have long, natural, thick African American hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this did much for my wavy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy dry long color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I only use a small amount of this product, about the size of a pea, since my hair is fine &amp; thin and I have a chin length bob.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry throughout the night.</li>
            <li> i let it dry out by itself and just used the straightener after my hair got dry</li>
            <li> but in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> If you over use this product you may start to feel your hair dry out a bit.</li>
            <li> But that is because my hair is dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> (I let my hair air dry), and helps save my hair from the straightening iron.</li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> I put it on before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> Even if I dont blow dry, it still makes my hair manageable.</li>
            <li> After putting this on and blow drying my hair straight with a round brush, my hair was noticeably smoother and silky feeling, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel brittle, sticky or weighed down like some of the other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> and it does not normally cooperate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very much</li>
            <li> It looks like my wet hair, but dry.</li>
            <li> Must blow dry after applying to wet hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair and then blow dry, and I also use it after I&#x27;ve dried my hair and flat</li>
            <li> They say it gives their hair bounce, wave, and makes their hair free from those rainy  and muggy Summer &amp;#34;FRIZZIES&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but when it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s so wavy</li>
            <li> If you have hairlike me and are looking for something to take your hair as it air dried, I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> It has worked for me, but I don&#x27;t put it on my wet hair</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length curly hair and use about a dime size dollop of this in my wet hair before drying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I use every day to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way to taming the frizzies.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way</li>
            <li> I purchased all of the other things</li>
            <li> It says it works for 24 hours, but for me it lasts two days (I wash my hair every other day).</li>
            <li> It is applied to dry hair and a little dab will do it.</li>
            <li> but you have to be very careful about quantity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that &amp;#34;de-frizz&amp;#34; and they usually end up making my hair look oily or flat.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair and use a straightening product every time I wash and dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz down and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like other products.</li>
            <li> and I just use a little to slick my hair back in a ponytail or bun.</li>
            <li> When I let my hair air dry, it turns into this awkward frizzy straight hair with wavy pieces</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave a film.  </li>
            <li> and it does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not get weighed down or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I usually just let it air dry overnight and straighten it in the morning.</li>
            <li> extra thick serum is too heavy and weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick(ish) hair with a slight wave to it</li>
            <li> If I do not straighten my hair, it has a slight wave to it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for those that have less processed hair.</li>
            <li> another try using half the amount.</li>
            <li> But my hair looks wavy (not the awkward straight hair with wavy pieces) and not frizzy!</li>
            <li> I uses to have to let my hair air dry before styling it because blow drying it would make it so hard to manage.</li>
            <li> My cousin&#x27;s hair is a little coarser than mine.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is mostly straight, but wings out like crazy at the ends.</li>
            <li> my my hair always feels heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair sleek and no fly away strands especially on humid days.</li>
            <li> She used this after washing and it made her hair sticky and dried it out.</li>
            <li> B00011QTZI Cricket Technique Barrel Hair Brush, XX-large Round, 2 Inch]].</li>
            <li> My hair is not sticky or stiff, and the product does not leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> this product made my hair feel damaged and stiff.</li>
            <li> No strong odor and not all that sticky.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when John Frieda discontinued the Frizz Ease Wind Down Creme, because it was the only product I had found to tame my naturally curly (translated frizzy) hair.  </li>
            <li> BTW - my hair is past my shoulders</li>
            <li> I will order again online as I have a hard time finding this one in stores.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, thick, and hard to detangle so when I find a product that works for me I stick to it.</li>
            <li> finally no more frizz!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed with the few John Frieda styling products I&#x27;ve tried, and I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I hate blow drying my hair (because it takes an our and a half), so</li>
            <li> Guys, don&#x27;t shy away from this product.</li>
            <li> Not perfect,</li>
            <li> But when i tie my hair up into a bun, and let it down, there is an annoying and ugly bump.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does the job well..tames my very unruly hair..</li>
            <li> best stuff to straighten curly hair and keep it from fizzing</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick(ish) hair with a slight wave to it and I LOVE this stuff for blowing my hair straight. Like other reviewers said, this product is for BLOW DRYING your hair straight, NOT using a flat iron on it. (My roommate wondered why her hair was smoking... oops...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (mid-back) hair and really just a pea-sized amount does plenty. I towel dry, add product, brush through, then blow dry straight with a brush. I think it also allows me to go a day or two longer between washes while still looking great.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when John Frieda discontinued the Frizz Ease Wind Down Creme, because it was the only product I had found to tame my naturally curly (translated frizzy) hair.  I&#x27;ve been trying different products for almost 2 years looking for a replacement, and I finally found it!  I have shoulder-length hair that I blow dry, and when I used this product for the first time, I did not have to use my flat iron afterward, and normally I do, even after blow drying with a straightening product.  My hair is not sticky or stiff, and the product does not leave a residue.  The best part is I still have body in my hair -- it&#x27;s not just stick straight with no style to it.  I do recommend that unless you have very dry hair, use less conditioner, or skip conditioner altogether when using this as it seems to work a lot better.  Now please John Frieda, don&#x27;t discontinue this one!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick hair cut in a bob.  If I do not straighten my hair, it has a slight wave to it.  I use this before blow drying and straightening my hair.  You do not have to use much at all. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave a film.  When I am done straightening, I do not have any fly aways either. I think its a great value because similar products from a salon cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> it works well, im not 100% frizz free, but it really does help especially with the straightening. i really know the difference.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I have fine, wavy hair that is really unmanageable in the humid summer months - frizzy, dry, dull, etc.  I&#x27;ve tried many different products but have never found something that works for me.  After just one day of using this product (along with the Smooth Start Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner), I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement.  My hair is almost completely frizz-free and looks smooth, shiny and healthy, even in the humidity.  I recommend giving this a try if you have shared my frustrations with wild, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> This works better than any expensive straightening cream bumble and bumble or redken can make, save the $ and use this, it&#x27;s amazing and hair stays straight without a flat iron. Also if you use the shampoo &amp; conditioner it works better :)</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I could definitely tell a difference. It made my hair more smooth and silky.  I told my sisters about this product since I really like it!  It&#x27;s pretty cheap too (around $5, little less - I found it on sale) so it&#x27;s not really expensive, which I like too!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and when it gets longer it is prone to frizzing. A little of this goes a long way to taming the frizzies. It is applied to dry hair and a little dab will do it. When you work it through your hair not only does it get rid of the frizzies, but it makes your hair nice and shiny too!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for to control my &#x27;baby hairs&#x27;. It holds and smooths without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> finally no more frizz!</li>
            <li> waiting for another.  This product is a lifesaver for summer humidity to control hair .  Suggest for hair that  cannot be controlled in high humidity</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair and use a straightening product every time I wash and dry my hair. I like the John Frieda straightening shampoo so I looked forward to trying this. I have tried using smaller and smaller amounts of this product my my hair always feels heavy and greasy. I recommend Beyond the Zone Straight Shot from Sally Beauty Supply. Straightens hair and leaves it light and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Great product !! Very fast !!</li>
            <li> really does keep hair from getting frizzy and knotted, recommend this for anyone with long hair</li>
            <li> The best product. I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and finally got around to using it last night. My hair is wavy, coarse, long, thick, and super frizzy. When I let my hair air dry, it turns into this awkward frizzy straight hair with wavy pieces but when it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s so wavy it&#x27;s almost curly.  I hate blow drying my hair (because it takes an our and a half), so I usually just let it air dry overnight and straighten it in the morning. (let me note that my hair is so unruly that I also have to straighten my hair in order to curl it.) So last night, I decided to use a dime sized amount in my hair, but I didn&#x27;t blow dry it. I let it air dry throughout the night. It&#x27;s 6 am now, and though parts of my hair are still wet as usual, the parts of my hair that are dry look AMAZING. It looks like my wet hair, but dry. I&#x27;m usuing this more for frizz control and to shape my hair than the straightening benefit. I would NOT recommend this if you are looking for something that will make your hair straight through air drying. But my hair looks wavy (not the awkward straight hair with wavy pieces) and not frizzy! My hair is also super soft and not weighed down at all! If you have hairlike me and are looking for something to take your hair as it air dried, I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> My hair (African American 3b/3c) is long, thick, natural and very curly...this product made my hair feel damaged and stiff. I so wanted this to work but it&#x27;s definitely not for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of this products lately and this one works the best for my fine hair by not weighing it down and making it greasy yet giving it some manageability. I only use it on my hair when it is damp thought.</li>
            <li> I first used it with a blow dryer and then i used a flat iron and it left my hair nice without frizz! But then i used it without blow drying my hair i let it dry out by itself and just used the straightener after my hair got dry it left it feeling not so soft and different. Get it if you plan on using the blow dryer since i think the creme gets activated by the blow dryer if not then i recomment using another product i really dont like blow drying my hair too much so i use it but not as often.. Either way great buy and great seller! Thank you!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT NEVER FAILS ME. I have a big beautiful curly Natural  (yep, the Fro is coming back in style) and this product keeps my hair moist, conditioned, and super soft. My &amp;#34;straight haired&amp;#34; girl friends love it too. They say it gives their hair bounce, wave, and makes their hair free from those rainy  and muggy Summer &amp;#34;FRIZZIES&amp;#34;. Guys, don&#x27;t shy away from this product. It should be great for YOUR hair too. No matter what your hair type and no matter what your ethnicity and no matter what your gender, you should give it a go. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is affordable and works well with my hair.  I have thin fine hair but in a dry climate.  This product makes my hair nice and smooth after blow drying without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li> Helps my frizzy hair straighten out.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years, couldn&#x27;t beat the price at the time so...  I have long, natural, thick African American hair. I stumbled upon this att cvs one day and thought I would try it. It has worked for me, but I don&#x27;t put it on my wet hair and I just use a little to slick my hair back in a ponytail or bun. This keeps my hair sleek and no fly away strands especially on humid days. I would not recommend for all African American hair. My cousin&#x27;s hair is a little coarser than mine. She used this after washing and it made her hair sticky and dried it out. I guess its about finding balance and what works for you. Worth a try, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy dry long color treated hair.  I use this in the summer and winter. No strong odor and not all that sticky. A small dab will go a long way so don&#x27;t think you will have to use more than a quarter size. I use it on wet hair and then blow dry, and I also use it after I&#x27;ve dried my hair and flat ironed it.  If you over use this product you may start to feel your hair dry out a bit. I on&#x27;t use it more than once a week.  But that is because my hair is dry and brittle. I would recommend this product for those that have less processed hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this did much for my wavy, thick hair.  I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle but did think it would help with the frizzies, and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have tried every smoothing product on the market and this one works better than the much more expensive ones. I just wish it came in a bigger container because I go through it pretty fast. A nickel or quarter sized dollop smoothed on to the temples and throughout my hair helps get rid of the curl and frizz and make my long hair more manageable. If you use too much it can be goopy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations were too high but I did not get the results I had hoped for on my natural hair. I will continue using it and hope for better results.</li>
            <li> I love how great this product works in my overly curly hair. I used to get Keratin done but decided to stop doing it to save money and I bought this product instead. My hair isn&#x27;t stick straight, but it does just have some body and it&#x27;s very shiny and looks very healthy. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would definitely buy it again. BTW - my hair is past my shoulders and I just have to use a &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; about the size of a nickel (or maybe a quarter?). It&#x27;s not very much and then I comb it through my hair and dry it straight with a hair dryer - no flat iron required.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> arrived promptly and as promised</li>
            <li> I love this product - along with the shampoo &amp; conditioner. I have wiry hair and this product is a godsend for it.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have very naturally curly hair that is extremely susceptible to frizz.  A little bit of this goes a long way and it does not leave my hair feeling greasy or crunchy.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally frizzy; when I use this, my hair is less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair never stays straight, especially if there is any moisture in the air. This stuff isn&#x27;t perfect but it keeps my hair straighter and less frizzy than all of the other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Just bought this at the store on a whim.  I love it!!!  I have medium fine curly hair, and living in New Orleans with the high humidity leaves me with a mess of frizz.  After putting this on and blow drying my hair straight with a round brush, my hair was noticeably smoother and silky feeling, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel brittle, sticky or weighed down like some of the other products I&#x27;ve used.  It does appear to last the entire 24 hours.  As a bonus, it also has a heat protector in it so you won&#x27;t damage your hair from blow drying or flat ironing.  Definitely worth a try for $6.  It makes me want to go out and try the rest of the Frizz Ease haircare line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better stuff in the John Frieda line an I really don&#x27;t think the stuff works that amazingly:  you&#x27;re better off going to Sally&#x27;s and talking to someone there for what&#x27;s best in stock for what you want.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the difference when I use it or not.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of John Frieda products.  I have curly hair, but use this to straighten.  I don&#x27;t have to use too much of it and it does not weigh my hair down.  If I do use more than what is needed, it will dry and flake a little, but combs out.  I have shoulder length curly hair and use about a dime size dollop of this in my wet hair before drying.  My hair stays nice and straight until I wash again.</li>
            <li> This product reduces frizz or allows curls.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Worth every cent spent!</li>
            <li> It is pretty hard to find a good Straighten hair cream for a good price. I am use to put just a slight touch of this cream of my hair and they turn out to be great. I sue shampoo, balsam and cream all from the Frizz-Ease collection and my hair reacts just great to it. It is probably the best product so far I ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to step up to semi-professional products just step up to John Freida, he knows what is doing. I was a Fructis user, but for 3/4 bucks more, Freida makes it worth, just give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> It sure seems to do its job; makes my hair silky and smooth, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t do away with all frizz/flyaways in my case. It&#x27;s definitely loads better than not using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I have very, very fine hair but a metric crapton of it. Seriously, so much hair... and it does not normally cooperate. I&#x27;m using it with the [[ASIN:B001UHN0I6 BaByliss Pro BABP2800 Porcelain Ceramic 2000-Watt Dryer, Black]] (which I LOVE) and a [[ASIN:B00011QTZI Cricket Technique Barrel Hair Brush, XX-large Round, 2 Inch]].</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair, necessarily. I have medium-length frizzy and wavy hair that gets really hard to manage once I&#x27;ve blow-dried it because it reacts so much to heat. I uses to have to let my hair air dry before styling it because blow drying it would make it so hard to manage. However, this helps to tame my hair and make it much easier to manage and style after blow drying. Not perfect, but it&#x27;s a vast improvement from what I had before!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that &amp;#34;de-frizz&amp;#34; and they usually end up making my hair look oily or flat. This one does not and it really helps protect my hair from my flat iron. Highly recommend this John Frieda product.</li>
            <li> I love that this has 2 benefits.  Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, helps hair dry straight (I let my hair air dry), and helps save my hair from the straightening iron.</li>
            <li> Works well to straighten hair and reduce frizz. Must blow dry after applying to wet hair.</li>
            <li> This product works  really well and I  live in FL with extreme humidity.</li>
            <li> This product works great to tame my unruly hair.  I apply it, then blow dry, and my hair looks way better than without it.</li>
            <li> Good smoothing serum, but you have to be very careful about quantity. It doesn&#x27;t spread easily through hair, so if you use even a little too much, your hair becomes very greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Got it for my girlfriend, she is happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Tried so many products. Hope this remains cheap because it is a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> My hair goes down to the middle of my back and is fairly straight.  I bought this to make my hair soft and to have less friz, which it does just that.  After the first use I could tell a difference.  After continued use my hair feels softer than it ever has.&lt;br /&gt;For the ends of my hair I use a protien coconut oil and then use a drop of this for the rest.  When I blow dry my hair it looks like I straightened it and is very smooth.</li>
            <li> This add on was not included in my package.  I purchased all of the other things just so I could get the add on and it was not in the package.  What do I do now</li>
            <li> Works great on wet hair, dry hair etc.  Manages the Frizz and gives you a nice soft shine.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> When I go to the mall for my haircuts, the stylist recommended that I use the Redkin straightening creme which was $18 dollars. I din&#x27;t want to keep on buying that so I found this at the drugstore for $5! It works just the same.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you will get greasy, flat hair and too little will get you nowhere. If you can find the delicate balance and use the right amount, this product does help with frizz and makes hair straighter. I just find that it is a pain to keep trying to find that perfect amount.</li>
            <li> This is not the best frizz fixing hair especially if you have course, thick hair. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for curly haired women.</li>
            <li> This stuff works for me. I have hair that is mostly straight, but wings out like crazy at the ends. I can usually never get my hair completely straight, and the wings will start to pop back up as the day goes on. However, with this product I can get my hair totally pin straight &amp; it lasts till the next time I wash it. I only use a small amount of this product, about the size of a pea, since my hair is fine &amp; thin and I have a chin length bob. My hair does not get weighed down or greasy at all. I think it&#x27;s a matter of finding the right amount that works for you hair type and style.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It helps to maintain the frizz in my hair. I have naturally wavy hair, so when I blow dry it straight, it gets frizzy, this helps.  I put it on before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> very good product, delicious aroma, ideal for hair care, I love that leaving it soft, silky and shiny, very good this line. thanks</li>
            <li> I tried this smoothing creme during the summer because the package claims it will keep your hair \\&quot;silky-straight for up to 24 hours.\\&quot; Instead of getting silky or straight hair, it nearly doubled the drying time and my ends felt stiff. I thought maybe I had used too much of the creme so I gave it another try using half the amount. My results were the same. I&#x27;ve been disappointed with the few John Frieda styling products I&#x27;ve tried, and I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my replacement product for a discontinued John Frieda purple tube that I used to buy.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far but it does control the frizz and kept my naturally curly hair straight for two days.  It seems slightly heavier than the old version but it works better than the more expensive versions I have tried recently.  I will order again online as I have a hard time finding this one in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer of this product. It&#x27;s the only thing I use every day to tame my hair. When I forget to use it, it makes a huge difference and my hair is frizzy and fluffy. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, and it has a very mild, nice smell. I love it!</li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair and it is very short on the sides and longer on top (fohawk). I have naturally thick curly hair and tried many different products to try to make my short sides lay flat without any flaking and residue or looking like I had gel on the sides. This is the only product that achieved that look. Once I add enough so that the sides are saturated, brush it straight and let it dry then brush it out, it&#x27;s perfectly straight and looks like it did when I walked out of the salon.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it works great.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! My normally frizzy hair is silky smooth and straight with it. It says it works for 24 hours, but for me it lasts two days (I wash my hair every other day).</li>
            <li> Love this stuff- makes even the curliest hair soft, and makes flat ironing a breeze. I use it to calm down my tight curls into loose &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; waves.  This magical stuff makes long, thick and curly hair manageable!</li>
            <li> If you use the right amount, doesn&#x27;t make your hair look too greasy, but holds in place all day. I have to adjust that amount regularly as my hair grows, and I use too much too often (resulting in a greasy look), but overall it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it daily to help control frizz.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair and this is the only thing Ive found that keeps it from turning into a giant frizz puff. I used to buy the tubes two at a time at Walmart but now I can&#x27;t find it in stores at all. The Frizz Ease extra thick serum is too heavy and weighs my hair down. I don&#x27;t use this to straighten my hair; nothing can protect 100% against the North Carolina humidity, but this is light and prevents frizz.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair conditioned and shiny.  Smells pleasant.  One of my favorite Frizz Ease products.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy frizzy hair and this I can put in and blow dry straight easily. Even if I dont blow dry, it still makes my hair manageable.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz down and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like other products. Easy to work with and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I regularly use this product with my L&#x27;Oreal Xtreme Straighter Creme (and coconut oil) and my hair stays smooth and keeps from my frizz to sprout throughout the work day. My hair is curly, thick, and hard to detangle so when I find a product that works for me I stick to it. This is the second time using this and my first time ordering via Amazon. The packaged product arrived on time and I get about 3-4months of usage. I enjoy using this when achieving a straight hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Smells really familiar to something.. i dont remember. But when i tie my hair up into a bun, and let it down, there is an annoying and ugly bump. So i use this product to smooth it out. Works fine, but it seems to be lightening my hair</li>
