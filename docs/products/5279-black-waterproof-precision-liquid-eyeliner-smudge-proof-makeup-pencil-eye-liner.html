            <li>It is perfect for a clear line!</li>

            <li>And i love how it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was so pretty and great but ran out within two days</li>
            <li>Very precise lines</li>
            <li>i love this product</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It comes our nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will probably order more, because I really love this liner.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye liners and some I paid up to $20.00</li>
            <li>It works awesome on the top lashes, especially when doing a wing.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s my favorite part.</li>
            <li>I am able to apply after I put my falsies on.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I found a better waterproof eyeliner at the dollar store.  </li>
            <li>I used it when dressing someone as Cleopatra and it was so smoothly done, I was amazed!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smudge, and stays more than 14 hours.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re also looking for a top quality eyeliner at an inexpensive price, buy this.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the packaging and how safe it was.</li>
            <li>i love the ease that i can apply the eyeliner and how versatile it is</li>
            <li>Therefore, i wasnt able to use it.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to my friends:)</li>
            <li>i love the way it makes my eyes look verry sexy.</li>
            <li>The felt on the tip started to come off on my eye as I put it on, and I was still able to smudge it, so it isn&#x27;t smudge proof</li>
            <li>Love the product and will order again.</li>
            <li>(or a zombie :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered two of these.</li>
            <li>I honestly really LOVE how this eye liner looks when on my eyes</li>
            <li>I used it to draw and it comes out as a better marker.</li>
            <li>I could have used a marker or sharpie and would have gotten better lines.</li>
            <li>this was great easy to make a straight line with this...</li>
            <li>They sent it on time and in a short amount of time and when i used the product it was amazing:) great quality</li>
            <li>Loved it for the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li>and I LOVE how easy it is to put on.</li>
            <li>I love the precise line you can create with the tip.</li>
            <li>good product for me since I have very watery eyes.</li>
            <li>I loved it thank you so much</li>
            <li>This is the easy way to use eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>more it goes on smoothly and is even a  easy clean up must have for anyone make up kit</li>
            <li>I find that this works best with a black eye liner (pencil) underneath and then use this one to help create the &amp;#34;sharp line&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Easy to use and leaves a fresh look for your eyes, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this it is perfect dries extremely fast on my skin and its easy to apply but the tip it stiff which I love makes putting the liner on easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>it was done so cheaply</li>
            <li>This product was not what I wanted and it did not go on smooth</li>
            <li>so i tried wetting the tip lightly and the tip fell off</li>
            <li>I got this thinking it would be perfect for my everyday out going 16 hours days.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>what you pay for, cheap price crappy stuff...period.</li>
            <li>This liquid eyeliner pencil is very black and creates perfect line.</li>
            <li>When I first got this I thought it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, it ended up being better then what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this amazing waterproof eyeliner that would create a nice, dark, precise line (like wiith a liquid liner) and allow me do wing tips on my eyes.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old loved the eyeliner so much because it was so easy for her to apply</li>
            <li>its hard to find the perfect eye liner..</li>
            <li>nice fine tip for extra smooth line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure when I will be able to get them at the great price.</li>
            <li>Regular eye liner from stores of any type do not work nearly as good as this.</li>
            <li>i love this so much.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a good product.</li>
            <li>With this I had to do it several times to just get it to work good.</li>
            <li>but I must let you know full results.</li>
            <li>Love this liquid eyeliner especially because it is in a pen form, easy too carry with, and easy too apply  Thankyou, jen</li>
            <li>The first 1/3 of the felt-tip brush is kind of soft, so feel really comfortable when applying it on the waterline.</li>
            <li>It runs out quick as well.</li>
            <li>This is a good product all together, yet it dried out after my 5th usage so I could have done better at the corner deli with the shipping price</li>
            <li>, thank you very much , I will come bake soon!</li>
            <li>This is amazing because most of the other eyeliners (both the drug store eyeliners and the brand name eyeliners)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap knockoff thing, firstly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for everyone, it is one of my favorite eyeliners so far.</li>
            <li>I do not remember the name but its worth the 8 bucks I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Its not really black, its more like pewter.</li>
            <li>Tried it for two days and it just didn&#x27;t work right for me.</li>
            <li>on it&#x27;s own, it won&#x27;t work, but if you use it on top of your regular eye liner, it has potential!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good for those people who like liners with hard tips !&lt;</li>
            <li>i was only able to get one good use out if it, after that it seemed to dry up and burned my eyes, is not waterproof!!!</li>
            <li>So good for design as well.rich black stay on tip..</li>
            <li>and it is so far good enough to keep.</li>
            <li>I think this product is same as its description, so l love it</li>
            <li>I only use it on my top lid, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well on the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>i wish i could get my money back on a better eyeliner</li>
            <li>She will be back to purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li>would been better to go to a local hair supply or walgreens/cvs store</li>
            <li>this is my first eyeliner pen.</li>
            <li>The product did not last more than one week.</li>
            <li>but it is something to be aware of</li>
            <li>but you get EXACTLY  </li>
            <li>In addition, it dries fast, so I can curl my eyelash right after I finish the eyeliner.</li>
            <li>use my first one 5 days ago and it dried up already, besides that it work very well, its a good thing</li>
            <li>it all day wear even in the scorching 100 degree florida heat which is hard to find buy it and itll last forever 5 stars at best !</li>
            <li>The initial use for the product I really liked it but literally after 3 uses it was completely out</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know before hand that it was going to make my eyes really swollen and hurt so much that blinking wasn&#x27;t fun at all.</li>
            <li>This is not a eye liner is pretty much a marker.</li>
            <li>It was ok for like the first 10 uses but after that the marker tip became very dry and non</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s very easy to use it.</li>
            <li>but mine was very black even when applied on top of my eye shadow!</li>
            <li>I can make a perfect winged and the tip is not to hard or rough.</li>
            <li>but it runs out to fast</li>
            <li>Also it shipped fast.</li>
            <li>in the picture see how&#x27;s so much make up is on her eye.....</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and evenly, cat eyes are made simply with this product.</li>
            <li>The product was really neat.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the product.</li>
            <li>i really wish it worked</li>
            <li>but thanks for efficient shipping</li>
            <li>after a whole day i have rubbed my eye and smeered it but seems to hold up otherwise.</li>
            <li>But it dries out too fast</li>
            <li>I ordered two of these one for myself and one for my daughter because the price was so reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I have several eyeliners and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>nice for everyday.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth, dark and very pretty.</li>
            <li>No need to pay $10-15 more to get other similar eyeliners just because we&#x27;re familiar with their brand.</li>
            <li>It works nicely and it last a long time</li>
            <li>it does not go on that smoothly as you would think a liquid liner does, however it does dry fast.</li>
            <li>but I do love the intensity of the black</li>
            <li>Should&#x27;ve been still a significant amount left in there just only after 10 uses exactly..</li>
            <li>no exactly what was described, but its an easy use.</li>
            <li>The older packing would rub off onto my hands but the new packing sold it for me.</li>
            <li>Right now I want my money back</li>
            <li>it was fine and all the next day it didnt work for me and the third day it dired up</li>
            <li>and it is brand new again.</li>
            <li>I love the way the product looks on me, its very dark and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>Last long and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I put it on this morning and 9 1/2 hours later still looks like it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>but I had to hold it up side down until the liquid filled into the point.</li>
            <li>It also is a  nice bold black color (as least on me).</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a big wow cause</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have bought these if I would have seen the amount of the shipping clearly up front.</li>
            <li>cause she also does professional make up...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes, and it had not once irritated them.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on things you see just because it looks cheap, people.</li>
            <li>WHEN I TRIED TO USE THE LINER, IT BARELY WORKED!!!  </li>
            <li>you can pair it with a gel black for intense look so pretty.</li>
            <li>downsides is the color is not completely dark.</li>
            <li>was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>African American and certain eyeliners don&#x27;t show up on my skin.</li>
            <li>Dried out really quickly.</li>
            <li>cause it&#x27;s hard for me to get a nice thick straight line</li>
            <li>and they either smudged, or flaked, or was just difficult to use and get the kind of results I got with this.</li>
            <li>Granted, it&#x27;s a fine tip, which helps in creating super thin lines, but it&#x27;s no where near dark enough</li>
            <li>thin enough to get that exotic cat eye..</li>
            <li>it worked okayish the first use, but then i had to throw it away because it dried out.</li>
            <li>First it scratches your top eyelid which is really painful</li>
            <li>It broke after a few uses!,ok when it lasted,a little cheap.</li>

            <li> i love this product</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It comes our nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I will probably order more, because I really love this liner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye liners and some I paid up to $20.00</li>
            <li> It works awesome on the top lashes, especially when doing a wing.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s my favorite part.</li>
            <li> I am able to apply after I put my falsies on.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I found a better waterproof eyeliner at the dollar store.  </li>
            <li> I used it when dressing someone as Cleopatra and it was so smoothly done, I was amazed!</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smudge, and stays more than 14 hours.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re also looking for a top quality eyeliner at an inexpensive price, buy this.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the packaging and how safe it was.</li>
            <li> i love the ease that i can apply the eyeliner and how versatile it is</li>
            <li> Therefore, i wasnt able to use it.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to my friends:)</li>
            <li> i love the way it makes my eyes look verry sexy.</li>
            <li> The felt on the tip started to come off on my eye as I put it on, and I was still able to smudge it, so it isn&#x27;t smudge proof</li>
            <li> Love the product and will order again.</li>
            <li> (or a zombie :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered two of these.</li>
            <li> I honestly really LOVE how this eye liner looks when on my eyes</li>
            <li> I used it to draw and it comes out as a better marker.</li>
            <li> I could have used a marker or sharpie and would have gotten better lines.</li>
            <li> this was great easy to make a straight line with this...</li>
            <li> They sent it on time and in a short amount of time and when i used the product it was amazing:) great quality</li>
            <li> Loved it for the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> and I LOVE how easy it is to put on.</li>
            <li> I love the precise line you can create with the tip.</li>
            <li> good product for me since I have very watery eyes.</li>
            <li> I loved it thank you so much</li>
            <li> This is the easy way to use eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> more it goes on smoothly and is even a  easy clean up must have for anyone make up kit</li>
            <li> I find that this works best with a black eye liner (pencil) underneath and then use this one to help create the &amp;#34;sharp line&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Easy to use and leaves a fresh look for your eyes, I love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this it is perfect dries extremely fast on my skin and its easy to apply but the tip it stiff which I love makes putting the liner on easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> it was done so cheaply</li>
            <li> This product was not what I wanted and it did not go on smooth</li>
            <li> so i tried wetting the tip lightly and the tip fell off</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would be perfect for my everyday out going 16 hours days.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> what you pay for, cheap price crappy stuff...period.</li>
            <li> This liquid eyeliner pencil is very black and creates perfect line.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I thought it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, it ended up being better then what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this amazing waterproof eyeliner that would create a nice, dark, precise line (like wiith a liquid liner) and allow me do wing tips on my eyes.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old loved the eyeliner so much because it was so easy for her to apply</li>
            <li> its hard to find the perfect eye liner..</li>
            <li> nice fine tip for extra smooth line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure when I will be able to get them at the great price.</li>
            <li> Regular eye liner from stores of any type do not work nearly as good as this.</li>
            <li> i love this so much.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a good product.</li>
            <li> With this I had to do it several times to just get it to work good.</li>
            <li> but I must let you know full results.</li>
            <li> Love this liquid eyeliner especially because it is in a pen form, easy too carry with, and easy too apply  Thankyou, jen</li>
            <li> The first 1/3 of the felt-tip brush is kind of soft, so feel really comfortable when applying it on the waterline.</li>
            <li> It runs out quick as well.</li>
            <li> This is a good product all together, yet it dried out after my 5th usage so I could have done better at the corner deli with the shipping price</li>
            <li> , thank you very much , I will come bake soon!</li>
            <li> This is amazing because most of the other eyeliners (both the drug store eyeliners and the brand name eyeliners)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap knockoff thing, firstly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for everyone, it is one of my favorite eyeliners so far.</li>
            <li> I do not remember the name but its worth the 8 bucks I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Its not really black, its more like pewter.</li>
            <li> Tried it for two days and it just didn&#x27;t work right for me.</li>
            <li> on it&#x27;s own, it won&#x27;t work, but if you use it on top of your regular eye liner, it has potential!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good for those people who like liners with hard tips !&lt;</li>
            <li> i was only able to get one good use out if it, after that it seemed to dry up and burned my eyes, is not waterproof!!!</li>
            <li> So good for design as well.rich black stay on tip..</li>
            <li> and it is so far good enough to keep.</li>
            <li> I think this product is same as its description, so l love it</li>
            <li> I only use it on my top lid, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well on the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> i wish i could get my money back on a better eyeliner</li>
            <li> She will be back to purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li> would been better to go to a local hair supply or walgreens/cvs store</li>
            <li> this is my first eyeliner pen.</li>
            <li> The product did not last more than one week.</li>
            <li> but it is something to be aware of</li>
            <li> but you get EXACTLY  </li>
            <li> In addition, it dries fast, so I can curl my eyelash right after I finish the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> use my first one 5 days ago and it dried up already, besides that it work very well, its a good thing</li>
            <li> it all day wear even in the scorching 100 degree florida heat which is hard to find buy it and itll last forever 5 stars at best !</li>
            <li> The initial use for the product I really liked it but literally after 3 uses it was completely out</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know before hand that it was going to make my eyes really swollen and hurt so much that blinking wasn&#x27;t fun at all.</li>
            <li> This is not a eye liner is pretty much a marker.</li>
            <li> It was ok for like the first 10 uses but after that the marker tip became very dry and non</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s very easy to use it.</li>
            <li> but mine was very black even when applied on top of my eye shadow!</li>
            <li> I can make a perfect winged and the tip is not to hard or rough.</li>
            <li> but it runs out to fast</li>
            <li> Also it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> in the picture see how&#x27;s so much make up is on her eye.....</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and evenly, cat eyes are made simply with this product.</li>
            <li> The product was really neat.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the product.</li>
            <li> i really wish it worked</li>
            <li> but thanks for efficient shipping</li>
            <li> after a whole day i have rubbed my eye and smeered it but seems to hold up otherwise.</li>
            <li> But it dries out too fast</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these one for myself and one for my daughter because the price was so reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I have several eyeliners and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> nice for everyday.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth, dark and very pretty.</li>
            <li> No need to pay $10-15 more to get other similar eyeliners just because we&#x27;re familiar with their brand.</li>
            <li> It works nicely and it last a long time</li>
            <li> it does not go on that smoothly as you would think a liquid liner does, however it does dry fast.</li>
            <li> but I do love the intensity of the black</li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve been still a significant amount left in there just only after 10 uses exactly..</li>
            <li> no exactly what was described, but its an easy use.</li>
            <li> The older packing would rub off onto my hands but the new packing sold it for me.</li>
            <li> Right now I want my money back</li>
            <li> it was fine and all the next day it didnt work for me and the third day it dired up</li>
            <li> and it is brand new again.</li>
            <li> I love the way the product looks on me, its very dark and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Last long and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I put it on this morning and 9 1/2 hours later still looks like it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> but I had to hold it up side down until the liquid filled into the point.</li>
            <li> It also is a  nice bold black color (as least on me).</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a big wow cause</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have bought these if I would have seen the amount of the shipping clearly up front.</li>
            <li> cause she also does professional make up...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes, and it had not once irritated them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on things you see just because it looks cheap, people.</li>
            <li> WHEN I TRIED TO USE THE LINER, IT BARELY WORKED!!!  </li>
            <li> you can pair it with a gel black for intense look so pretty.</li>
            <li> downsides is the color is not completely dark.</li>
            <li> was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> African American and certain eyeliners don&#x27;t show up on my skin.</li>
            <li> Dried out really quickly.</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s hard for me to get a nice thick straight line</li>
            <li> and they either smudged, or flaked, or was just difficult to use and get the kind of results I got with this.</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s a fine tip, which helps in creating super thin lines, but it&#x27;s no where near dark enough</li>
            <li> thin enough to get that exotic cat eye..</li>
            <li> it worked okayish the first use, but then i had to throw it away because it dried out.</li>
            <li> First it scratches your top eyelid which is really painful</li>
            <li> It broke after a few uses!,ok when it lasted,a little cheap.</li>
            <li> I barely got to use this product 2 or 3 times before it dried up completely.</li>
            <li> it does&#x27;t last too long....</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t las long at all...literally lasted for only 5 applications...</li>
            <li> not great, but not bad</li>
            <li> This would have gotten 5 starts IF it didn&#x27;t dry out after the third time I used it.</li>
            <li> and this item I use it once abd when I tried to use it the second time it was dry</li>
            <li> The tip of the eye liner is sturdy so it makes making a cat eye as simple as possible since it doesn&#x27;t move around like other liquid eyeliner does.</li>
            <li> but truth is I find it hard to work with because it&#x27;s very at times.</li>
            <li> The ink was dried out and completely unusable.</li>
            <li> , I had to wet the tip ten</li>
            <li> Makes precise lines, thick or small.</li>
            <li> Then when I put it on it was so watery and took a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Ive used it about 6 times now and its beginning to get slightly dry.</li>
            <li> then it started to dry out.but</li>
            <li> Just wish it didn&#x27;t dry out so soon.</li>
            <li> It was dry before I opened it.</li>
            <li> Great price but horrible.</li>
            <li> I use only few time after that is dry.can&#x27;t use anymore.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to wet a brush to moisten a cake of liner and you don&#x27;t have to redip your brush in cake liner.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden it dried up and couldn&#x27;t use anymore.</li>
            <li> Also when i tried it, it was already dried, i only used it once</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> too wet...</li>
            <li> But a couple of days later it was already dried out.</li>
            <li> Often, the tip gets kinda dry while using it, even if it&#x27;s pointing down.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do a wing as well with any of my other eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you love being disappointed.</li>
            <li> Look for other options.</li>
            <li> I will now see what happens due to the burning and I will update using this product a while.</li>
            <li> the product itself is not very good, I was going for the price point and also the design of the stiff brush compared to other eyeliners with soft brush.</li>
            <li> the tip came out dry and it was not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> if it is only one thing of eyeliner then we should pay for at least 2.50.</li>
            <li> its not worth it at all</li>
            <li> It was not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> and they were dark.</li>
            <li> Not worth your 5 dollars and change.</li>
            <li> This is a thin blackish grey pen that you have to put water on the tip of to get it even relativity solid black.</li>
            <li> then it comes out grayish on your eye and now a dark black cat eye as you hope.</li>
            <li> I saw others say it wasn&#x27;t black</li>
            <li> If your not afraid to get your hands dirty then pull out the felt brush and flip it over, the rest (if not most) of the product should be in there.</li>
            <li> but I do get a little fading by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It was not worth it.!</li>
            <li> it was very dry going on and kinda hard to work with</li>
            <li> The eyeliner was dried out and I couldn&#x27;t even use it</li>
            <li> Product easily dried up when used.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m using a dried up marker when applying to my eyes.</li>
            <li> anymore dont waste ur money</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> It was dried out.</li>
            <li> The brush wasn&#x27;t dried at all.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it, when i opened it up to use it, the makeup was dried up</li>
            <li> It dried up.</li>
            <li> dead buy the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> When I received this item, it was dried out.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look brownish but it is very black and pigmented.</li>
            <li> Yes i close the cap very tight</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes this eyeliner is practically useless to anyone who likes to do eye makeup even similar to the picture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it is just me who is allergic to this</li>
            <li> I usually get the FAT marker by some company.</li>
            <li> It has a hard tip that scratches your eyelid.</li>
            <li> and is hard to put on.</li>
            <li> it sucks</li>
            <li> This products sucks.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!!</li>
            <li> Crap, it started to fade away after ten minutes, and wad not black, just dark gray &amp;#62;:( bottom line don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> Bad quality, only use once then cannot use.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this eyeliner to my worst enemy to make them waste money.</li>
            <li> but the liner liquid is of poor quality, smears a lot.</li>
            <li> Sorry to have put 1 star.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> It does smudge and it also burns as if I put pepper spray on my eyes so sad</li>
            <li> no more bad liner!!</li>
            <li> This is so stupid.</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.  </li>
            <li> and it did not work was very disappointed though.</li>
            <li> Worst eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Cruel</li>
            <li> This was so horrible.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner however is the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried on.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Often, the tip gets kinda dry while using it, even if it&#x27;s pointing down. Other than that, it&#x27;s very easy to use it.</li>
            <li> Makes precise lines, thick or small. Ive used it about 6 times now and its beginning to get slightly dry. But it still gets the job done. All around, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> loved it, does not irate looks awesome, i recommend it and its a good price.  I got it on time.</li>
            <li> Dried out really quickly.</li>
            <li> It good but it runs out to fast</li>
            <li> Crap, it started to fade away after ten minutes, and wad not black, just dark gray &amp;#62;:( bottom line don&#x27;t get it</li>

            <li> I received my eye liner today and used it only moments ago. The precision is wonderful. Regular eye liner from stores of any type do not work nearly as good as this. I&#x27;m very happy with it and I will order it again soon.</li>
            <li> hello vicky this is jasmine. I am here to tell you that I paid 4.50 for one thing of eyeliner. if it is only one thing of eyeliner then we should pay for at least 2.50.</li>
            <li> SatisfI&#x27;d  with the product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter.</li>
            <li> It literally did not work at all.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner was dried out and I couldn&#x27;t even use it (hence the reason why I answered &amp;#34;lighter than expected&amp;#34; to the question &amp;#34;How is the color?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Wearing eyeliner is new to me,but this liquid is the best...it makes lining the eye so simple..i love this product</li>
            <li> Product easily dried up when used. I feel like I&#x27;m using a dried up marker when applying to my eyes. Totally do NOT suggest it! Do not buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> i love this so much. its hard to find the perfect eye liner..this is it! thin enough to get that exotic cat eye..yet i can layer it for the thicker night out look too.</li>
            <li> it does&#x27;t last too long....</li>
            <li> Loved it. Just received it and it works amazing. I am African American and certain eyeliners don&#x27;t show up on my skin. I can make a perfect winged and the tip is not to hard or rough. I would recommend this for everyone, it is one of my favorite eyeliners so far.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!! It is very cheap and very good, I haven&#x27;t had a problem with smudging but I do get a little fading by the end of the day. If your not afraid to get your hands dirty then pull out the felt brush and flip it over, the rest (if not most) of the product should be in there. The older packing would rub off onto my hands but the new packing sold it for me.</li>
            <li> Pertfect flawless easy just glides on! So good for design as well.rich black stay on tip.. you can pair it with a gel black for intense look so pretty.</li>
            <li> I love it..gets the job done.I wilk deff recomend it.order came so fast.easy use perfect for cat eye liner. ...</li>
            <li> The application was amazing, but not hypoallergenic. I broke out after 4 hours with itchy , swollen eyes. If you leave your eye makeup on overnight, it cakes and flakes, and needs to be re-applied . I love the applicator tip as it was very easy to apply however.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It stays in place without smearing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, because I wanted a liner that came out like a cake liner. This is the one. You don&#x27;t have to wet a brush to moisten a cake of liner and you don&#x27;t have to redip your brush in cake liner. This does it. Its great and easy to use. It comes our nice and smooth. I will probably order more, because I really love this liner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye liners and some I paid up to $20.00 and they either smudged, or flaked, or was just difficult to use and get the kind of results I got with this. I recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Loved it for the first 2 weeks then it started to dry out.but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a big wow cause hey u can&#x27;t beat that price</li>
            <li> This is a thin blackish grey pen that you have to put water on the tip of to get it even relativity solid black. It has a hard tip that scratches your eyelid. It is not the best</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this it is perfect dries extremely fast on my skin and its easy to apply but the tip it stiff which I love makes putting the liner on easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Sorry to have put 1 star. I would like to give my opinion on how the product is, but I can&#x27;t.....I never got this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have several eyeliners and this is by far my favorite. I only use it on my top lid, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well on the bottom lashes. It works awesome on the top lashes, especially when doing a wing. I can&#x27;t do a wing as well with any of my other eyeliner. It doesn&#x27;t smear at all and that&#x27;s my favorite part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used mine once but I love it! I saw others say it wasn&#x27;t black but mine was very black even when applied on top of my eye shadow! I only gave it 4 stars cause it&#x27;s hard for me to get a nice thick straight line but if I was more coordinated it would be amazing!</li>
            <li> The initial use for the product I really liked it but literally after 3 uses it was completely out it was done so cheaply I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes this eyeliner is practically useless to anyone who likes to do eye makeup even similar to the picture. I would only recommend this eyeliner to my worst enemy to make them waste money.</li>
            <li> I am able to apply after I put my falsies on.</li>
            <li> Tried it for two days and it just didn&#x27;t work right for me. All of a sudden it dried up and couldn&#x27;t use anymore. So sad.</li>
            <li> I used this product once already, I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Only downsides is the color is not completely dark. Also drys quickly.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s very good for those people who like liners with hard tips !&lt;br /&gt;Like a marker tip !&lt;br /&gt;I like the applying marker.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I thought it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, it ended up being better then what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the easy way to use eyeliner. Its like a pen but it doesn&#x27;t hurt, pull, or tug at your eyes. I am also going to do a review on this product on YouTube soon, since like i said on the gel eyeliner review, there are no videos about it. The picture makes it look brownish but it is very black and pigmented. I love this product. Also it shipped fast. I got it in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I wanted and it did not go on smooth it was all gross and clumpy and smudged on your face I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS</li>
            <li> i was only able to get one good use out if it, after that it seemed to dry up and burned my eyes, is not waterproof!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my girlfriend as part of her bday gift and now she only wnats this brand she loves it cause she also does professional make up...so another great product</li>
            <li> this came to me as a pen.....wasn&#x27;t in a package or anything......in the picture see how&#x27;s so much make up is on her eye.....well its a lie you can only get one eye like that</li>
            <li> this product met its expectations.  lasted all day without smudge or fading. good product for me since I have very watery eyes.</li>
            <li> i bought this thinking it would help me speed up my make up and well once i got it it was fine and all the next day it didnt work for me and the third day it dired up and it wont even mark anymore dont waste ur money its not worth it at all i wish i could get my money back on a better eyeliner</li>
            <li> Love the product. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Worst eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had. The ink was dried out and completely unusable.Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you love being disappointed.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! I order 5 at a time so I do not run out!! It is perfect for a clear line!</li>
            <li> This would have gotten 5 starts IF it didn&#x27;t dry out after the third time I used it. Simple fix though just dip it in a bit water and shake it and it is brand new again. The tip of the eye liner is sturdy so it makes making a cat eye as simple as possible since it doesn&#x27;t move around like other liquid eyeliner does. Just wish it didn&#x27;t dry out so soon.</li>
            <li> Great eye liner stays on tell you wash it off</li>
            <li> It does not rub off or smear or smudge. It lasts all day. I have sensitive eyes, and it had not once irritated them.</li>
            <li> If I could give a no star I would but I have to and this item I use it once abd when I tried to use it the second time it was dry it sucks</li>
            <li> What a waste. I found a better waterproof eyeliner at the dollar store.  Please Don&#x27;t wast your money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> not great, but not bad don&#x27;t get it in your eyes because it burns</li>
            <li> it all day wear even in the scorching 100 degree florida heat which is hard to find buy it and itll last forever 5 stars at best !</li>
            <li> When i received this eyeliner, it was nothing like the picture, shown here. Also when i tried it, it was already dried, i only used it once and it ran out. I don&#x27;t recommend it. Look for other options.</li>
            <li> It works nicely and it last a long time</li>
            <li> It doesnt work. Just uses one time and vanished. Cruel</li>
            <li> I was expecting the 5 eyeliners not 1. I went to use it after i got it and it did not work so i tried wetting the tip lightly and the tip fell off i was devastated. I do not reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> It dried out to fast after  5 use</li>
            <li> Amazing works&lt;br /&gt;Great!!</li>
            <li> I got this today and tried it on.! And i love how it is very easy to use. But its not waterproof at all. And it does smear..  I would not buy this again.. It runs out quick as well.</li>
            <li> This precision liquid eyeliner makes it easy to make perfect lines on your eyes! It goes on so smoothly and evenly, cat eyes are made simply with this product. I used it when dressing someone as Cleopatra and it was so smoothly done, I was amazed!</li>
            <li> This liquid eyeliner pencil is very black and creates perfect line. The first 1/3 of the felt-tip brush is kind of soft, so feel really comfortable when applying it on the waterline. In addition, it dries fast, so I can curl my eyelash right after I finish the eyeliner. This is amazing because most of the other eyeliners (both the drug store eyeliners and the brand name eyeliners) I tried before get off after I curl my eyelash, and I had to re-apply the eyeliner after that. It also doesn&#x27;t smudge, and stays more than 14 hours. I&#x27;m really happy that I find this product. If you&#x27;re also looking for a top quality eyeliner at an inexpensive price, buy this. No need to pay $10-15 more to get other similar eyeliners just because we&#x27;re familiar with their brand. Will definitely recommend this to my friends!</li>
            <li> This was a order for my daughter she really loved it. She will be back to purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li> It broke after a few uses!,ok when it lasted,a little cheap.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the packaging and how safe it was. The product itself is a great product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price but horrible. It was dried out. I was so dissapointed. Never again will I order this!! It got here in 2 days as well</li>
            <li> This is not a eye liner is pretty much a marker. the tip came out dry and it was not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> Bad quality, only use once then cannot use.</li>
            <li> use my first one 5 days ago and it dried up already, besides that it work very well, its a good thing I both 3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve still never received this... LOL, I think I&#x27;ve banged on people about this before. This was so horrible. It&#x27;s a cheap knockoff thing, firstly. Don&#x27;t waste your money on things you see just because it looks cheap, people. K? K. Bye.</li>
            <li> it does not go on that smoothly as you would think a liquid liner does, however it does dry fast.</li>
            <li> was exactly what i expected. i love the ease that i can apply the eyeliner and how versatile it is</li>
            <li> It was not worth it.!</li>
            <li> So I loved the product but it didn&#x27;t las long at all...literally lasted for only 5 applications...so overall I wil not purchase it again</li>
            <li> The product was really neat. Easy to use. The brush wasn&#x27;t dried at all. But it wasn&#x27;t waterproof. Overall it was a good product.</li>
            <li> I brought this hoping I would get something that would be great to use for a smokey eye or something. I thought it would go on like a sharpie or something but I had to hold it up side down until the liquid filled into the point. Then when I put it on it was so watery and took a long time to dry. But I guess this was a lesson learned....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the product. I was told that this would be easier than my pencil but its not. My pencil works the 1st time. With this I had to do it several times to just get it to work good. Its not really black, its more like pewter.</li>
            <li> I love this because the design of the pen makes application a breeze! Very easy to manage. This is perfect for all you gals wanting to try the lastest liner trends.</li>
            <li> Love this liquid eyeliner especially because it is in a pen form, easy too carry with, and easy too apply  Thankyou, jen</li>
            <li> it goes on great and looks awesome for the first hour or so, then look in the mirror and its now in your eye lid crease! no exactly what was described, but its an easy use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and leaves a fresh look for your eyes, I love this product. Makes it easier to put my make-up on.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it, when i opened it up to use it, the makeup was dried up so i never got to use it.</li>
            <li> Not water proof for me and to me it was very dry going on and kinda hard to work with Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would be perfect for my everyday out going 16 hours days. That was not the case at all it watery when I put it on and come off almost instantly.</li>
            <li> WHEN I TRIED TO USE THE LINER, IT BARELY WORKED!!!  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I WOULDNT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO MY FRIENDS.</li>
            <li> i tried using this once or twice and it did not work was very disappointed though. It was advertise so great</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It was dry before I opened it. Therefore, i wasnt able to use it.Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> They sent it on time and in a short amount of time and when i used the product it was amazing:) great quality and I would recommend it to my friends:)</li>
            <li> its not the greatest out there. it worked okayish the first use, but then i had to throw it away because it dried out. maybe i could of just gotten abad one but i dont know. i really wish it worked because now i haveno eyeliner. ):</li>
            <li> I barely got to use this product 2 or 3 times before it dried up completely. Next time I&#x27;ll stick to buying make up products at the store</li>
            <li> too wet...the chemicals irritate my eyes and it dries as soon as you take the cap off. would been better to go to a local hair supply or walgreens/cvs store</li>
            <li> the product itself is not very good, I was going for the price point and also the design of the stiff brush compared to other eyeliners with soft brush. but the liner liquid is of poor quality, smears a lot. but thanks for efficient shipping</li>
            <li> but truth is I find it hard to work with because it&#x27;s very at times. but I do love the intensity of the black</li>
            <li> Its definitely a liquid eye liner  marker and it is so far good enough to keep. It smudged o n my daughter, yet it didn&#x27;t smudge on my niece so I am at a stand still until I try it out on myself. I bought 20 items at $0.99 each and the shipping was $90.00 so that was tricky when the weight wasn&#x27;t over a pound. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought these if I would have seen the amount of the shipping clearly up front. So I look at it as costing  $ 11.00 per item and if it doesn&#x27;t last thru the night I will never purchase from this company again. Upate ~&gt; It does smudge and it also burns as if I put pepper spray on my eyes so sad I will now see what happens due to the burning and I will update using this product a while. Right now I want my money back but I must let you know full results. Last up date...This is a good product all together, yet it dried out after my 5th usage so I could have done better at the corner deli with the shipping price</li>
            <li> this is my first eyeliner pen. it seems to be a good product. after a whole day i have rubbed my eye and smeered it but seems to hold up otherwise.</li>
            <li> Very nice liked these</li>
            <li> I use it as a touch up during the day to freshen up my eyes. Last long and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner goes on smooth.  I am happy with this and the way it goes on.  Would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> This one is nice becouse it doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in your eyes and this is verry key. i love the way it makes my eyes look verry sexy.</li>
            <li> The product did not last more than one week. It dried up. I only had the chance to use it once, and even then it wasnt working properly. It was not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This products sucks. Its literally a freaking marker. Like a paper marker not like a makeup marker. This is so stupid. Ppl save ur one penny. Trust me!!!!!</li>
            <li> this was great easy to make a straight line with this... no more bad liner!!</li>
            <li> The felt on the tip started to come off on my eye as I put it on, and I was still able to smudge it, so it isn&#x27;t smudge proof</li>
            <li> Writes perfect love it</li>
            <li> It was so pretty and great but ran out within two days and i used it twice. Yes i close the cap very tight</li>
            <li> I really loved it. It was a very good purchase. Very easy to use. I Would recommend buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love the product and will order again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> IT dont even work that good !NOT BUYING AGAIN IF YOU ASK ME&lt;br /&gt;O THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE GOOD ! BUT NOT</li>
            <li> It smudges in about 5 mins. and is hard to put on. It sucks. It looks like you&#x27;re dead buy the end of the day.  (or a zombie :)</li>
            <li> I love the way the product looks on me, its very dark and lasts all day! I am a Very happy customer!</li>
            <li> For some one on the go all the time a girl doesn&#x27;t have time to keep checking her eyes for smudged smearing wearing eyeliner I tell you it&#x27;s awesome glides right on</li>
            <li> It was great to start off with. Very precise lines and they were dark. But a couple of days later it was already dried out.</li>
            <li> When sweat, I like to know that my liner isn&#x27;t sweating with me.</li>
            <li> I love the precise line you can create with the tip. But it dries out too fast</li>
            <li> for the price this is an amazing buy wont more it goes on smoothly and is even a  easy clean up must have for anyone make up kit</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth, dark and very pretty. I&#x27;m glad I ordered two of these. I can see myself ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I loved it thank you so much</li>
            <li> I honestly really LOVE how this eye liner looks when on my eyes and I LOVE how easy it is to put on. BUT! I didn&#x27;t know before hand that it was going to make my eyes really swollen and hurt so much that blinking wasn&#x27;t fun at all. I&#x27;m not sure it is just me who is allergic to this but it is something to be aware of before you buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id say just email the seller and ask for what is in this. (Thats what I have just done)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again if youre NOT allergic to this it looks and goes on great. It stays on great too.</li>
            <li> I usually get the FAT marker by some company. I do not remember the name but its worth the 8 bucks I paid for it. This eyeliner however is the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried on. It doesnt work well what so ever. I used it to draw and it comes out as a better marker. First it scratches your top eyelid which is really painful then it comes out grayish on your eye and now a dark black cat eye as you hope. Would not recommend to anyone and I usually love to write good reviews. Not worth your 5 dollars and change.</li>
            <li> It was ok for like the first 10 uses but after that the marker tip became very dry and non was coming out at all, I had to wet the tip ten sit it up.... Should&#x27;ve been still a significant amount left in there just only after 10 uses exactly..but you get EXACTLY  what you pay for, cheap price crappy stuff...period.</li>
            <li> nice fine tip for extra smooth line. It also is a  nice bold black color (as least on me). nice for everyday. I put it on this morning and 9 1/2 hours later still looks like it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this amazing waterproof eyeliner that would create a nice, dark, precise line (like wiith a liquid liner) and allow me do wing tips on my eyes. What I got was a marker. Granted, it&#x27;s a fine tip, which helps in creating super thin lines, but it&#x27;s no where near dark enough and I find myself having to go over the same area two and three times. That of course leaves plenty of room for error!. I find that this works best with a black eye liner (pencil) underneath and then use this one to help create the &amp;#34;sharp line&amp;#34; effect. on it&#x27;s own, it won&#x27;t work, but if you use it on top of your regular eye liner, it has potential!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these one for myself and one for my daughter because the price was so reasonable.  My 15 year old loved the eyeliner so much because it was so easy for her to apply I ended up letting her have both of them b/c I&#x27;m not sure when I will be able to get them at the great price.</li>
            <li> When I received this item, it was dried out. I could have used a marker or sharpie and would have gotten better lines.</li>
    </ol>
