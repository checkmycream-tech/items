    <ol>
            <li>but this is great for me!!!</li>
            <li>I am SO happy with these products!</li>
            <li>Great results!</li>
            <li>Great beauty brand!</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think the product is that magnificent.  </li>
            <li>I’m happy to say that this anti-aging eye serum has worked wonders for me!</li>
            <li>They are Amazing!!!</li>
            <li>It was great!  </li>
            <li>The Orogold Anti-Aging Eye Serum is the best eye serum that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It was simply superb.</li>
            <li>In OROGOLD and Forever Flawless it&#x27;s a scam.</li>
            <li>However, the best part is the way my skin looked today morning.</li>
            <li>Already, the difference is incredible.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>The salesman then began to tell me how beautiful I was</li>
            <li>Beautiful packaging, beautiful promises that do not yield beautiful results.</li>
            <li>It looked so beautiful.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, the product worked great, i could tell a difference in her wrinkles just from the sample she used at the store.  </li>
            <li>(the Peel is great, I feel like everytime</li>
            <li>I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS .</li>
            <li>But, I have a friend who got suckered into purchasing some of their products and she was actually happy about it.</li>
            <li>Happy wife happy life</li>
            <li>They work great.</li>
            <li>There are great products out there</li>
            <li>It’s one of the most wonderful emollients I’ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I’m thrilled with the effects of this serum!</li>
            <li>The serum is perfect “from top to toe”.</li>
            <li>He told me that I have beautiful skin and looked very sophisticated</li>
            <li>I never heard of this product before and the lady told me how good gold was found to be used for our skin, yada yada.</li>
            <li>I know that we guys have it easier when it comes to skin care, but no harm in trying to look good, is there?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how good Oro Gold products might be, anyone that uses sales tactics like these is not going to get my business.</li>
            <li>Good Luck.</li>
            <li>and yes it did look good</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am delighted to have found Orogold Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Talking about the product, I have nothing but good things to say.</li>
            <li>Love this and all oro good products!</li>
            <li>I am so happy with how effective the product has been and the kind of changes it has brought for my skin.</li>
            <li>OK, she made us pay through the teeth, but the stuff is great, I tell ya!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I was very glad to discover that I could use this serum without worrying about the fact that the serum would cause dermal irritation.</li>
            <li>, however SHE LOOKED MORE LIKE 45!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>, I received the email where the company asked me if I was satisfied with its product!</li>
            <li>OK, I admit that I did buy the products in the store, and yes the prices were outrages!  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!!!</li>
            <li>This product has been really amazing for my eye area.</li>
            <li>you have a great product, why do you need to lure people in with a cheap &amp;#34;free sample trick&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>and he wanted to show me an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I have to thank Orogold Cosmetics for this amazing eye serum</li>
            <li>I really liked to products from Orogold – their golf face mask and the anti-aging eye cream.</li>
            <li>Well, I think I really liked the moisturizer that they offered and since I already had a moisturizer, I preferred something for the eye area</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that they offered a gold certificate along with the product.</li>
            <li>One product that I found to be really effective was the Orogold 24K Anti-Aging Eye Serum.</li>
            <li>I liked that.</li>
            <li>and I really liked all their products.</li>
            <li>I also liked the way OROGOLD packages its products.</li>
            <li>I love the products from R&amp;F and although he was quite nice and charming...</li>
            <li>I really don’t have words to describe how wonderful these products are.</li>
            <li>It’s super light and perfectly soaks into the skin.</li>
            <li>My mother had bought this from a place at the mall and really liked it and said she wanted more for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>But I feel SO much better than the guilt for wasting money and then thinking well it will look nice on the bathroom shelf.</li>
            <li>This serum is by far the best serum I have applied in the eye area.</li>
            <li>I was tired but happy from our successful hunt for the perfect dress</li>
            <li>I have forgotten about the fine lines and sun spots!</li>
            <li>A great product for anyone suffering from the signs of aging or for anyone wanting to make their skin look special before a special event.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is I can tell a HUGE difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>and she said well if u did...which one would you use the most.</li>
            <li>Sooo glad I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>so I could behold the magical transformation.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 6 weeks, along with the eye cream, and, truthfully</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other people seem to have better results.</li>
            <li>Love this eye serum....</li>
            <li>I know all cosmetics don&#x27;t work on everyone as I am allergic to many</li>
            <li>I love orogold  24k</li>
            <li>More the days pass better are the results.</li>
            <li>I have opted for this serum because my wife always uses Orogold products and she is completely satisfied with this beauty brand.</li>
            <li>However....I do love the products.</li>
            <li>they are now more pronounced.</li>
            <li>I paid a lot more for this than what is advertised on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but how she would give me a sample of an eye cream that would be so much better for my puffy eyes and wrinkles</li>
            <li>and I wanted to wait a day to make sure that I did not have a skin reaction.</li>
            <li>Save the 40 minutes or more of your life and go purchase your skin care products elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I know through my personal experience that this anti-aging serum is awesome!</li>
            <li>However, nothing matters more than the results of this product.</li>
            <li>I can say for sure that this serum has improved the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>However, the most important thing about this serum is that it has reduced the puffiness under my eyes!</li>
            <li>Glad I found them affordable here because I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to keep buying them.     </li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>Bought many Orogold products from their Dallas Galleria Store that totalled $4,000.00 plus.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I made my escape and did not buy any of their products.  </li>
            <li>and I was immediately in love with their products.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you purchase them online.</li>
            <li>I love the products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best was when he finally announced the price for two eye products was $248 and tried to act like I was an unreasonable cheapskate when I balked.  </li>
            <li>And I must say that for once I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay attention to those reviews.</li>
            <li>believe that my perfect complexion is thanks to the Orogold skin care products and this an-aging eye serum, in particular, which I have been using for more than 3 years!</li>
            <li>Lines were becoming more prominent.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind one can win a few battles on aging but Mother Nature will win the war.</li>
            <li>He continued to tell me how lovely I was and that this product was going to erase those fine lines.  </li>
            <li>This product makes your eye area look much more beautiful and younger and gives it a refreshed and rejuvenated look.</li>
            <li>They offer you a beautiful gold colored box that contains these products along with a certificate which proves that the product uses real gold.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most amazing serums I&#x27;ve tried, you see results immediately and if you keep using it the texture of your skin will be smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li>Be strong and don&#x27;t wilt to pressure.  </li>
            <li>Both products left my skin looking beautiful.</li>
            <li>my body decided it&#x27;s had enough time being beautiful and that not it&#x27;s time to take care of myself.</li>
            <li>It actually looked beautiful.</li>
            <li>Watch your eyes brighten and fine lines disapear immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 with fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>The eye serum has literally erased all the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>it was worth more than the scrub itself...    </li>
            <li>It makes the skin on my eyes look really smooth</li>
            <li>This anti-aging Eye Serum is so fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was just dragged into an orogold store by a woman who gave me a free sample and asked what I use.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product after stopping to take a free sample in the mall.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I did not buy this product.</li>
            <li>my skin looks smooth.</li>
            <li>The thing about this serum is that you just need a couple of drops in each application to make your eye area look smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>The free sample that they offered had a moisturizer of some sorts which I happened to use during the trip itself.</li>
            <li>the free sample came in a pouch.</li>
            <li>But I found that gold has no benefits and can actually cause more harm to our skin than good.</li>
            <li>now I order it from Amazon and am much happier paying a third of the price for 100% great results!</li>
            <li>Like everyone else, I was waylaid by the charming young kiosk guy in the mall.</li>
            <li>and I said, very kindly, that the lemon juice is a lot cheaper and left.</li>
            <li>At first I would just walk by but after some practice I became able to get the free sample and then say no.</li>
            <li>Nice , price is high</li>
            <li>We saw a significant improvement on my sister&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>Maybe, the person serving me was new, because she was really nice.</li>
            <li>but he could improve my looks with his special eye serum.</li>
            <li>However, I must take out the Anti-Aging Eye Serum for special mention because of its lightweight non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>That sample turned out not to be free -- I was detained for 40 minutes while a sales person gave the most high pressure sales pitch I&#x27;ve ever endured.</li>
            <li>Wonder if it was the true product or a copy.</li>
            <li>I have never been the type of guy to obsess about my skin, but I have really fallen in love with the Orogold Anti-Aging Eye Serum.</li>
            <li>Perhaps they might do some good on a younger skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, I slept well, but nothing could define how cool my eye area looked.</li>
            <li>The regional manager came out, and he just kept on rambling about how ignorant the scams were on amazon and how their products were the best in the market despite of all the negative reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li>IF YOU DO BUY, ANNOY THEM TO GIVE YOU A FULL REFUND.</li>
            <li>I was ready to leave when he wanted to address my neck wrinkles and that he needed just 5 more minutes of my time.  </li>
            <li>Overall I see no harm done in my case but nothing good or any improvements either.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this item at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and used it faithfully.</li>
            <li>After only two weeks of using the product I am in LOVE and would gladly pay that amount again &amp; again.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon as always for the quick response.  </li>
            <li>and she spoke so quickly you do feel ambushed</li>
            <li>She guessed my age -- a bit on the high end -- and then told me how much better I&#x27;d look if I started to take care of my skin with her products.  </li>
            <li>We had fun with our sales associate, she was fun and friendly.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliation cream has greatly reduced all redness and dark marks on my checks.  </li>
            <li>I don’t know if it was the moisturizer or the fact that I was super excited to be in Vegas, but my skin really began to glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>The power of suggestion is HUGE because I looked at my eyes after she had applied the product to one side and really thought that I could see a difference.  </li>
            <li>She said I couldn&#x27;t just get the scrub without the body butter to go along with it and said it would be complimentary...</li>
            <li>Until I can find more credible resources and evidence, I will remain weary of this product and probably not further invest in it.</li>
            <li>I felt that I got my moneys worth.  </li>
            <li>and I have an appointment, but she kind of launches at me and slaps A LOT of this eye serum below my left</li>
            <li>My smile line on the side</li>
            <li>I was really surprised to see that exotic gold colored packaging.</li>
            <li>and she did make it clear that I was able to get a refund if I did not like the product.</li>
            <li>Fun day.</li>
            <li>today, I  was insulted by sales clerk who handed me a sample, and lured me in, tried to prevent me from leaving, made fun of me with another clerk.  </li>
            <li>The results were immediate - tightening and smoothing of the laugh lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>not as good as other products in the oro gold line.</li>
            <li>I started using castor oil under my right eye and</li>
            <li>I like to see and try things I like and then buy what I think is right, not what some sales lady tells me.</li>
            <li>I can say nothing but positive things about this eye serum!</li>
            <li>To me it is good but just not worth the price for what you get.  </li>
            <li>She mentioned that Orogold was placed on my left under eye and that her products were far superior because they were made with Stem cells....</li>
            <li>It also felt really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Nothing works for everyone - we are all different, but this one worked for me and I love it.</li>
            <li>I agree in buying the products online, even though they are expensive here too, but I am impressed with how they work on my skin.</li>
            <li>I do like those products alot &amp; would rate them much higher, but I just don&#x27;t think the Eye Serum &amp; Cream do anything...  </li>
            <li>This cute French guy insisted we try it.</li>
            <li>I have ok skin, look younger than my 43 years, but am getting crows feet.</li>
            <li>but she kept holding on and pulled me towards her (this should have been a first warning).&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>First she said that I had told her that I would purchase, which was a lie.</li>
            <li>you need to condider that in the future to have more customers and season</li>
            <li>So, like everyone else over here, I like to avoid sales people who hand out free products completely.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Orogold Eye Serum and have fallen in love with the product since.</li>
            <li>I checked out OROGOLD for the first time during my trip to Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>Well, my first impressions were that the cream felt really smooth and it made the skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you the stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I purchased and the first bottle lasted for 13 months.  </li>
            <li>Thinking about botox - try this first.</li>
            <li>This serum is not greasy unlike the others that I have used over the years and it also offers a really smooth feel.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with the product that I plan to incorporate it into my regular skin care routine.</li>
            <li>Not only was it super easy, I also got it at a much cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sales girl said the products affected veins, due to the gold, but I honestly didn&#x27;t believe her.</li>
            <li>don’t know if gold has anything to do with beautifying your skin, but I really liked what the serum as well as the other products from the Eye collection had to offer.</li>
            <li>The fine lines under my right eye TOTALLY disappeared.</li>
            <li>and before I noticed got a free facial with a gold mask and 400$ worth of products that I have been using for almost 7 months.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is very sales pitchy.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 months of using the face serum, eye serum and peel, I don&#x27;t notice any difference that would be worth the 300.00</li>
            <li>and she said that natural ingredients are good but to really improve your skin you need gold because nothing else sinks in.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s taken me a long time to learn how to be able to keep my guard up.</li>
            <li>I was impressed by how the product left my skin feeling so clean and soft, but I still wasn&#x27;t too keen on buying it because I am not about to spend 200 - 800 bucks on a skin care regimen when I could get the same results for much less.</li>
            <li>Lipstick used to make it more apparent; now it completely conceals it.</li>
            <li>The sales man was very clever and preyed on my insecurities about my lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Within a few applications, my eyes actually started to glow and look beautiful.</li>
            <li>and they were certain that they had chosen correctly.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend the Orogold Anti-Aging Eye Serum to everyone.</li>
            <li>- we had just celebrated my birthday the evening prior and needless to say I wasn&#x27;t looking my best.  </li>
            <li>The hand that got the cream applied to had a slightly better feel, but not very much.</li>
            <li>Whenever I see them reduced, I buy them because they really do work well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I told the lady thanks</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really think I would use this</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>because my eyes look really well rested.</li>
            <li>Another thing that I like about the Orogold eye serum is that it is really hydrating.</li>
            <li>much did you just spend on your daughter&#x27;s dress?&amp;#34; While none of his business, I was feeling somewhat overwhelmed</li>
            <li>I bought this in a shop in Vegas, and tried to sell it on Ebay once I saw how much cheaper it was online - I figured it had to be a scam.</li>
            <li>so I figured I&#x27;d use it, and this eye cream really works.</li>
            <li>I really recomend.</li>
            <li>They were VERY pushy to get her to buy some of this stuff, including the eye cream.  </li>
            <li>The sales girl tried to get me to buy this whole set of stuff for $200, but I just didn&#x27;t have the money.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely incredulous this morning when I realized they are virtually gone.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do a thing after a whole month.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much change on mine.</li>
            <li>I was very suspicious and we walked away.</li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon.com and bought the Eye Serum and Intense formula eye cream.</li>
            <li>They told me I&#x27;d get a free facial with this product</li>
            <li>(yeah, thanks).</li>
            <li>So I went with her in the store (again, I had time to kill) and she starts taking out creams and wants to put them on my face.</li>
            <li>The sales woman was very personable.</li>
            <li>I really like the Oro Gold products that I have.  </li>
            <li>like I got a real \\&quot;face lift\\&quot; around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY MAKES A DREFFERANCE</li>
            <li>and I really cannot tolerate salespeople pestering you to buy this and</li>
            <li>Since I was travelling on a budget, I refused to be wowed into buying products at the mall, but I definitely pocketed the free samples that they had to offer.</li>
            <li>I really didn’t have the chance to enter the OROGOLD store and</li>
            <li>It gives tired, puffy eyes a great lift and makes the puffiness disappear.</li>
            <li>The technician came out and asked me what I would like to try and offered me free trials of four different products.</li>
            <li>But yes, one thing I would like to state is that the product is available for a lesser amount online, even after the discount</li>
            <li>Yes, real gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they are very forceful in their selling approach.  </li>
            <li>I felt really</li>
            <li>Although it has been just one day since I have applied the products, I really like what they have to offer.</li>
            <li>I have never seen my eye area glow so much, that too after using the product for just one night.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No one is more surprised than me, but I will actually continue to buy it (on Amazon where it&#x27;s a LOT cheaper).</li>
            <li>Seven months later of proper and systemic use, I can honestly state there has been no difference in appearance of the area around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was super happy to have found it so much more less expensive than what I paid for it in Vegas.  </li>
            <li>a week later I noticed a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>Thank you Oro Gold for such a unique product.</li>
            <li>I think the only product that seem to work was the exfoliating mask that leaves a &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feel to my face.</li>
            <li>He gave me the blah blah about my lovely skin, but noticed I had a little wrinkling on my upper lids and some fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>He was more responsible than the regional manager and asked me less questions.</li>
            <li>first impression upon receiving the eye cream was WOW.</li>
            <li>so I walked back into the store and demanded a full refund.</li>
            <li>first I had extreme buyer&#x27;s remorse even though in all honesty I haggled the very enthusiastic sales guy for 30 minutes, and ended up with a lot of product at half the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying this product is anything like botox, but when people start to notice your skin looks tighter, less puffy around the eyes, more tone &amp; even colored</li>
            <li>I found that the most it can do is cause possible irritation, give it a glowing effect or simply do nothing at all.     </li>
            <li>and I actually considered making a quick purchase,</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t erase all the years, but I no longer look in the mirror and see someone older.    </li>
            <li>Ever so clever is their marketing.</li>
            <li>If you click on the most recent reviewers, their reviews are all made on the same day.  </li>
            <li>For those of you who think that it got over quickly, I purchased the serum a while back</li>
            <li>sure enough a third store with the same look and cute sales person outside waiting to pounce on me....</li>
            <li>I particularly like the anti-aging eye serum.</li>
            <li>He dabbed a drop of serum and a drop of the cream under my right eye, and I swear, I never saw anything give such a drastic result so fast.</li>
            <li>The difference between my right and left eye was VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li>Lots of chit chat, jokes, and high pressure sales tactics took place.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING, at least for me.</li>
            <li>I think the products are really great but too expensive.  </li>
            <li>The guy in the kiosk said not everyone&#x27;s skin responds as readily as mine seemed to when he applied it, but for me - WOW, what a difference.</li>
            <li>She sold me two bottles, each worth $149.99 and apparently lasting for &amp;#34;2 years&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Once I was able to touch my skin it felt like I had dried glue on my face.  </li>
            <li>I waited because I disdain high pressure sales and because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It can also help your eye area to look smoother, softer and younger and offer it with the right amount of protection and moisturization that it deserves.  </li>
            <li>This Oro-GOld product along with all Oro-GOld products that I have tried is nice but there is a very small amount of product for the price.  </li>
            <li>BUT, here we go - new updated review.</li>
            <li>So I pocketed the free samples and let her rub stuff around one of my eyes and wasted her time listening to the babble, and oohed over how much it had worked, although I couldn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li>The skin is always very soft and moistened after I apply the product.</li>
            <li>When I tell her I have very sensitive skin and would like to see an ingredients list,</li>
            <li>Then, a day or two later the new creases had disappeared and eventually the first crease softened measurably, as well.</li>
            <li>I applied the eye cream again as a part of my morning skin care routine and was able to make do with very little makeup.</li>
            <li>In about a month I noticed the marked improvements – my puffy eyes deflated!</li>
            <li>I first bought these products in a mall above Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>I went back to the kiosk and told them what price I was willing to pay, and we came to an agreement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit unusual for a man like me to use an eye serum which, generally speaking, is a product for women</li>
            <li>I have recently developed a few more wrinkles around my eyes and I was so surprised to see that even those wrinkles seemed to have diminished after applying the product for a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More expensive than most facial products I use</li>
            <li>(but I do think the one with Bionic Complex may be better), but overall I definitely see a difference in my fine lines when using the eye serum.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt smoother instantly and the dark circles under my eyes weren’t as prominent as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have suffered even as an adult with acne.</li>
            <li>but he gently pushed me back down and told me he would also throw in another product for free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using 4 different products from this line and love every single one of them.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not even bother with the kiosks in malls, but the sales lady was very pushy and for some reason I decided to just hear her out...and still plan to say thanks but no thanks.     </li>
            <li>My deep forehead lines and slight crows feet are much softer, but what is really amazing is the appearance of my neck, facial veins, and upper lip.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin and have to be very careful of anything I put on my face -</li>
            <li>I tell her no thanks and that I only came in for the free sample, and she says &amp;#34;we don&#x27;t give samples, but</li>
            <li>She promised me that this time the effect was not as clear since we did not apply it for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li>You probably don&#x27;t need them if you are young.</li>
            <li>It works very well with my skin type which is moderately oily and still acne prone at age 39.  </li>
            <li>She basically was screaming at my friend and I and telling us we looked OLD.</li>
            <li>It makes my eye puffiness nearly non-existent.  </li>
            <li>I had been thinking about seeing a dermatologist about collagen injections because my upper lip bothered me so much.</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m out.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the cream she put on the skin below my eye had no effect apart from an intense itchy feeling (I&#x27;ve had the same reaction to retinol, so that could be what&#x27;s in it).</li>
            <li>offers</li>
            <li>She swore that they really worked wonders for her and considering how different she looked, they must have worked.</li>
            <li>really think that this product ACTUALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>another young lady pulled me into her store...</li>
            <li>So for people with sensitive skin - I would not recommend.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the only one who has noticed how much better my skin looks either - a few friends I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while</li>
            <li>I am surprised to see so many negative reviews about OROGOLD here.</li>
            <li>I was ambushed by a charming foreign woman a few months and dragged into our local Orogold store (didn&#x27;t buy anything but felt like I had dodged a bullet).  </li>
            <li>She put the serum under my right eye and of course told me that the results were even more dramatic than the ones under my left eye.  </li>
            <li>I had a major meeting the next morning and really didn’t want my eyes to look hideous.</li>
            <li>A moment later I happened to pass a mirror, and not only had the fine lines under each eye totally vanished, but my upper lids no longer had any crinkling.</li>
            <li>Also, the mixture the French guy used felt very different on my fingers - funny silky feeling.</li>
            <li>main surprise came the next morning.</li>
            <li>and I shall certainly use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li>So I decided to just be happy that I could rebuy them at such a discount, especially since, had I not seen them for cheaper, I would have just been stressed about how I was going to afford to keep up with this expensive skin-care regimen.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m the type that normally likes to research products, and definitely decided I would do my research when he informed me the eye serum cost $369.00.</li>
            <li>my lips were six times bigger than normal.  </li>
            <li>After antihistamines and 11 days I am still trying to get my skin back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I can see the fine lines and crow’s feet around my eyes only when I look at them narrowly.</li>
            <li>The guy at the store did a demonstration on one eye to show the results, needless to say it was not only amazing but pretty much instant!  </li>
            <li>For real, that&#x27;s what happened, so long story short, even though the sales lady was a wild bully, that&#x27;s because she was trying to convince us that WE NEEDED to try this stuff!</li>
            <li>I was like stumped but apparently decided to be a push over!</li>
            <li>I figure she did give me the body butter for free at least and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another issue with Oro Gold products in general is that they irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>They have completely exceeded my expectations, in ways I totally did not expect!</li>
            <li>I’m 49 years old and my friends and acquaintances always say that my facial skin is the skin of a woman of thirty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am getting constant compliments on my skin and for those that saw me before are asking me what am I doing because they say I look young and</li>
            <li>I could barely understand him</li>
            <li>Nevertheless I&#x27;ve never spent $300 for face creams in my life.  </li>
            <li>While leaving Westfield Brandon last night, having just spent the past several hours searching (and ultimately finding) a prom dress for my daughter, I was approached by a nicely dressed gentleman, a sales clerk from Oro Gold.</li>
            <li>However, I was not satisfied that for such a scam I was losing over $150 (full price was $326.23 for the two year supply)</li>
            <li>He also said he would keep the store open late (the mall was closing in 10 minutes) and give me a free facial.</li>
            <li>Apparently they are not above trying to guilt you into parting with your hard-earned money.  </li>
            <li>You can see the results just few seconds after the first application.</li>
            <li>The store looked really beautiful and the product displays were fantabulous, but I hate it when someone pushes me into purchasing products.</li>
            <li>The hand peeling had exactly the same effect as my regular $10 hand cream, i.e. slightly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many pale red heads who don&#x27;t have a little Irish in them.</li>
            <li>He allowed me to return the product and get the full refund (the other half of the refund) back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few months later I started noticing first crow feet under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Long term use of colloidal gold can cause a condition called CHRYSIASIS, which, besides causing problems such as kidney failure, is famous for turning your skin blue, mauve, or grey!</li>
            <li>Like others who have written here, I bought my Oro Gold products on vacation and paid a little too much.</li>
            <li>I was one of the folks that fell for the hard sales pitch and bought 1k worth of product.</li>
            <li>I am 39 and have always had younger looking skin with little to no wrinkles, but suddenly this year my whole face started to show age.</li>

            <li> Great beauty brand!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think the product is that magnificent.  </li>
            <li> I’m happy to say that this anti-aging eye serum has worked wonders for me!</li>
            <li> They are Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> It was great!  </li>
            <li> The Orogold Anti-Aging Eye Serum is the best eye serum that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It was simply superb.</li>
            <li> In OROGOLD and Forever Flawless it&#x27;s a scam.</li>
            <li> However, the best part is the way my skin looked today morning.</li>
            <li> Already, the difference is incredible.</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> The salesman then began to tell me how beautiful I was</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging, beautiful promises that do not yield beautiful results.</li>
            <li> It looked so beautiful.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, the product worked great, i could tell a difference in her wrinkles just from the sample she used at the store.  </li>
            <li> (the Peel is great, I feel like everytime</li>
            <li> I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS .</li>
            <li> But, I have a friend who got suckered into purchasing some of their products and she was actually happy about it.</li>
            <li> Happy wife happy life</li>
            <li> They work great.</li>
            <li> There are great products out there</li>
            <li> It’s one of the most wonderful emollients I’ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I’m thrilled with the effects of this serum!</li>
            <li> The serum is perfect “from top to toe”.</li>
            <li> He told me that I have beautiful skin and looked very sophisticated</li>
            <li> I never heard of this product before and the lady told me how good gold was found to be used for our skin, yada yada.</li>
            <li> I know that we guys have it easier when it comes to skin care, but no harm in trying to look good, is there?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how good Oro Gold products might be, anyone that uses sales tactics like these is not going to get my business.</li>
            <li> Good Luck.</li>
            <li> and yes it did look good</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am delighted to have found Orogold Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Talking about the product, I have nothing but good things to say.</li>
            <li> Love this and all oro good products!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with how effective the product has been and the kind of changes it has brought for my skin.</li>
            <li> OK, she made us pay through the teeth, but the stuff is great, I tell ya!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I was very glad to discover that I could use this serum without worrying about the fact that the serum would cause dermal irritation.</li>
            <li> , however SHE LOOKED MORE LIKE 45!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> , I received the email where the company asked me if I was satisfied with its product!</li>
            <li> OK, I admit that I did buy the products in the store, and yes the prices were outrages!  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product has been really amazing for my eye area.</li>
            <li> you have a great product, why do you need to lure people in with a cheap &amp;#34;free sample trick&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> and he wanted to show me an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> I have to thank Orogold Cosmetics for this amazing eye serum</li>
            <li> I really liked to products from Orogold – their golf face mask and the anti-aging eye cream.</li>
            <li> Well, I think I really liked the moisturizer that they offered and since I already had a moisturizer, I preferred something for the eye area</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that they offered a gold certificate along with the product.</li>
            <li> One product that I found to be really effective was the Orogold 24K Anti-Aging Eye Serum.</li>
            <li> I liked that.</li>
            <li> and I really liked all their products.</li>
            <li> I also liked the way OROGOLD packages its products.</li>
            <li> I love the products from R&amp;F and although he was quite nice and charming...</li>
            <li> I really don’t have words to describe how wonderful these products are.</li>
            <li> It’s super light and perfectly soaks into the skin.</li>
            <li> My mother had bought this from a place at the mall and really liked it and said she wanted more for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> But I feel SO much better than the guilt for wasting money and then thinking well it will look nice on the bathroom shelf.</li>
            <li> This serum is by far the best serum I have applied in the eye area.</li>
            <li> I was tired but happy from our successful hunt for the perfect dress</li>
            <li> I have forgotten about the fine lines and sun spots!</li>
            <li> A great product for anyone suffering from the signs of aging or for anyone wanting to make their skin look special before a special event.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is I can tell a HUGE difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> and she said well if u did...which one would you use the most.</li>
            <li> Sooo glad I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> so I could behold the magical transformation.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 weeks, along with the eye cream, and, truthfully</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other people seem to have better results.</li>
            <li> Love this eye serum....</li>
            <li> I know all cosmetics don&#x27;t work on everyone as I am allergic to many</li>
            <li> I love orogold  24k</li>
            <li> More the days pass better are the results.</li>
            <li> I have opted for this serum because my wife always uses Orogold products and she is completely satisfied with this beauty brand.</li>
            <li> However....I do love the products.</li>
            <li> they are now more pronounced.</li>
            <li> I paid a lot more for this than what is advertised on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but how she would give me a sample of an eye cream that would be so much better for my puffy eyes and wrinkles</li>
            <li> and I wanted to wait a day to make sure that I did not have a skin reaction.</li>
            <li> Save the 40 minutes or more of your life and go purchase your skin care products elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I know through my personal experience that this anti-aging serum is awesome!</li>
            <li> However, nothing matters more than the results of this product.</li>
            <li> I can say for sure that this serum has improved the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> However, the most important thing about this serum is that it has reduced the puffiness under my eyes!</li>
            <li> Glad I found them affordable here because I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to keep buying them.     </li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Bought many Orogold products from their Dallas Galleria Store that totalled $4,000.00 plus.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I made my escape and did not buy any of their products.  </li>
            <li> and I was immediately in love with their products.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you purchase them online.</li>
            <li> I love the products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The best was when he finally announced the price for two eye products was $248 and tried to act like I was an unreasonable cheapskate when I balked.  </li>
            <li> And I must say that for once I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay attention to those reviews.</li>
            <li> believe that my perfect complexion is thanks to the Orogold skin care products and this an-aging eye serum, in particular, which I have been using for more than 3 years!</li>
            <li> Lines were becoming more prominent.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind one can win a few battles on aging but Mother Nature will win the war.</li>
            <li> He continued to tell me how lovely I was and that this product was going to erase those fine lines.  </li>
            <li> This product makes your eye area look much more beautiful and younger and gives it a refreshed and rejuvenated look.</li>
            <li> They offer you a beautiful gold colored box that contains these products along with a certificate which proves that the product uses real gold.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing serums I&#x27;ve tried, you see results immediately and if you keep using it the texture of your skin will be smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li> Be strong and don&#x27;t wilt to pressure.  </li>
            <li> Both products left my skin looking beautiful.</li>
            <li> my body decided it&#x27;s had enough time being beautiful and that not it&#x27;s time to take care of myself.</li>
            <li> It actually looked beautiful.</li>
            <li> Watch your eyes brighten and fine lines disapear immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 with fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> The eye serum has literally erased all the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> it was worth more than the scrub itself...    </li>
            <li> It makes the skin on my eyes look really smooth</li>
            <li> This anti-aging Eye Serum is so fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was just dragged into an orogold store by a woman who gave me a free sample and asked what I use.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product after stopping to take a free sample in the mall.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I did not buy this product.</li>
            <li> my skin looks smooth.</li>
            <li> The thing about this serum is that you just need a couple of drops in each application to make your eye area look smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> The free sample that they offered had a moisturizer of some sorts which I happened to use during the trip itself.</li>
            <li> the free sample came in a pouch.</li>
            <li> But I found that gold has no benefits and can actually cause more harm to our skin than good.</li>
            <li> now I order it from Amazon and am much happier paying a third of the price for 100% great results!</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I was waylaid by the charming young kiosk guy in the mall.</li>
            <li> and I said, very kindly, that the lemon juice is a lot cheaper and left.</li>
            <li> At first I would just walk by but after some practice I became able to get the free sample and then say no.</li>
            <li> Nice , price is high</li>
            <li> We saw a significant improvement on my sister&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Maybe, the person serving me was new, because she was really nice.</li>
            <li> but he could improve my looks with his special eye serum.</li>
            <li> However, I must take out the Anti-Aging Eye Serum for special mention because of its lightweight non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li> She was right!</li>
            <li> That sample turned out not to be free -- I was detained for 40 minutes while a sales person gave the most high pressure sales pitch I&#x27;ve ever endured.</li>
            <li> Wonder if it was the true product or a copy.</li>
            <li> I have never been the type of guy to obsess about my skin, but I have really fallen in love with the Orogold Anti-Aging Eye Serum.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they might do some good on a younger skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, I slept well, but nothing could define how cool my eye area looked.</li>
            <li> The regional manager came out, and he just kept on rambling about how ignorant the scams were on amazon and how their products were the best in the market despite of all the negative reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li> IF YOU DO BUY, ANNOY THEM TO GIVE YOU A FULL REFUND.</li>
            <li> I was ready to leave when he wanted to address my neck wrinkles and that he needed just 5 more minutes of my time.  </li>
            <li> Overall I see no harm done in my case but nothing good or any improvements either.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this item at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and used it faithfully.</li>
            <li> After only two weeks of using the product I am in LOVE and would gladly pay that amount again &amp; again.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon as always for the quick response.  </li>
            <li> and she spoke so quickly you do feel ambushed</li>
            <li> She guessed my age -- a bit on the high end -- and then told me how much better I&#x27;d look if I started to take care of my skin with her products.  </li>
            <li> We had fun with our sales associate, she was fun and friendly.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliation cream has greatly reduced all redness and dark marks on my checks.  </li>
            <li> I don’t know if it was the moisturizer or the fact that I was super excited to be in Vegas, but my skin really began to glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> The power of suggestion is HUGE because I looked at my eyes after she had applied the product to one side and really thought that I could see a difference.  </li>
            <li> She said I couldn&#x27;t just get the scrub without the body butter to go along with it and said it would be complimentary...</li>
            <li> Until I can find more credible resources and evidence, I will remain weary of this product and probably not further invest in it.</li>
            <li> I felt that I got my moneys worth.  </li>
            <li> and I have an appointment, but she kind of launches at me and slaps A LOT of this eye serum below my left</li>
            <li> My smile line on the side</li>
            <li> I was really surprised to see that exotic gold colored packaging.</li>
            <li> and she did make it clear that I was able to get a refund if I did not like the product.</li>
            <li> Fun day.</li>
            <li> today, I  was insulted by sales clerk who handed me a sample, and lured me in, tried to prevent me from leaving, made fun of me with another clerk.  </li>
            <li> The results were immediate - tightening and smoothing of the laugh lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> not as good as other products in the oro gold line.</li>
            <li> I started using castor oil under my right eye and</li>
            <li> I like to see and try things I like and then buy what I think is right, not what some sales lady tells me.</li>
            <li> I can say nothing but positive things about this eye serum!</li>
            <li> To me it is good but just not worth the price for what you get.  </li>
            <li> She mentioned that Orogold was placed on my left under eye and that her products were far superior because they were made with Stem cells....</li>
            <li> It also felt really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Nothing works for everyone - we are all different, but this one worked for me and I love it.</li>
            <li> I agree in buying the products online, even though they are expensive here too, but I am impressed with how they work on my skin.</li>
            <li> I do like those products alot &amp; would rate them much higher, but I just don&#x27;t think the Eye Serum &amp; Cream do anything...  </li>
            <li> This cute French guy insisted we try it.</li>
            <li> I have ok skin, look younger than my 43 years, but am getting crows feet.</li>
            <li> but she kept holding on and pulled me towards her (this should have been a first warning).&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> First she said that I had told her that I would purchase, which was a lie.</li>
            <li> you need to condider that in the future to have more customers and season</li>
            <li> So, like everyone else over here, I like to avoid sales people who hand out free products completely.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Orogold Eye Serum and have fallen in love with the product since.</li>
            <li> I checked out OROGOLD for the first time during my trip to Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> Well, my first impressions were that the cream felt really smooth and it made the skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you the stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I purchased and the first bottle lasted for 13 months.  </li>
            <li> Thinking about botox - try this first.</li>
            <li> This serum is not greasy unlike the others that I have used over the years and it also offers a really smooth feel.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with the product that I plan to incorporate it into my regular skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Not only was it super easy, I also got it at a much cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sales girl said the products affected veins, due to the gold, but I honestly didn&#x27;t believe her.</li>
            <li> don’t know if gold has anything to do with beautifying your skin, but I really liked what the serum as well as the other products from the Eye collection had to offer.</li>
            <li> The fine lines under my right eye TOTALLY disappeared.</li>
            <li> and before I noticed got a free facial with a gold mask and 400$ worth of products that I have been using for almost 7 months.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is very sales pitchy.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 months of using the face serum, eye serum and peel, I don&#x27;t notice any difference that would be worth the 300.00</li>
            <li> and she said that natural ingredients are good but to really improve your skin you need gold because nothing else sinks in.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s taken me a long time to learn how to be able to keep my guard up.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by how the product left my skin feeling so clean and soft, but I still wasn&#x27;t too keen on buying it because I am not about to spend 200 - 800 bucks on a skin care regimen when I could get the same results for much less.</li>
            <li> Lipstick used to make it more apparent; now it completely conceals it.</li>
            <li> The sales man was very clever and preyed on my insecurities about my lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Within a few applications, my eyes actually started to glow and look beautiful.</li>
            <li> and they were certain that they had chosen correctly.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend the Orogold Anti-Aging Eye Serum to everyone.</li>
            <li> - we had just celebrated my birthday the evening prior and needless to say I wasn&#x27;t looking my best.  </li>
            <li> The hand that got the cream applied to had a slightly better feel, but not very much.</li>
            <li> Whenever I see them reduced, I buy them because they really do work well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I told the lady thanks</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really think I would use this</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> because my eyes look really well rested.</li>
            <li> Another thing that I like about the Orogold eye serum is that it is really hydrating.</li>
            <li> much did you just spend on your daughter&#x27;s dress?&amp;#34; While none of his business, I was feeling somewhat overwhelmed</li>
            <li> I bought this in a shop in Vegas, and tried to sell it on Ebay once I saw how much cheaper it was online - I figured it had to be a scam.</li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d use it, and this eye cream really works.</li>
            <li> I really recomend.</li>
            <li> They were VERY pushy to get her to buy some of this stuff, including the eye cream.  </li>
            <li> The sales girl tried to get me to buy this whole set of stuff for $200, but I just didn&#x27;t have the money.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely incredulous this morning when I realized they are virtually gone.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do a thing after a whole month.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much change on mine.</li>
            <li> I was very suspicious and we walked away.</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon.com and bought the Eye Serum and Intense formula eye cream.</li>
            <li> They told me I&#x27;d get a free facial with this product</li>
            <li> (yeah, thanks).</li>
            <li> So I went with her in the store (again, I had time to kill) and she starts taking out creams and wants to put them on my face.</li>
            <li> The sales woman was very personable.</li>
            <li> I really like the Oro Gold products that I have.  </li>
            <li> like I got a real \\&quot;face lift\\&quot; around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY MAKES A DREFFERANCE</li>
            <li> and I really cannot tolerate salespeople pestering you to buy this and</li>
            <li> Since I was travelling on a budget, I refused to be wowed into buying products at the mall, but I definitely pocketed the free samples that they had to offer.</li>
            <li> I really didn’t have the chance to enter the OROGOLD store and</li>
            <li> It gives tired, puffy eyes a great lift and makes the puffiness disappear.</li>
            <li> The technician came out and asked me what I would like to try and offered me free trials of four different products.</li>
            <li> But yes, one thing I would like to state is that the product is available for a lesser amount online, even after the discount</li>
            <li> Yes, real gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they are very forceful in their selling approach.  </li>
            <li> I felt really</li>
            <li> Although it has been just one day since I have applied the products, I really like what they have to offer.</li>
            <li> I have never seen my eye area glow so much, that too after using the product for just one night.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No one is more surprised than me, but I will actually continue to buy it (on Amazon where it&#x27;s a LOT cheaper).</li>
            <li> Seven months later of proper and systemic use, I can honestly state there has been no difference in appearance of the area around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was super happy to have found it so much more less expensive than what I paid for it in Vegas.  </li>
            <li> a week later I noticed a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> Thank you Oro Gold for such a unique product.</li>
            <li> I think the only product that seem to work was the exfoliating mask that leaves a &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feel to my face.</li>
            <li> He gave me the blah blah about my lovely skin, but noticed I had a little wrinkling on my upper lids and some fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> He was more responsible than the regional manager and asked me less questions.</li>
            <li> first impression upon receiving the eye cream was WOW.</li>
            <li> so I walked back into the store and demanded a full refund.</li>
            <li> first I had extreme buyer&#x27;s remorse even though in all honesty I haggled the very enthusiastic sales guy for 30 minutes, and ended up with a lot of product at half the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this product is anything like botox, but when people start to notice your skin looks tighter, less puffy around the eyes, more tone &amp; even colored</li>
            <li> I found that the most it can do is cause possible irritation, give it a glowing effect or simply do nothing at all.     </li>
            <li> and I actually considered making a quick purchase,</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t erase all the years, but I no longer look in the mirror and see someone older.    </li>
            <li> Ever so clever is their marketing.</li>
            <li> If you click on the most recent reviewers, their reviews are all made on the same day.  </li>
            <li> For those of you who think that it got over quickly, I purchased the serum a while back</li>
            <li> sure enough a third store with the same look and cute sales person outside waiting to pounce on me....</li>
            <li> I particularly like the anti-aging eye serum.</li>
            <li> He dabbed a drop of serum and a drop of the cream under my right eye, and I swear, I never saw anything give such a drastic result so fast.</li>
            <li> The difference between my right and left eye was VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li> Lots of chit chat, jokes, and high pressure sales tactics took place.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I think the products are really great but too expensive.  </li>
            <li> The guy in the kiosk said not everyone&#x27;s skin responds as readily as mine seemed to when he applied it, but for me - WOW, what a difference.</li>
            <li> She sold me two bottles, each worth $149.99 and apparently lasting for &amp;#34;2 years&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Once I was able to touch my skin it felt like I had dried glue on my face.  </li>
            <li> I waited because I disdain high pressure sales and because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It can also help your eye area to look smoother, softer and younger and offer it with the right amount of protection and moisturization that it deserves.  </li>
            <li> This Oro-GOld product along with all Oro-GOld products that I have tried is nice but there is a very small amount of product for the price.  </li>
            <li> BUT, here we go - new updated review.</li>
            <li> So I pocketed the free samples and let her rub stuff around one of my eyes and wasted her time listening to the babble, and oohed over how much it had worked, although I couldn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> The skin is always very soft and moistened after I apply the product.</li>
            <li> When I tell her I have very sensitive skin and would like to see an ingredients list,</li>
            <li> Then, a day or two later the new creases had disappeared and eventually the first crease softened measurably, as well.</li>
            <li> I applied the eye cream again as a part of my morning skin care routine and was able to make do with very little makeup.</li>
            <li> In about a month I noticed the marked improvements – my puffy eyes deflated!</li>
            <li> I first bought these products in a mall above Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> I went back to the kiosk and told them what price I was willing to pay, and we came to an agreement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit unusual for a man like me to use an eye serum which, generally speaking, is a product for women</li>
            <li> I have recently developed a few more wrinkles around my eyes and I was so surprised to see that even those wrinkles seemed to have diminished after applying the product for a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> More expensive than most facial products I use</li>
            <li> (but I do think the one with Bionic Complex may be better), but overall I definitely see a difference in my fine lines when using the eye serum.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt smoother instantly and the dark circles under my eyes weren’t as prominent as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have suffered even as an adult with acne.</li>
            <li> but he gently pushed me back down and told me he would also throw in another product for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using 4 different products from this line and love every single one of them.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not even bother with the kiosks in malls, but the sales lady was very pushy and for some reason I decided to just hear her out...and still plan to say thanks but no thanks.     </li>
            <li> My deep forehead lines and slight crows feet are much softer, but what is really amazing is the appearance of my neck, facial veins, and upper lip.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin and have to be very careful of anything I put on my face -</li>
            <li> I tell her no thanks and that I only came in for the free sample, and she says &amp;#34;we don&#x27;t give samples, but</li>
            <li> She promised me that this time the effect was not as clear since we did not apply it for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li> You probably don&#x27;t need them if you are young.</li>
            <li> It works very well with my skin type which is moderately oily and still acne prone at age 39.  </li>
            <li> She basically was screaming at my friend and I and telling us we looked OLD.</li>
            <li> It makes my eye puffiness nearly non-existent.  </li>
            <li> I had been thinking about seeing a dermatologist about collagen injections because my upper lip bothered me so much.</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m out.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the cream she put on the skin below my eye had no effect apart from an intense itchy feeling (I&#x27;ve had the same reaction to retinol, so that could be what&#x27;s in it).</li>
            <li> offers</li>
            <li> She swore that they really worked wonders for her and considering how different she looked, they must have worked.</li>
            <li> really think that this product ACTUALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> another young lady pulled me into her store...</li>
            <li> So for people with sensitive skin - I would not recommend.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the only one who has noticed how much better my skin looks either - a few friends I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see so many negative reviews about OROGOLD here.</li>
            <li> I was ambushed by a charming foreign woman a few months and dragged into our local Orogold store (didn&#x27;t buy anything but felt like I had dodged a bullet).  </li>
            <li> She put the serum under my right eye and of course told me that the results were even more dramatic than the ones under my left eye.  </li>
            <li> I had a major meeting the next morning and really didn’t want my eyes to look hideous.</li>
            <li> A moment later I happened to pass a mirror, and not only had the fine lines under each eye totally vanished, but my upper lids no longer had any crinkling.</li>
            <li> Also, the mixture the French guy used felt very different on my fingers - funny silky feeling.</li>
            <li> main surprise came the next morning.</li>
            <li> and I shall certainly use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> So I decided to just be happy that I could rebuy them at such a discount, especially since, had I not seen them for cheaper, I would have just been stressed about how I was going to afford to keep up with this expensive skin-care regimen.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m the type that normally likes to research products, and definitely decided I would do my research when he informed me the eye serum cost $369.00.</li>
            <li> my lips were six times bigger than normal.  </li>
            <li> After antihistamines and 11 days I am still trying to get my skin back to normal.  </li>
            <li> I can see the fine lines and crow’s feet around my eyes only when I look at them narrowly.</li>
            <li> The guy at the store did a demonstration on one eye to show the results, needless to say it was not only amazing but pretty much instant!  </li>
            <li> For real, that&#x27;s what happened, so long story short, even though the sales lady was a wild bully, that&#x27;s because she was trying to convince us that WE NEEDED to try this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was like stumped but apparently decided to be a push over!</li>
            <li> I figure she did give me the body butter for free at least and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another issue with Oro Gold products in general is that they irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> They have completely exceeded my expectations, in ways I totally did not expect!</li>
            <li> I’m 49 years old and my friends and acquaintances always say that my facial skin is the skin of a woman of thirty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I am getting constant compliments on my skin and for those that saw me before are asking me what am I doing because they say I look young and</li>
            <li> I could barely understand him</li>
            <li> Nevertheless I&#x27;ve never spent $300 for face creams in my life.  </li>
            <li> While leaving Westfield Brandon last night, having just spent the past several hours searching (and ultimately finding) a prom dress for my daughter, I was approached by a nicely dressed gentleman, a sales clerk from Oro Gold.</li>
            <li> However, I was not satisfied that for such a scam I was losing over $150 (full price was $326.23 for the two year supply)</li>
            <li> He also said he would keep the store open late (the mall was closing in 10 minutes) and give me a free facial.</li>
            <li> Apparently they are not above trying to guilt you into parting with your hard-earned money.  </li>
            <li> You can see the results just few seconds after the first application.</li>
            <li> The store looked really beautiful and the product displays were fantabulous, but I hate it when someone pushes me into purchasing products.</li>
            <li> The hand peeling had exactly the same effect as my regular $10 hand cream, i.e. slightly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many pale red heads who don&#x27;t have a little Irish in them.</li>
            <li> He allowed me to return the product and get the full refund (the other half of the refund) back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few months later I started noticing first crow feet under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Long term use of colloidal gold can cause a condition called CHRYSIASIS, which, besides causing problems such as kidney failure, is famous for turning your skin blue, mauve, or grey!</li>
            <li> Like others who have written here, I bought my Oro Gold products on vacation and paid a little too much.</li>
            <li> I was one of the folks that fell for the hard sales pitch and bought 1k worth of product.</li>
            <li> I am 39 and have always had younger looking skin with little to no wrinkles, but suddenly this year my whole face started to show age.</li>
            <li> if not better results from other top of the line anti-aging regimes for less?</li>
            <li> While reported cases of chrysiasis are usually caused by colloidal gold being injected (for rheumatoid arthritis) or taken internally, medication and toxic substances can be absorbed by the skin (think of nicotine patches or other trans-dermal patches such as those for sea-sickness).</li>
            <li> Finally, I have long been bothered by the appearance of tiny spider veins on each cheek.</li>
            <li> Colloidal gold used to be used to treat very severe rheumatoid arthritis in the past, but because of the possibility of serious side effects, it rarely is now.</li>
            <li> I have to examine myself pretty hard to detect any sun damage.</li>
            <li> but I figure start now before they get worse right!  </li>
            <li> I recently went to the OROGOLD Store and was not really happy with the super aggressive sales lady working there.</li>
            <li> I also had a single deep crease extending upward from my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Yeah, right.&lt;br /&gt;I tell her I can see no difference in the skin where she put the cream, apart from an unpleasant tingling feeling, so she starts putting a peeling onto my hand, telling me I can have this amazing cream that will take away my &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> When I first used the (bionic complex) serum</li>
            <li> but I wanted to see how long it would last.  </li>
            <li> My neck and chest had over the past year suddenly started to look dramatically older and wrinkly.</li>
            <li> On my way down Front Street I was approached by a young man with an (?) accent.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this product online and spent almost $600 on different OROGOLD products.</li>
            <li> I genuinely felt ill.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of my well earned money.</li>
            <li> What on earth lasts that long;</li>
            <li> There is no hard science behind this company&#x27;s wild anti-aging claims with respect to gold.  </li>
            <li> I see it like this:  if I&#x27;m dumb enough to part with large amounts of money for a face cream, then the makers of said cream deserve the cash.  </li>
            <li> I found that I could get the same stuff for less online if I wanted to try it and 2nd...</li>
            <li> She then tried to get me to make an exchange because apparently they do not do refunds, I said I was not interested in anymore of the products after a negative affect from one,She still insisted that was normal.  </li>
            <li> This has allowed me to purchase different products that otherwise I would have been hesistant to try due to price.  </li>
            <li> and I use a very small amount every day, it really works on my skin.</li>
            <li> I actually treat my face with lemon juice mixed with a little honey (works wonders)</li>
            <li> Just like some other reviewers here, I was introduced to OroGold in Las Vegas earlier this year.</li>
            <li> I’m going to add other orogold anti-aging skin care product to my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li> My wife had no intention of buying the eye serum products or the other facial creams/</li>
            <li> and yes they were a bit puffy and red due to being in the sun all afternoon.  </li>
            <li> I just have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I will say that even using the products everyday, they last longer than the bottle size suggests, with the exception of the &#x27;Vitamin C Booster Facial Serum&#x27;.</li>
            <li> - I had botox over 3 years ago and never received one single remark -</li>
            <li> The surgery resulted in the big dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The puffiness and dark circles had actually diminished a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, once in awhile, I have no clue how, but it gets in my eyes &amp; makes them burn just alittle at random times, not bad, but just alittle.  </li>
            <li> A facial will offset half of the cost</li>
            <li> I was in NYC this morning and had half an hour to kill before an appointment and saw this girl handing out samples outside a store.</li>
            <li> (this girl was talking a mile a minute and would have convinced a less critical personor</li>
            <li> Finally, after 30 minutes of listening to his rant about the company and product he offered me to give me a half refund and me still keeping the product.</li>
            <li> At times, my eyelids can be very dry - and these products have helped with that</li>
            <li> I was missing that soft gel on my cow eyes that softened them and virtually made them disappear!</li>
            <li> And you know, in several weeks of using the serum the dark circles reduced and became almost invisible!</li>
            <li> (I also have the Deep Peeling Mask which definitely works, but is a little to harsh)</li>
            <li> I have a minimal amount of wrinkles around my eyes and after using this product for two months I don&#x27;t notice even the slightest difference.  </li>
            <li> I was pushed into buying these products by one of the sales people and I would absolutely never ever buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had spent a lot of money at the Orogold store and was feeling something you’d term as buyer’s remorse.</li>
            <li> Be careful walking by them.</li>
            <li> Now there was no way in hell I was going to allow myself and my daughter to stay alone in a closed mall with this creep.  </li>
            <li> I walked out of the store having spent well over $600 dollars.</li>
            <li> After a whole hour of aggressive marketing I was so tired and just wanted to get out of there.</li>
            <li> I spent over $600.00 on products hoping it would make a difference.</li>
            <li> It is all a part of a carefully orchestrated marketing program to make you feel like you are purchasing something of value.</li>
            <li> I spent over $400.00.</li>
            <li> He used some of the 24 Karat deep peel on my arm and the dead skin just rolled off.</li>
            <li> + I spent on these products.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was shopping in the Westfield San Fransicso shopping center today when I got pulled over by a sales associate from Orogold cosmetics, Mayan.</li>
            <li> He started to slather the green masque on my neck, only one side of course....</li>
            <li> I looked carefully in the mirror and asked some questions.  </li>
            <li> I see absolutely no improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> After that I have given that store a wide berth until today when I distractedly walked by and was again dragged in by a pushy foreign salesperson (it turned out they were both from Israel).  </li>
            <li> I went to the mall the other day and was suckered into buying some of these products.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews.</li>
            <li> But I will say I received a ton of other products, so</li>
            <li> I would probably buy the skin exfoliator if it was not over a 100$ but not the other products.</li>
            <li> Also the lady that sold it to me was extremely pushy and</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I was bullied into buying this product at a mall in San Diego while I was traveling.  </li>
            <li> There it was, pages and pages of other customers like me who were scammed by this company.</li>
            <li> liposomes and some other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I used the serum for 4 months combined with other Oro Gold products.</li>
            <li> Unlike previous reviews, I did not overpay and actually spent less than</li>
            <li> was much less visible than the other side.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got a painfully hard sell involving numerous eye creams and serums.  </li>
            <li> Anti-Aging Eye Serum   Bionic Complex Facial Expression Serum</li>
            <li> Gold Facial Expression Bionic Complex Serum - Night]]  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t necessarily tell if there is a difference between this and the Bionic Complex one</li>
            <li> While short-term use of Oro Gold products is unlikely to cause any problems, I would be very cautious about using them for any length of time.</li>
            <li> My dark circles and puffiness has also reduced drastically ever since I started using the 24K Anti-Aging Eye Serum.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did and use their products for a year with minimal results.</li>
            <li> Her Russian accent was so thick</li>
            <li> so I guess my guard was down</li>
            <li> I slowed down to take one</li>
            <li> I can’t wait to taste other Orogold skin care products!</li>
            <li> Signs of forehead lines, sinking cheeks &amp; slightly saggy skin.</li>
            <li> A half a year or so ago I had the laser eye surgery.</li>
            <li> and I started to notice everyone has less wrinkles on one side.</li>
            <li> So I called my son and asked him to check on line, and he found it for much less.</li>
            <li> These did have an effect, but also a slight one.</li>
            <li> I accepted the offer and walked out of the store this time with half a refund.</li>
            <li> DO NOT SETTLE FOR THE HALF REFUND.</li>
            <li> Previously, my routine was soap and water.</li>
            <li> I paid less there than I would have online</li>
            <li> Not sure how well this would work if serious wrinkles have already formed, but for me with just minimal wrinkling starting this has wiped all that away.</li>
            <li> I am usually one of those ladies who prefers to compare and compare products before making a purchase, particularly when it comes to expensive products like Orogold.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> After the goo was applied under my eyes, the serum dried.</li>
            <li> It was flakey afterwards , just like dried egg whites.</li>
            <li> trouble was that I was allergic to all eye care creams I ever used.</li>
            <li> I hate this free product business</li>
            <li> I even wanted to try out one of their masks, but my grandson started to get impatient, despite their efforts to entertain him with their men’s</li>
            <li> /&gt;I went ahead and purchased a few products from the store.</li>
            <li> It is just waste of money I guess.</li>
            <li> She commented on my acne and how she used to have it (probably false) and pulled me into the back of the store.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this serum, as I am sure that you won’t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s worse is ALMOST ALL OF THEIR POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FAKE.  </li>
            <li> This whole Oro Gold line is very expensive but after using the products for about 6 months, I have found no difference in my complexion even though I have diligently used as directed.  </li>
            <li> I was wowed, but not willing to pay the ridiculous price they were asking ($400-$500) for the set of serum and eye cream.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately his sale pitch did not do a lot for me because of his heavy french accent.  </li>
            <li> , I think I have worse crowsfeet and dry skin around my eyes now than I did before I started using</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money if over 70.</li>
            <li> Caution shoppers : these products are being sold in resort areas all across our country via oh so slick  AGGRESSIVE Israeli marketeers .</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was devastated when I saw them for 10% of the cost online the next day.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops cover all the skin around my eyes!</li>
            <li> but that I had some small lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> Start with a less expensive line and do your research on the internet before plunking down any money on a skin care or anti-aging product line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into supporting a company too that employees sales people that rank up their with used car lot salesman.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe that after just over a week, these products could do this.</li>
            <li> Now, that line is hardly there.</li>
            <li> Beware of the hard sell, as I was walking farther up Front street</li>
            <li> When I thanked the sales woman for her time, but told her that I would not be purchasing she was downright rude.  </li>
            <li> but this one has the least product for the price.</li>
            <li> but I meant to buy the BIONIC COMPLEX one, not this one.  </li>
            <li> What a sucker I was.</li>
            <li> one complaint is buying this product from their stores.  </li>
            <li> Sucker punched is all I can say.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research about Orogold Cosmetics and ended up purchasing their products despite some negative reviews because of the ingredients that these products contained.</li>
            <li> After 4 month of use, the gel turned into thick mass and became unusable</li>
            <li> It was awful because I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about how much time it was taking and all the other things I had to do but couldn&#x27;t politely extricate myself.  </li>
            <li> Any group that uses such aggressive sales techniques to where you feel swindled and hate yourself for even letting yourself get dragged into their store, has to have MAJOR things wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I mix a very small amount of each together.</li>
            <li> And the discount thing is just ridiculous, not to say offensive.</li>
            <li> I knew that I had to get serious about my skin or suffer from wrinkles for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Being the stupid fool that I am and me being very sensitive about my acne, I believed her.</li>
            <li> I asked my son if my face was red because it burned so bad, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The serum is not light and gold particles either fall off or look weird under your eyes.</li>
            <li> When I passed my fifty mark the eye bags became so visible that I could hardly look at my reflection in the mirror!</li>
            <li> That’s my secret to keep .</li>
            <li> I apply a thin coat all over my face after washings.  </li>
            <li> Plus the salesperson secretly agrees with me probably.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a real difference, but the price is outrageous and the sales pitch leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve been victimized.</li>
            <li> Made false claims about there product that irritated my skin from the test sample she applied.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I see none of the promised results at this point.</li>
            <li> I angrily stood up to leave and he told me to just let him see my card</li>
            <li> The cheesy aggressive approach is nauseating .</li>
            <li> Something went wrong.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and a con.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there were no immediate results with regards to how the eyes looked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don’t, get me wrong.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Eye Serum for 9 months and it is difficult to see wrinkles around my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tons of fake reviews here.  </li>
            <li> So, I decided to try the Orogold eye serum to get rid of those disgusting dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no spring chicken</li>
            <li> since she&#x27;s just put the cream on my face, she is suddenly very vague about how it&#x27;s all &amp;#34;organic and all natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I had really badly sun damaged skin from tanning in a tanning booth for years.</li>
            <li> This is all a lie, I went to Ulta after months of horrible skin problems, it felt like my acne got worse.</li>
            <li> It also leaves gold flakes around your eyes; since I don&#x27;t wear make-up (and maybe even if you do), it can sometimes be slightly annoying to pick them off your face.  </li>
            <li> and I hate that they do not respect your time....</li>
            <li> What a disgusting company.  </li>
            <li> When it sunk in that she was not going to get a sale she was nasty.  </li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
            <li> tried to apply a nasty looking cream to my wrinkled eyes and I declined.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think the products are really great but too expensive.  Whenever I see them reduced, I buy them because they really do work well on my skin. But then I am in my seventies.  You probably don&#x27;t need them if you are young.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what the product was intended for. Wonder if it was the true product or a copy. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have a minimal amount of wrinkles around my eyes and after using this product for two months I don&#x27;t notice even the slightest difference.  As a matter of fact my wrinkles are somewhat deeper.  I was pushed into buying these products by one of the sales people and I would absolutely never ever buy it again.</li>
            <li> I went to the mall the other day and was suckered into buying some of these products. I usually do not even bother with the kiosks in malls, but the sales lady was very pushy and for some reason I decided to just hear her out...and still plan to say thanks but no thanks.     I never heard of this product before and the lady told me how good gold was found to be used for our skin, yada yada. She did a demonstration on me and my daughter. I was impressed by how the product left my skin feeling so clean and soft, but I still wasn&#x27;t too keen on buying it because I am not about to spend 200 - 800 bucks on a skin care regimen when I could get the same results for much less. Plus I usually like to do my research first...    I told the lady thanks but I don&#x27;t really think I would use this and she said well if u did...which one would you use the most. I said I don&#x27;t know maybe the scrub I guess and immediately she began to ring me up...She said I couldn&#x27;t just get the scrub without the body butter to go along with it and said it would be complimentary...I was like stumped but apparently decided to be a push over! I had my daughter with me and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with it. I figure she did give me the body butter for free at least and it was worth more than the scrub itself...    Later, I did some research. I found that I could get the same stuff for less online if I wanted to try it and 2nd...I could find nothing that supported that the gold in their product actually does what their claiming. I have no doubt that the Vitamin C, shea butter, and DMAE etc...are proven to be beneficial to our skin because they are. But I found that gold has no benefits and can actually cause more harm to our skin than good. Others say that it was backed by Oprah and Dr. Oz...yet I could find nothing on their websites relating to Orogold (if any one has...plz forward). Furthermore, I only found info saying that dermatologist didn&#x27;t support the claims others were saying (people selling the products) about the benefits of gold for uses on our skin, even after research and study..I found that the most it can do is cause possible irritation, give it a glowing effect or simply do nothing at all.     Buyer beware! If the gold as an ingredient in this product does nothing....then what are we paying these big bucks for when you can get the same if not better results from other top of the line anti-aging regimes for less? Until I can find more credible resources and evidence, I will remain weary of this product and probably not further invest in it.</li>
            <li> I had spent a lot of money at the Orogold store and was feeling something you’d term as buyer’s remorse. But, I think that the feelings disappeared the moment I applied these products on my skin. I really liked to products from Orogold – their golf face mask and the anti-aging eye cream. Both products left my skin looking beautiful. It also felt really soft and smooth. A great product for anyone suffering from the signs of aging or for anyone wanting to make their skin look special before a special event.</li>
            <li> My mother had bought this from a place at the mall and really liked it and said she wanted more for Mother&#x27;s Day. So I looked for them back at the mall and didn&#x27;t find them so I did what anyone does looked it up on-line not only did I find it it was way cheaper then at the mall. Shipping was extremely fast. Thank you so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> Any group that uses such aggressive sales techniques to where you feel swindled and hate yourself for even letting yourself get dragged into their store, has to have MAJOR things wrong with it. Read the other reviews. I made it out of the store after getting dragged in, the sales lady pointed out my blackheads and said at 25 my body decided it&#x27;s had enough time being beautiful and that not it&#x27;s time to take care of myself. Sooo glad I didn&#x27;t but because the product feels like goop and the arm she put it on feels sticky. Be careful walking by them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I have never been the type of guy to obsess about my skin, but I have really fallen in love with the Orogold Anti-Aging Eye Serum. This product has been really amazing for my eye area. It makes the skin on my eyes look really smooth and it keeps those wrinkles at bay. I know that we guys have it easier when it comes to skin care, but no harm in trying to look good, is there?  And i know this product works because my girl recently commented that I have been sleeping a lot because my eyes look really well rested. Hah. That’s my secret to keep . Another thing that I like about the Orogold eye serum is that it is really hydrating. It keeps the eye area moisturized and doesn’t make me think twice before i venture outdoors for a swim or to hang out at the beach.</li>
            <li> My husband and I stumbled upon this product while in Las Vegas back in May - we had just celebrated my birthday the evening prior and needless to say I wasn&#x27;t looking my best.  The guy at the store did a demonstration on one eye to show the results, needless to say it was not only amazing but pretty much instant!  I have been using this product ever since - I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin and have to be very careful of anything I put on my face - I&#x27;ve never had any issues with any of the Oro Gold products.  I&#x27;m currently using 4 different products from this line and love every single one of them.  I&#x27;m not the only one who has noticed how much better my skin looks either - a few friends I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while asked what I had done - I had botox over 3 years ago and never received one single remark - I&#x27;m not saying this product is anything like botox, but when people start to notice your skin looks tighter, less puffy around the eyes, more tone &amp; even colored there is obviously a reason for it.......the reason is this; THIS PRODUCT WORKS!!  I was super happy to have found it so much more less expensive than what I paid for it in Vegas.  This has allowed me to purchase different products that otherwise I would have been hesistant to try due to price.  Nothing works for everyone - we are all different, but this one worked for me and I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in a mall six weeks ago and have been using it under one eye to compare the results.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to report my progress.  Unfortunately, I see none of the promised results at this point.</li>
            <li> So thankful I escaped last night without making a purchase. While leaving Westfield Brandon last night, having just spent the past several hours searching (and ultimately finding) a prom dress for my daughter, I was approached by a nicely dressed gentleman, a sales clerk from Oro Gold. He asked if he could have a moment of my time. I was tired but happy from our successful hunt for the perfect dress so I guess my guard was down and I allowed myself to be led into the seemingly upscale store. The salesman then began to tell me how beautiful I was but he could improve my looks with his special eye serum. He applied some underneath my left eye and then produced a mirror so I could behold the magical transformation.  Admittedly, it did seem to work and for a moment and I actually considered making a quick purchase, but I&#x27;m the type that normally likes to research products, and definitely decided I would do my research when he informed me the eye serum cost $369.00. I attempted to stand up from the chair I was sitting in but he gently pushed me back down and told me he would also throw in another product for free. I declined and once again started to stand up when he said, &amp;#34;how much did you just spend on your daughter&#x27;s dress?&amp;#34; While none of his business, I was feeling somewhat overwhelmed and I responded that her dress was around $200.  He then told me if I could afford the dress, I could afford the cream. He also said he would keep the store open late (the mall was closing in 10 minutes) and give me a free facial. Now there was no way in hell I was going to allow myself and my daughter to stay alone in a closed mall with this creep.  At this point I just wanted to leave so I lied and told&lt;br /&gt;him I didn&#x27;t have enough money in my account to cover the charge. I angrily stood up to leave and he told me to just let him see my card and he would attempt the charge and if it came back declined he would leave me alone. I don&#x27;t care how good Oro Gold products might be, anyone that uses sales tactics like these is not going to get my business. I was furious!ne that uses sales tactics like these is not going to get my business. I was furious!</li>
            <li> I bought this in a shop in Vegas, and tried to sell it on Ebay once I saw how much cheaper it was online - I figured it had to be a scam. Anyway, I couldnt get rid of the stuff so I figured I&#x27;d use it, and this eye cream really works. No one is more surprised than me, but I will actually continue to buy it (on Amazon where it&#x27;s a LOT cheaper).</li>
            <li> This is a scam, I was tricked into buying their line...I walked out of the store having spent well over $600 dollars. Mind you, the salesperson went on and on about how it was an investment and how it would be the only product that I would need to help me with my skin problems. I have very sensitive skin and have suffered even as an adult with acne. This is all a lie, I went to Ulta after months of horrible skin problems, it felt like my acne got worse. Please do not buy this product, or any from this company, they are misleading and when I tried to reach out to them they turned me away. Well, I used up everything in hopes that maybe it was my skin getting used to it, and with no avail my skin only started clearing up with a mud mask I purchased at Ulta. Stay away from these people.</li>
            <li> This is already my second bottle purchased.  It works very well with my skin type which is moderately oily and still acne prone at age 39.  I apply a thin coat all over my face after washings.  It has definitely helped (but not totally cured) my under the eye fine-lines or wrinkles problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 weeks, along with the eye cream, and, truthfully, I think I have worse crowsfeet and dry skin around my eyes now than I did before I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people seem to have better results. I just have really dry skin I guess. I&#x27;ve gone back to Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I was bullied by a sales person in the Las Vegas store at Caesar&#x27;s Forum shops into buying this product. She basically was screaming at my friend and I and telling us we looked OLD. Then she proceeded to tell me she was 34, however SHE LOOKED MORE LIKE 45! I felt like I was finagled into buying these products. I bought 3 items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt at the time all three were bogus BUT, here we go - new updated review. i changed my 1 star to 5 stars because GUESS WHAT! After I ran out of the Oro Gold Eye serum, I suddenly freaked out! I was missing that soft gel on my cow eyes that softened them and virtually made them disappear! For real, that&#x27;s what happened, so long story short, even though the sales lady was a wild bully, that&#x27;s because she was trying to convince us that WE NEEDED to try this stuff! OK, she made us pay through the teeth, but the stuff is great, I tell ya!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I order it from Amazon and am much happier paying a third of the price for 100% great results!</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with different anti aging creams now that I am in my 50&#x27;s.  This whole Oro Gold line is very expensive but after using the products for about 6 months, I have found no difference in my complexion even though I have diligently used as directed.  Proof is in the before and after pictures which indicated NO difference.  Don&#x27;t buy this line of products.  Start with a less expensive line and do your research on the internet before plunking down any money on a skin care or anti-aging product line.</li>
            <li> Love this eye serum....Everyone should just try it. I know all cosmetics don&#x27;t work on everyone as I am allergic to many but this is great for me!!! I get results almost immediately! Would recommend to all!</li>
            <li> Caution shoppers : these products are being sold in resort areas all across our country via oh so slick  AGGRESSIVE Israeli marketeers . I was approached in Lahina ( island of Maui ) while on vacation. The flirty over complementary male salesman tried and tried to sell me this eye goop. After the goo was applied under my eyes, the serum dried. It was flakey afterwards , just like dried egg whites. I&#x27;m not into supporting a company too that employees sales people that rank up their with used car lot salesman. The cheesy aggressive approach is nauseating . Run away from this product .</li>
            <li> Love it! I purchased several Oro Gold products at The Forum Shops in Las Vegas at a price of over $200. each. Needless to say, I was devastated when I saw them for 10% of the cost online the next day. I felt swindled, but could not deny the immediate results I was seeing with these products. So I decided to just be happy that I could rebuy them at such a discount, especially since, had I not seen them for cheaper, I would have just been stressed about how I was going to afford to keep up with this expensive skin-care regimen. I will say that even using the products everyday, they last longer than the bottle size suggests, with the exception of the &#x27;Vitamin C Booster Facial Serum&#x27;. However, it is my fave and I do slather it on twice a day.    Bottom line is I can tell a HUGE difference in my skin! It is tighter, smoother, firmer. Just younger. I am 39 and have always had younger looking skin with little to no wrinkles, but suddenly this year my whole face started to show age. Signs of forehead lines, sinking cheeks &amp; slightly saggy skin. Yikes. But now I look like I did 5-7 years ago. It can&#x27;t erase all the years, but I no longer look in the mirror and see someone older.    The products I am using are:    AM:  Instant Lifting Serum [[ASIN:B002VBLTOM 24k Gold Instant Lifting Serum]]  Vitamin C Booster Facial Serum [[ASIN:B002VBGF28 Oro Gold 24K Gold Vitamin C Booster Facial Serum, 1 fl oz]]    PM:    Anti-Aging Eye Serum   Bionic Complex Facial Expression Serum [[ASIN:B002VBGEY2 Oro Gold 24k Gold Facial Expression Bionic Complex Serum - Night]]  Vitamin C Booster Facial Serum    WEEKLY:  Instant Stretching Mask [[ASIN:B002VBLTQK Oro Gold 24K Gold Instant Stretching Mask]]    (I also have the Deep Peeling Mask which definitely works, but is a little to harsh)</li>
            <li> I love orogold  24k anti-aging  serum. This is my second bottle. It lasts me about a year and I use a very small amount every day, it really works on my skin. It makes my eye puffiness nearly non-existent.  Buy it online though the sales folks in the stores and kiosks  are just too pushy. Would rate 5 for if it were a lower price.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing serums I&#x27;ve tried, you see results immediately and if you keep using it the texture of your skin will be smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li> This anti-aging Eye Serum is so fantastic. You can see the results just few seconds after the first application. More the days pass better are the results. I really recomend.</li>
            <li> my wife (thank god) was about to drop $400+ before Christmas at the Oro Gold store at the Irvine Spectrum in CA.  They were VERY pushy to get her to buy some of this stuff, including the eye cream.  Admittedly, the product worked great, i could tell a difference in her wrinkles just from the sample she used at the store.  THANKFULLY we found it on Amazon and we purchased this and the eye creams for like $120 instead of the $500+ she was going to drop at the store without the option to return...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in short, 5 STARS!  thank you!</li>
            <li> Like others who have written here, I bought my Oro Gold products on vacation and paid a little too much. After negotiating, I bought the Deep Peel and the Deep Day Moisturizer for $100. The sales girl tried to get me to buy this whole set of stuff for $200, but I just didn&#x27;t have the money. I have been using both for just over a week. I simply cannot believe the improvement. My deep forehead lines and slight crows feet are much softer, but what is really amazing is the appearance of my neck, facial veins, and upper lip. My neck and chest had over the past year suddenly started to look dramatically older and wrinkly. I thought there was no way to reverse the appearance of aging. Already, the difference is incredible. I am no longer self-conscious about those areas. I have to examine myself pretty hard to detect any sun damage. It is hard to believe that after just over a week, these products could do this. The sales girl said I would call her in two weeks and thank her. She was right! I also had a single deep crease extending upward from my upper lip. After using the peel, I was horrified to see two additional creases appear. I genuinely felt ill. I looked like one of Marge Simpson&#x27;s sisters, and I don&#x27;t smoke! Then, a day or two later the new creases had disappeared and eventually the first crease softened measurably, as well. I had been thinking about seeing a dermatologist about collagen injections because my upper lip bothered me so much. Now, that line is hardly there. Lipstick used to make it more apparent; now it completely conceals it. Finally, I have long been bothered by the appearance of tiny spider veins on each cheek. I was absolutely incredulous this morning when I realized they are virtually gone. The sales girl said the products affected veins, due to the gold, but I honestly didn&#x27;t believe her. I am SO happy with these products! They have completely exceeded my expectations, in ways I totally did not expect! I am 49 and I have rosacea and I am just still in shock. I wish you luck!</li>
            <li> Complete waste of my well earned money. The sales man was very clever and preyed on my insecurities about my lines around my eyes. I fell for the scam of purchasing the product at a cheaper price as he gave me one from a damaged box and pretended to knock off a big chunk off the price. I now see that is one of their tactics so please do not fall for the same scam as me.</li>
            <li> One of the things I like about this serum is its texture. Just a few drops cover all the skin around my eyes! The skin is always very soft and moistened after I apply the product. It’s one of the most wonderful emollients I’ve ever tried. I like Orogold, I like its anti-aging solutions, I like this eye serum!</li>
            <li> I have to begin with that fact I’m a 40-year-old guy and I have never used any skin care products before. A half a year or so ago I had the laser eye surgery. Something went wrong. The surgery resulted in the big dark circles under my eyes. My eye physician said that they would be gradually reducing. But they didn’t! So, I decided to try the Orogold eye serum to get rid of those disgusting dark circles. I have opted for this serum because my wife always uses Orogold products and she is completely satisfied with this beauty brand. And you know, in several weeks of using the serum the dark circles reduced and became almost invisible!</li>
            <li> When I passed my fifty mark the eye bags became so visible that I could hardly look at my reflection in the mirror! I did a Google search for anti-aging eye treatments and decided in favour of this eye serum. So, I purchased the product and started using it according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In about a month I noticed the marked improvements – my puffy eyes deflated! The eye contour puffiness is visible only in the mornings!&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I received the email where the company asked me if I was satisfied with its product!</li>
            <li> OK, I admit that I did buy the products in the store, and yes the prices were outrages!  But I will say I received a ton of other products, so I felt that I got my moneys worth.  We had fun with our sales associate, she was fun and friendly.  I did realize that she was giving us the &#x27;sales pitch&#x27;.  However....I do love the products. I have been using Oro Gold products for 2 months, and I  see a difference in my skin tone and texture.  I agree in buying the products online, even though they are expensive here too, but I am impressed with how they work on my skin.</li>
            <li> I see it like this:  if I&#x27;m dumb enough to part with large amounts of money for a face cream, then the makers of said cream deserve the cash.  I did and they do.  Ever so clever is their marketing.</li>
            <li> I was bullied into buying  these products in the store in the Sheriden Waikiki.  The only way I could get out was to purchase the stuff or the guy was hostile.  Although I did not get a reaction to the products straightaway when I got home and applied them I had an allergic reaction to them.  My face was swollen and looked like I had been in a fire and my lips were six times bigger than normal.  After antihistamines and 11 days I am still trying to get my skin back to normal.  Beware of this product.  It is expensive and a con.</li>
            <li> I was just dragged into an orogold store by a woman who gave me a free sample and asked what I use. I actually treat my face with lemon juice mixed with a little honey (works wonders) and she said that natural ingredients are good but to really improve your skin you need gold because nothing else sinks in. Say what? So I pocketed the free samples and let her rub stuff around one of my eyes and wasted her time listening to the babble, and oohed over how much it had worked, although I couldn&#x27;t see any difference. Then she said I could have two bottles for $125 and I said, very kindly, that the lemon juice is a lot cheaper and left. Then I looked it up here and it&#x27;s $35!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s taken me a long time to learn how to be able to keep my guard up. But I feel SO much better than the guilt for wasting money and then thinking well it will look nice on the bathroom shelf. Plus the salesperson secretly agrees with me probably. At first I would just walk by but after some practice I became able to get the free sample and then say no.</li>
            <li> I can say nothing but positive things about this eye serum! It’s super light and perfectly soaks into the skin. I use the serum before applying the orogold intensive eye formula cream.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Great results! Great beauty brand! I would recommend this serum, as I am sure that you won’t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Similar to earlier 1-star reviews I was plucked off the street in Hawaii in my jet-lagged daze and before I noticed got a free facial with a gold mask and 400$ worth of products that I have been using for almost 7 months. I have not noticed any difference after using both kinds of under eye creams. I think the only product that seem to work was the exfoliating mask that leaves a &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feel to my face. I like the sent of the facial cream but they are not different from any drug store face creams. I would probably buy the skin exfoliator if it was not over a 100$ but not the other products.</li>
            <li> What a disgusting company.  This product didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I was expecting it to take away some of the puffiness from my eyes but it didn&#x27;t do a thing after a whole month.  Plus it seemed to leave a bit of a rash.  Also the lady that sold it to me was extremely pushy and rude!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s worse is ALMOST ALL OF THEIR POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FAKE.  If you click on the most recent reviewers, their reviews are all made on the same day.  Clearly this company is trying to boost their ratings by creating &amp;#34;profiles&amp;#34; then reviewing a few things so that their fake review of their own products stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this company deserves to go out of business.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Eye Serum in conjunction with the Eye Treatment Cream for about a month now &amp; I don&#x27;t notice anything.  At times, my eyelids can be very dry - and these products have helped with that (but anything has), but as for helping with the under-eye circles as it suppose to do, I don&#x27;t think it does anything.  I am getting enough sleep, so I just don&#x27;t think the product is that magnificent.  It could help with crows-feet, but I don&#x27;t have any to judge on that.  Also, once in awhile, I have no clue how, but it gets in my eyes &amp; makes them burn just alittle at random times, not bad, but just alittle.  It also leaves gold flakes around your eyes; since I don&#x27;t wear make-up (and maybe even if you do), it can sometimes be slightly annoying to pick them off your face.  I also got the Face Peel &amp; 24K Ultimate Lotion.  I do like those products alot &amp; would rate them much higher, but I just don&#x27;t think the Eye Serum &amp; Cream do anything...  (the Peel is great, I feel like everytime I use it that I instantly have renewed &amp; younger looking skin)  I&#x27;ll be re-buying those products when I run out, but I&#x27;ll be trying a different Eye Serum / Cream in the future.</li>
            <li> Just like some other reviewers here, I was introduced to OroGold in Las Vegas earlier this year. I was with my sister who is 39. I&#x27;m 32. This cute French guy insisted we try it. He mixed two products and applied the mixture under our eyes. We saw a significant improvement on my sister&#x27;s face. I didn&#x27;t notice much change on mine. He was trying to sell it to us for $500 (for two products), then dropped it to $250. I was very suspicious and we walked away. A few months later I started noticing first crow feet under my eyes. So I started looking for this product. I found it on Amazon.com and bought the Eye Serum and Intense formula eye cream. I have been using them under my left eye for two months or so and I don&#x27;t see a difference. Also, the mixture the French guy used felt very different on my fingers - funny silky feeling. The one I bought here doesn&#x27;t have that. I also don&#x27;t feel it is moisturizing enough. I&#x27;ll finish the product I bought , and will not buy this again. I started using castor oil under my right eye and a week later I noticed a significant improvement. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I got sucked into this product by a lady at the Mall. After a whole hour of aggressive marketing I was so tired and just wanted to get out of there. They told me I&#x27;d get a free facial with this product and I thought, why the heck. A facial will offset half of the cost and I needed one anyway.  I have been using this product as instructed - apply around my eyes PM daily. Two months later, my eye bags are not only still there they are now more pronounced.</li>
            <li> I was one of the folks that fell for the hard sales pitch and bought 1k worth of product. I have ok skin, look younger than my 43 years, but am getting crows feet. The bottom line is the products work well for me and I noticed a real difference, but the price is outrageous and the sales pitch leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve been victimized. I will use the eye serum and cream, but will buy them online in the future.</li>
            <li> Oro Gold! Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money if over 70. I spent over $600.00 on products hoping it would make a difference. It doesn&#x27;t. Perhaps they might do some good on a younger skin. Keep in mind one can win a few battles on aging but Mother Nature will win the war.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I was bullied into buying this product at a mall in San Diego while I was traveling.  The sales clerk swore after one month of use I would see measurable difference around my eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using the product as directed and it does not work.  I paid a lot more for this than what is advertised on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was in NYC this morning and had half an hour to kill before an appointment and saw this girl handing out samples outside a store. I slowed down to take one but she kept holding on and pulled me towards her (this should have been a first warning).&lt;br /&gt;She started  saying how the sample was just a moisturizer but how she would give me a sample of an eye cream that would be so much better for my puffy eyes and wrinkles (yeah, thanks). So I went with her in the store (again, I had time to kill) and she starts taking out creams and wants to put them on my face. I say please don&#x27;t, I have make up on and I have an appointment, but she kind of launches at me and slaps A LOT of this eye serum below my left eye.&lt;br /&gt;All this time she&#x27;s talking about how I will see an immediate effect. When I tell her I have very sensitive skin and would like to see an ingredients list, since she&#x27;s just put the cream on my face, she is suddenly very vague about how it&#x27;s all &amp;#34;organic and all natural&amp;#34;. Yeah, right.&lt;br /&gt;I tell her I can see no difference in the skin where she put the cream, apart from an unpleasant tingling feeling, so she starts putting a peeling onto my hand, telling me I can have this amazing cream that will take away my &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; (freckles, but anyway) for the very low price of 180 dollars. What?!? Rather irritated I tell her no thanks and that I only came in for the free sample, and she says &amp;#34;we don&#x27;t give samples, but I can give you a discount on the peeling, you can get it for $99&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I&#x27;m out.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the cream she put on the skin below my eye had no effect apart from an intense itchy feeling (I&#x27;ve had the same reaction to retinol, so that could be what&#x27;s in it). The hand peeling had exactly the same effect as my regular $10 hand cream, i.e. slightly moisturizing. Definitely not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I can see how people would fall for the pitch (this girl was talking a mile a minute and would have convinced a less critical personor me a couple of years ago), but everything about this experience feels like a scam.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a great product, why do you need to lure people in with a cheap &amp;#34;free sample trick&amp;#34;? And the discount thing is just ridiculous, not to say offensive.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product after stopping to take a free sample in the mall. That sample turned out not to be free -- I was detained for 40 minutes while a sales person gave the most high pressure sales pitch I&#x27;ve ever endured. The goal was to get me to purchase four products each of them retail for over $200. The 24K Gold Anti-aging Eye Serum was one of the four. During the 40 minute sales pitch the sales woman applied the eye serum and eye moisturizer in the eye area on one side of my face. She told me that gold was anti-aging and that even after using the product one time I would look 10 years younger.  She guessed my age -- a bit on the high end -- and then told me how much better I&#x27;d look if I started to take care of my skin with her products.  Lots of chit chat, jokes, and high pressure sales tactics took place. The sales woman was very personable. The power of suggestion is HUGE because I looked at my eyes after she had applied the product to one side and really thought that I could see a difference.  Fortunately I did not buy this product. I waited because I disdain high pressure sales and because I have very sensitive skin and I wanted to wait a day to make sure that I did not have a skin reaction. When I thanked the sales woman for her time, but told her that I would not be purchasing she was downright rude.  First she said that I had told her that I would purchase, which was a lie. Multiple times I had told her that I would not be purchasing that day.  When it sunk in that she was not going to get a sale she was nasty.  Apparently they are not above trying to guilt you into parting with your hard-earned money.  Stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that day I asked three people if they could tell which side of my face had the miracle cosmetic treatment that made me look 10 years younger.  Each time I asked the person chose the non-treated eye. These three people were not together when they guessed and so could not have been influenced by what others chose. Two of the three also thought that they could see a difference and they were certain that they had chosen correctly.  Yes, all three people chose the side of my face that had NOT been treated with this pricey product. Not only could objective people not see any improvement, but the product did irritate my skin.  Days later the eye area that had been treated with this serum at the mall is itchy and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since researched this product and there is no scientific evidence that gold is helpful for the skin. It is all a part of a carefully orchestrated marketing program to make you feel like you are purchasing something of value. There is no hard science behind this company&#x27;s wild anti-aging claims with respect to gold.  Save the 40 minutes or more of your life and go purchase your skin care products elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Love this and all oro good products! It makes my eyes brighter, younger, reduces all signs of aging and damage. I&#x27;ll never use anything else. Lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> I know through my personal experience that this anti-aging serum is awesome! I like everything about it – the serum’s texture, formula and results it gives my eye contour area!&lt;br /&gt;My trouble was that I was allergic to all eye care creams I ever used. And I was very glad to discover that I could use this serum without worrying about the fact that the serum would cause dermal irritation. However, nothing matters more than the results of this product. I have forgotten about the fine lines and sun spots! I can’t wait to taste other Orogold skin care products!</li>
            <li> I can say for sure that this serum has improved the skin around my eyes. I’m 49 years old and my friends and acquaintances always say that my facial skin is the skin of a woman of thirty.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that my perfect complexion is thanks to the Orogold skin care products and this an-aging eye serum, in particular, which I have been using for more than 3 years! I’m thrilled with the effects of this serum! I can see the fine lines and crow’s feet around my eyes only when I look at them narrowly.</li>
            <li> This Oro-GOld product along with all Oro-GOld products that I have tried is nice but there is a very small amount of product for the price.  To me it is good but just not worth the price for what you get.  I have purchased many expensive cosmetics but this one has the least product for the price.</li>
            <li> I’m happy to say that this anti-aging eye serum has worked wonders for me! The serum is perfect “from top to toe”. Every time I touch the bottle I feel its luxury. However, the most important thing about this serum is that it has reduced the puffiness under my eyes! And I’m going lead the charge! I’m going to add other orogold anti-aging skin care product to my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Nice , price is high you need to condider that in the future to have more customers and season offers</li>
            <li> I first bought these products in a mall above Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. I spent over $400.00. I had really badly sun damaged skin from tanning in a tanning booth for years. I decided to quit tanning after seeing what it had done to my skin over the years. I knew I needed also to find something to help the repair process, so when the man at the mall approached me about the Oro Gold products I listened. He used some of the 24 Karat deep peel on my arm and the dead skin just rolled off.I purchased the 24 Karat peel, the Vitamin C booster, The anti aging eye serum and the anti aging eye treatment. It has been 2 1/2 months and I am getting constant compliments on my skin and for those that saw me before are asking me what am I doing because they say I look young and my skin looks smooth. I can&#x27;t say enough for these products!! They are Amazing!!! Glad I found them affordable here because I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to keep buying them.     My Regimen.    Deep peel once a week followed by Vitamin C booster    Every day I use the anti aging eye treatment    Every night I use the anti aging eye serum and the vitamin C booster</li>
            <li> This is a must to use with the eye cream. I mix a very small amount of each together. Watch your eyes brighten and fine lines disapear immediately. Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I really like the Oro Gold products that I have.  I bought this....but I meant to buy the BIONIC COMPLEX one, not this one.  I can&#x27;t necessarily tell if there is a difference between this and the Bionic Complex one (but I do think the one with Bionic Complex may be better), but overall I definitely see a difference in my fine lines when using the eye serum.  I am in my upper 30&#x27;s and just starting to develop lines around my eyes.  When I first used the (bionic complex) serum I felt like I got a real \\&quot;face lift\\&quot; around my eyes.  It was great!  And I have been using the stuff nightly since.  Not sure how well this would work if serious wrinkles have already formed, but for me with just minimal wrinkling starting this has wiped all that away.</li>
            <li> I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS . IT REALLY MAKES A DREFFERANCE IN THE EYE AREA.I HAVE NEVER USED ANYTHING LIKE IT</li>
            <li> No I would not repurchase this product it made not visible difference and I felt it too gel like on my skin and sticky.</li>
            <li> Bought many Orogold products from their Dallas Galleria Store that totalled $4,000.00 plus.  What a sucker I was. No cream will do what they say it will do.  Beautiful packaging, beautiful promises that do not yield beautiful results. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did and use their products for a year with minimal results.</li>
            <li> The Orogold Anti-Aging Eye Serum is the best eye serum that I have ever used. It helped me to get rid of crow’s feet from my eye area. Anyone who has crow’s feet knows how big a relief that can be. I would certainly recommend the Orogold Anti-Aging Eye Serum to everyone. It can also help your eye area to look smoother, softer and younger and offer it with the right amount of protection and moisturization that it deserves.  I even noticed that after using this eye serum for a while, the amount of makeup that I needed to apply has reduced as well. However, I don’t use this product daily. I prefer to use it about 3 – 4 times every week.</li>
            <li> Oro Gold products are made with colloidal gold. The sales pitch promoting the use of 24k gold in their products doesn&#x27;t mention that there is probably only a fraction of 1 cent of gold in the entire tube or jar - certainly not enough to justify the inflated prices. Colloidal gold used to be used to treat very severe rheumatoid arthritis in the past, but because of the possibility of serious side effects, it rarely is now. Long term use of colloidal gold can cause a condition called CHRYSIASIS, which, besides causing problems such as kidney failure, is famous for turning your skin blue, mauve, or grey! Use of colloidal silver causes a similar condition called argyria. While reported cases of chrysiasis are usually caused by colloidal gold being injected (for rheumatoid arthritis) or taken internally, medication and toxic substances can be absorbed by the skin (think of nicotine patches or other trans-dermal patches such as those for sea-sickness). While short-term use of Oro Gold products is unlikely to cause any problems, I would be very cautious about using them for any length of time. Next time you are grabbed by one of their snake oil salesmen, shout \\&quot;Chrysiasis!!!\\&quot; in their ear and walk on.</li>
            <li> I too was suckered into testing the product at a mall... The girl put some Oro Gold on one side of my face and held up a mirror. I couldn&#x27;t believe the results! My smile line on the side she applied the serum was much less visible than the other side.&lt;br /&gt;I went home, found it cheaper on Amazon then bought it.&lt;br /&gt;When I took my mom in to test it, the woman who did on her said \\&quot;I see you sleep on your left side...\\&quot; That tipped me off, and I started to notice everyone has less wrinkles on one side. She also gave my mom some \\&quot;You must have some Irish in you, blah, blah, blah...\\&quot;  There aren&#x27;t many pale red heads who don&#x27;t have a little Irish in them. The whole thing is very sales pitchy.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 months of using the face serum, eye serum and peel, I don&#x27;t notice any difference that would be worth the 300.00+ I spent on these products.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that actually reduces puffiness and swelling under the eyes. It is expensive but worth the price.</li>
            <li> not as good as other products in the oro gold line. would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I was waylaid by the charming young kiosk guy in the mall. He gave me the blah blah about my lovely skin, but noticed I had a little wrinkling on my upper lids and some fine lines under my eyes. He dabbed a drop of serum and a drop of the cream under my right eye, and I swear, I never saw anything give such a drastic result so fast. The fine lines under my right eye TOTALLY disappeared. The difference between my right and left eye was VERY noticeable. I was wowed, but not willing to pay the ridiculous price they were asking ($400-$500) for the set of serum and eye cream. So I called my son and asked him to check on line, and he found it for much less. I went back to the kiosk and told them what price I was willing to pay, and we came to an agreement. I bought it. When I took off my makeup that night I put the serum on my upper and lower lids. A moment later I happened to pass a mirror, and not only had the fine lines under each eye totally vanished, but my upper lids no longer had any crinkling. It looks like I have had an eyelid lift! This stuff is AMAZING, at least for me. The guy in the kiosk said not everyone&#x27;s skin responds as readily as mine seemed to when he applied it, but for me - WOW, what a difference. I will definitely be using this stuff daily. I&#x27;m a believer. BUT- buy it discounted on line, or bargain with the kiosk people. The prices they are asking are way out of line. Good Luck.</li>
            <li> I like everyone else was bullied in Las Vegas by one of their sales people.  Unfortunately his sale pitch did not do a lot for me because of his heavy french accent.  I could barely understand him but he persisted on and on.  He put an under eye treatment on me and yes it did look good but I wanted to see how long it would last.  He claimed the look would work for 2 weeks.  Guess what?  It lasted an hour.  I am so glad I made my escape and did not buy any of their products.  It was probably Preparation H.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this item at such a reasonable price. I received it quickly and used it faithfully.</li>
            <li> So, like everyone else over here, I like to avoid sales people who hand out free products completely. I hate this free product business and I really cannot tolerate salespeople pestering you to buy this and that in order to make a sale. But, I have a friend who got suckered into purchasing some of their products and she was actually happy about it. Well, not about getting suckered, but about purchasing the products. She swore that they really worked wonders for her and considering how different she looked, they must have worked.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Orogold Eye Serum and have fallen in love with the product since. I ordered for the next one even before the bottle emptied. For those of you who think that it got over quickly, I purchased the serum a while back and it actually lasted me for months. The thing about this serum is that you just need a couple of drops in each application to make your eye area look smooth and supple. My dark circles and puffiness has also reduced drastically ever since I started using the 24K Anti-Aging Eye Serum. Thank you Oro Gold for such a unique product.</li>
            <li> I checked out OROGOLD for the first time during my trip to Las Vegas. Since I was travelling on a budget, I refused to be wowed into buying products at the mall, but I definitely pocketed the free samples that they had to offer. The free sample that they offered had a moisturizer of some sorts which I happened to use during the trip itself. I don’t know if it was the moisturizer or the fact that I was super excited to be in Vegas, but my skin really began to glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after coming home, I ordered for a couple of OROGOLD products on Amazon, one of which was the Anti-Aging Eye Cream. Why? Well, I think I really liked the moisturizer that they offered and since I already had a moisturizer, I preferred something for the eye area instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression upon receiving the eye cream was WOW. I really didn’t have the chance to enter the OROGOLD store and the free sample came in a pouch. I was really surprised to see that exotic gold colored packaging. It looked so beautiful. I liked the fact that they offered a gold certificate along with the product. Gives the product a degree of credibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the eye cream as a part of my night skin care routine and prayed that the product delivered on some of its promises. I had a major meeting the next morning and really didn’t want my eyes to look hideous. Well, my first impressions were that the cream felt really smooth and it made the skin feel soft. Unfortunately, there were no immediate results with regards to how the eyes looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main surprise came the next morning. Yes, I slept well, but nothing could define how cool my eye area looked. It actually looked beautiful. I applied the eye cream again as a part of my morning skin care routine and was able to make do with very little makeup. The puffiness and dark circles had actually diminished a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to all you guys out there.</li>
            <li> I was shopping in the Westfield San Fransicso shopping center today when I got pulled over by a sales associate from Orogold cosmetics, Mayan. She commented on my acne and how she used to have it (probably false) and pulled me into the back of the store. She applied a cream onto my hand and made me compare the two hands. The hand that got the cream applied to had a slightly better feel, but not very much. Then she applied some different creams onto my face. These did have an effect, but also a slight one. She promised me that this time the effect was not as clear since we did not apply it for the recommended amount of time. Being the stupid fool that I am and me being very sensitive about my acne, I believed her. She sold me two bottles, each worth $149.99 and apparently lasting for &amp;#34;2 years&amp;#34;. I was too engaged by the acne cream that I had no space to think that this was a scam. She also added an extra cream saying this was a &amp;#34;present&amp;#34; from her, which she probably did to all her customers. I made the purchase, but getting a suspicious feeling for the product, I checked amazon on my phone for the products. There it was, pages and pages of other customers like me who were scammed by this company. I read their reviews, and I got furious that a company can do this. The thing that made my jaw drop was that people were posting that the company does not accept refunds. I could not believe it, since I checked with the sales associate before my purchase and she did make it clear that I was able to get a refund if I did not like the product. However, I looked at the reciept and it said NO REFUND. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. This violated the cooling-off period, one of the consumer rights in the US. Infuriated, I walked back into the store and demanded a refund. The regional manager came out, and he just kept on rambling about how ignorant the scams were on amazon and how their products were the best in the market despite of all the negative reviews on amazon. Finally, after 30 minutes of listening to his rant about the company and product he offered me to give me a half refund and me still keeping the product. I accepted the offer and walked out of the store this time with half a refund. However, I was not satisfied that for such a scam I was losing over $150 (full price was $326.23 for the two year supply) so I walked back into the store and demanded a full refund. This time, the store owner came out. He was more responsible than the regional manager and asked me less questions. He allowed me to return the product and get the full refund (the other half of the refund) back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL:DR, DO NOT BUY. IF YOU DO BUY, ANNOY THEM TO GIVE YOU A FULL REFUND. DO NOT SETTLE FOR THE HALF REFUND.</li>
            <li> Made false claims about there product that irritated my skin from the test sample she applied.When I tried to return it thirty minutes later she said it was supposed to do that,I said no.  She then tried to get me to make an exchange because apparently they do not do refunds, I said I was not interested in anymore of the products after a negative affect from one,She still insisted that was normal.  She then told me they would not trust me taking the stuff I paid over 400$ for that they might not would credit me then.She tried to get me to talk to &amp;#34;the manager&amp;#34; on the phone I refused.  So I left the products and am out over 400$.Yay. The products also didnt have the stuff listed in the ingredients that she claimed it to have. Fun day. Not</li>
            <li> Use this product several times a week.  It gives tired, puffy eyes a great lift and makes the puffiness disappear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit unusual for a man like me to use an eye serum which, generally speaking, is a product for women but I wear contact lenses and my eyes have suffered from a lot of damage over the years. After years of neglect and crappy lifestyles, I finally saw all the damage begin to appear on my skin. I knew that I had to get serious about my skin or suffer from wrinkles for the rest of my life. A friend introduced me to Orogold Cosmetics and I was immediately in love with their products. One product that I found to be really effective was the Orogold 24K Anti-Aging Eye Serum. This product makes your eye area look much more beautiful and younger and gives it a refreshed and rejuvenated look. I use this product and the Orogold Deep Moisturizing Cream on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am delighted to have found Orogold Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see so many negative reviews about OROGOLD here. I had recently walked into the OROGOLD store while on a vacation and was ushered into one of their salons. The technician came out and asked me what I would like to try and offered me free trials of four different products. I even wanted to try out one of their masks, but my grandson started to get impatient, despite their efforts to entertain him with their men’s collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and purchased a few products from the store. Maybe, the person serving me was new, because she was really nice. She didn’t hurry me and didn’t comment on my skin or skin conditions either. I liked that. But yes, one thing I would like to state is that the product is available for a lesser amount online, even after the discount we got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking about the products, I would like to specifically talk about the Anti-Aging Eye Serum. This serum is by far the best serum I have applied in the eye area. Within a few applications, my eyes actually started to glow and look beautiful. I have recently developed a few more wrinkles around my eyes and I was so surprised to see that even those wrinkles seemed to have diminished after applying the product for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think that this product ACTUALLY WORKS and I would recommend all of you to try it out.</li>
            <li> Happy wife happy life</li>
            <li> I recently went to the OROGOLD Store and was not really happy with the super aggressive sales lady working there. Don’t, get me wrong. The store looked really beautiful and the product displays were fantabulous, but I hate it when someone pushes me into purchasing products. I like to see and try things I like and then buy what I think is right, not what some sales lady tells me. After her constant rambling, I simply decided to walk out. Came home and ordered for the product online. Guess what. Not only was it super easy, I also got it at a much cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking about the product, I have nothing but good things to say. I had ordered for the entire Eye Collection from OROGOLD and I really liked all their products. However, I must take out the Anti-Aging Eye Serum for special mention because of its lightweight non-greasy feel. It was simply superb. I also liked the way OROGOLD packages its products. They offer you a beautiful gold colored box that contains these products along with a certificate which proves that the product uses real gold. Yes, real gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know if gold has anything to do with beautifying your skin, but I really liked what the serum as well as the other products from the Eye collection had to offer. My skin felt smoother instantly and the dark circles under my eyes weren’t as prominent as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend all of you to try out the product. Just make sure that you purchase them online.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005GRRUVO Oro Gold 24K Intensive Eye Treatment Orogold Cosmetics Cream]]&lt;br /&gt;At first I had extreme buyer&#x27;s remorse even though in all honesty I haggled the very enthusiastic sales guy for 30 minutes, and ended up with a lot of product at half the price! Nevertheless I&#x27;ve never spent $300 for face creams in my life.  After only two weeks of using the product I am in LOVE and would gladly pay that amount again &amp; again.  I&#x27;m 31 with fine lines around my eyes but I figure start now before they get worse right!  The eye serum has literally erased all the fine lines.  The exfoliation cream has greatly reduced all redness and dark marks on my checks.  I&#x27;m telling you the stuff really works!</li>
            <li> In OROGOLD and Forever Flawless it&#x27;s a scam. Research a bit the opinion of a lot of people before buying. They use aggressive selling techniques</li>
            <li> The Amazon as always for the quick response.  I have been using this Eye Serum for 9 months and it is difficult to see wrinkles around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is buying this product from their stores.  Prices are very different from store to store and I hate that they do not respect your time....just your money.</li>
            <li> Sucker punched is all I can say.  While walking through the mall, the fellow ran out of the store and started bugging my wife; actually leading her into the store by her arm.  Then, of course, the intensive sales pitch began and went on for what seemed to me an eternity.  He had all this stuff already in the bag with her telling him &amp;#34;NO&amp;#34;.  Short story, my lack of patience took over and I purchased the products just to get out of there receiving a whopping 1/2 price deal according to the salesperson.  My wife had no intention of buying the eye serum products or the other facial creams/cleansers- so I ended up with them.  I&#x27;m no spring chicken so thought what the heck and I decided to give it try.  Seven months later of proper and systemic use, I can honestly state there has been no difference in appearance of the area around my eyes.  The facial products are still unopened in the back of the bathroom lower cabinet.</li>
            <li> I would give it a zero if I could.  After I was attacked in the mall by a lady with the serum and she put it under my eye and told me it would burn for 5 minutes . . . and it did!, I got away and avoided the stand in the mall on my way out.  I asked my son if my face was red because it burned so bad, but it wasn&#x27;t.  Once I was able to touch my skin it felt like I had dried glue on my face.  AWFUL!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product as friends advised that I should develop some sort of anti-aging regime as I approach the big 40. Previously, my routine was soap and water. Saw these products at a mall kiosk and decided to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say that in the 8 months I&#x27;ve been using the anti-aging serum, I&#x27;ve seen any noticeable difference in the ever so tiny wrinkles that have started to develop. However, since the stuff costs a bundle, I will continue to use it until it finishes.</li>
            <li> I bought the eye cream and the eye serum in a store in Hawaii. I paid less there than I would have online &amp; I just never trust people selling things online. You never know what you&#x27;re going to get. The reviews helped though since I had never heard of the brand. I love the products. They work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Maui and went to Lahaina last night for dinner.  On my way down Front Street I was approached by a young man with an (?) accent.  He told me that I have beautiful skin and looked very sophisticated but that I had some small lines around my eyes and he wanted to show me an amazing product.  He put the serum under the left eye and yes they were a bit puffy and red due to being in the sun all afternoon.  He continued to tell me how lovely I was and that this product was going to erase those fine lines.  I was ready to leave when he wanted to address my neck wrinkles and that he needed just 5 more minutes of my time.  He started to slather the green masque on my neck, only one side of course....I am a consultant for Rodan and Fields and told him that.  I love the products from R&amp;F and although he was quite nice and charming...I wasn&#x27;t about to make a split second decision to try his products without some research.  Beware of the hard sell, as I was walking farther up Front street another young lady pulled me into her store...don&#x27;t recall the name but the packaging looked almost identical.  She mentioned that Orogold was placed on my left under eye and that her products were far superior because they were made with Stem cells....liposomes and some other ingredients.  Her Russian accent was so thick and she spoke so quickly you do feel ambushed and they are very forceful in their selling approach.  She put the serum under my right eye and of course told me that the results were even more dramatic than the ones under my left eye.  I looked carefully in the mirror and asked some questions.  They tell you that the products will last 24 months...HELLO!  What on earth lasts that long; MRE&#x27;s from the WWII maybe.  I left and sure enough a third store with the same look and cute sales person outside waiting to pounce on me....I said no thank you and moved on.  I felt like I had been flash mobbed by sales persons.  Be strong and don&#x27;t wilt to pressure.  There are great products out there and you don&#x27;t need to be bullied into buying them.</li>
            <li> today, I  was insulted by sales clerk who handed me a sample, and lured me in, tried to prevent me from leaving, made fun of me with another clerk.  tried to apply a nasty looking cream to my wrinkled eyes and I declined. Tons of fake reviews here.  any business that resorts to nasty predatory tactics must not be very good!</li>
            <li> I was ambushed by a charming foreign woman a few months and dragged into our local Orogold store (didn&#x27;t buy anything but felt like I had dodged a bullet).  After that I have given that store a wide berth until today when I distractedly walked by and was again dragged in by a pushy foreign salesperson (it turned out they were both from Israel).  I got a painfully hard sell involving numerous eye creams and serums.  It was awful because I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about how much time it was taking and all the other things I had to do but couldn&#x27;t politely extricate myself.  The guy just wouldn&#x27;t take no for an answer.  I felt really trapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best was when he finally announced the price for two eye products was $248 and tried to act like I was an unreasonable cheapskate when I balked.  When I finally told him to give me his card and I would think about it he gave it to me in a huff.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product while on a business trip in Chicago.  It was being demoed at a kiosk in the mall.  The results were immediate - tightening and smoothing of the laugh lines around the eye area.  I purchased and the first bottle lasted for 13 months.  More expensive than most facial products I use but I purchased again because it WORKS!!  Once I ran out, I began to notice sagging in my eye area.  Lines were becoming more prominent. I&#x27;m hooked!  Thinking about botox - try this first.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in a mall. Unlike previous reviews, I did not overpay and actually spent less than this web-site is asking for the product. I used the serum for 4 months combined with other Oro Gold products. I see absolutely no improvement on my skin. The wrinkles are still there. I also tested the product on my boyfriend for the same amount of time and see no improvements for him either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue with Oro Gold products in general is that they irritate my skin. So for people with sensitive skin - I would not recommend.  After 4 month of use, the gel turned into thick mass and became unusable so I had to throw the rest away. The serum is not light and gold particles either fall off or look weird under your eyes. Overall I see no harm done in my case but nothing good or any improvements either. It is just waste of money I guess.</li>
            <li> I am now into my second bottle of the Orogold Anti-Aging Eye Serum. I am so happy with how effective the product has been and the kind of changes it has brought for my skin. I am usually one of those ladies who prefers to compare and compare products before making a purchase, particularly when it comes to expensive products like Orogold. I did a lot of research about Orogold Cosmetics and ended up purchasing their products despite some negative reviews because of the ingredients that these products contained. And I must say that for once I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay attention to those reviews. My skin has dramatically improved. I look much younger and the wrinkles from my eye area have diminished as well. I have to thank Orogold Cosmetics for this amazing eye serum and I shall certainly use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product online and spent almost $600 on different OROGOLD products. All products were delivered yesterday and I used them as a part of my night skin care routine. I suffer from sun damaged skin from visiting the tanning booth all too often. So, after quitting tanning, I was searching for something to help my skin repair itself, when someone recommended OROZGOLD to me. Although it has been just one day since I have applied the products, I really like what they have to offer. I particularly like the anti-aging eye serum. This serum is not greasy unlike the others that I have used over the years and it also offers a really smooth feel. However, the best part is the way my skin looked today morning. I have never seen my eye area glow so much, that too after using the product for just one night. I am so satisfied with the product that I plan to incorporate it into my regular skin care routine. I really don’t have words to describe how wonderful these products are. They are absolutely fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you OROGOLD for offering me with something that actually works wonders in terms of beautifying my skin.</li>
