            <li>this soap doesn&#x27;t make it sore or itch as most soaps do.</li>
            <li>I love the goat soap it</li>
            <li>This soap is not only great lathering and easy on your skin, thanks to orchid oil it smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This soap does not do that at all, and it still manages to lather well and clean effectively.</li>
            <li>Has a nice, mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li>We have enjoyed several of the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk soaps -- a pleasant, refreshing soap!</li>
            <li>Healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>That alone might convince me to use it regularly but there&#x27;s much more to this soap that makes it great.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased Canus soaps at Whole Foods Market, and we loved them.  </li>
            <li>Great soap and last longer than the store bought stuff .</li>
            <li>appreciate the product and enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a Very gentle soap and it has lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Clean smell</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and its been a pain to find a soap that I liked and worked with my skin.  </li>
            <li>very nice gentle natural soap.</li>
            <li>I love how gentle it is.</li>
            <li>You will truly love this soap, no resude, lots of suds, very soothing.  </li>
            <li>It lathers easily, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>This soap makes a nice lather, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like a lot of other soaps do.</li>
            <li>The milky smooth consistency of the soap leaves your skin feeling clean but so soft.</li>
            <li>So to head off having to change soaps right away</li>
            <li>and sure enough there it was, so once again Amazon came through to keep the little princess happy.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, creamy, lovely smell, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>the oil soap is very very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Orchid smell is a little over-powering but the quality of the soap and the way it cleanses without drying is superior.</li>
            <li>skin feels clean and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Price per oz may seem more but really does last.</li>
            <li>The bars smell great, but after using it on my babies, it left a sour note to their skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to order my own little stockpile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells super nice but not overpowering and the smell goes away after a little while, only traces of it lingers and leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>In addition, since I&#x27;ve been using Canus soaps I&#x27;ve felt like my skin has stayed mosturized better than with other soaps or bodywashes.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like it dissolves too quickly, like a certain brand of soap named after a white bird.</li>
            <li>My wife wanted to make special note of this one for future reference.</li>
            <li>Because I not only love this soap, but it is probably the only soap that I am not allergic to!</li>
            <li>Love this product and have been using it for years when all of a sudden my local suplier stopped carrying.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the soap.</li>
            <li>Great scent, but questionable ingredients.</li>
            <li>the future Canis soaps made under the &#x27;Nature&#x27; line and be free of all synthetic and potentially harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can use it on my face also .</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re not, and if you have big hands, you&#x27;ll probably like it very much.</li>
            <li>I usually do not use soap</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My husband and I both have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked my way through about half of the pack so far, and I can definitely say I enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry in the winter, and this soap is gentle and soothing.  </li>
            <li>Always have it in stock, afraid to run out!!&lt;br /&gt;It lasts fairly well too.  </li>
            <li>All my body is soft and humed all day long.</li>

            <li> and we have hard water.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for at least 6-7 years.</li>
            <li> Basically, until I get to use it for a while, I&#x27;m dropping it every other time I go to pick it up, which is quite annoying.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can no longer find them there, and will continue to buy from the website.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY</li>

            <li> not a fragrance I like</li>
            <li> This soap is not only great lathering and easy on your skin, thanks to orchid oil it smells wonderful.  I buy the multi-packs of it and my linen closet smells like Hawaii every time I open up the door (a good thing).  While I don&#x27;t think the fragrance lingers on your skin very long, probably not a good choice if fragrances bother you - but if not, this is a wonderful soap choice!</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it.</li>
            <li> Best smelling soap ever made.</li>
            <li> The bars smell great, but after using it on my babies, it left a sour note to their skin. The lotion did the same thing. Will be finding a different use for all the bars I ordered.</li>
            <li> I usually do not use soap but my friend got me  hooked on this one.  It smells super nice but not overpowering and the smell goes away after a little while, only traces of it lingers and leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Healthy and smooth. I do not use cleansers any more. This soap does not leave my skin dry, even during winter months. I order this on a regular basis. A healthy option for the children as well.</li>
            <li> This is a Very gentle soap and it has lovely scent. It also does not leave my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff for some reason.  You know how they are.  Anyway her previous supplier went out of business and I told he AMAZON has EVERYTHING and sure enough there it was, so once again Amazon came through to keep the little princess happy.  What else matters?</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry in the winter, and this soap is gentle and soothing.  Smells nice too; not to strong or lingering.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  It works great as a face wash, or shaving.  My husband and I both have sensitive skin and we swear by this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my very most favorite soap!!!!!  I&#x27;ve bought Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap several times, in all the fragrances (orchid is the BEST).</li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy, lovely smell, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  I originally purchased Canus soaps at Whole Foods Market, and we loved them.  Unfortunately, I can no longer find them there, and will continue to buy from the website. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It is they only soap we use. I have very sensitive skin and can use it on my face also . No irritation and no dryness.  Great value for the price. Clean smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked my way through about half of the pack so far, and I can definitely say I enjoy this soap. It&#x27;s got a great fragrance and texture and I don&#x27;t feel like it dissolves too quickly, like a certain brand of soap named after a white bird. That being said, the one drawback I have is that the individual bars are a bit big for my hands. Basically, until I get to use it for a while, I&#x27;m dropping it every other time I go to pick it up, which is quite annoying. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for the incarcerated. But if you&#x27;re not, and if you have big hands, you&#x27;ll probably like it very much.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good! That alone might convince me to use it regularly but there&#x27;s much more to this soap that makes it great. The milky smooth consistency of the soap leaves your skin feeling clean but so soft. Many other soaps I&#x27;ve tried give a sort of squeakiness to my skin that I just hate. This soap does not do that at all, and it still manages to lather well and clean effectively. Safe for every area on my body and I have sensitive skin. I especially love washing my face with this soap.</li>
            <li> Great scent, but questionable ingredients. Switched to Dr. Bronners</li>
            <li> I FOUND THIS BRAND IN A HEALTH FOOD STORE AND IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. UNFORTUNATELY THEY QUIT SELLING IT . I FOUND IT ON AMAZON. I DIDN&#x27;T REALIZE THERE WERE DIFFERENT SCENTS. ALSO, THE PRICE WAS MUCH BETTER ON AMAZON. I BOUGHT A LARGE SUPPLY AND HAVE BEEN HAPPY EVER AFTER.</li>
            <li> Great soap and last longer than the store bought stuff . Price per oz may seem more but really does last.</li>

            <li> Because I not only love this soap, but it is probably the only soap that I am not allergic to!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this soap repeatedly and will continue to do so.  Very good on the skin and not drying.  Has a nice, mild fragrance.  Migraine sufferers will not trigger a headache.</li>
            <li> great product and I love it for baths.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and was disappointed to hear from the manufacturer that this scent and all 3packs are discontinued. So to head off having to change soaps right away I decided to order my own little stockpile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the future Canis soaps made under the &#x27;Nature&#x27; line and be free of all synthetic and potentially harmful chemicals. There is a wider array of scents, plus they come in individually wrapped bars. Unfortunately the price is also higher.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased to find this item on line while  shopping at Amazon.  It literally had gotten harder to find and purchase these items  at local stores.  Everything arrived in excellent order and was affordable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the product and enjoy using it.  Extremely sarisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about a month now and I love it. It lathers easily, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at the grocery store in nyc, but then we moved to LA so I have to order it on Amazon. I love how gentle it is.</li>
            <li> I love this soap the scent is wonderful and lasts and the soap is nice and rich like lotion my skin is so much softer since i started using it</li>
            <li> very nice gentle natural soap. skin feels clean and soft afterwards. good for use on face and body.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, have used it for many years, and once again you have it now available thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> the oil soap is very very good.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Great, smells nice and very gentle on your skin. Sometimes I get psoriasis on my el owns &amp; knuckles and this soap doesn&#x27;t make it sore or itch as most soaps do. I&#x27;ve used Canus for years and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> smells good and works good.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my sensitive skin. All my body is soft and humed all day long.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have been using it for years when all of a sudden my local suplier stopped carrying.  Thank heavens for Amazon !!  there it was.  You will truly love this soap, no resude, lots of suds, very soothing.  A must try.</li>
            <li> I love the goat soap it does&#x27;nt dry my skin out like reguar soap. I would suggest this item to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Do your research. Canus products contain formaldehyde aka DMDM Hydantoin as printed on their ingredient list. Stick with the small Mom and Pop soap makers. Canus has sold out.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and its been a pain to find a soap that I liked and worked with my skin.  This soap and also the unscented version work great. Lathers well and we have hard water.  I have been using this soap for at least 6-7 years. Always have it in stock, afraid to run out!!&lt;br /&gt;It lasts fairly well too.  A all around great product.</li>
            <li> Superb product.  I have been using this soap for years. Lathers well, fresh&lt;br /&gt;Scent, moisturizers well. Highly recommend the soap.</li>
            <li> The Orchid smell is a little over-powering but the quality of the soap and the way it cleanses without drying is superior. I am hooked on Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk soap, my husbands raves about it also.</li>
