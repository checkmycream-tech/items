            <li>We got one for our dog and our daughter wanted her own.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the bristles.</li>
            <li>Great brush and worth the money!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right for me and looks so beautifully made.</li>
            <li>Great brush and got to my house very fast!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best brush!  </li>
            <li>This is the best hairbrush I have ever had, I&#x27;m never going to buy a different kind of hairbrush.</li>
            <li>My husband was truly impressed with how my hair looked after the brushing and agreed for me to get him his own wooden brush.</li>
            <li>went sulfate free in shampoo/conditioner and was experiencing a lot of static from my much beloved spornette 21 vinyl bristle paddle brush.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this brush, the feel of the brush, and the ease of it as I comb it through my hair...</li>
            <li>So comfortable!  </li>
            <li>Love the lack of &amp;#34;knobs&amp;#34; on the end of the bristles.  </li>
            <li>i love to use these everytime</li>
            <li>Lovely brush</li>
            <li>Best of all, it feels natural and comfortable on your scalp when you brush.</li>
            <li>Reduces static electricity generated by plastic or metal brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out when I brush with it.</li>
            <li>My favorite things is how it feels on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>and I just keep brushing and brushing enjoying the massage.</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite brush.  </li>
            <li>This hairbrush works better then any hairbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that will help my hair grow and be thicker over time.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and nice to look at.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause static</li>
            <li>I also have many chronic pain issues, so I was worried about my scalp.</li>
            <li>I really love this hairbrush.</li>
            <li>This is an extremely satisfying product.</li>
            <li>The best part about it - and the reason I bought it - is the shape of the wooden bristles.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I might get the boar bristle Ambassador to do even more sebum smoothing, post de-tangle.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a static problem when I use this.  </li>
            <li>Instead, the bristles feel pretty good on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Love it being so lightweight and comfortable for the hand and the hair.</li>
            <li>The internet said wood bristles would solve the static issue and help distribute the sebum to smooth my fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Not so great for soft coated dogs either.</li>
            <li>Not because I wore it out, but because I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It slides through my hair really easily.</li>
            <li>The brush goes through tangles easily without pulling on your hair.  </li>
            <li>if fine haired or fine coated.  </li>
            <li>When the brush glides through my hair it feels wonderful, and gives the scalp a little massage too.</li>
            <li>Glides through hair and leaves it smooth and healthy-looking.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Consequently, the wooden bristles glide through your hair much more smoothly and it feels good.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and I wish they made a bigger size that would be great too.</li>
            <li>and I think overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Really easy to hold and clean.</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the bristles, which makes for an easy clean.</li>
            <li>I pray that they will make these at the outstanding quality they are right now, forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very prone to static electricity, so finding a brush and comb not made of plastic or metal wasn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li>I think the bristle pad is rubber, and I don&#x27;t see any plastic anywhere, not even on the original box</li>
            <li>I love how it does not pull my hair, is easy to use with a hairdryer and get a nice smooth finish, and makes my hair shine due to retaining some of my hair</li>
            <li>Tried and true method.</li>
            <li>This is a good sturdy wooden brush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are wood and massage nicely into the scalp to stimulate hair production and it evenly spreads your natural oils in your hair.</li>
            <li>this brush is gentle on my hair compared to most plastic brushes I don&#x27;t have a hairbrush full of hair..</li>
            <li>Ambassador/Fuchs is the only wooden pin brush I&#x27;ve tried, so I have no comparison, but why keep looking when you&#x27;re already very happy?</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Overall, really nice good quality wooden brush.</li>
            <li>It detangles easily and gently.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice brush, lightweight and strong, good size for long and thick hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time in awhile I have felt moisture all throughout my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brush, but I bought another similar to it that was cheaper and worked better on my son&#x27;s (long) hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s def worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth The Price.</li>
            <li>The smell is also lovely and relaxing - overall, it’s a good investment as I’ve been using this brush for a solid month</li>
            <li>She really likes the brush but mentioned that it does not work great on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I notice less static and it massages my scalp better than my plastic brush did.  </li>
            <li>brushing my hair is pleasant and I worry less!</li>
            <li>It really works !</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how that famous $200 European wooden brush could be any better.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li>It has been used for about 1.5 years and still doing very well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was on time and The first time I used it immidiently after brushing my hair once my hair was shinier and softer.</li>
            <li>pretty to look at-</li>
            <li>This brush is so much nicer!  </li>
            <li>the handle is not too short and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li>wood pins are much better than plastic or wire; easy to clean(vacum); wood is nice; likely to last as long as one would like</li>
            <li>the bristles are good without those round tips but that is about all the positive I can say about this brush.</li>
            <li>I am very mindful of my things and have owned and used many wooden combs.</li>
            <li>Super soft and unlike plastic brushes, it doesn’t snag hair off even if it’s in tangles!</li>
            <li>Perhaps its best use would be for adding extra oils to your hair, otherwise I do not notice any more or less shedding or change in condition from my other older brushes.</li>
            <li>See positive results.</li>
            <li>the bristles did not feel strong and i was hoping the brush was bigger.  </li>
            <li>but by no means large.  </li>
            <li>distributes natural oils evenly leaving hair soft and easy to work with and run my fingers through.. which I can&#x27;t do when I wake up in the morning ...</li>
            <li>One of the things that drew me to getting a wooden brush was supposedly less static, but I have not seen nor felt a difference in the amount of static from my hair.</li>
            <li>Very high quality brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>I have waist length hair that I try hard to keep in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Gentle hairbrush.</li>
            <li>Very well made hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>and my hair does not come out as much.</li>
            <li>Feels much nicer than the plastic bristle ones.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that so few pins would be able to de-tangle my semi-thick wavy waist length mane, but happy day!</li>
            <li>only potential downside is that I thought the size was a bit small for hair below the shoulders, although it would be perfect for a mans head...</li>
            <li>After I used my first for a few months, I ordered three more.  </li>
            <li>Spending $20 on a brush seems a little ridiculous, but I&#x27;m comfortable paying more to avoid plastic and help support more environmentally responsible manufacturing.  </li>
            <li>Highly worth the price as it saves you time and weird hair from static electricity of cheap all plastic brushes.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and work well for both straight and curly hair as well as thick hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Even aside from the static issue, the brush doesn&#x27;t have those little balls on the end that gather dust.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is really no negative thing I can say about this brush.</li>
            <li>but I have sprayed it w/ lavender water a few times and now it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell, but it seems to be dispersing my natural hair oils better</li>
            <li>Still looks new.</li>
            <li>I got this as part of a new hair regiment:</li>
            <li>It was so hard to find a good wooden brush that wasn&#x27;t made in China.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product and it came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li>First wooden peg brush.</li>
            <li>Size: The brush size is a bit small, but it&#x27;s still perfectly usable even though I have large hands (for a gal) and thick, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is a little small but it will be great to travel with.</li>
            <li>It is not a huge size but it fits my hand perfectly and brushes through my long thick hair with ease.  </li>
            <li>Is there such a thing as brushing your hair too much?</li>
            <li>I have now developed an addiction to brushing my hair.</li>
            <li>but I use a wooden comb if I&#x27;m straight out of shower.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a brush that does the following, this is the brush for you:&lt;br /&gt;-sturdy and not easily broken</li>
            <li>/&gt;-distributes natural hair oil to the rest of hair</li>
            <li>They did not have tiny circular ends instead they were straight.</li>
            <li>So far it has lasted over a year.  </li>
            <li>I initially purchased 3 different types of brushes (this one, a heavy duty boar brush and a highly rated steel pin brush) and this one is our favorite.</li>
            <li>This is the first time ever i have seen white mold patches on such expensive and good quality product.  </li>
            <li>but so far I do not see any particular improvement in my hair, which is tailbone length, slightly wavy, and already healthy from no heat implements or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a short few weeks, but I feel the benefits and my hair looks better.</li>
            <li>The wooden bristles do not need to have little balls and their tips - that&#x27;s a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>I do not personally care for the small size of this brush, I may have a better opinion of it if I gotten a larger paddle version.</li>
            <li>I have noticed less hair being pulled out and less static,</li>
            <li>This brush looks very similar to the #1 All Systems brush, and both are made in Germany, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to someday learn that they were made side-by-side.  </li>
            <li>I guess wooden brushes absorb your hairs natural oils....</li>
            <li>If you want to give yourself a little treat, this brush might be right for you.  </li>
            <li>I do not live in high humidity area.</li>
            <li>I live in california and the weather is dry.</li>

            <li> if fine haired or fine coated.  </li>
            <li> When the brush glides through my hair it feels wonderful, and gives the scalp a little massage too.</li>
            <li> Glides through hair and leaves it smooth and healthy-looking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Consequently, the wooden bristles glide through your hair much more smoothly and it feels good.  </li>
            <li> and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and I wish they made a bigger size that would be great too.</li>
            <li> and I think overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Really easy to hold and clean.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the bristles, which makes for an easy clean.</li>
            <li> I pray that they will make these at the outstanding quality they are right now, forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very prone to static electricity, so finding a brush and comb not made of plastic or metal wasn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li> I think the bristle pad is rubber, and I don&#x27;t see any plastic anywhere, not even on the original box</li>
            <li> I love how it does not pull my hair, is easy to use with a hairdryer and get a nice smooth finish, and makes my hair shine due to retaining some of my hair</li>
            <li> Tried and true method.</li>
            <li> This is a good sturdy wooden brush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are wood and massage nicely into the scalp to stimulate hair production and it evenly spreads your natural oils in your hair.</li>
            <li> this brush is gentle on my hair compared to most plastic brushes I don&#x27;t have a hairbrush full of hair..</li>
            <li> Ambassador/Fuchs is the only wooden pin brush I&#x27;ve tried, so I have no comparison, but why keep looking when you&#x27;re already very happy?</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Overall, really nice good quality wooden brush.</li>
            <li> It detangles easily and gently.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush, lightweight and strong, good size for long and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time in awhile I have felt moisture all throughout my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush, but I bought another similar to it that was cheaper and worked better on my son&#x27;s (long) hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s def worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth The Price.</li>
            <li> The smell is also lovely and relaxing - overall, it’s a good investment as I’ve been using this brush for a solid month</li>
            <li> She really likes the brush but mentioned that it does not work great on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I notice less static and it massages my scalp better than my plastic brush did.  </li>
            <li> brushing my hair is pleasant and I worry less!</li>
            <li> It really works !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how that famous $200 European wooden brush could be any better.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li> It has been used for about 1.5 years and still doing very well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was on time and The first time I used it immidiently after brushing my hair once my hair was shinier and softer.</li>
            <li> pretty to look at-</li>
            <li> This brush is so much nicer!  </li>
            <li> the handle is not too short and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> wood pins are much better than plastic or wire; easy to clean(vacum); wood is nice; likely to last as long as one would like</li>
            <li> the bristles are good without those round tips but that is about all the positive I can say about this brush.</li>
            <li> I am very mindful of my things and have owned and used many wooden combs.</li>
            <li> Super soft and unlike plastic brushes, it doesn’t snag hair off even if it’s in tangles!</li>
            <li> Perhaps its best use would be for adding extra oils to your hair, otherwise I do not notice any more or less shedding or change in condition from my other older brushes.</li>
            <li> See positive results.</li>
            <li> the bristles did not feel strong and i was hoping the brush was bigger.  </li>
            <li> but by no means large.  </li>
            <li> distributes natural oils evenly leaving hair soft and easy to work with and run my fingers through.. which I can&#x27;t do when I wake up in the morning ...</li>
            <li> One of the things that drew me to getting a wooden brush was supposedly less static, but I have not seen nor felt a difference in the amount of static from my hair.</li>
            <li> Very high quality brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> I have waist length hair that I try hard to keep in good condition.  </li>
            <li> Gentle hairbrush.</li>
            <li> Very well made hairbrush.  </li>
            <li> and my hair does not come out as much.</li>
            <li> Feels much nicer than the plastic bristle ones.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that so few pins would be able to de-tangle my semi-thick wavy waist length mane, but happy day!</li>
            <li> only potential downside is that I thought the size was a bit small for hair below the shoulders, although it would be perfect for a mans head...</li>
            <li> After I used my first for a few months, I ordered three more.  </li>
            <li> Spending $20 on a brush seems a little ridiculous, but I&#x27;m comfortable paying more to avoid plastic and help support more environmentally responsible manufacturing.  </li>
            <li> Highly worth the price as it saves you time and weird hair from static electricity of cheap all plastic brushes.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and work well for both straight and curly hair as well as thick hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Even aside from the static issue, the brush doesn&#x27;t have those little balls on the end that gather dust.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is really no negative thing I can say about this brush.</li>
            <li> but I have sprayed it w/ lavender water a few times and now it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell, but it seems to be dispersing my natural hair oils better</li>
            <li> Still looks new.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a new hair regiment:</li>
            <li> It was so hard to find a good wooden brush that wasn&#x27;t made in China.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product and it came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> First wooden peg brush.</li>
            <li> Size: The brush size is a bit small, but it&#x27;s still perfectly usable even though I have large hands (for a gal) and thick, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is a little small but it will be great to travel with.</li>
            <li> It is not a huge size but it fits my hand perfectly and brushes through my long thick hair with ease.  </li>
            <li> Is there such a thing as brushing your hair too much?</li>
            <li> I have now developed an addiction to brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> but I use a wooden comb if I&#x27;m straight out of shower.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a brush that does the following, this is the brush for you:&lt;br /&gt;-sturdy and not easily broken</li>
            <li> /&gt;-distributes natural hair oil to the rest of hair</li>
            <li> They did not have tiny circular ends instead they were straight.</li>
            <li> So far it has lasted over a year.  </li>
            <li> I initially purchased 3 different types of brushes (this one, a heavy duty boar brush and a highly rated steel pin brush) and this one is our favorite.</li>
            <li> This is the first time ever i have seen white mold patches on such expensive and good quality product.  </li>
            <li> but so far I do not see any particular improvement in my hair, which is tailbone length, slightly wavy, and already healthy from no heat implements or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a short few weeks, but I feel the benefits and my hair looks better.</li>
            <li> The wooden bristles do not need to have little balls and their tips - that&#x27;s a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> I do not personally care for the small size of this brush, I may have a better opinion of it if I gotten a larger paddle version.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair being pulled out and less static,</li>
            <li> This brush looks very similar to the #1 All Systems brush, and both are made in Germany, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to someday learn that they were made side-by-side.  </li>
            <li> I guess wooden brushes absorb your hairs natural oils....</li>
            <li> If you want to give yourself a little treat, this brush might be right for you.  </li>
            <li> I do not live in high humidity area.</li>
            <li> I live in california and the weather is dry.</li>
            <li> One brush sheds a pin nearly every time it is used but the other two are holding up well</li>
            <li> I was skeptical before I bought it though it&#x27;s very true..</li>
            <li> smelled icky at first</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has a crazy head of hair (super thick, long, and easily tangled).  </li>
            <li> you have delicate hair that breaks easily - highly recommend this long lasting brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably have this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had long hairs</li>
            <li> Also, does not cause breakage of dry hair.</li>
            <li> despite it being winter and my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks it caught mold all over the wooden body.</li>
            <li> Using this hairbrush, it only took less than 1 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the little hole in the middle of it that exudes air when mashed..</li>
            <li> Hard to find a wooden brush with wooden bristles.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> (they only have 2 missing pins each).</li>
            <li> Just a year later, I am having to replace one of the three brushes due to missing pins.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the brush is too small or too big.</li>
            <li> They look nylon to me and the entire thing is a large disappointment.</li>
            <li> Those little balls are used so that the bristles don&#x27;t hurt your scalp with their sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> bought the one for people because of the Prime shipping and the slightly lower price (compared to the #1 All Systems product).  </li>
            <li> I have used it on slightly damp hair</li>
            <li> also ive noticed a lot less breakage in my hair ...</li>
            <li> I feel as if because of this little guy</li>
            <li> a massive brush that takes up unnecessary drawer space</li>
            <li> Tired of plastic hairbrushes, I decided to splurge and purchase a wooden brush.  </li>
            <li> Stiff and harsh on the scalp esp</li>
            <li> Less pain in my scalp because I WANT to brush!</li>
            <li> (And he&#x27;s not easily impressed!)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Which was slightly odd and confusing, I&#x27;m guessing there was a mix up in packaging?</li>
            <li> As others have said, it&#x27;s a small brush (the head is about the size of a deck of cards).</li>
            <li> No static as the bristles are all wood.</li>
            <li> my hair is very thin and fragile.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to hold onto.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have balls that capture and tug on your hair, tug on the bristles themselves and rip them out of the hairbrush, and make it hard to remove hair that gets tangled in the bristles.  </li>
            <li> I have thick coily hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that doesn&#x27;t respond to boar&#x27;s hair, and I don&#x27;t like using plastic brushes that damage the hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Rather inflexible bristles.  </li>
            <li> This is an expensive brush and i cannot return/replace it now as i just passed the return window.</li>
            <li> As they are narrower at the end than at the base, without the sphere at the tip so common on plastic bristles, lint doesn&#x27;t gather and stick to the brush, and collected hair is easier to pull off.</li>
            <li> OMG this is a real game changer!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Is there such a thing as brushing your hair too much? I love the smell of this brush, the feel of the brush, and the ease of it as I comb it through my hair... I feel as if because of this little guy I have now developed an addiction to brushing my hair. I was skeptical before I bought it though it&#x27;s very true.. distributes natural oils evenly leaving hair soft and easy to work with and run my fingers through.. which I can&#x27;t do when I wake up in the morning ... until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every nickel and dime .. best investment I&#x27;ve made for hair since coconut conditioner!</li>
            <li> It really works ! I have thick coily hair. This is the first time in awhile I have felt moisture all throughout my hair!</li>
            <li> This brush is a little small but it will be great to travel with.</li>
            <li> So comfortable!  Helps keep my frizzy, lightweight, flyaway hair tamed.  Love the lack of &amp;#34;knobs&amp;#34; on the end of the bristles.  Glides through hair and leaves it smooth and healthy-looking.  As others have said, it&#x27;s a small brush (the head is about the size of a deck of cards).</li>
            <li> i love to use these everytime i comb my hair.</li>
            <li> Lovely brush but by no means large.  It&#x27;s rather child-size so it&#x27;s hard to hold onto.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairbrush I have ever had, I&#x27;m never going to buy a different kind of hairbrush. I pray that they will make these at the outstanding quality they are right now, forever.</li>
            <li> Seems quality and works well, but it does make my hair staticky.</li>
            <li> The highest quality best performing brush out there! Luxury in every stroke. No static as the bristles are all wood. Highly worth the price as it saves you time and weird hair from static electricity of cheap all plastic brushes. Very highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Best brush ever! Very comfortable and in great quality. It&#x27;s def worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that doesn&#x27;t respond to boar&#x27;s hair, and I don&#x27;t like using plastic brushes that damage the hair. That leaves brushes with wooden pins! What a difference! When the brush glides through my hair it feels wonderful, and gives the scalp a little massage too. It never pulls at or snags my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Ambassador/Fuchs is the only wooden pin brush I&#x27;ve tried, so I have no comparison, but why keep looking when you&#x27;re already very happy? I don&#x27;t see how that famous $200 European wooden brush could be any better. Great brush, excellent price, beautiful natural wood design. I highly recommend this hair brush.</li>
            <li> this brush is gentle on my hair compared to most plastic brushes I don&#x27;t have a hairbrush full of hair.. my hair is very thin and fragile. I have not had one pin fall out and I had this brush for a while. good deal</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve ordered this hairbrush. Not because I wore it out, but because I loved it so much I wanted to have one in my gym bag. I love how it does not pull my hair, is easy to use with a hairdryer and get a nice smooth finish, and makes my hair shine due to retaining some of my hair oils.&lt;br /&gt;If you have delicate hair that breaks easily - highly recommend this long lasting brush.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of pet grooming supply companies (Chris Christensen and #1 All Systems to name two) that include pin brushes with wooden bristles in their product lines.  Wood bristles massage the animal and brush through without pulling or breaking hairs. I confess I purchased this to use on my medium-coated Ragdoll cat, and she loves it.  The pins seem well-rooted into the pad, and the handle is perhaps a touch lighter than I would have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the one for people because of the Prime shipping and the slightly lower price (compared to the #1 All Systems product).  This brush looks very similar to the #1 All Systems brush, and both are made in Germany, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to someday learn that they were made side-by-side.  For my needs, this has been a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this brush.  Spending $20 on a brush seems a little ridiculous, but I&#x27;m comfortable paying more to avoid plastic and help support more environmentally responsible manufacturing.  Notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Origin: Made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Size: The brush size is a bit small, but it&#x27;s still perfectly usable even though I have large hands (for a gal) and thick, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Materials: The box says that the brush is not made from endangered wood.  I do note that the importer&#x27;s barcode label indicates that the brush is bamboo, not ashwood as described, and judging from appearances it does indeed look like bamboo.  This isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker for me, but I&#x27;m mentioning it in case it&#x27;s a deal-breaker for you.  I think the bristle pad is rubber, and I don&#x27;t see any plastic anywhere, not even on the original box (although it came in a ziplock-style bag).</li>
            <li> Hard to find a wooden brush with wooden bristles.  We got one for our dog and our daughter wanted her own.  She&#x27;s very happy with the quality and performance of this brush.</li>
            <li> If you want to give yourself a little treat, this brush might be right for you.  I&#x27;m very prone to static electricity, so finding a brush and comb not made of plastic or metal wasn&#x27;t easy.  Even aside from the static issue, the brush doesn&#x27;t have those little balls on the end that gather dust.  It&#x27;s extremely easy to clean.  Best of all, it feels natural and comfortable on your scalp when you brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush.  Reduces static electricity generated by plastic or metal brushes.  Also, does not cause breakage of dry hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush!!! It is the perfect size for me. It is not a huge size but it fits my hand perfectly and brushes through my long thick hair with ease.  I have used it on slightly damp hair but I use a wooden comb if I&#x27;m straight out of shower. I love that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out when I brush with it. Before this brush hand fulls of hair were coming out, now the last 3 days with this brush I have 4/5 strands come out in this brush. My favorite things is how it feels on my scalp.  It feels amazing and I just keep brushing and brushing enjoying the massage.</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite brush.  I use it as a scalp stimulator and for untangling my hair before shampooing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> Gentle hairbrush. See positive results. Hair does look shinier and scalp feels great. Quick shipping. Tried and true method. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush works better then any hairbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  The wooden bristles do not need to have little balls and their tips - that&#x27;s a huge plus.  Those little balls are used so that the bristles don&#x27;t hurt your scalp with their sharp edges.  But wood doesn&#x27;t do that so you don&#x27;t have balls that capture and tug on your hair, tug on the bristles themselves and rip them out of the hairbrush, and make it hard to remove hair that gets tangled in the bristles.  Consequently, the wooden bristles glide through your hair much more smoothly and it feels good.  This is the brush to get.</li>
            <li> Very well made hairbrush.  I was so happy to find a brush with wood pins instead of plastic!  I notice less static and it massages my scalp better than my plastic brush did.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell, but it seems to be dispersing my natural hair oils better and I&#x27;m sure that will help my hair grow and be thicker over time.</li>
            <li> This brush is everything I was hoping it would be. If you are looking for a brush that does the following, this is the brush for you:&lt;br /&gt;-sturdy and not easily broken&lt;br /&gt;-good quality and great craftsmanship&lt;br /&gt;-smells like Ashwood and leaves your hair smelling that way&lt;br /&gt;-bristles are made of wood and do not fall out easily&lt;br /&gt;-good size for daily use and travel&lt;br /&gt;-not a massive brush that takes up unnecessary drawer space&lt;br /&gt;-distributes natural hair oil to the rest of hair&lt;br /&gt;-does not cause friction&lt;br /&gt;-reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;-massages scalp and feels amazing to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is really no negative thing I can say about this brush. I now look forward to brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> Glides threw my hair and massages my scalp. Would order again.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Best hairbrush I&#x27;ve used in years.</li>
            <li> Very high quality brush for the price.  Comfortable and nice to look at.  It has been used for about 1.5 years and still doing very well!</li>
            <li> It was so hard to find a good wooden brush that wasn&#x27;t made in China.  This is a very nice brush, lightweight and strong, good size for long and thick hair.  And made in Germany, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product and it came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this hairbrush! It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or tangle. It doesn&#x27;t cause static and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this wooden brush after relying on various plastic ones. OMG this is a real game changer! Never mind all the potions and lotions, the biggest difference will come from this brush!&lt;br /&gt;Now i know what happens to the look of your hair when the scalp is massaged as you brush and the oils are distributed from the scalp through the ends of your hair! My husband was truly impressed with how my hair looked after the brushing and agreed for me to get him his own wooden brush. (And he&#x27;s not easily impressed!)&lt;br /&gt;The only potential downside is that I thought the size was a bit small for hair below the shoulders, although it would be perfect for a mans head...</li>
            <li> Worth The Price. I did some research and came across that using a wooden brush instead of plastic brush can help your hair grow. I guess wooden brushes absorb your hairs natural oils....&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was on time and The first time I used it immidiently after brushing my hair once my hair was shinier and softer. love it! Must Have. also ive noticed a lot less breakage in my hair ...and my hair does not come out as much.Whereas I used a plastic brush it seemed like all my damn hair was comin out!</li>
            <li> This brush arrived in good condition. I really liked the bristles. They did not have tiny circular ends instead they were straight. In less than 2 weeks it caught mold all over the wooden body. it has white patches all over now. I wish it would have come with instructions of how this could be avoided if it has a tendency to get mold. This is an expensive brush and i cannot return/replace it now as i just passed the return window. I do not live in high humidity area. I live in california and the weather is dry. i never put the brush over the sink. I am very mindful of my things and have owned and used many wooden combs. This is the first time ever i have seen white mold patches on such expensive and good quality product.  I wish this would have worked for me.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Good quality. Been using it daily now for about 6mo, and it has held up well. Still looks new.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush, feels really good on my scalp. Was shipped on time. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for me. I have thick, curly, shoulder length hair. I also have many chronic pain issues, so I was worried about my scalp. This brush can get though my hair and doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp. Instead, the bristles feel pretty good on my scalp. It works for detangling as well as styling.</li>
            <li> I really love this hairbrush. It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and I wish they made a bigger size that would be great too.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush! It feels amazing on my scalp and I think overall it&#x27;s a great product. Really easy to hold and clean. One of the things that drew me to getting a wooden brush was supposedly less static, but I have not seen nor felt a difference in the amount of static from my hair. Could just be me I guess, hopefully I&#x27;ll find something to help that issue, but it&#x27;s not this brush. Also, the packaging seemed to be for a boar bristle brush? Which was slightly odd and confusing, I&#x27;m guessing there was a mix up in packaging? Overall, really nice good quality wooden brush.</li>
            <li> makes my scalp feel good. pretty to look at- smelled icky at first but I have sprayed it w/ lavender water a few times and now it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Tired of plastic hairbrushes, I decided to splurge and purchase a wooden brush.  I was having issues with the bristles always falling out.  This brush is so much nicer!  I have noticed less hair being pulled out and less static, despite it being winter and my hair is dry.  Great brush and worth the money!  Hopefully it will last a lot longer than plastic.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely satisfying product. Super soft and unlike plastic brushes, it doesn’t snag hair off even if it’s in tangles! The smell is also lovely and relaxing - overall, it’s a good investment as I’ve been using this brush for a solid month and it’s still in great condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush, but I bought another similar to it that was cheaper and worked better on my son&#x27;s (long) hair.</li>
            <li> First wooden peg brush. I LOVE this brush! brushing my hair is pleasant and I worry less! Less pain in my scalp because I WANT to brush! And it smells awesome! Unlike its plastic counter part. I will never go back! A gift from my husband for x-mas. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> This is a good sturdy wooden brush.  The best part about it - and the reason I bought it - is the shape of the wooden bristles.  As they are narrower at the end than at the base, without the sphere at the tip so common on plastic bristles, lint doesn&#x27;t gather and stick to the brush, and collected hair is easier to pull off.</li>
            <li> The best brush I have ever had! Love it being so lightweight and comfortable for the hand and the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has a crazy head of hair (super thick, long, and easily tangled).  She really likes the brush but mentioned that it does not work great on wet hair.  I ended up buying a second brush for my mother in law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this thing is a really solid German made product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is the second one I&#x60;ve gotten. I decided to get a second because my daughter is always using it when I need it. She also loves it. It slides through my hair really easily. Feels much nicer than the plastic bristle ones. Your hair does not catch on the bristles.</li>
            <li> Like the wood look and wooden bristles. The hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the bristles, which makes for an easy clean. I&#x27;ll probably have this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly great! I got this as part of a new hair regiment: went sulfate free in shampoo/conditioner and was experiencing a lot of static from my much beloved spornette 21 vinyl bristle paddle brush. The internet said wood bristles would solve the static issue and help distribute the sebum to smooth my fly-aways. I was skeptical that so few pins would be able to de-tangle my semi-thick wavy waist length mane, but happy day! It works! I recommend this for anyone in a similar situation - the handle is not too short and the quality is top notch. I might get the boar bristle Ambassador to do even more sebum smoothing, post de-tangle.</li>
            <li> I do not personally care for the small size of this brush, I may have a better opinion of it if I gotten a larger paddle version. I have only been using it for a few weeks but so far I do not see any particular improvement in my hair, which is tailbone length, slightly wavy, and already healthy from no heat implements or harsh chemicals. Perhaps its best use would be for adding extra oils to your hair, otherwise I do not notice any more or less shedding or change in condition from my other older brushes.</li>
            <li> the bristles did not feel strong and i was hoping the brush was bigger.  i am returning it</li>
            <li> I had long hairs so it took me about 5 minutes to comb my hair before. Using this hairbrush, it only took less than 1 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;And I bought it for my mom later, and she also loves it.</li>
            <li> Great brush and got to my house very fast!</li>
            <li> wood pins are much better than plastic or wire; easy to clean(vacum); wood is nice; likely to last as long as one would like</li>
            <li> Stiff and harsh on the scalp esp if fine haired or fine coated.  Rather inflexible bristles.  Not so great for soft coated dogs either.</li>
            <li> Very good brush. Does the job</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brush!  I have now ordered 3 of them - one for me and one for each of my daughters.  The brush goes through tangles easily without pulling on your hair.  All 3 of us have thigh length hair so a good brush is a necessity. They are easy to clean and work well for both straight and curly hair as well as thick hair. I initially purchased 3 different types of brushes (this one, a heavy duty boar brush and a highly rated steel pin brush) and this one is our favorite. I cannot recommend these enough!  UPDATE: Just a year later, I am having to replace one of the three brushes due to missing pins. One brush sheds a pin nearly every time it is used but the other two are holding up well (they only have 2 missing pins each).</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush. I was researching wooden brushes for a while and this one fulfilled all I hoped with using wood and not plastic. The bristles are wood and massage nicely into the scalp to stimulate hair production and it evenly spreads your natural oils in your hair. I have only been using this for a short few weeks, but I feel the benefits and my hair looks better. I don&#x27;t think the brush is too small or too big. It&#x27;s just right for me and looks so beautifully made.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair that I try hard to keep in good condition.  I used to use a Widu brush ($45).  Now I use these.  The wooden bristles help distribute the oil from the scalp to the ends.  I don&#x27;t have a static problem when I use this.  It detangles easily and gently.  After I used my first for a few months, I ordered three more.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about not finding one when this wears out.  So far it has lasted over a year.  It should last several years if my dog doesn&#x27;t decide to chew on it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the little hole in the middle of it that exudes air when mashed.. the bristles are good without those round tips but that is about all the positive I can say about this brush. They look nylon to me and the entire thing is a large disappointment. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
