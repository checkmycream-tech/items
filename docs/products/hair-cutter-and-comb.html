            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>I am very happy.</li>
            <li>and it cuts wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This was so good, I bought another one!!!</li>
            <li>Very good price.  </li>
            <li>Product came within the anticipated shipping time and was in great shape.</li>
            <li>This product works great.  </li>
            <li>Broke in no time at all, Great idea though</li>

            <li>Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>nice blade , dont have to go out get a hair cut .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that you can replace the blade in it when it gets dulll</li>
            <li>very easy to use.</li>
            <li>purchased this item to keep my bangs trimmed between hair appointments to great success.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly fine!</li>
            <li>Very cheap.</li>
            <li>-  but perhaps with a woman&#x27;s more lengthy hair, is another story.</li>
            <li>decided to give this Tinkle Hair Cutter a chance, and I love the way it cuts my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like it even better than the Trim Comb that I had, for all those years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used razor combs for many years.  </li>
            <li>absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I am bald on top with just the sides that have to be cut.</li>
            <li>I imagine it would work great for any kind of human hair.</li>
            <li>very useable, good blades.</li>
            <li>Bought two of these critters (because of one reviewer saying handles easily broke).  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to control.  </li>
            <li>Its a perfect little tool to have to touch up your bangs</li>
            <li>Cheap, but the price was cheap.</li>
            <li>Available at any pharmacy like Walgreens, RiteAid, etc.  </li>
            <li>It is great for short hair cuts.</li>
            <li>pleased  simple and effective.</li>
            <li>The more parallel the trimmer is to the hair you&#x27;re trimming, the more hair that is cut.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll quickly get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>Have only used it twice, and am very pleased with it</li>
            <li>This comb is very helpful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>(it did the good job I expected!).  </li>
            <li>I like the look of my hair better than having it done at a hair cuttery because it gives a smoother, more tousled appearance to my thick hair.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li>Hate to pay full price for half a haircut, ha ha!  Had something similar to this, more compact, a great many years ago, my father gave to me to use during the many months</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t work very well, and you can&#x27;t change the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Adjusting the angle of the trimmer determines how much hair you cut off with each stroke.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>And the nice thing is you can replace the double-edged razor blades when they get dull.  </li>
            <li>have only used it once, but it looks like it is going to hold up pretty well, and you can replace the blades.  </li>
            <li>I am a 65 year old male, balding on back top, hair seems to bulk up on sides and around back of me neck between haircuts.  </li>
            <li>I might as well buy several of the razors at a time as the cost of each is certainly reasonable and will probably bundle purchase from now on.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used a razor comb, be very careful the first time.  </li>
            <li>Used to help feather wigs and sew-ins, love the precision of the fine or wide blades hen cutting.</li>
            <li>This little comb works really well!</li>
            <li>Basically, I just moisten my hair with a little water, brush it like I usually do, and then use the long-comb side for trimming longer hair on top or the short-comb side for shorter hair on the sides and back.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really like this one because it&#x27;s small and lightweight</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> Decided to go back, and try this again now  -  at least to tide me over for any real haircut that may be due, and stretching things out some.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but this little razor trimmer works very well and helps keep my hair neatly trimmed in between haircuts.  </li>
            <li> She has strong, hard wire like hair on the top and very thin fluffy hair closer to the base and this cuts right through it.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp and it&#x27;s easy to cut a big, ugly chunk out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Razor isn&#x27;t sharp, at all.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> My hope was to use this on my long haired cat that tends to have a few knots but his hair was too thick for this comb.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut my hair at all waste of money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find a new Trim Comb, so I bought a similar looking product from Conair, which I hated.  </li>
            <li> Pulls hair so bad we can barely stand the pain.  </li>
            <li> I had this when I was a kid growing up in a poor family.</li>
            <li> Once I got used to the angle I needed to use it reduced the cutting time in half!  </li>
            <li> Waste of money, i am not sure if they sent me a dull razor, i just threw the crap in the bin!</li>
            <li> I have increased clientele and decreased cutting time.  </li>
            <li> This product works amazingly at cutting her her.</li>
            <li> damage your hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> we got this to cut grandsons hair but it pulls so bad he runs every time he see&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> this is crap, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li> This little comb works really well! I have thick curly hair and it worked really well for me. I will definitely buy another in the future.</li>
            <li> very useable, good blades.</li>
            <li> Very cheap. Didn&#x27;t cut my hair at all waste of money.</li>
            <li> A good quality Hair Cutter &amp; Comb.</li>
            <li> nice blade , dont have to go out get a hair cut . save money ...</li>
            <li> I am a 65 year old male, balding on back top, hair seems to bulk up on sides and around back of me neck between haircuts.  Hate to pay full price for half a haircut, ha ha!  Had something similar to this, more compact, a great many years ago, my father gave to me to use during the many months I was out at Sea (am retired Coast Guard).  Decided to go back, and try this again now  -  at least to tide me over for any real haircut that may be due, and stretching things out some.  Bought two of these critters (because of one reviewer saying handles easily broke).  Have only used it twice, and am very pleased with it (it did the good job I expected!).  Handles are sturdy enough (for my locks)  -  but perhaps with a woman&#x27;s more lengthy hair, is another story.</li>
            <li> Cuts his hair like a barber. Arrived quickly and at a very reasonable price.Would recommend this to everyone that needs a trim.</li>
            <li> Used to help feather wigs and sew-ins, love the precision of the fine or wide blades hen cutting. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> This razor comb is just what I need to trim the curls off the back of my neck since I don&#x27;t get to the barber as often as I used too.</li>
            <li> I used to have something called a Trim Comb.  I used that to cut my hair for about 30 years, until I lost it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find a new Trim Comb, so I bought a similar looking product from Conair, which I hated.  It just didn&#x27;t work very well, and you can&#x27;t change the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this Tinkle Hair Cutter a chance, and I love the way it cuts my hair.  I like it even better than the Trim Comb that I had, for all those years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once, but it looks like it is going to hold up pretty well, and you can replace the blades.  I am very happy.</li>
            <li> this is crap, it doesn&#x27;t work. I bought it to do my dog&#x27;s hair but it just kept getting stuck. don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this to cut my dog&#x27;s hair. She doesn&#x27;t like to sit still to use the scissors and she hates the clippers. This product works amazingly at cutting her her. She has strong, hard wire like hair on the top and very thin fluffy hair closer to the base and this cuts right through it. I imagine it would work great for any kind of human hair.</li>
            <li> Cheap, but the price was cheap.</li>
            <li> My hope was to use this on my long haired cat that tends to have a few knots but his hair was too thick for this comb.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but this little razor trimmer works very well and helps keep my hair neatly trimmed in between haircuts.  And the nice thing is you can replace the double-edged razor blades when they get dull.  Available at any pharmacy like Walgreens, RiteAid, etc.  Be advised, though:  There are no instructions included but you can Google/YouTube how-to guidelines.  Basically, I just moisten my hair with a little water, brush it like I usually do, and then use the long-comb side for trimming longer hair on top or the short-comb side for shorter hair on the sides and back.  Adjusting the angle of the trimmer determines how much hair you cut off with each stroke.  The more parallel the trimmer is to the hair you&#x27;re trimming, the more hair that is cut.  You&#x27;ll quickly get the hang of it.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> i used something similar (not on amazon) a couple years ago to trim my son&#x27;s hair, it worked well and i saw it well priced at amazon. Waste of money, i am not sure if they sent me a dull razor, i just threw the crap in the bin!</li>
            <li> Pulls hair so bad we can barely stand the pain.  I bought a different, more expensive one after 1 use of this one.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> pleased  simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Once I got used to the angle I needed to use it reduced the cutting time in half!  Used scissors to mark the guideline for the cut and used the razor from that point on.  I prefer the razor cut on people that have gray hair as it causes the hair to lay smoother unlike the blunt cut of a scissor.  I have increased clientele and decreased cutting time.  Con:  Changing the blade is a hassle.  I might as well buy several of the razors at a time as the cost of each is certainly reasonable and will probably bundle purchase from now on.</li>
            <li> This comb is very helpful and easy to use. It is great for short hair cuts. I don&#x27;t know how it would work for longer hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut hair at all</li>
            <li> Its a perfect little tool to have to touch up your bangs and it cuts wonderfully. Very sharp. Plus, u cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> Comb came just as described and does the job that it is intended to perform. Product came within the anticipated shipping time and was in great shape. No complaints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item to keep my bangs trimmed between hair appointments to great success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used razor combs for many years.  Helps keep my short hair neat between haircuts.  I really like this one because it&#x27;s small and lightweight so it&#x27;s easy to control.  Also, it has a regular handle rather than a comb-style handle, so no teeth to cut into your hands during use.  If you&#x27;ve never used a razor comb, be very careful the first time.  The blades are very sharp and it&#x27;s easy to cut a big, ugly chunk out of your hair.</li>
            <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> absolutely love it. very easy to use. I like the look of my hair better than having it done at a hair cuttery because it gives a smoother, more tousled appearance to my thick hair. I am a girl with a pixie btw.</li>
            <li> I had this when I was a kid growing up in a poor family. This saves me $ 15.00 every time I get a hair cut. I am bald on top with just the sides that have to be cut. Barbers just rip off bald people. This was so good, I bought another one!!!</li>
            <li> Razor isn&#x27;t sharp, at all. All it does is stretch/damage your hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly fine!</li>
            <li> This product works great.  Very good price.  It&#x27;s also nice that you can replace the blade in it when it gets dulll</li>
            <li> Does a good job. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> we got this to cut grandsons hair but it pulls so bad he runs every time he see&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Broke in no time at all, Great idea though</li>
