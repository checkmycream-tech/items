            <li>The separate tubes is a good idea.  </li>
            <li>Good product for a good price.</li>
            <li>Cover girl is one of the best lasting lipstick ( very good).</li>
            <li>I am 48 and love lipstick!</li>
            <li>The product works great - goes on easily &amp; stays on for hours, even through eating &amp; drinking.</li>
            <li>I do like covergirl outlast lipcolor and it works amazingly, in fact if i go to bed with my makeup on its still there in the morning</li>
            <li>The color is a bit fader than the image, but still a nice color &amp; a good lip-grip :)</li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>I still use it and it looks nice, just not one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t resist purchasing it at such a great price!</li>
            <li>I have used years and love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have been using the Outlast All Day Lipcolour for years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;They have now stopping making my colour , #825 Raisin Satin.</li>
            <li>I love not having to reapply all day.</li>
            <li>A lovely color -</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I wear 542 and 555 depending on whether I&#x27;m wearing warm or cool colors.</li>
            <li>Amazing and the color is exactly like picture on my lips</li>
            <li>Wait one full minute, keeping lips from touching.</li>
            <li>I find the smell just fine, not funky to me at all.</li>
            <li>and I spent a good bit of $ doing so, but this brand works so well, and I am still able to use the too light or too dark colors by mixing, and thankfully these go on sale often or can be found at a great price through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it&#x27;s important to follow the right steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)tips and tricks and you will be as happy as I am with TRUE REAL long lasting lip color.</li>
            <li>If you mix anything with Outlast it does something to the protective no wear cover coat (the clear \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; top coat).</li>
            <li>If it is the lipstick will just flake right off.</li>
            <li>use mytips and tricks and you will be as happy as I am with TRUE REAL long lasting lip color.</li>
            <li>Right after you put the lipstick on be sure to fix any errors such as smudging, or areas out of line because once it dries it is</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>(the color on the box is pretty off</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product overall</li>
            <li>Not as pink as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rub your lips completely clear with a clean cloth prior to applying.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted, fast service, A++++</li>
            <li>Got just what I wanted - - - I hope this shade will be available in the future.  </li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast ship.</li>
            <li>especially if the meal has oils/fats in it, but NOTHING like how it would look if it were the regular kind of lip stick.</li>
            <li>But the color is a bit dark for me as I am quite fair-skinned, so I either mix it with a lighter shade (that I feel is too light for me) or wipe a good bit off immediately after applying, to lessen the tone a little.</li>
            <li>Over the last 13 years people have asked me if I had my lips tattooed with color since my lipstick is NEVER smudged, faded, or shows signs of wear after a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn it without incident (no rub off)</li>
            <li>and I was lucky enough to choose a decent colour online.</li>
            <li>This is the color lipstick that I like and it is getting more and more difficult to find.</li>
            <li>Besides the color though the product in general is very satisfactory!</li>
            <li>but right after you put it on or within a short period of time after applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was having trouble finding this lip color in the store, and was pleased to find it at an amazingly modest price!</li>
            <li>I live in a part of the country where girly girls who are witnessed reapplying lipstick might be considered an oddity.  </li>
            <li>there a new name for #825 now , does anyone know.</li>
            <li>When I love a product this much, I&#x27;m always afraid that it will no longer be available.  </li>
            <li>I constantly find myself throughout the day wiping the lipstick off and reapplying it again because after an hour of wearing the lipstick, it becomes very clumpy!</li>
            <li>Apply the clear coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reapply the clear coat throughout the day to keep lips shiny and moist.</li>
            <li>only downside for me is that I go through the clear coat so much faster than the color.</li>
            <li>For those who complain about dryness - you can buy just tubes of the clear coat moisturizing sticks and apply whenever you like.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day for me and even when it starts to fade, it looks natural.</li>
            <li>No chapstick, old lipstick, lotion, or anything else can be on your lips.</li>
            <li>Be prepared for lots of questions :) I get at least once a week, your lipstick did not come off, or yours didn&#x27;t smudge, or when do you reapply your lipstick.</li>
            <li>and it really does last.</li>
            <li>This comes off readily while eating, is a bit dry, and the additional lip balm could be combined with the lipstick.</li>
            <li>I would have to say that my only complaint is that it appears to be a pinkish tone, but when I got it it was more of a purple tone.</li>
            <li>When I get my teeth cleaned the whole staff has to come in and see for themselves that I did not get once single</li>
            <li>Thankfully you can now buy the clear coat separately, so it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li>That clear applicator is the actual sealer that keeps the lipstick in place...</li>
            <li>Lips have to be fully natural prior to applying!</li>
            <li>I use the lip shine/moisturizing tube several times before reapplying color is necessary, so I really wish it came in a larger tube.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the way lipstick looks, but hated actually wearing it because it rubs off so quickly.</li>
            <li>Do not apply clear coat until lipstick color is fully dry.</li>
            <li>HAVING LIPSTICK THAT NEVER SMUDGES OR RUBS OFF - imagine eating at a find dining restaurant and wiping your mouth with the WHITE cloth napkin and not a single outline of your lips left behind!!!&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>

            <li> HAVING LIPSTICK THAT NEVER SMUDGES OR RUBS OFF - imagine eating at a find dining restaurant and wiping your mouth with the WHITE cloth napkin and not a single outline of your lips left behind!!!&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge and stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> This allows me to apply a thin layer that does not goop up or spread unevenly but still delivers a smooth, solid color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands that \\&quot;claim\\&quot; to do the same thing</li>
            <li> only ways I have found to get the lipstick off without rubbing my lips off or literally sleeping it off is putting any other lipstick or chap stick on my lips.</li>
            <li> Apply to dry lips with NOTHING on them.</li>
            <li> This allows the color to dry and not flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now once the clear moisturizing coat is on you can eat anything including greasy chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, and anything else you can wrap your lips around without smudging or rubbing off your lipstick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lipstick makes my lips very dry and crusty looking.</li>
            <li> I have tried other stains that felt like I had paint on my lips, this one doesn&#x27;t feel like that at all.</li>
            <li> Do not use any other product or it will cause the color to flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other lipsticks, you don&#x27;t have to put two or three coats on to get the color you need.</li>
            <li> the color does last but it rubs off if you were to touch your lips to other things and also it makes your lips very dry and super crusty looking as if you need to exfoilate your lips bad!!!</li>
            <li> A LITTLE DRYNESS OR</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t eat or drink for at least a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I opened the package and the item was not only out of the box, but the cap was open and the lips sick looked like it was used.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my lips or just the product</li>
            <li> It was hard to find shades that work for me</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anyone reminding you to wear it thin.</li>
            <li> i got and ugly purple like dark purple color</li>
            <li> but it dries out my lips really bad.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> This color looks great on my lips and I couldn&#x27;t resist purchasing it at such a great price! Thanks!</li>
            <li> The color is a bit fader than the image, but still a nice color &amp; a good lip-grip :)</li>
            <li> Lasts all day for me and even when it starts to fade, it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I am 48 and love lipstick! I just got braces and my lipstick I have used for 15 years smudged all over my braces. I tried this product in #538 Wine to Five,and it is awesome!!! It doesn&#x27;t smudge and stays on all day long. I am so happy that I got this product and will continue to buy even after the braces come off my teeth! I find the smell just fine, not funky to me at all. I have tried other stains that felt like I had paint on my lips, this one doesn&#x27;t feel like that at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my lips or just the product but it dries out my lips really bad. I bought four different colors at ulta and had to return them all.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and the item was not only out of the box, but the cap was open and the lips sick looked like it was used. I am so upset.</li>
            <li> Got just what I wanted - - - I hope this shade will be available in the future.  I have used years and love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing and the color is exactly like picture on my lips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the way lipstick looks, but hated actually wearing it because it rubs off so quickly. No more! I put on Covergirl Outlast once in the morning and it stays on all day without smudging off on anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s important to follow the right steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply to dry lips with NOTHING on them. No chap stick, residue, water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I wipe off all the excess color from the wand using the rim of the tube. This allows me to apply a thin layer that does not goop up or spread unevenly but still delivers a smooth, solid color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Wait one full minute, keeping lips from touching. This allows the color to dry and not flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply the clear coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Don&#x27;t eat or drink for at least a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Reapply the clear coat throughout the day to keep lips shiny and moist. Do not use any other product or it will cause the color to flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Remove with vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought four different colors and the color as it appears in the tube is the same as it appeared on my lips (the color on the box is pretty off though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside for me is that I go through the clear coat so much faster than the color. Thankfully you can now buy the clear coat separately, so it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon Outlast over a decade ago and I been using it ever since. I have tried other brands that \\&quot;claim\\&quot; to do the same thing but they don&#x27;t. Over the last 13 years people have asked me if I had my lips tattooed with color since my lipstick is NEVER smudged, faded, or shows signs of wear after a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn it without incident (no rub off) while:&lt;br /&gt;- drinking anything including using straws&lt;br /&gt;- kissing&lt;br /&gt;- brushing teeth&lt;br /&gt;- eating&lt;br /&gt;- wiping mouth with form of material&lt;br /&gt;- getting my teeth cleaned&lt;br /&gt;- facials&lt;br /&gt;- working out&lt;br /&gt;- rock climbing&lt;br /&gt;- facial waxing&lt;br /&gt;- surgeries&lt;br /&gt;- getting botox on my upper lip for my hyperhydrosis&lt;br /&gt;- beach&lt;br /&gt;- pools&lt;br /&gt;- camping&lt;br /&gt;- snorkeling&lt;br /&gt;- and anything else you can think of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ways I have found to get the lipstick off without rubbing my lips off or literally sleeping it off is putting any other lipstick or chap stick on my lips. If you mix anything with Outlast it does something to the protective no wear cover coat (the clear \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; top coat). That clear applicator is the actual sealer that keeps the lipstick in place... FYI!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So some tricks I have learned over the years:&lt;br /&gt;1. Do not apply clear coat until lipstick color is fully dry. Takes about 30 seconds I guess. I put the lipstick on, then apply my mascara and by the time I am done the lips are dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. Right after you put the lipstick on be sure to fix any errors such as smudging, or areas out of line because once it dries it is almost impossible.&lt;br /&gt;3. For those who complain about dryness - you can buy just tubes of the clear coat moisturizing sticks and apply whenever you like. I do not do this anymore because I am used to it, but also you can lick your lips too - the lipstick will NOT rub off from licking.&lt;br /&gt;ITS YOUR CHOICE A LITTLE DRYNESS OR HAVING LIPSTICK THAT NEVER SMUDGES OR RUBS OFF - imagine eating at a find dining restaurant and wiping your mouth with the WHITE cloth napkin and not a single outline of your lips left behind!!!&lt;br /&gt;4. Your lips are NOT peeling off... (lipstick comes off with either a) improper application or b) time finally taking it&#x27;s toll ) when the lipstick comes off it comes off by peeling which looks like skin but it is not... it is just the lipstick. If you IMPROPERLY apply it, it will have the same effect but right after you put it on or within a short period of time after applied.&lt;br /&gt;5. You can use lip liner before application but only as a liner and not a filler. Any area you cover besides the lips inner or outer areas and the lipstick will not hold.&lt;br /&gt;6. Lips have to be fully natural prior to applying! No chapstick, old lipstick, lotion, or anything else can be on your lips. If it is the lipstick will just flake right off. Make sure to rub your lips completely clear with a clean cloth prior to applying. Even greasy food can affect it. Now once the clear moisturizing coat is on you can eat anything including greasy chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, and anything else you can wrap your lips around without smudging or rubbing off your lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;7. If you put it on 9am and go to sleep with it on... you will still have a good portion of it on in the morning. Before bed I grab a chapstick and rub it generously all along my lips, then grab a cloth and rub the lipstick off. It will come off in flakes but I just dump them into the sink and wash them away. Then once off I reapply the chapstick and off to bed.&lt;br /&gt;8. Be prepared for lots of questions :) I get at least once a week, your lipstick did not come off, or yours didn&#x27;t smudge, or when do you reapply your lipstick. And then they all want to know what lipstick I wear. When I get my teeth cleaned the whole staff has to come in and see for themselves that I did not get once single smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So from one who has been using this lip stick for ages and plan to continue until the end of my time.... use mytips and tricks and you will be as happy as I am with TRUE REAL long lasting lip color. :)tips and tricks and you will be as happy as I am with TRUE REAL long lasting lip color. :)</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted, fast service, A++++</li>
            <li> The product works great - goes on easily &amp; stays on for hours, even through eating &amp; drinking. The separate tubes is a good idea.  I use the lip shine/moisturizing tube several times before reapplying color is necessary, so I really wish it came in a larger tube.  I am pleased with the product overall -just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Cover girl is one of the best lasting lipstick ( very good). I would buy again..</li>
            <li> Not as pink as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  I live in a part of the country where girly girls who are witnessed reapplying lipstick might be considered an oddity.  This product saves me.  I put it on with my make-up in the morning, and it lasts and lasts.  I do notice that it might fade a bit after a meal...especially if the meal has oils/fats in it, but NOTHING like how it would look if it were the regular kind of lip stick. It&#x27;s just the best product.  When I love a product this much, I&#x27;m always afraid that it will no longer be available.  Please, Covergirl, don&#x27;t let that happen!!!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and I was lucky enough to choose a decent colour online. This comes off readily while eating, is a bit dry, and the additional lip balm could be combined with the lipstick. Good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> The color does last like it states on the box however... This lipstick makes my lips very dry and crusty looking. I constantly find myself throughout the day wiping the lipstick off and reapplying it again because after an hour of wearing the lipstick, it becomes very clumpy! I would not recommend this product to anyone nor will I ever purchase this product again! Horrible! Also I do find the lipstick rubbing off my lips and onto the straw when I drink juices and water. So basically to sum it all up..the color does last but it rubs off if you were to touch your lips to other things and also it makes your lips very dry and super crusty looking as if you need to exfoilate your lips bad!!!</li>
            <li> i got and ugly purple like dark purple color</li>
            <li> I have been using the Outlast All Day Lipcolour for years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;They have now stopping making my colour , #825 Raisin Satin. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Is there a new name for #825 now , does anyone know.</li>
            <li> This is the color lipstick that I like and it is getting more and more difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anyone reminding you to wear it thin. Unlike other lipsticks, you don&#x27;t have to put two or three coats on to get the color you need. I wear 542 and 555 depending on whether I&#x27;m wearing warm or cool colors. A tube will last me several months. I actually have my eyebrows and eyeliner tattooed on. I didn&#x27;t do my lips because I know your complexion can change over the years. However, people will still think I&#x27;ve had it done if they don&#x27;t know me. I love not having to reapply all day. By the way, it comes off with eye makeup remover at night. Often, after I&#x27;ve removed my mascara, I&#x27;ll flip the pad over and remove my lipstick.</li>
            <li> ...But the color is a bit dark for me as I am quite fair-skinned, so I either mix it with a lighter shade (that I feel is too light for me) or wipe a good bit off immediately after applying, to lessen the tone a little. It was hard to find shades that work for me and I spent a good bit of $ doing so, but this brand works so well, and I am still able to use the too light or too dark colors by mixing, and thankfully these go on sale often or can be found at a great price through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> A lovely color - and it really does last.</li>
            <li> I have to say the lipcolor came on time and packaged properly. I do like covergirl outlast lipcolor and it works amazingly, in fact if i go to bed with my makeup on its still there in the morning and i have to scrub it off! I would have to say that my only complaint is that it appears to be a pinkish tone, but when I got it it was more of a purple tone. I still use it and it looks nice, just not one of my favorites. Besides the color though the product in general is very satisfactory!</li>
            <li> Fast ship. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Laats all day, really nice product!</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this lip color in the store, and was pleased to find it at an amazingly modest price!</li>
