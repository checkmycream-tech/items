            <li> This brushes are great , I use them for when I do my acrylic/uv nails and when I do my pedicure.</li>
            <li> The brushes are fine, but it said &#x27;Assorted Color&#x27;, that did not happen</li>
            <li> The brushes I received are not the colors indicated online and each has a permanent &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; on the handle. They are really small and difficult to hang onto.  Would not order again.  Stuck them in my garage cabinet in hopes of some obscure art project that may require several brushes.</li>
            <li> love them.But l only got all white l wanted muti color!! i bought 12!!! the quality is great but o was really lookn forward to getting multi colors</li>
            <li> Got merchandise in a timely fashion. however I thought the brushes were suppose to be in multiple colors as shown in the picture. I received shades of tan. And the brushes are Very hard .</li>
            <li> The brushes are absolutely perfect nail brushes.  But the colors are not as pictured.  I got all colors but no clear ones.  Really not a big deal to me though.  For this price and quality they can make them any colors they want.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes!  I love that they have a handle, it makes them so much easier to hold with slippery soapy hands!  I use them for many things, not just nails... I wash eggs with them, use them on my kids&#x27; hands and feet, etc.  The bristles are very soft and gentle.  Will definitely be purchasing again when these run out!!</li>
            <li> These were a great deal, I need lots of them so I can assign each of my clients their own personal brush for sanitary purposes. These are nice and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I love these. They are very durable. Will older again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these old school nail brushes anywhere. Thanks Amazon. I bought a more expensive single white one but these are just as good.</li>
            <li> I was expecting different color, but all the brushes were white. Not a biggie. It is a good investment and the price is fair. The brushes are sturdy and well-built.</li>
            <li> I can thouroughly wash my long nails using these brushes and dont have to wait until I visit nail salon. And Very good price!</li>
            <li> very good quality manicure nail brushes.  love the colors. Great product for the very reasonable price. Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> the bristles are so cheap I&#x27;m lucky to get one use out of these. These brushes are not even worth .50 a brush.</li>
            <li> They only come in one color - a bright orange pink.  But the brush has good strong bristles.  For the money a good buy but do not expect the assorted colors as advertised.</li>
            <li> I gave one to everyone in the family. I keep one in the bathroom as well. We like our nails clean. For the money, this is a great product. I often see then in nail salons to wash your hands. It&#x27;s a quick way to clean your nails.</li>
            <li> One on the brushes was damaged with a lot of black stuff on the bristles. Not what I expected but workable.</li>
            <li> What can I say except the obvious?  These brushes are rather modest in their quality, but YOU GET 12 OF THEM for a very small  price.  I am very satisfied and so are the various male members of my family that have cleaner nails as a result of our purchase.</li>
            <li> flimsy bristles, but what else did I expect for the price?</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted they came in assorted colors like the picture and the bristles are ferm which is great for what I need them for very happy.</li>
            <li> good one for good price...it brushes good...</li>
            <li> nice little scrub brushes.</li>
            <li> Since I do a lot of work both in the garage and the backyard I have been looking for a stiff nail brush for a long time. Nothing I could find anywhere for a long time would get the dirt or oil from under my nails till I got these. Recently I purchased these as well as several others. I received a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; manicure one today and gave it to my wife unopened to give to her manicurist because just by touching it in the bag I know it&#x27;s too soft. Not only are these at a amazing price but they work great! I have only had them for a short time but they also seem to be made well. I&#x27;m extremely happy finding  them. They are also great for other uses around the house and I am going to buy more. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  Not bad but the colors are dull.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great to clean your nails after working outside in the dirt.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy another manicure brush from a beauty supplier. This is the best value for your money and is the exact same quality product!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a spa themed birthday party for my daughter and they are perfect for the goody bags.  You can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> These are great little brushes, just stiff enough bristles for so many uses. I have one near each sink for nails and I use the green ones in my kitchen to clean vegetables. One family member is using one for their dentures and says it cleans better than a denture brush.</li>
            <li> perfect for barbers and using them to clean my clippers the best price makes them even better .. i will look no further</li>
            <li> Great for clipper blade cleaning good stiff bristles.I wish you got a choice of colors I received 3 each White.Purple,light green,Pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. They last awhile and are great for spot cleaning and vegetable brushes, too. I just run them through the dishwasher to lean them.</li>
            <li> These brushes were used at my daughter&#x27;s spa party the girls loved them, plus they got to take them home as a part of their favor.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my manicurist and she loves them.  I think she gave some to her other customers.  Kept one for myself.</li>
            <li> These are for your hands but a lot of barbers like to use these... and they are just what i was looking for nice hard bristles that lay the hair down and theyre great doing line ups even on people with curly hair such as myself</li>
            <li> Im an up coming barber and i use it to brush the hair which they work great for. plus since there plastic i can put them in the barbersyde to clean and disinfect.</li>
            <li> these are great for brushing your feet in the tub and your nails after washing dishes</li>
            <li> Decent disposable nail brush.</li>
            <li> My idea of assorted colors and their idea of assorted colors are two very different things. Mine were all blue, so family distribution, which I thought was a cinch--ain&#x27;t so. I won&#x27;t purchase these again, I wish Amazon had a block vendor feature so I could make sure to avoid them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brushes for my 9 year old birthday party, the description said assorted colors, so I ordered assuming I was getting different colors, which was what I needed yet I received 12 white brushes! So dissatisfied and my daughter is very disappointed.</li>
