            <li>But the best thing is.....</li>
            <li>If you have thinning hair, this is the perfect product to protect your scalp!  </li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen, and I&#x27;ll never be without it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to take on a trip - no liquid</li>
            <li>the non-greasy powder is particularly great when I am playing tennis and sweating in boot camp.  </li>
            <li>if you fly model airplanes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The customer service is great.</li>
            <li>It works great for exposed scalp at the hair-part and forehead.</li>
            <li>I love this sunblock!!</li>
            <li>I loved the design of this</li>
            <li>Living in sunny California with my fair skin, I need protection from the sun every day.</li>
            <li>like the sun and all of the good things it brings, but on my skin it&#x27;s just a biopsy waiting to happen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Allegedly, this stuff is good for 300 applications.</li>
            <li>It is good for getting the part in your hair without having to make you hair greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair, but this kept me sunburn free.  </li>
            <li>The price is fair for the amazing value.</li>
            <li>Especially good for balding men who have the sun beating down on them, lol.</li>
            <li>I took a leap of faith that it would work and fell in love with powder sunscreens.    </li>
            <li>I also love it for me...</li>
            <li>It turned out to be my favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find Go!screen (which is 1/2 the price AND better quality than the original powder block that I had bought).  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s has been really good at keeping me safe from the sun (which is especially important to me since I&#x27;ve had minor skin cancers).  </li>
            <li>I found the Go!screen powder sunscreen easy to apply to my one-year-old.</li>
            <li>I am sure the current design works great for kids and people who like makeup brushes, but I would prefer to use a pressing pad or cotton ball.  </li>
            <li>This is an easy, convenient way to tote some additional sunscreen with you when you are out and about.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep in my purse or backpack for touch ups.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply</li>
            <li>Goes on so easily.</li>
            <li>This is the first sunscreen that my kids don&#x27;t mind using...with a quick brush across their faces, they are good to go.  </li>
            <li>I found that its best use is for light activity or in emergencies when I&#x27;ve forgotten to put other sunscreen on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to carry in my bag.</li>
            <li>It now works fine.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it was very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>gentleness and effectiveness are my primary concerns</li>
            <li>GO!screen makes applying sunblock to my scalp easy and clean</li>
            <li>Go!screen has been so great for me -- I keep it in my purse and apply it whenever I&#x27;m outside at the park, restaurant, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult with fair skin.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like you are wearing any sunscreen - no thick lotion, greasy film or white sheen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply and can be done while chasing toddlers or standing still.</li>
            <li>it really works and has great, natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The all natural sunscreen powder is both economical and comes with an applicator that works well -- it is also re-fillable, making it eco-friendly too (good for our family and the environment).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick to apply and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The power does seem to wash right off during swimming or sweating.</li>
            <li>I feel good that it&#x27;s not full of chemicals, too.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s pretty).  </li>
            <li>It is gentle!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic, natural, zinc oxide-based block - not just a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>When I get hot and sweaty, it stays on and doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes.</li>
            <li>And, it really works!  </li>
            <li>The first order didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>It takes many pumps to push enough out to cover.</li>
            <li>After a call in they sent me a new one right away.</li>
            <li>This goes on fast and really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I live in Phoenix and it&#x27;s very sunny here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it, if you can take the price.</li>
            <li>My fair-skinned husband was skeptical, but after using it once, was happy to find that he was protected.</li>
            <li>That said, the actual SUNCREEN works really well, gives my skin a nice shimmer, and doesn&#x27;t make me look like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li>I have had skin cancer and also have sensitive skin - yay!  </li>
            <li>(I recently learned from a former employee of a sunscreen company that many sunscreens are made with ingredients/chemicals that are actually poisonous and come in vats with skull and crossbones!).  </li>
            <li>The second one stoped working after the first day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a lovely product, it&#x27;s just the design that sucks.</li>
            <li>So far this product  has not irritated my skin at all, nor has it caused any breakout.</li>
            <li>My kids love it too - with the simple brush, we face none of the battles that we do with the heavy creams.</li>
            <li>The small container size makes it really easy for travel too.  </li>
            <li>GO!screen is small and easy to keep in my purse.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s also been much easier to apply to my kids than regular sunscreen - they actually like it!</li>
            <li>-through (when you go out in the sun, though, it&#x27;s just barely shimmery.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 5 days and so far it has been terrific.  </li>
            <li>Eventually I ended up cracking the whole thing open and putting the powder in a little container</li>
            <li>I only use this on my face and neck and don&#x27;t want too much or too little.  </li>
            <li>This stuff leaves no indication to where it&#x27;s at, which could be a good or bad thing.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Mine jammed on the second or third day, but their customer service promply sent instructions for  fixing.  </li>
            <li> Because it does go on so nicely, it is hard to tell how much you have on.  </li>
            <li> much as I dislike the goop, at least you know where you have applied it</li>
            <li> Not to be the single, cranky wet-blanket, but I feel like someone should deflate some of the hype.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it all summer and still have almost the entire tube, so a little goes a long way, which makes it easier to stomach the cost of it.</li>
            <li> + applications!\\&quot; a little dubious, because, really, if one pump counts as an application you&#x27;re getting a lot less than 300 uses, even if you only use it to cover a very small area like your face.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune sampling drug store products and \\&quot;green\\&quot; products with no luck.  </li>
            <li> Other lotion sunscreens irritate my skin or make it breakout.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I just whip it out, brush it on their little bodies...no muss, no fuss</li>
            <li> He always ends up with sunscreen all over his clothes when I apply creams, but the powder wasn&#x27;t messy at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient to carry in my purse or car, and I use it for running and tennis in addition to everyday coverage.</li>
            <li> The little pump-thing has to be pushed about twenty times to dispense enough sunscreen to cover maybe half your arm, and even then it&#x27;s difficult to tell if you have any of the stuff on you because it&#x27;s see</li>
            <li> If you have very pale skin, like me, you will have trouble seeing any spots you may have missed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and travels well too.</li>
            <li> I try to never be in the sun, but that is next to impossible</li>
            <li> Seriously</li>
            <li> so I gave goscreen a 5, but the applicator is a little difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I had an spf 15 product I used for years, but they changed the formula and it started irritating the heck out of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Therefor I am unable to say anything regarding the powder.</li>
            <li> It applies very thinly.</li>
            <li> I hate the liquid stuff that makes you smell like a banana cream pie.</li>
            <li> The applicator is awful, flat-out.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I live in Phoenix and it&#x27;s very sunny here. My grandchildren always squirm whenever I attempt to put traditional sunscreen on them.  The GOscreen has totally changed this dreaded scenario.  I just whip it out, brush it on their little bodies...no muss, no fuss and it&#x27;s done. But the best thing is.....it really works and has great, natural ingredients.  I am now using it on myself. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product. I&#x27;m an adult with fair skin. Other lotion sunscreens irritate my skin or make it breakout. This goes on fast and really works. I use it on my face, hands, neck every day.  No shiny, white lotion face!  It&#x27;s also great to take on a trip - no liquid so no problems packing it in carry-on baggage.</li>
            <li> I found the Go!screen powder sunscreen easy to apply to my one-year-old. He always ends up with sunscreen all over his clothes when I apply creams, but the powder wasn&#x27;t messy at all. He even holds out his hands himself so I can do the tops. I feel good that it&#x27;s not full of chemicals, too. It&#x27;s light and easy to carry in my bag. Plus it doubles as a baby toy!</li>
            <li> I loved the design of this product!But if I was still pumping I could not get any powder out of it.Therefor I am unable to say anything regarding the powder.I returned it,since I refuse to pay $26.00 for something that will not work.</li>
            <li> Not to be the single, cranky wet-blanket, but I feel like someone should deflate some of the hype.  The applicator is awful, flat-out.  The little pump-thing has to be pushed about twenty times to dispense enough sunscreen to cover maybe half your arm, and even then it&#x27;s difficult to tell if you have any of the stuff on you because it&#x27;s see-through (when you go out in the sun, though, it&#x27;s just barely shimmery.  Maybe a deal-breaker for some, but I think it&#x27;s pretty).  This makes the product&#x27;s claim of \\&quot;WHOA! 300+ applications!\\&quot; a little dubious, because, really, if one pump counts as an application you&#x27;re getting a lot less than 300 uses, even if you only use it to cover a very small area like your face.  Eventually I ended up cracking the whole thing open and putting the powder in a little container so I could dip a brush in and apply it myself.      That said, the actual SUNCREEN works really well, gives my skin a nice shimmer, and doesn&#x27;t make me look like an oil slick.  It&#x27;s really a lovely product, it&#x27;s just the design that sucks.</li>
            <li> If you read on this website... (...) ...you will learn how zinc and titanium dioxide in nano-particle form are toxic. In the lungs they cause inflammation, in the blood stream it is carried to our tissues and brain and deposited where it causes lesions and tissue damage.&lt;br /&gt;Use creams and a hat or a scarf.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 days and so far it has been terrific.  I have had skin cancer and also have sensitive skin - yay!  I had an spf 15 product I used for years, but they changed the formula and it started irritating the heck out of my skin.  I have spent a fortune sampling drug store products and \\&quot;green\\&quot; products with no luck.  So far this product  has not irritated my skin at all, nor has it caused any breakout. It is gentle!  I hope this continues, because goscreen will then become a part of my needed daily ritual.  After I wash my face and put on my daily moisterizer  I brush on the goscreen like I would a cosmetic powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gentleness and effectiveness are my primary concerns so I gave goscreen a 5, but the applicator is a little difficult to use.  Mine jammed on the second or third day, but their customer service promply sent instructions for  fixing.  It now works fine.  I also have trouble determining how much I have on.  I only use this on my face and neck and don&#x27;t want too much or too little.  Because it does go on so nicely, it is hard to tell how much you have on.  If I have any suggestion it is to at some point in the future come up with design for faces only that is similar to some mineral makeup compacts.  I am sure the current design works great for kids and people who like makeup brushes, but I would prefer to use a pressing pad or cotton ball.  Though I am getting accustomed to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love GO!screen so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use it made me breakout and I gave it up.</li>
            <li> If you have thinning hair, this is the perfect product to protect your scalp!  I don&#x27;t use slimy spray or lotion in my hair, so now I use GO!screen.  GO!screen makes applying sunblock to my scalp easy and clean and now I don&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li> Living in sunny California with my fair skin, I need protection from the sun every day. Go!screen is my daily \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; product. It&#x27;s a fantastic, natural, zinc oxide-based block - not just a sunscreen. It&#x27;s convenient to carry in my purse or car, and I use it for running and tennis in addition to everyday coverage. When I get hot and sweaty, it stays on and doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes. My kids love it too - with the simple brush, we face none of the battles that we do with the heavy creams. The price is fair for the amazing value. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> When my dermatologist suggested that I start using a powder sunscreen (which provides a physical block instead of a chemical block), I was hesitant because I did not think it would stay on my face and truly protect against the sun. I took a leap of faith that it would work and fell in love with powder sunscreens.    I was thrilled to find Go!screen (which is 1/2 the price AND better quality than the original powder block that I had bought).  The all natural sunscreen powder is both economical and comes with an applicator that works well -- it is also re-fillable, making it eco-friendly too (good for our family and the environment).  This is the first sunscreen that my kids don&#x27;t mind using...with a quick brush across their faces, they are good to go.  I also love it for me...the non-greasy powder is particularly great when I am playing tennis and sweating in boot camp.  Two thumbs up for Go!screen!</li>
            <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t tried it outside yet, but I hope it works. I hate the liquid stuff that makes you smell like a banana cream pie. I try to never be in the sun, but that is next to impossible if you fly model airplanes.&lt;br /&gt;I like the sun and all of the good things it brings, but on my skin it&#x27;s just a biopsy waiting to happen.&lt;br /&gt;Allegedly, this stuff is good for 300 applications. However it is a smaller package than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;As much as I dislike the goop, at least you know where you have applied it and you know what hasn&#x27;t been covered. This stuff leaves no indication to where it&#x27;s at, which could be a good or bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;So if it works like I hope, I give it a 5 star. If I get a melanoma, I give it a -7 star.</li>
            <li> This is an easy, convenient way to tote some additional sunscreen with you when you are out and about.  If you have very pale skin, like me, you will have trouble seeing any spots you may have missed.  (And you will figure that out when you have a sunburn there later.)  I would recommend still using an SPF lotion before heading out, but keep this in a bag for extra applications.  It is good for getting the part in your hair without having to make you hair greasy.  I will keep this on hand, but in addition to my liquid sunscreen, not to replace it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen to take on our Hawaiian vacation.  It turned out to be my favorite sunscreen.  First of all, it was very easy to apply.  It doesn&#x27;t get your hands all goopy like a lotion, and you don&#x27;t have to hold your breath and go outside to apply like a spray.  Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like you are wearing any sunscreen - no thick lotion, greasy film or white sheen.  And, it really works!  I&#x27;m very fair, but this kept me sunburn free.  The small container size makes it really easy for travel too.  It&#x27;s easy to keep in my purse or backpack for touch ups. I also think this is a healthier and greener option since it doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of chemicals (I recently learned from a former employee of a sunscreen company that many sunscreens are made with ingredients/chemicals that are actually poisonous and come in vats with skull and crossbones!).  This is a great sunscreen, and I&#x27;ll never be without it!</li>
            <li> GO!screen is small and easy to keep in my purse.  The kids never fuss when I put it on them.  It&#x27;s quick to apply and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin.  I love this sunblock!!</li>
            <li> Go!screen has been so great for me -- I keep it in my purse and apply it whenever I&#x27;m outside at the park, restaurant, etc.  It&#x27;s so easy to apply and it&#x27;s has been really good at keeping me safe from the sun (which is especially important to me since I&#x27;ve had minor skin cancers).  I wouldn&#x27;t apply regular sunscreen as often as I use this!  And it&#x27;s also been much easier to apply to my kids than regular sunscreen - they actually like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep in our diaper bag and I love it. Goes on so easily. Plus my daughter loves having it brushed on. My fair-skinned husband was skeptical, but after using it once, was happy to find that he was protected. I found that its best use is for light activity or in emergencies when I&#x27;ve forgotten to put other sunscreen on. The power does seem to wash right off during swimming or sweating. I&#x27;d highly recommend it, if you can take the price. We&#x27;ve used it all summer and still have almost the entire tube, so a little goes a long way, which makes it easier to stomach the cost of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my toddlers. It&#x27;s super easy to apply and can be done while chasing toddlers or standing still. I used it for two toddlers all summer and still have a lot left. No burns either. It&#x27;s small and travels well too.</li>
            <li> We tried this one but the \\&quot;push button to load\\&quot; didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I never could see it come out of the brush.</li>
            <li> The first order didn&#x27;t work at all. After a call in they sent me a new one right away. The customer service is great. The second one stoped working after the first day. The power will not pump into the brush.</li>
            <li> My friend and I purchased the same sunscreen. Both stopped working because the product gets stuck.  I called the company, and they told me to use a paper clip to unplug the brush.  That works for 1 application and then plugs up again.&lt;br /&gt;It needs a redesign. I&#x27;m trying another brand.  Maybe it will function better.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 1 star because the sunscreen works, if you can get it out.</li>
            <li> Bought this in hopes it&#x27;d be easier for my kids. It applies very thinly. My husband tried it on his face and burned. It takes many pumps to push enough out to cover. Not worth the money. Back to California Baby.</li>
            <li> I always have this on hand for vac and summer days at the park. Everyone knows I carry it so all the adults ask if they can borrow it. It works great for exposed scalp at the hair-part and forehead. Especially good for balding men who have the sun beating down on them, lol. Seriously</li>
