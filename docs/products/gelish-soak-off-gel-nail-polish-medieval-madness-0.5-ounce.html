            <li>Lol...</li>
            <li>The color is great, the quality is good, and the price point is good.</li>
            <li>I wonder if it would look good on lighter skin.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this color!</li>
            <li>it looks amazing on my nails.</li>
            <li>Applies nicely.</li>
            <li>This color is great, I use 2 coats some times 3 depending on how rich you want the color.</li>
            <li>on your nails it looks more like what need a tan should have looked like.</li>
            <li>This color is more of a tan color with greenish tones depending on the lighting.  </li>
            <li>However, the quality of the product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Color is better than what it looks.</li>
            <li>I do gelish manicures so someone will love it regardless.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I really love the way this color looks.</li>
            <li>It is more of an off-beige.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the initial color when you put this polish on (which isn&#x27;t that great anyway!)</li>
            <li>More like &amp;#34;Crack Den&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Smack Sauce&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Jaundice with a Side of Filth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Gelish polishes are awesome, so easy to use and long wearing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ver y light, so if you&#x27;re looking for a steel-y gray, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now!</li>
            <li>This is a really cool winter color.</li>
            <li>I think this is cool color</li>
            <li>I absolutely dislike ads that are not true to the product and this is a perfect example of that.</li>
            <li>It looks OKAY with sparkles over it, just nowhere near the color pictured on gelish&#x27;s website or on amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought this color thinking it would be a nice grey</li>
            <li>Very fashionable color!</li>
            <li>love it with Vegas Nights over it, or as a two tone french manicure with&lt;br /&gt;Midnight</li>
            <li>I definitely like the color better in the picture provided.  </li>
            <li>just because I won&#x27;t be positive of what I&#x27;m buying.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because normal polish only lasts like 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>I expected this to be more of a grey colored polish, but when I used it, it is more of a tan.  </li>
            <li>thanks Mom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unattractive.  </li>
            <li>VERY misleading</li>
            <li>Very neutral gray color.</li>
            <li>This color is really nice and versatile, but it is a taupe shade -- definitely not in the grey family.</li>
            <li>But very natural color too.</li>
            <li>Not to dark and not to light.</li>
            <li>try the IBD for first time  last week.</li>
            <li>It is good for a base on which to paint normal nail polish which is easily removed without removing the gel polish.</li>
            <li>It shipped really quickly and came before the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li>its so clear.</li>
            <li>As a professional I haven&#x27;t found anyone this is flattering on.</li>
            <li>if you want more tense color to really show of like grey we need to apply about 3 coats.</li>
            <li>but it is actually a solid taupe color which is very classy and neutral.</li>
            <li>Not a grey color at all..</li>
            <li>Pretty soft color -  you will need at least 3 coats to be somewhat opaque.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Pretty soft color -  you will need at least 3 coats to be somewhat opaque.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle and pretty, though!</li>
            <li> Supposed to be grey, not at all!!!</li>
            <li> After a week I can tell some wear but it is minimal.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews saying it was gray...</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t dark at all but also isn&#x27;t a pink or lighter spring color.</li>
            <li> I have tan skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li> I usually like strange colors for my nails (like putty, mauve, etc.), but I didn&#x27;t like this.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing wrong with the product though.</li>
            <li> This is an icky swamp brown color not a soft gray like this photo reflects</li>
            <li> Color not true to description.</li>
            <li> That being said, this particular color of polish, \\&quot;Medieval Madness\\&quot;, is incredibly ugly.  </li>
            <li> i used this a few times.</li>
            <li> the look like green...</li>
            <li> that is why I bought it but not sure it is flattering on me.</li>
            <li> I can wear Gelish for at least a week without noticing any wear in the polish.</li>
            <li> This color seriously sucks.</li>
            <li> because in a few hours (maybe even minutes) it is going to fade to this disgusting, discolored beige/gray/jaundice yellow tone that will repel and gross out everyone in your life.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the picture above :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dirty gray.  </li>
            <li> I hate the color.</li>
            <li> Horrible.... Matches with everything that is ugly.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an icky swamp brown color not a soft gray like this photo reflects</li>
            <li> This is a really cool winter color. I thought it would be a shimmery silver but it is actually a solid taupe color which is very classy and neutral.</li>
            <li> This is a great nude color. It is NOT gray at all.... on your nails it looks more like what need a tan should have looked like.</li>
            <li> This is a drab green/grey color. My mother told me it made her think of vomit.  Lol...thanks Mom.</li>
            <li> Color didn&#x27;t match what was represented at all.</li>
            <li> I really loved this color! it looks amazing on my nails. Not to dark and not to light.</li>
            <li> Horrible.... Matches with everything that is ugly. Not a grey color at all.. Looks like a mixture of puke and mud.</li>
            <li> Very fashionable color! But very natural color too. I love it!</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews saying it was gray...Not at all! It came out a greenish taupey color on me with 3 coats.  I wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li> This color is more of a tan color with greenish tones depending on the lighting.  It&#x27;s the color of the old-school \\&quot;Putty\\&quot; colored metal desks.  It&#x27;s very unattractive.  Nothing like the gray color shown in the color swatch so beware!  However, the quality of the product is outstanding.  It has worn like the paint on the aforementioned metal desk.</li>
            <li> I bought this color thinking it would be a nice grey and it&#x27;s taupe!! (greenish-grey brown) It looks OKAY with sparkles over it, just nowhere near the color pictured on gelish&#x27;s website or on amazon.</li>
            <li> Color is better than what it looks. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Pretty soft color -  you will need at least 3 coats to be somewhat opaque.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT a metallic color it is gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it with Vegas Nights over it, or as a two tone french manicure with&lt;br /&gt;Midnight Caller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gelish rocks.</li>
            <li> Was seeking a greyish hue and the photo indicated that this polish was that color. It is actually an opaque taupe/tan color. I opted to keep it and add it to my collection but if you are looking for grey/charcoal this is not it.  Not at all like the picture above :(</li>
            <li> I thought I was the only person who felt this way. I should&#x27;ve read the reviews before I bought this color. Supposed to be grey, not at all!!! I hate the color.</li>
            <li> I think this is cool color that is why I bought it but not sure it is flattering on me. I have tan skin and dark hair. I wonder if it would look good on lighter skin. I do gelish manicures so someone will love it regardless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this color at all. Looks like putty. As a professional I haven&#x27;t found anyone this is flattering on.</li>
            <li> Color not true to description. Shipped in timely matter. Found reviews on youtube for colors that I will use for future purchases.</li>
            <li> I absolutely dislike ads that are not true to the product and this is a perfect example of that. Their example picture is not even CLOSE to the actual color of the product. VERY misleading and it makes me not want to purchase from this company again ... just because I won&#x27;t be positive of what I&#x27;m buying.</li>
            <li> The color is great, the quality is good, and the price point is good. I love this stuff because normal polish only lasts like 3-4 days. I can wear Gelish for at least a week without noticing any wear in the polish. After a week I can tell some wear but it is minimal. This color is great, I use 2 coats some times 3 depending on how rich you want the color. For the amount of product you get the price point is great! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love the color. Can be left as is or dressed up with a sparkly overcoat. I like it.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this color looks. Very neutral gray color. It&#x27;s ver y light, so if you&#x27;re looking for a steel-y gray, this isn&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s subtle and pretty, though!</li>
            <li> Gelish polishes are awesome, so easy to use and long wearing.  That being said, this particular color of polish, \\&quot;Medieval Madness\\&quot;, is incredibly ugly.  It&#x27;s a dirty gray.  Maybe the color of someone&#x27;s skin who died from the plague during medieval times.  It. Is. Awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this color! It shipped really quickly and came before the expected arrival date. Applies nicely. No complaints. I&#x27;m wearing it right now!</li>
            <li> Great product, came quicker than anticipated!</li>
            <li> This color is really nice and versatile, but it is a taupe shade -- definitely not in the grey family.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a silver colour as it shows in the photo.  It is more of an off-beige.  I don&#x27;t love it.  It is good for a base on which to paint normal nail polish which is easily removed without removing the gel polish.</li>
            <li> I usually like strange colors for my nails (like putty, mauve, etc.), but I didn&#x27;t like this.  It looks like nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the winter time. It isn&#x27;t dark at all but also isn&#x27;t a pink or lighter spring color. I absolutely love this color</li>
            <li> This color seriously sucks. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the initial color when you put this polish on (which isn&#x27;t that great anyway!) because in a few hours (maybe even minutes) it is going to fade to this disgusting, discolored beige/gray/jaundice yellow tone that will repel and gross out everyone in your life. &amp;#34;Medieval Madness&amp;#34;?? More like &amp;#34;Crack Den&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Smack Sauce&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Jaundice with a Side of Filth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I expected this to be more of a grey colored polish, but when I used it, it is more of a tan.  It&#x27;s not the prettiest of colors.  I definitely like the color better in the picture provided.  Absolutely nothing wrong with the product though.</li>
            <li> i used this a few times. its so clear. if you want more tense color to really show of like grey we need to apply about 3 coats. the next day or even the same day the look like green... yah... never again. try the IBD for first time  last week. im impressed.</li>
