    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best in covering me for all my accidents, which I am prone to.  </li>
            <li>Also the warrenty is tranferable and that is awesome.</li>
            <li>LOL LOL</li>
            <li>The price was great and I like the fact that it&#x27;s 2-years not 1-year.</li>
            <li>The paper work was very nice.</li>
            <li>So I did not have a chance to see if the coverage is as good as the seller promised...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a good product</li>
            <li>Good Value for the money</li>
            <li>Nice to have a warrantee on electronic gadgets, even razors.</li>
            <li>but glad i have it just incase.</li>
            <li>check to see and make sure you get it.</li>
            <li>When you order this make sure you check your email and maybe in spam folder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write a better review when my machine craps out.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because&lt;</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S A PRETTY FAIR PRICE FOR A 2 YEAR DEAL.</li>
            <li>The extended coverage is for free replacement after the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty expires.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thankfully the part was cheap to replace.</li>
            <li>I am Totally covered with a great warranty.</li>
            <li>even free shipping is included.</li>
            <li>This was a great extended protection and only 4.00 for 2 years</li>
            <li>In most cases Philips products do not need any extra protection within 2 years after purchase according to my experience.</li>
            <li>It had a lot of pretty colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many Kindles and I buy this each time.........and only had to use the plan once.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Adobe Reader</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t cost much and its for two yrs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what it is.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for a protection plan.</li>
            <li>Was it worth the money and did they actually DO anything for me............who knows.</li>
            <li>and I have to break mt new cordless razor to use it  </li>
            <li>Since I just received the new device, I&#x27;ve had no need to use the extended warranty</li>
            <li>I think this covers natural wear and tear of a product.</li>
            <li>It is always good to have an extended warranty just in case something goes wrong or quits working</li>
            <li>I am very glad I bought this as you never know when something will go wrong with a purjchased item.  </li>
            <li>Now I need to hunt down my paperwork and see if the manufacturer is willing to deal with me, because this &amp;#34;protection plan&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t kick in until that one expires.  </li>

            <li> The 2-Year Warranty for Omron Blood Pressure Monitor (BP742N) has very small print and one needs to magnify at least 150% in order to read.  </li>

            <li> Worth the money if something goes wrong down the line (assuming they honor the warranty)</li>
            <li> The 2-Year Warranty for Omron Blood Pressure Monitor (BP742N) has very small print and one needs to magnify at least 150% in order to read.  However, nowhere does it specifically identify the BP Monitor product.  Thanks to Adobe Reader, I can read the policy and saved copy on my hard disc for future reference.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will not be needed.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use this.</li>
            <li> I bought it in error with Philips beard trimmer. In most cases Philips products do not need any extra protection within 2 years after purchase according to my experience. So I did not have a chance to see if the coverage is as good as the seller promised...</li>
            <li> I did not order this. I am not sure how I came to have it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this extended protection plan to cover the costs if a blood pressure meter I purchased needed repair or replacement</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a good product but I returned the device it covered so I returned it also.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to mislead anyone, I have NOT actually replaced an item using the warranty yet. I did however accidentally buy 2 when i only wanted one. I asked for a refund, and even though it was my error they refunded it promptly with no questions asked. I will cover future purchases with them, and will update this if I ever call it in.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> My advice â€“ skip the protection. The extended coverage is for free replacement after the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty expires.&lt;br /&gt;The documentation Canopy provides is minimal, an email stating the coverage has been purchased. However, the email does not list the product covered. Instead it refers to the &amp;#34;protection plan order confirmation from Amazon.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just got this and I have to break mt new cordless razor to use it  LOL LOL</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use it but glad i have it just incase.</li>
            <li> Purchased it for insurance....hope I never have to use it</li>
            <li> it works never used it</li>
            <li> Have not had to use it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use it yet but I have peace of mind knowing it&#x27;s there if I need it!</li>
            <li> bought it for peace of mine.  will see how it goes... hopefully I&#x27;ll never have to use it.</li>
            <li> I had purchase this protection plan and for some reason never received it. I&#x27;m not saying not get but check to see and make sure you get it. My situation was different and has not be resolved yet. Still waiting.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Received the contract for my protection plan. When you order this make sure you check your email and maybe in spam folder.</li>
            <li> I think this covers natural wear and tear of a product. I damaged a product by accidentally dropping it, and when I checked the warranty, I found out that it didn&#x27;t cover it. Thankfully the part was cheap to replace.</li>
            <li> The best in covering me for all my accidents, which I am prone to.  I am Totally covered with a great warranty.</li>
            <li> Since I just received the new device, I&#x27;ve had no need to use the extended warranty so what do you want me to write? The paper work was very nice. It had a lot of pretty colors. Was it worth the money and did they actually DO anything for me............who knows. I&#x27;ll write a better review when my machine craps out.</li>
            <li> I got this extended protection for my sister when I order her this Eraser Shaver and I&#x27;m glad I did because&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t cost much and its for two yrs. so if anything goes wrong with it they will replace it and give her another one.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use it yet but I have peace of mind knowing it&#x27;s there if I need it!</li>
            <li> It is always good to have an extended warranty just in case something goes wrong or quits working</li>
            <li> Stupid! Don&#x27;t get it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what it is. Does it cover everything I purchase from Amazon or only one item purchased from Amazon. Do I need to download something to show I have &amp;#34;Canopy 2-year Personal Car Extended?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use this yet but fully warrented after manufactoring warrenty for 2 yrs and even free shipping is included. Also the warrenty is tranferable and that is awesome.</li>
            <li> Supposedly my item has a warranty from the manufacturer.  Now I need to hunt down my paperwork and see if the manufacturer is willing to deal with me, because this &amp;#34;protection plan&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t kick in until that one expires.  No help, no savings in effort, and generally an utter waste of money.  Not a mistake I will repeat.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a warrantee on electronic gadgets, even razors.</li>
            <li> not sure...hope I don&#x27;t have to use</li>
            <li> never needed it seeing how the monitor didn&#x27;t work again.</li>
            <li> REALLY CANNOT COMMENT ON SOMETHING THAT I HARDLY HAVE USED. IT&#x27;S A PRETTY FAIR PRICE FOR A 2 YEAR DEAL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must to have a warranty, but this CANOPY PROTECTION is a big hassle to return/replace items.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work if you washed the fitbit....</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will not need this extended protection plan but I have it if needed.  It was inexpensive and arrived via email as promised.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for a protection plan.</li>
            <li> This was a great extended protection and only 4.00 for 2 years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a protection plan.  I&#x27;ve bought many Kindles and I buy this each time.........and only had to use the plan once.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t help if you lose your fitbit.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I bought this as you never know when something will go wrong with a purjchased item.  The price was great and I like the fact that it&#x27;s 2-years not 1-year.</li>
            <li> Good Value for the money</li>
