            <li>It&#x27;s a tweezerman, what more can I say.....</li>
            <li>LOVE them.</li>
            <li>So far, it works great</li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all with what I consider to be the top of the line tweezers.  </li>
            <li>; is certainly true in this case!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to grab hairs</li>
            <li>Very good quality and will be at my service as long as I can imagine.</li>
            <li>I think they were good value for money, as I hope the new tweezers will be too.</li>
            <li>Handle is stable and non-slip and the whole tweezer&#x27;s weight is nice and light.</li>
            <li>These serve my purpose for getting to a wider area but not as precise as the pointed ones are.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste time looking for the best one ---THIS</li>
            <li>Precise, and well made.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s comfortable to grin</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to spend the money to replace them, as they aren&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li>Do they still offer free sharpening ?</li>
            <li>So quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>When I look at these tweezers they don&#x27;t seem to be anything special.  </li>
            <li>i thought i would never pay this price for a pair of tweezers, but these are top notch high quality</li>
            <li>Great tweezers - worth the price and red is a good color for spotting in my messy drawer</li>
            <li>Very nice......very precise........</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>i felt like splurging since this is supposedly near the top of the tweezer market.</li>
            <li>can precisely remove short brow hairs, love it</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>Everything good they say about this trademark is true at least for me, accurate precision.</li>
            <li>He was right.  </li>
            <li>the cheep ones, they grip 99% of all the hairs on the first try</li>
            <li>Red is my favorite color</li>
            <li>I love tweezerman and they seem the same quality that I have purchased from the store.</li>
            <li>The strong, sharp tips grab hair easily, although I wouldn&#x27;t use it on skin.</li>
            <li>The Limited Edition red coating is great too.</li>
            <li>Grips fine and very short hair follicles.</li>
            <li>I have only had the tweezers for a few weeks, but they seem great.  </li>
            <li>I have never tried a tweezer with such a comfortable pull.  </li>
            <li>works very well -</li>
            <li>This was a real bargain compared to prices in my community for this.</li>
            <li>Not the best I&#x27;ve used but definitely not the worse.  </li>
            <li>Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>Plucking eyebrows or the occasional stray chin hair (for me), and cleanly taking care of pesky ingrown beard hairs (for him) is now almost effortless again.  </li>
            <li>Highly recomend,&lt;br /&gt;yes</li>
            <li>Very precise, sharp, easy to grip even small hairs.</li>
            <li>and it gets the hair instead of my skin more often than tweezers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li>Same as my old ones.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it was totally worth the price</li>
            <li>but it works really well and its uber sharp!</li>
            <li>But other ones I have purchased in the past were not engineered or machined properly and their clasp would miss fine things, like hairs.  </li>

            <li> I can even pull white-heads with this tweezer (sorry sounds gross, but it&#x27;s true!).</li>
            <li> I manage to pull most of my brows, but end up cutting about a third of them off with this tweezer.  </li>
            <li> We tried some less expensive brands from a local store, but they just didn&#x27;t have the sure grip on the hair that we had come to expect from our tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a long time, no complains.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m wondering why did I wait so long.</li>
            <li> I have been using Revlon&#x27;s Ultimate Tweezer for the last few years now.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Tweezerman products, but this one is worse than useless.</li>
            <li> My husband finally put his foot down and said we needed to get another Tweezerman tweezer.  </li>
            <li> careful when using it.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, it is just a tweezer after all.  </li>
            <li> When we lost our last pair of Tweezerman tweezers (we think it got bumped into the trashcan unnoticed)</li>
            <li> The edges are so sharp that it cuts the hair off instead of grasping it.  </li>
            <li> Still sharp.</li>
            <li> It has a very sharp points at tips....not used to that and have to be careful</li>
            <li> These tweezers are sharp &amp; grasp small hairs, but the tension is so loose.</li>
            <li> In fact, I bought another one in pink!!</li>
            <li> I swear there&#x27;s less pain</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve saved a lot of time and trouble.</li>
            <li> The pair that were being replaced suddenly became useless  but as I have had them for about 10 years</li>
            <li> Not sure if there is a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; tweezer,</li>
            <li> It was time to replace my dull Revlon&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ve always wanted a Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> A lot of money for a failure of a product.</li>
            <li> I hated plucking my eyebrows and at first glance these didn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;d change that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought tweezers that were as much as expensive as these</li>
            <li> Oh I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Hate this tweezer.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love these after years of buying others and not getting what I needed.  I bought these and the pointed ones. These serve my purpose for getting to a wider area but not as precise as the pointed ones are.  Very good quality and will be at my service as long as I can imagine.</li>
            <li> My last tweezerman tweezers lasted for 15 years. These are just as well made and work great. Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> When I look at these tweezers they don&#x27;t seem to be anything special.  I hated plucking my eyebrows and at first glance these didn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;d change that.  I swear there&#x27;s less pain and it gets the hair instead of my skin more often than tweezers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  I don&#x27;t mind plucking if I&#x27;m using these.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used a set of Tweezerman tweezers then you know they&#x27;re the best. Got these at a great price and the seller happily shipped them to Canada. The Limited Edition red coating is great too.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tweezerman products for over 20 years. They have always been the best products available...</li>
            <li> Best tweezer I have ever bought. What a difference!!!!</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned! Very precise. This is my second pair, because I wanted two. Both are amazing. Perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased Tweezerman tweezers. They are the best. They even get to the smallest and thinnest hairs. Look no further, Get Tweezerman!</li>

            <li> These were just what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I found it. It works perfectly. Don&#x27;t waste time looking for the best one ---THIS ONE is the best one :)</li>
            <li> Precise, and well made.  Not much to say, it is just a tweezer after all.  But other ones I have purchased in the past were not engineered or machined properly and their clasp would miss fine things, like hairs.  No such problem with these.</li>

I bought these off Amazon and I am hooked!  I have never tried a tweezer with such a comfortable pull.  So quick and easy.  Very precise.  It&#x27;s easy to grab hairs and it&#x27;s comfortable to grin/hold.  I would recommend these to everyone!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers - worth the price and red is a good color for spotting in my messy drawer</li>
            <li> Not disappointed at all with what I consider to be the top of the line tweezers.  The get even the smallest of hair and out it goes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good tweezer for the price.  Not the best I&#x27;ve used but definitely not the worse.  You won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> works very well - this is 2nd I am buying.</li>
            <li> I have had Tweezerman tweezers before so knew what to expect.  The pair that were being replaced suddenly became useless  but as I have had them for about 10 years I think they were good value for money, as I hope the new tweezers will be too.</li>

            <li> Great pair of tweezers. The strong, sharp tips grab hair easily, although I wouldn&#x27;t use it on skin. Best pair I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Red is my favorite color and I know I&#x27;ll love this Tweezerman, replacing one I bought Oct 2002. Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Grips fine and very short hair follicles. Handle is stable and non-slip and the whole tweezer&#x27;s weight is nice and light.</li>
            <li> Thank you. It arrived well packaged and well made. Exacting tip.</li>
            <li> can precisely remove short brow hairs, love it</li>
            <li> I bought these online because I didn&#x27;t want to pay $25 at the store for a great pair of tweezers.  It&#x27;s a great pproduct at 1/2 the store price!</li>
            <li> I have only had the tweezers for a few weeks, but they seem great.  I am trying to keep the tips in the plastic that they arrived in in order to protect them from damage.  I love tweezerman and they seem the same quality that I have purchased from the store.</li>
            <li> These are just the best tweezers out there. I have 2 pair. Buy an extra set because your man or kid will borrow them.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are outstanding!  Where have you been all my life?  Worth every penny and then some...I only wish I had purchased them sooner.</li>
            <li> This item is perfect.  It does the job well and I love the bright color making it easy to locate in my makeup or bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> Huh? People say these tweezerman are not as good as they used to be... LIES.  Same as my old ones. the only reason I had to replace them is because I lost my last Tweezerman&#x27;s.  Do they still offer free sharpening ?</li>
            <li> These tweezers are sharp &amp; grasp small hairs, but the tension is so loose. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before even with $3 tweezers. Would not spend the money on these again. Better off with $8 Revlon!</li>
            <li> Hate this tweezer.  I have always loved Tweezerman products, but this one is worse than useless. The edges are so sharp that it cuts the hair off instead of grasping it.  I manage to pull most of my brows, but end up cutting about a third of them off with this tweezer.  A lot of money for a failure of a product.</li>
            <li> Good, accurate tweezers for the money.  So far, it works great and I haven&#x27;t needed to invest in another.  Not sure if there is a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; tweezer, but this does the job well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there could be difference between &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; tweezer and &amp;#34;not so good&amp;#34; tweezer.  I thought tweezers were tweezers and they couldn&#x27;t be so different I quality.  Oh I was wrong.  This tweezer is amazing.  I can even pull white-heads with this tweezer (sorry sounds gross, but it&#x27;s true!). If I ever lose this, I would be purchasing the same item again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tweezerman, what more can I say.....great tool</li>
            <li> Very nice......very precise........i thought i would never pay this price for a pair of tweezers, but these are top notch high quality and i would definitely buy again.  In fact, I bought another one in pink!!</li>
            <li> Very precise, sharp, easy to grip even small hairs. Telling all my friends about it!  Worth every penny- it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these tweezers for years now and I just got around to doing a review. LOVE them. Still sharp. Grabs the tiniest hairs.</li>
            <li> This was a real bargain compared to prices in my community for this. Such a basic in my beauty routine that I ordered five. Doesn&#x27;t that say it all?</li>
