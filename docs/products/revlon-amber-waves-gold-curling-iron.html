            <li>I really love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>I liked the</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to use hairspray to keep them nice.</li>
            <li>This dual voltage product is ideal and does a great job in curling my short hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect curling iron for those with short hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure I could have used a lower number</li>
            <li>I love that Amazon had this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve burned myself many times on it.</li>
            <li>If you need a new curling iron, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and most curls</li>
            <li>It heats up good and curl your hair fine, but I keep getting my hair stuck between the clip if I pick up too much hair to curl at once.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants super cute curls.</li>
            <li>This is a sturdy, well made iron that is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>most importantly, it heats quickly - my wife&#x27;s main concern.</li>
            <li>I love that it heat up really fast and didnt lose heat while curling my hair.</li>
            <li>and I didnt need to leave my hair in the curler for more than a minute it curls my hair really fast.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and has variable heat settings.</li>
            <li>This one is sturdy, heats up quickly and is just what I needed.</li>
            <li>However, I know that high heat is damaging my hair, so I&#x27;m going to look for another iron with better temperature regulation.</li>
            <li>Alright, I guess the downside of this type of curling iron is that it doesn&#x27;t have that smooth ceramic hot iron feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also perfect for my little girl who has short hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this to touch up the top layer where the curls are frizzy and need a little more definition.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and evenly and really holds heat well.</li>
            <li>This iron is good if you are looking to have tight curls.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I was able to curl her hair for the first time recently because of this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though the heat settings are adjustable, the lowest setting is still scorching hot.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy in the hand, but has good ergonomics.</li>
            <li>Also, The day that I used the curling iron I had flat ironed my hair that morning and the curls still lasted me the whole night and when I woke up the next morning my hair was still curly. :)</li>
            <li>Much hotter than my very old one that broke.  </li>
            <li>Small size is good for a person with short hair.  </li>
            <li>The 1/2 inch size is just right for my short hairdo.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy/curly hair that I can style straight or curly without a lot of trouble.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know that anyone does that until it is needed, and when it is, wife will run out an buy a new one rather that wait on the mail for a replacement spring.</li>
            <li>It has a dial to determine the heat and it gets hot enough, without burning your hair.  </li>
            <li>I use a large curling iron to make spiral curls and then curl up the bottom and back</li>
            <li>As an African American with relaxed hair, this iron stands up to my thick hair creating perfect little shiny curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, the description specifically says &amp;#34;dual voltage for worldwide use&amp;#34; and upon receipt of the item it clearly said 110v only on the handle.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that is has multiple heat settings, because my hair is thick enough that I need the hottest setting.</li>
            <li>I have a three year old with very long hair.  </li>

            <li> so I could choose how hot I wanted the curling iron to get, I chose the highest because I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> but because of the length of my hair, the curling iron I use for spirals was too wide.  </li>
            <li> and I needed dual voltage, which is very hard to find in the market where I live.  </li>
            <li> An average curler.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 10 seconds to set.</li>
            <li> So you just have to be careful and pick a small chunk of hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron for one of my Choir concerts this past year.</li>
            <li> Since it was past return period</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard finding a small barrel...</li>
            <li> it is difficult to find a small curling iron.  </li>

            <li> Perfect curling iron for those with short hair. Heats up quickly and has variable heat settings. Not too heavy in the hand, but has good ergonomics. Def recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my perfect curling iron. The 1/2 inch size is just right for my short hairdo. It heats up quickly and evenly and really holds heat well. As an African American with relaxed hair, this iron stands up to my thick hair creating perfect little shiny curls. No worries about scorching because you can adjust the heat level. This is a sturdy, well made iron that is comfortable to hold. I love the fact that the cord is tangle-free and the 24K gold plating looks great. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has a hard time creating curls that hold.</li>
            <li> I really love this curling iron! I love that it heat up really fast and didnt lose heat while curling my hair. I liked the it came with a dial so I could choose how hot I wanted the curling iron to get, I chose the highest because I have very thick hair so I&#x27;m sure I could have used a lower number and I didnt need to leave my hair in the curler for more than a minute it curls my hair really fast.

            <li> I like this iron.  It has a dial to determine the heat and it gets hot enough, without burning your hair.  It&#x27;s lightweight and manageable.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron to do my hair for Halloween. It gave me perfect ringlets! I love the fact that is has multiple heat settings, because my hair is thick enough that I need the hottest setting. I would reccommend this prosuct to others, it&#x27;s a good brand, and it works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron for one of my Choir concerts this past year. When I curled all my hair, I was so happy. The curls were perfect. I didn&#x27;t even have to use hairspray to keep them nice. I have really fine hair and most curls don&#x27;t even stay in for an hour. I was very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants super cute curls.</li>
            <li> Worked for 3 months (3 times a week max) then just stopped heating up. The element inside burnt and was not fixable. Since it was past return period Amazon suggested I send it to Revlon for replacement. I dont need another unreliable product so I bought Helen of troy instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because of both the size and the dual voltage.  I travel and I needed dual voltage, which is very hard to find in the market where I live.  I love that Amazon had this item.</li>
            <li> Good item.  Much hotter than my very old one that broke.  Small size is good for a person with short hair.  If you need a new curling iron, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have a three year old with very long hair.  I wanted to curl it around Christmas time and this curling iron is PERFECT!!!! A great buy :)</li>
            <li> Alright, I guess the downside of this type of curling iron is that it doesn&#x27;t have that smooth ceramic hot iron feel.  It heats up good and curl your hair fine, but I keep getting my hair stuck between the clip if I pick up too much hair to curl at once.

            <li> It&#x27;s hard finding a small barrel...Works great!!</li>
            <li> I have short hair with long layers.  I use a large curling iron to make spiral curls and then curl up the bottom and back but because of the length of my hair, the curling iron I use for spirals was too wide.  This size is just what I needed to make the tiny curls at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also perfect for my little girl who has short hair.  I was able to curl her hair for the first time recently because of this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it does not have an automatic shut-off.</li>
            <li> Heat control. swiveling cord, but most importantly, it heats quickly - my wife&#x27;s main concern. She wishes it came with an extra spring which may break before iron dies. There is a form inside package to order an extra. Don&#x27;t know that anyone does that until it is needed, and when it is, wife will run out an buy a new one rather that wait on the mail for a replacement spring.</li>
            <li> it is difficult to find a small curling iron.  This one is sturdy, heats up quickly and is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 0.5 inch iron for my mother in law for travel.  The item I received was 3/8&amp;#34; instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the description specifically says &amp;#34;dual voltage for worldwide use&amp;#34; and upon receipt of the item it clearly said 110v only on the handle.</li>
            <li> This iron is good if you are looking to have tight curls. It heats up well and curls well. Great price</li>
            <li> This dual voltage product is ideal and does a great job in curling my short hair. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Even though the heat settings are adjustable, the lowest setting is still scorching hot. I&#x27;ve burned myself many times on it. I have fine, wavy/curly hair that I can style straight or curly without a lot of trouble. I use this to touch up the top layer where the curls are frizzy and need a little more definition.  The curl holds great. It takes less than 10 seconds to set. I use it like a curling wand, which is part of the reason why I&#x27;m always burning my hand. However, I know that high heat is damaging my hair, so I&#x27;m going to look for another iron with better temperature regulation.</li>
