            <li>I use this product when my hair is damp and it smells SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>Good product; doesn&#x27;t control frizz well.</li>
            <li>It smells good.  </li>
            <li>So happy I was able to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>It makes me look so sexy frocking my beach wave frock!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this beachy product!  </li>
            <li>It would be better as a fragrance!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, as all of Kevin Murphy&#x27;s products are.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing though.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and keeps my hair intact without looking like it was doused on hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I use Kevin Murphy for most of my shopping and how could anyone give this a good review?  </li>
            <li>oh how i love a good product.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice, though.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent to it, unlike anything else on the market right now.</li>
            <li>Scent is quite strong!</li>
            <li>This product holds in a wave, which is great, but my hair is crunchy all day and sticky when it first goes on.</li>
            <li>I love using this spray when I set my hair to sultry curls.</li>
            <li>Love Kevin Murphy products.</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived with a mis matched top and sprayer...</li>
            <li>It took about 20 years, but I finally found  the perfect product for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But I love all of Kevin Murphy line</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried better surf sprays and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>About a dozen spritzes of this product and some scrunching action while drying (without a diffuser) yields some incredible curls.  </li>
            <li>I use so many sea salt type of products-</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m totally in love.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am sure the light spray can which allows it to spread evenly helps with this effect too.</li>
            <li>This is decent and has a pleasant smell, but it doesn&#x27;t have a long-lasting effect.</li>
            <li>I love this hair product, it holds the style but in a light way without feeling like you have a lot of product in your hair, you can use it prior to styling for the heat protectant value or use it after to break up the style, great for beach waves or beach curls, can even be used in place of hair spray if you use a light hold hair spray</li>
            <li>The smell is fine, not overbearing or anything.</li>
            <li>The cans came in an envelope so they were quite dented, but they work just fine, so I have not found that to be a problem.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much!!</li>
            <li>Still a huge fan of Kevin Murphy shampoos &amp; conditioners, however.</li>
            <li>not too greasy, not too light.</li>
            <li>Good stuff and love the entire KM line  </li>
            <li>and it looks really good with soft curls.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Often my hair looks just as good the next day.  </li>
            <li>i love it so much.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery also!</li>
            <li>I spray in while damp and then blow dry on low to no heat - AMAZING Beachy waves!!!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, straight, silky, and often oily.  </li>
            <li>I was ecstatic when I first started using it, but I&#x27;ve found the most effective way is to use it in tandem with other product.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of products but this spray works the best with my very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely thick and frizzy hair and this spray leaves my hair in nice, beachy type curls without making my hair stiffen up (as moose does) and gives it a nice, clean and crisp look.</li>
            <li>I love the way it keeps my hair soft, yet gives it volume, and style.  </li>
            <li>definitely not the original top and sprayer...</li>
            <li>It really gives volume and gives your hair that beachy outside sexy look!</li>
            <li>It does nothing for my hair&#x27;s natural wave and texture, so perhaps this product is better suited for straight hair.</li>
            <li>And the texture effect is perfect, not too heavy like some other products, it&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li>It could definitely have better resiliency.</li>
            <li>First off I work in a salon</li>
            <li>It gives the exact surfer hair I want without looking too grungy.</li>
            <li>Buying on Amazon was much cheaper than at the salon!</li>
            <li>with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>No matter how much money I spend on products, I always end up with frizzy hair when it is hot and humid.  </li>
            <li>Such an easy way to style my hair</li>
            <li>But I will say that it&#x27;s not my favorite because it leaves my hair looking and feeling dry.</li>
            <li>it did absolutely nothing for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Adds great texture for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>Not wavy at all really.</li>
            <li>like real coconut and beach and hawaiian air and a massage.</li>
            <li>really like this product as a hair hold instead of a gel as it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
            <li>Way too sticky and really does not do the job.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and she has long hair - we both love it!  </li>
            <li>Most leave your hair crunchy and dry - this one is soft and tousled - follow directions!  </li>
            <li>Definitely needed to be packaged better so it could retain its actual shape.</li>
            <li>Kevin Murphy Hair Resort spay is a great product for my short thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Was an older bottle that was a bit dented</li>
            <li>My hair salon is very far away, so it&#x27;s very convenient to buy it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Highly recomended</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried other sea salt, messy, surfer hair solutions and none of them really work or smell as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Blast it with garment steamer and the curls bounce right back up.</li>
            <li>now it is very expensive and this deal was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>(it looks the best this way thanks for asking) and I still hate this.  </li>
            <li>they are both the same, no scent, different cap than the original from the salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a product that holds in my natural wave, but doesn&#x27;t leave the crunchy stickiness.</li>
            <li>I tried this product before but could not find it any where in stores near me.</li>
            <li>The soft waves lasted all day.</li>
            <li>have medium-length thick hair, fine texture.</li>
            <li>The seller explained why and did guarantee it was authentic and offered me a refund if I was not happy.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry my hair like regular hairspray</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The seller explained why and did guarantee it was authentic and offered me a refund if I was not happy.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry my hair like regular hairspray</li>
            <li> Still not sure its the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, slightly wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I had long hair and used this.  </li>
            <li> As someone with board flat hair it has been a challenge in the past achieving beach waves, but this product gives my hair volume and texture without as much drying out as other products.</li>
            <li> It can be used in damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> By ordering from Amazon, I got 4 cans for the price of a single can at my salon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if someone watered it down and put it back in the can.  </li>
            <li> well on wet or dry hair&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> And now my hair is a little above my shoulders</li>
            <li> I like to come out of the shower, spray on the Hair Resort, fluff and go.  </li>
            <li> I have really thin hair, that doesn&#x27;t stay curled or straight.</li>
            <li> My thick Asian hair however only holds it for an hour before dissipating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the same product as the one I purchased in the salon??</li>
            <li> Not as much as other products like this.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little sticky.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, and I became quite annoyed at the price at my hair salon.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> used this product for a few years</li>
            <li> and not cheap sugary...</li>
            <li> MUCH too expensive!</li>
            <li> This made my hair so stiff and unruly.</li>
            <li> so on and each time I used the spray I found my hair looking greasy and stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thin and does not hold curl well</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy hair, which I usually describe as frizzy in humid weather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could like this.</li>
            <li> I started buying the product from my hairdresser at a crazy price of $25 for the same size.</li>
            <li> so I was really curious when this was so bad.</li>
            <li> makes hair look dull and dirty!!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a product that holds in my natural wave, but doesn&#x27;t leave the crunchy stickiness. This product holds in a wave, which is great, but my hair is crunchy all day and sticky when it first goes on. The smell is fine, not overbearing or anything. I won&#x27;t purchase again though. The search continues.</li>
            <li> I love using this spray when I set my hair to sultry curls. It makes me look so sexy frocking my beach wave frock!</li>
            <li> Great for managing my hair.  Love Kevin Murphy products.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this product as a means to give me that &amp;#34;beach head&amp;#34; texture. My thick Asian hair however only holds it for an hour before dissipating. I was ecstatic when I first started using it, but I&#x27;ve found the most effective way is to use it in tandem with other product. It could definitely have better resiliency.</li>
            <li> First off I work in a salon so I already know how this stuff works. Let me just say Hair Resort Spray is AMAZING!! No contest!!!! My hair is long and thin and does not hold curl well but I just use this and a heat protector (no hairspray!) and it will hold for days!!! The only reason why I gave it 3 stars was because the bottle is aluminum and when I received it, it was all bent in. Definitely needed to be packaged better so it could retain its actual shape. Still its a wonderful product</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived with a mis matched top and sprayer...definitely not the original top and sprayer...this makes me wonder if the product is 100%.</li>
            <li> Great customer service from this guy... Highly recomended</li>
            <li> Kevin Murphy Hair Resort spay is a great product for my short thick hair.  I like to come out of the shower, spray on the Hair Resort, fluff and go.  It holds my hair up great and keeps the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look.  I have tried a lot of products but this spray works the best with my very thick hair.  I also use the Hair Resort gel but prefer Anti Gravity for blow drying.  All Kevin Murphy products are great and the have wonderful scents.</li>
            <li> I received this product and there was a hole in the can. I leaked out everywhere. I contacted the seller and they did not reimburse me as they said they would.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and love the entire KM line  I am so happy with all my KM products I have almost 1 of each.</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy hair, which I usually describe as frizzy in humid weather.  No matter how much money I spend on products, I always end up with frizzy hair when it is hot and humid.  This product is amazing, as all of Kevin Murphy&#x27;s products are.  My hair shows no sign of frizz when I use this product.  It took about 20 years, but I finally found  the perfect product for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The only spray I use.</li>
            <li> I tried this product before but could not find it any where in stores near me. So happy I was able to find it on amazon. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is decent and has a pleasant smell, but it doesn&#x27;t have a long-lasting effect. My roots get greasy again within an hour or two. Still a huge fan of Kevin Murphy shampoos &amp; conditioners, however.</li>
            <li> I like the volume it gives to my hair. I don&#x27;t use gel, or mousse or hairspray. And the Kevin Murphy Beach Resort spray gives me the volume that I need. I started buying the product from my hairdresser at a crazy price of $25 for the same size. It lasted forever, but then I tried the Amazon &amp;#34;Kevin&#x27;s&amp;#34; and both this and the last one I purchased (different supplier and actually 3 for about $25)...they are both the same, no scent, different cap than the original from the salon. I think they should be advertised as REJECTS since that is what they are.... they are NOT the same as the Salon Kevins...............</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and frizzy hair and this spray leaves my hair in nice, beachy type curls without making my hair stiffen up (as moose does) and gives it a nice, clean and crisp look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Salt Sprays.  This one is the best I&#x27;ve found.  Most leave your hair crunchy and dry - this one is soft and tousled - follow directions!  I spray in while damp and then blow dry on low to no heat - AMAZING Beachy waves!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim . . . with all the positive reviews. Everyone said it smelled great and worked great. I did not like the smell at all.  .. .and it did absolutely nothing for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again . . .just sayin!</li>
            <li> Was an older bottle that was a bit dented but I didn&#x27;t care about that.  Was the product I wanted and was great.</li>
            <li> Different bottle than shown.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the same product as the one I purchased in the salon??</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Great for the beachy, textured look, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I studied abroad in Australia and found this beautiful product while getting my hair cut over there.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-length thick hair, fine texture. I use this product when my hair is damp and it smells SO GOOD. It gives the exact surfer hair I want without looking too grungy. Such an easy way to style my hair and it looks really good with soft curls.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried other sea salt, messy, surfer hair solutions and none of them really work or smell as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Can was dented. Cap &amp; nozzle were different than a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; bottle you would buy at a salon. Smell was not the same.  Product was not the same.  It&#x27;s as if someone watered it down and put it back in the can.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly...I can&#x27;t figure out what I&#x27;m supposed to do with this product. But I love all of Kevin Murphy line so I&#x27;m still &amp;#34;liking&amp;#34; it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, and I became quite annoyed at the price at my hair salon.  By ordering from Amazon, I got 4 cans for the price of a single can at my salon.  The cans came in an envelope so they were quite dented, but they work just fine, so I have not found that to be a problem.  I will re-order once my supply dwindles.</li>
            <li> I believe I read about the Kevin Murphy Hair Resort Spray on a men&#x27;s fashion blog. It has a great scent to it, unlike anything else on the market right now. But I will say that it&#x27;s not my favorite because it leaves my hair looking and feeling dry. It does nothing for my hair&#x27;s natural wave and texture, so perhaps this product is better suited for straight hair. I&#x27;ve tried better surf sprays and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!! Adds great texture for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! The guy who cuts my hair uses all of Kevin Murphys products! It really gives volume and gives your hair that beachy outside sexy look! Buying on Amazon was much cheaper than at the salon! Very fast delivery also!</li>
            <li> spray nozzle won&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It does the job it says but it&#x27;s a little sticky. Not as much as other products like this. The smell is amazing though. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again. The soft waves lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product, it holds the style but in a light way without feeling like you have a lot of product in your hair, you can use it prior to styling for the heat protectant value or use it after to break up the style, great for beach waves or beach curls, can even be used in place of hair spray if you use a light hold hair spray plus it smells great but the smell doesn&#x27;t distract &amp; you don&#x27;t smell it all day.</li>
            <li> Love this beachy product!  Use it everyday.  It can be used in damp or dry hair. I use it after a shower as. Well as throughout the day to give my hair that beachy look</li>
            <li> horrible product! makes hair look dull and dirty!!!! would never recommend product to anyone, one good thing is is smells good!!</li>
            <li> Love it , buy it all the time !!</li>
            <li> Good product; doesn&#x27;t control frizz well. Smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;Works well on wet or dry hair&lt;br /&gt;Good price for the product</li>
            <li> Still not sure its the real deal.  used this product for a few years now it is very expensive and this deal was too good to be true.  The seller explained why and did guarantee it was authentic and offered me a refund if I was not happy.  I decided to keep it, close but not quite (my opinion).  Seller was very nice</li>
            <li> ..i can tell by the smell.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  It smells amazing and keeps my hair intact without looking like it was doused on hairspray.  Does not dry my hair like regular hairspray either.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently my order got lost in the mail but the seller immediately refunded my money.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair, that doesn&#x27;t stay curled or straight. My hair stylist recommended this product and used it during a salon visit. Very impressed. I don&#x27;t trust my curls to anything else!</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  My hair is fine, straight, silky, and often oily.  This stuff makes it feel like barbie hair... LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair sticky and crunchy. Not wavy at all really.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, slightly wavy hair.  About a dozen spritzes of this product and some scrunching action while drying (without a diffuser) yields some incredible curls.  Often my hair looks just as good the next day.  Blast it with garment steamer and the curls bounce right back up. This product smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> I use Kevin Murphy for most of my shopping and how could anyone give this a good review?  I use so many sea salt type of products- so I was really curious when this was so bad. It smells good.  But, so does spraying perfume on my locks.  I had long hair and used this.  I chopped my hair shorter to my shoulders and used this.  And now my hair is a little above my shoulders (it looks the best this way thanks for asking) and I still hate this.  It leaves hair gross.  By gross- crunchy&#x27;ish, tangley, and just blah.  Sea water beats this stuff from the ocean beats this.  &#x27;Motion Lotion&#x27; from KM mixed with Not your mothers sea salt spray is my current routine.  I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could like this.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I only know of two places you can get this in my area:  my hair salon and on Amazon.  My hair salon is very far away, so it&#x27;s very convenient to buy it on Amazon.  I love the way it keeps my hair soft, yet gives it volume, and style.  If you like that beachy look, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> oh how i love a good product. i got a bottle of this in a swag bag at a blogger conference and i&#x27;m totally in love. this stuff is ecstasy--every squirt is an instant vacation to hawaii. and not cheap sugary...like real coconut and beach and hawaiian air and a massage. and it makes my frizzy head as beachy perfect as it can get. not too greasy, not too light. it&#x27;s just perfect for beachy waves. i love it so much.</li>
            <li> really like this product as a hair hold instead of a gel as it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
            <li> The beachy coconutty smell of this is awesome! And the texture effect is perfect, not too heavy like some other products, it&#x27;s just right! I am sure the light spray can which allows it to spread evenly helps with this effect too.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this at my hairdresser when she was visiting, forgetting she couldn&#x27;t get it home on the airplane. I kept it and ordered her another and had it dellivered to her house. I have short hair and she has long hair - we both love it!  Really great for the curls on me and lots of body for her.</li>
            <li> I love this product. As someone with board flat hair it has been a challenge in the past achieving beach waves, but this product gives my hair volume and texture without as much drying out as other products.</li>
            <li> Way too sticky and really does not do the job. Scent is quite strong!</li>
            <li> This made my hair so stiff and unruly. I used varying amounts in different settings and so on and each time I used the spray I found my hair looking greasy and stiff. MUCH too expensive! Overpriced product and brand. Smells really nice, though. It would be better as a fragrance!</li>
