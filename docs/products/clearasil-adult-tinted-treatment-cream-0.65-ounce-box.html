    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>And Clearasil&#x27;s sulfur product - this one - is the best of them.  </li>
            <li>Great product, great service, A+++!</li>
            <li>Clearasil works great.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Very effective in getting good results.</li>
            <li>This product used to be a perfect, light beige, sofisticated tint.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and a good product  </li>
            <li>- Sulfur works way better for my family!  </li>
            <li>but it does have a nice smell to the lotion.</li>
            <li>After 10 days my skin is clearing up nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried the kind with the benzoyl peroxide a couple of times; both times I ended up in the emergency room with my eyes so swollen, it looked like I&#x27;d gone 10 rounds in the boxing ring.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s just nice for applying a think layer over acne.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t blame you for not selling it in stores, but it would be nice to be able to buy this over the counter somewhere.</li>
            <li>However, be sure to moisturise as it can be drying.</li>
            <li>~One of my kids can&#x27;t stand the smell :-)</li>
            <li>Sure beats drug store</li>
            <li>This one works better for me than the benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>For anyone like me who is concerned about Comediogenic ingredients Acnomel is better.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t mind the tint as I feel better looking at my skin in the mirror at home.  </li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t like moisturizing afterward, but it&#x27;s best to do so before putting on makeup to leave for the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am absolutely sure that if more people knew of this product they would never buy anything with Benzol Peroxide again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Why more manufacturers don&#x27;t produce a Sulfur and Resocinol product is beyond me.</li>
            <li>Material arrived ahead of schedule - everyhing OK.</li>
            <li>So glad it&#x27;s not taken off market online.</li>
            <li>Fully satisfied</li>
            <li>in good quantity at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Sales of this would skyrocket if people knew about it and could easily buy</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a strong smell --</li>
            <li>This came very fast and it was reletivly cheap.</li>
            <li>(And I live in a huge city!)</li>
            <li>a pretty orangey tint!  </li>
            <li>It was such a nice color that I could even use it as makeup.</li>
            <li>They do a good job at preventing acne as well as dry the acne fast.</li>
            <li>I bought it and used it for several days and noticed right off my face looked better.</li>
            <li>When we&#x27;re having an outbreak, in addition to the night routine, we also put in on very, very sparingly in the morning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is great, these will last me at least a year or more.</li>
            <li>and  it really helps!</li>
            <li>I am going to keep trying this product for several more weeks</li>
            <li>I found another brand with the same sulfur and resorcinol formulation but without the Comediogenic ingredients, it works much better</li>
            <li>So a couple of weeks ago, it suddenly dawned on me to look for my old favorite online, and voila!</li>
            <li>AND it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this available, and you will have at least one loyal customer for life!</li>
            <li>No seriously, I have cystic acne</li>
            <li>I bought this with the high hopes it would help with my acne.</li>
            <li>Plus the smell of Clearasil is a little more bearable than acnomel.</li>
            <li>But since using it I can&#x27;t say that it has brought any of my new breakouts to a whitehead or dramatically reduced the size of my breakouts.</li>
            <li>About 10 years ago, (something like that), it had become increasingly more and more difficult to find in stores, until finally I just couldn&#x27;t find it at all anymore.</li>
            <li>It hasnt helped clear my skin</li>
            <li>but I will share my opinions thus far.</li>
            <li>Try Acnomel adult acne treatment instead.  </li>
            <li>I am overly sensitive to Salicylic Acid, so I can&#x27;t use that either.</li>
            <li>They have the right mix of acne drying and moisturizing - other sulfur products are too drying.  </li>
            <li>Nothing major, but I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As the years went by I always kept some for those occasional little facial doodads, not to mention that it made a fantastic cover-up, and still does.</li>
            <li>When I first discovered this product in 1967 at the age of 14, I knew we would be together for a long, long time.</li>
            <li>Clearasil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up the Clearasil Adult Tinted Cream because it just about had almost the same ingredients in it as acnomel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old and have tried every imaginable product on the market to keep my zits under control and this is the ONLY over-the-counter product that works for me.</li>
            <li>I went to Amazon to see if they have it and saw that Clearasil has a similar product (this is the Adult Treatment Cream).</li>
            <li>only complaint is that is has a strong mediciny smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I wet my finger and apply a small amount, just enough to hide the blemish and I am comfortable that I do not look like Red Nose the Reindeer when I am in public ... sounds funny, but I could not locate any tinted acne product in any of the retail stores I looked</li>

            <li> so didn&#x27;t feel any major difference, except that my face seems less oily.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any other store that sold this type of product and it was the only one on Wal-Mart&#x27;s shelve.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this particular version of this product on the store shelves.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t understand why the only two things you can buy in stores is Benzol Peroxide and Salysilic Acid, which very few people can actually use and has only marginal results.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money,</li>
            <li> I recommended it to my other family member</li>
            <li> We like to use a layer all over, then make spot mountains on bad spots (don&#x27;t forget to wash off, though, or you&#x27;ll look very, very funny!)</li>
            <li> The benzoyl peroxide leaves dark marks on my skin, so women of color should use this product instead.</li>
            <li> Extremely allergic!</li>
            <li> It is a very dark tint to it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Go away Benzoil Peroxide (not sure of spelling, and don&#x27;t feel like checking!)</li>
            <li> Before purchasing Clearasil I bought Adult Acnomel and tried it for two nights on a few horrible breakouts that would not come to head.</li>
            <li> and it is annoying to go out in public with the redness</li>
            <li> And to make matters worse, it did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> Benzol Peroxide is like smearing acid on my face and makes my zits much worse.</li>
            <li> bought expensive creams, soaps, and meds in the US and overseas.</li>
            <li> and it was rather expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the color of a dirty pumpkin.</li>
            <li> but it stinks like sulfur.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff is horrible.</li>
            <li> That is one of the worst pore clogging ingredients around.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Rapid and efficient at a low cost</li>
            <li> This really does what it says, and you don&#x27;t need to use it everyday, just when you have breakouts. However, be sure to moisturise as it can be drying.</li>
            <li> Go away Benzoil Peroxide (not sure of spelling, and don&#x27;t feel like checking!) - Sulfur works way better for my family!  And Clearasil&#x27;s sulfur product - this one - is the best of them.  They have the right mix of acne drying and moisturizing - other sulfur products are too drying.  Warning - not for using and going out in public - the color of the sulfur makes the &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; a pretty orangey tint!  ~One of my kids can&#x27;t stand the smell :-) but, he&#x27;ll use it! ~ Put it on at night, and wash off in the morning. We like to use a layer all over, then make spot mountains on bad spots (don&#x27;t forget to wash off, though, or you&#x27;ll look very, very funny!) When we&#x27;re having an outbreak, in addition to the night routine, we also put in on very, very sparingly in the morning.  A benefit to keep in mind - it acts a bit like a barrier - protecting your skin from grease/oils/hair products, etc.</li>
            <li> Clearasil works great.</li>
            <li> This product used to be a perfect, light beige, sofisticated tint. It was such a nice color that I could even use it as makeup. Now they&#x27;ve changed the tint to a tacky orange color. I&#x27;m not kidding. It&#x27;s the color of a dirty pumpkin. Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the high hopes it would help with my acne. This came very fast and it was reletivly cheap. It is a very dark tint to it. Of course I am as white as a ghost! It hasnt helped clear my skin but it does have a nice smell to the lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service, A+++!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and a good product  in good quantity at a very reasonable price. Sure beats drug store</li>
            <li> No seriously, I have cystic acne and I&#x27;ve seen multiple MDs, nurses, bought expensive creams, soaps, and meds in the US and overseas. This is the only thing that does the trick. After 10 days my skin is clearing up nicely. This one works better for me than the benzoyl peroxide. The benzoyl peroxide leaves dark marks on my skin, so women of color should use this product instead. I wear it at night and wash my face with baby shampoo. I only wish they made these in bigger tubes, instead of a puny 18 grams. I&#x27;d rather buy a big tube that will last a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great but it stinks like sulfur.  I can&#x27;t stand it.  Going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have sometimes problems with redness and it is annoying to go out in public with the redness showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefor I wanted a tinted acne product that could somehow mask the redness and blend into my skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I wet my finger and apply a small amount, just enough to hide the blemish and I am comfortable that I do not look like Red Nose the Reindeer when I am in public ... sounds funny, but I could not locate any tinted acne product in any of the retail stores I looked and I looked in many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is great, these will last me at least a year or more.</li>
            <li> I use this product to eliminate itchiness on some red spots on my scalp and face. I recommended it to my other family member and  it really helps!</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff is horrible. Not only did my face stink but the odor permeated my clothes. I washed my shirt multiple times and the smell would not come out!. And to make matters worse, it did nothing for my acne. I will never use this again. A total waste of money,</li>
            <li> Hard to find this particular version of this product on the store shelves. Very effective in getting good results.Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream about two weeks ago from this posted date so maybe my review does not qualify as a \\&quot;thorough\\&quot; one but I will share my opinions thus far. Before purchasing Clearasil I bought Adult Acnomel and tried it for two nights on a few horrible breakouts that would not come to head. The next day whiteheads were visible but I could not stand the smell of that product and it was rather expensive so I returned it and bought Clearasil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up the Clearasil Adult Tinted Cream because it just about had almost the same ingredients in it as acnomel AND it was much cheaper. Plus the smell of Clearasil is a little more bearable than acnomel. But since using it I can&#x27;t say that it has brought any of my new breakouts to a whitehead or dramatically reduced the size of my breakouts. But I can say that it does not leave my skin flakey after use. I am going to keep trying this product for several more weeks but overall I would say its an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> Reading the ingredients I found this stuff and the regular Benzoyl peroxide formulas both contain isopropyl myristate!! That is one of the worst pore clogging ingredients around.  I found another brand with the same sulfur and resorcinol formulation but without the Comediogenic ingredients, it works much better and I threw out the clearasil forever!  Try Acnomel adult acne treatment instead.  For anyone like me who is concerned about Comediogenic ingredients Acnomel is better.</li>
            <li> When I first discovered this product in 1967 at the age of 14, I knew we would be together for a long, long time. As the years went by I always kept some for those occasional little facial doodads, not to mention that it made a fantastic cover-up, and still does. About 10 years ago, (something like that), it had become increasingly more and more difficult to find in stores, until finally I just couldn&#x27;t find it at all anymore. (And I live in a huge city!) I&#x27;d tried the kind with the benzoyl peroxide a couple of times; both times I ended up in the emergency room with my eyes so swollen, it looked like I&#x27;d gone 10 rounds in the boxing ring. Extremely allergic! So a couple of weeks ago, it suddenly dawned on me to look for my old favorite online, and voila! When I received it and dabbed some on, it was like coming home. Thank you thank you thank you! There&#x27;s nothing like this product anywhere, and believe me, I&#x27;ve searched. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this available, and you will have at least one loyal customer for life!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;I can see some improvement with my acne after using this.  Nothing major, but I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the tint as I feel better looking at my skin in the mirror at home.  I personally don&#x27;t like moisturizing afterward, but it&#x27;s best to do so before putting on makeup to leave for the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and have tried every imaginable product on the market to keep my zits under control and this is the ONLY over-the-counter product that works for me. Benzol Peroxide is like smearing acid on my face and makes my zits much worse. I can&#x27;t use it at all. I am overly sensitive to Salicylic Acid, so I can&#x27;t use that either. I was in a Wal-Mart one day found another product that contained sulfur and Resorcinol, like this product does. I bought it and used it for several days and noticed right off my face looked better. I couldn&#x27;t find any other store that sold this type of product and it was the only one on Wal-Mart&#x27;s shelve. I went to Amazon to see if they have it and saw that Clearasil has a similar product (this is the Adult Treatment Cream). I ordered it and have been using it for about a month now with absolutley NO ZITS. I&#x27;m in Freeakin Heaven. I finaly found something that works and I can use.&lt;br /&gt;Hey Clearasil - THANK YOU! PLease do not discontinue this product. I&#x27;m am absolutely sure that if more people knew of this product they would never buy anything with Benzol Peroxide again.&lt;br /&gt;I know dealing with retailers like Wal-Mart and Walgreens is a nightmare so I don&#x27;t blame you for not selling it in stores, but it would be nice to be able to buy this over the counter somewhere. Sales of this would skyrocket if people knew about it and could easily buy it.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that is has a strong mediciny smell. Maybe you could cut back on the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t understand why the only two things you can buy in stores is Benzol Peroxide and Salysilic Acid, which very few people can actually use and has only marginal results. Why more manufacturers don&#x27;t produce a Sulfur and Resocinol product is beyond me.</li>
            <li> Material arrived ahead of schedule - everyhing OK.</li>
            <li> Just started to use it  so didn&#x27;t feel any major difference, except that my face seems less oily. However, I like the texture --&amp;#62; it&#x27;s just nice for applying a think layer over acne. It is not a concealer even though it&#x27;s tinted. It doesn;t cover up at all. There&#x27;s also a strong smell -- must be of the sulphuer smell.</li>
            <li> Great. So glad it&#x27;s not taken off market online. Can&#x27;t get it in stores. Regular clearasil is entirely different formula. Made my face break out in tiny blisters</li>
            <li> They work well. They do a good job at preventing acne as well as dry the acne fast. The tint ensures that you can wear them at work as well. Fully satisfied</li>
