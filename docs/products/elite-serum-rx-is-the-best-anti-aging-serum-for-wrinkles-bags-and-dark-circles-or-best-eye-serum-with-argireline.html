            <li>Loving this line of products!</li>
            <li>Who the heck has this kind of customer service these days!?</li>
            <li>After researching methods to reduce eye puffiness, I found the website for this serum and was impressed with the innovative ingredients.</li>
            <li>I got a lot of suggestions from my flawless skinned friends, but one product intrigued me more than the rest....</li>
            <li>No matter how many YouTube videos I watch, my concealer does not look flawless like the girls in the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which many experts, including Dr. Oz, say is the best alternative to cosmetic injections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin is looking bright and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and honestly I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I am fairly patient, and I realize that repairing damaged tissue like the bags around my eyes is not an overnight process.</li>
            <li>I have read fair reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li>The Good Goods</li>
            <li>I have used the elite serum for about 6 months and saw good results.</li>
            <li>I am 58 and have never had any procedures done because I have been blessed with good skin.</li>
            <li>She had been using it for a couple of months, with surprising results.</li>
            <li>Since that was not an option and the elite serum got good reviews</li>
            <li>We’re all fair skinned</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I was delighted to see the results that Elite Serum boasted.</li>
            <li>Good luck to anyone who makes the purchase.</li>
            <li>The scientific research, testing and documentation of the improvement in texture, tone, wrinkle depth assures you that you have chosen your serum wisely.</li>
            <li>Because of that, and the fact that I have a lot of face-to-face business meetings, it is important that I look my best.</li>
            <li>Plus, looking good makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m not doing any justice to saying how good SkinPro has been for me.</li>
            <li>There are so many products on the market with incredible promises.  </li>
            <li>and I want her to feel good about herself.  </li>
            <li>The owner of this company did make good on it ...</li>
            <li>Seems To Absorb Fairly Well.</li>
            <li>I loved how the product looked and was wrapped</li>
            <li>delivery system is unique, impressive.</li>
            <li>So my wife and I are getting fairly up there in years, and while I of course still think she’s the most beautiful woman in the world</li>
            <li>I recently celebrated another Happy Birthday, yay!</li>
            <li>Not to mention most products leave your skin oily and if you&#x27;re a woman like me that loves makeup applying makeup over the serum or cream just looks clumpy and unnatural, but I&#x27;m happy to admit</li>
            <li>cannot express how SATISFIED and happy I am with this product.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I must say, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The reviews were great and the results I got after a month were even better.  </li>
            <li>While again there are a great many products out there</li>
            <li>, I saw the greatest level of success with this one.</li>
            <li>This organization has brought many great products in to the cosmeticeutical industry.</li>
            <li>I felt it did a great job, better than the Mary Kay and the ROC I had tried.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than a year and the results are great.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The after sales support is also excellent, with on line replies to queries answered quickly and effectively.  </li>
            <li>I have not only seen incredible results myself, but I have also recommended it to friends and family, who have also been very happy with their results!  </li>
            <li>I am pretty impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>Love SkinPro and Elite Serum Rx!</li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>More remarkably, was the change I noticed in the reduction of swelling under my mother&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li>Both products require an additional moisturizer, but Caudalie worked so much better for me!  </li>
            <li>Love  it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to look any more!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>How great to see a productthat accurately details its ingredients..</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are an  amazing Web Site explained it  all from A to Z.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the customer service is beyond amazing.  </li>
            <li>The diagrams are attractive, yes , but they&#x27;re accurate and informative.</li>
            <li>For an added boost, I keep this amazing product in my fridge.</li>
            <li>Please refrain from using words like miracle, amazing,</li>
            <li>So I decided to take matters into my own hands.</li>
            <li>I liked that it was non- comedogenic.  </li>
            <li>And when I tried it I liked the way it felt.  </li>
            <li>It was nice</li>
            <li>Skin Pro is the absolute best at producing products that are based on science and research.  </li>
            <li>Truly an effective product.  </li>
            <li>really liked the syringe applicator</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
            <li>but I liked the idea of a serum.  </li>
            <li>it became so popular that it hit #1 on Amazon&#x27;s bestselling list.</li>
            <li>The product itself is nice.  </li>
            <li>Remarkably, and despite eating salty foods and enjoying our evening wine, each day I looked better than the day before.  </li>
            <li>And its great to know that they even have their own full product line to enhance and improve every area of beauty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible to have a product that really does everything that it claims to do!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I decided to try this, and I already ordered two more applicators, one for my sister and one for my mother</li>
            <li>It feels so good on my skin, and by the second week I started noticing beautiful improvements (and no breakouts!).</li>
            <li>The Elite Serum Rx has been a real good friend to me so far!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for close to 5 weeks now from a girlfriend that began to use it, and I am pleased to say that I am satisfied with what I&#x27;m seeing in the mirror!</li>
            <li>Good for fine lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum is good for my eye area because I have started to see my fine lines disappear in a two month period.</li>
            <li>They have really improved on a product that was already very good.  </li>
            <li>I loved the results and how smoothly it went on around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have quite very impressed thus far.</li>
            <li>This really is a great product to use and is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The product did not have any kind of overwhelming scent to speak of.</li>
            <li>Over the years I’ve developed an impressive number of bags under my eyes (you can thank my kids for that)</li>
            <li>I am impressed so far and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if there was something more effective on the market</li>
            <li>BY FAR, THE BEST EYE PRODUCT THAT EXISTS!!  </li>
            <li>First off, the packaging is nice- sturdy, attractive box, and the syringe is protected and secured in a spongey packing material.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use with the syringe applicator and the texture is very smooth without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>Elite Serum Rx - Extra Strength is the greatest thing that I&#x27;ve found in my trek to discover effective eye care.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best eye serum available.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product that contains very moisturizing ingredients!</li>
            <li>I tried it and at first I wasn&#x27;t happy with what I saw.  </li>
            <li>I do have is very smooth under eye area...</li>
            <li>product itself is a very light,</li>
            <li>Easy to use and amazing results.</li>
            <li>I also really liked the fact that it&#x27;s in a syringe, which makes it easy to carry around and apply.</li>
            <li>And I discovered that photographing your own eye isn’t easy at ALL, so please forgive the disaster of the attached photo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>This is easily one of the most effective creams I’ve ever applied in trying to get rid of the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always in front of people, and being able to be confident is very important.</li>
            <li>They seem more lifted and even toned as well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased.    </li>
            <li>I even feel more confident now when I leave my house without any makeup on to cover my raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>Besides that, I just looked more refreshed and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been using this for many months, and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried getting more sleep, the cucumber treatment, and a variety of cosmetic products.</li>
            <li>So I started using it on my bruises 3x’s a day (morning/noon/night), I just let the Elite Serum work its magic on healing and repairing my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love their line, everything seems to work for me.</li>
            <li>But the eye serum is one of my favorite products, it keeps my eyes glowing.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I may be using it more liberally than I should</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>And I have tried many.</li>
            <li>My skin just felt refreshed, healthier, and better moisturized...</li>
            <li>For many years, I worked in a specialty store&#x27;s dept.</li>
            <li>I found this Elite Serum RX outstanding in the genre.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy I bought it and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Best of all, you know it&#x27;s safe: it&#x27;s been on the market since 2013 and underwent two years of testing prior to that.</li>
            <li>I was glad I did.  </li>
            <li>, I was pleased.</li>
            <li>I want to make sure that I take care of my aging skin.</li>
            <li>Product does nothing more than leaving your skin</li>
            <li>, every year she gets more and more self-conscious about her aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Compared to everything else she has tried this has definitely worked the best.  </li>
            <li>tried so many products that promised results...</li>
            <li>went to a Web Site where woman, She explained push the top plastic piece to the end&lt;br</li>
            <li>trying many products like I said.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 3 times more potent for quicker results...</li>
            <li>more concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though the price of Elite Serum Rx was more than I wanted to spend, I figured I needed something that could help me out.</li>
            <li>It does more than just moisturize; it really helps take away the circles and puffiness around my eyes, and I don’t have to inject poisonous toxins into my face, and I like that a great deal.</li>
            <li>I had faithfully used two syringes of Elite Serum and was truly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>These lines bother me even more then the wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found just what I was looking for based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>Lovely options.  </li>
            <li>The Elite Serum leaves no shine and I am comfortable in my own skin.</li>
            <li>Every time I put on my under eye concealer, my makeup settles into the lines, drawing more attention to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eye area has never looked better.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t have that greasy texture like most products.</li>
            <li>There are so many products that promise &#x27;wrinkle reducing&#x27; capabilities.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that I would gladly try for 3-4 months, but not at this price.</li>
            <li>I personally enjoyed using the Elite Serum.</li>
            <li>Despite any age, your skin will appear tighter and more elastic.</li>
            <li>and I keep coming for more...</li>
            <li>I started with just using it at night for a week to make sure I didn&#x27;t develop any reactions.  </li>
            <li>It went on so smoothly around my eyes it felt amazing.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Top notch customer service.</li>
            <li>I love the syringe applicator to keep the product sterile and control the application amount..</li>
            <li>It might be better for wrinkles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the result I love seeing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still torn as to whether or not its working better than my Clinique All About Eyes, but I&#x27;m going to keep trying it.</li>
            <li>I also love that this company doesn&#x27;t do any testing on animals and</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that the dispense locks</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m aging it seems as though I&#x27;m getting more, and more wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>The instant products worked the best but a lot of them would crack after application or my makeup would stick to it.  </li>
            <li>More over, I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I have tried more treatments for my face, eyes, forehead, and neck than I will ever admit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better eye creams on the market (and cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with many different types of products trying to find the best preventative and rejuvenating formula.  </li>
            <li>Cornell Univ came up with an algorithm (http://reviewskeptic.com) in which you can cut and paste a review and to see if review is truthful or not.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this cream.</li>
            <li>Should I have taken better care of my skin in my 20s?</li>
            <li>, I noticed that the skin around my eyes look better.</li>
            <li>I would continue using this until something better comes up.</li>
            <li>One more thing to add</li>
            <li>I was more then satisfied with the Elite Serum but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>By applying it before going to sleep and after waking up I feel more confident and the skin around my eyes firmer and moisturised.</li>
            <li>Fabulous results!</li>
            <li>and when I came home for the holidays there was definitely a notable difference in the quality of her skin.</li>
            <li>Please be sure that this review is written with &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; emotion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok to include pros and cons.  </li>
            <li>SYN®-COLL increases the amount of collagen your body produces to help make the skin cells more elastic, so they do not shrivel up and wrinkle.</li>
            <li>This is used in most anti-aging serums to rejuvenate and repair the tissue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sincerely, John Paul (BTW, I told my plastic surgeon he needs to recommend this product / company as well)</li>
            <li>As a product junkie, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried em all--particularly most Retin-A bearing products.</li>
            <li>Either I have the world&#x27;s most stubborn, product-resistant eyes in the world</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>THIS “MAGIC PEN” MY Elite Serum, IS THE ANTI-AGING SOLUTIONS</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 1 month and just love it.  </li>
            <li>You do not need to use a generous amount of cream to achieve outstanding results.</li>
            <li>I recently tried this product and I must say I was really impressed.</li>
            <li>Suffering from insomnia surely doesn&#x27;t help, either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frantically, I phoned all my family and friends with the same inherited eye problems to tell them about this cosmetic treasure I had found and how it would make a wonderful birthday gift.</li>
            <li>There are so many products to choose from that make all sorts of claims about reducing wrinkles around the eyes and mouth and puffiness under the eyes.</li>
            <li>After some weeks using this product, the wrinkles and the puffiness are much more disguised..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried products like Olay Regenerist and Shiseido Regenerating Cream and while they were okay, I never got the &amp;#34;deep down&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>And the reason why is because it is 100% needle free!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a better eye treatment - one that worked -</li>
            <li>I cannot express how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>Additionally, another benefit that I love about</li>
            <li>It spreads lightly, absorbs nicely, and you feel a refreshing, hydrating sensation after applying it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not stranger to serums, I know collagen is our friend, and I have learned that you need to spend a bit more to get products that produce results.</li>
            <li>Love how you an feel tightened your skin.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a life saver in a skinny skinny tube. :)</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, it felt really good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to see what will happen after 3-6 months.</li>
            <li>The package is unique, the product itself is amazing, and it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>think you are doing pretty good for your age&amp;#34; or something to that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(and I liked the cool design of the syringe).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m aging, any fine lines that develop become SO much more prominent when I am wearing concealer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how I will look in the upcoming months!</li>
            <li>This product is simultaneously rich and weightless!</li>
            <li>What I like most about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have any strong fragrances or odors.</li>
            <li>The reason I use the two together is that there it&#x27;s not cost effective to use the Elite Serum Rx on the forehead and around the mouth because I would go through it too quickly.</li>
            <li>so maybe the serum will work better for women with fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed it helps to make fine lines not so prominent.  </li>
            <li>oily skin, which can be a huge pain because anything that I put on my face, even if its just around my eyes, tends to make my face even more greasy.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, I saw continued improvement a month into using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not even sure if these products are even available anywhere else.</li>
            <li>However, since I’ve tried the Elite Serum, my face is smooth yet again and my complexion has never looked better.</li>
            <li>thing I love about the serum is that it goes on light weight with no oily feeling, and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my moisturizers and makeup</li>
            <li>So far I am happy.  </li>
            <li>Being an avid Amazon Bargain Hunter, I was very pleased to find this product on here.</li>
            <li>Then, with a touch of serum at my finger tip, I dabbed it smoothly around the bottom of each eye, working my way to the top.</li>
            <li>However,  it&#x27;s the best money I have ever spent on a beauty product.  </li>
            <li>Even better is that its fragrance free so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;fresh look&#x27; was something that I honestly had not seen in some time.</li>
            <li>love that it goes on so easy, non greasy and makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves a great feeling around your eyes and has a very soft and light feeling when applying.</li>
            <li>Most amazingly, the hooding , one of the most humiliating signs that you are indeed getting older, is gradually diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in the fine lines I have yet, but I will give it more time.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally be able to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>t say enough good things about Elite Serum!</li>
            <li>After receiving, unwrapping, and setting my aging eyes on Elite Serum RX, I swiftly fell in love with the unique syringe-like applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited about the Bellapulse System he was able to award me as I am</li>
            <li>I love them...and thank you also for friendly helpful personnel.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and no side affects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard great things about Elite Serum, but before I decided to try it, a friend told me about Elite Serum Rx, which is supposed to be the same thing, but even better.</li>
            <li>is that it’s easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a sensational product and I recommend this to anyone who wants to revitalize their skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, so I kept using it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This works very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IS EASY TO APPLY</li>
            <li>Also, it is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>One of my best friends is a Botox diva (and looks fabulous), but I was not ready for the needle.</li>
            <li>So for me, this product is too strong.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try this as I liked that one of the main ingredients was seaweed and it sounded like it would be very light  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full price though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Elite Serum Rx for almost 2yrs now to prevent the fine lines and wrinkles from developing around my eyes, mouth and forehead area.</li>
            <li>The most incredible result was with my dark circles.</li>
            <li>It all worked out just fine.</li>
            <li>The serum rx is wonderful and gets rid of the slight puffiness that remains.</li>
            <li>I was getting fed up with seeing a bunch of fine lines appearing around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>, another ingredient found in Elite Serum RX, is an octapeptide that can prevent the development of wrinkles and fine lines through the attenuation of muscle contractions.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t have a lot of fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>I had fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>the fine lines turned into the fine line.  </li>
            <li>She said it goes on smooth, not greasy, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Smooths out Fine Lines</li>
            <li>much more where using Elite Serum with tremendous success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The most change I&#x27;ve seen was a mild softening around the corners of my eyes with Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>I go through it a lot more quickly.  </li>
            <li>From the very first time I used this product I knew it was going to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have been using Elite Eye Serum for several years and am very pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li>This is my very first time to write a review because I am very excited about the product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the serum for 3 months I’ve seen a HUGE difference in wrinkles around my eyes though.</li>
            <li>I started using Elite Serum Rs and can tell a huge difference already.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 90% accurate.</li>
            <li>I dab that under my eyes and on where people get &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; even though I don&#x27;t have any, then use a AH oil free moisturizer on the rest of my face...</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I came across the Elite Serum - RX from Skin Pro.</li>
            <li>I use Elite Serum because its established reputation for reversing the signs of aging, its a light weight consistency and it has also toned the skins around my eye.</li>
            <li>The serum is perfume free which I like and absorbs well when I apply at night.</li>
            <li>I also noticed wrinkles reduction, no puffness around my eyes and just an overall great apearence.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous...</li>
            <li>guess what another fabulous plus...</li>
            <li>This product is fragrance free which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m getting great results above my lip.  </li>
            <li>You just place a dime size drop on your fingers and apply to where you see fit.</li>
            <li>I had some success, but still wanted to improve a bit more.  </li>
            <li>It contains scientifically advanced peptides that are proven to result in DNA rejuvenation.</li>
            <li>It is made in an advanced FDA-licensed laboratory in the United States.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s oil free</li>
            <li>Since she looked fabulous I had to order one myself.</li>
            <li>I like this product too because the company doesn&#x27;t do any animal testing which is important to me.</li>
            <li>That part of the description is really, really important.</li>
            <li>Since then, it&#x27;s been smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make a difference like a filler would, but for a topical product, it works great.</li>
            <li>but this is a great daily product to use in conjunction with.</li>
            <li>Both products are paraben free which is a plus.</li>
            <li>But if you go for the cheaper brands, you&#x27;ll end up spending upwards of $100 anyway trying to find a cheap cream that works.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Vitamin C Serum all over my face to help with moisture, to even skin tone and smooth out lines and rid some puffiness.  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes looked supple, smooth and noticeably brighter.  </li>
            <li>It helped his bags so much under his eyes he wanted his own tube.</li>
            <li>I am grateful that this now has worked out smoothly.</li>
            <li>I sincerely believe that this is an excellent product for the delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li>But so far, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Those fine wrinkles have significantly smoothed out.  </li>
            <li>Elite Serum Rx has made me feel more confident in my appearance as I reach a new age milestone!</li>
            <li>¦s not like I¡¦m getting any younger, and the problem will go away º. Special thanks to Skin Pro and their great service!!  </li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the product and have high hopes of</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced some slight improvements but hoping for better with continued use.  </li>
            <li>Thank you SkinPro for creating such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>The results have been gradual but absolutely genuine, and I&#x27;m more than happy to continue to take a few seconds out of my day in order to keep my face this way.</li>
            <li>100% original because I bought from its web site as well.</li>
            <li>and I’m excited to see if it continues to help.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and felt cool.</li>
            <li>Elite Serum Rx may take some time, but now that I’ve finished with one syringe my wrinkles have significantly smoothed away.</li>
            <li>Within a pretty timely fashion I noticed a hair more brightness and vivaciousness in my image in the mirror.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>So far I have used this for 5 weeks and am very pleased with my results.</li>
            <li>I was actually excited when I woke up each morning to see the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Within the first week, my puffy, droopy, tired-looking dilemmas seemed to magically disappear.</li>
            <li>The site recommends using for about 6 months before seeing significant improvements.</li>
            <li>The only improvement I have seen is with a couple of wrinkles on my neck that seem to be looking softer, and the gel is very smooth and feels nice, hence the 2 stars.</li>
            <li>He was apologetic and courteous and said a new one had been mailed.</li>
            <li>While nothing short of sand-blasting will create the skin of an 18-year-old on the eyelids of this 63-year-old woman, I can honestly say that my lids...from the lash line to the brows....as well as the under-eye area, look quite a bit better than they did before I started using this serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than pleased with the results I see thus far</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I¡¦d been using a product recommended by my plastic surgeon (for eye puffiness), for approximately 2 years, and experienced fair results.</li>
            <li>I spent a few days doing research on trending products, products with the best feedback, most effective ingredients and Elite Serum</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soaks right in when you put it on - which is so easy to do with the applicator.</li>
            <li>When you apply it to clean skin you can feel a slightly cool sensation to let you know its working.</li>
            <li>They sent me another order special delivery, and at no cost to me.</li>
            <li>I am super excited about settling on this serum and not have to go looking for others.</li>
            <li>product is certainly one of the most effective cosmetics when it comes to preventing the natural aging of skin.</li>
            <li>You really get the most out of your money.</li>
            <li>for\\&quot; is definitely true.</li>
            <li>I really thought that I would never look healthy again.  </li>
            <li>but I do feel good enough to wear my contacts now.  </li>
            <li>I usually try and take care of my eyes with rest and a good diet, but this product does a great job helping me out on days when I can’t take the time to care for myself the way I normally would do.</li>
            <li>but my purchase included a hand full of samples.  </li>
            <li>Matrixyl 3000 contains Matrikines are responsible for cutaneous repair and restructuration, and make your skin more youthful and glowing with health.  </li>
            <li>I keep my Elite Serum Rx in the fridge because I like the cool feel when applying it.  </li>
            <li>Since I am in my late twenties, I began my search on products once I noticed lines around my eyes and came across this superb serum.</li>
            <li>My under eye area looks and feels more hydrated and the skin around my eyes has a much smoother appearance.</li>
            <li>a 60 year old woman and a product like this will not do the trick all on its own</li>
            <li>I have tried more creams and concealers than I can count and gave up years ago on finding any real</li>
            <li>I hope to receive a full refund</li>
            <li>I wanted to look good for my sister’s wedding last month, but my skin was not cooperating.</li>
            <li>I loved youthology 90 second serum, but they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  </li>
            <li>still, not a bad serum.</li>
            <li>This eye serum is absolutely hands down the best I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best treatment for fine lines and dark circles I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>As others have said, there is no miracle serum per se, but this has worked far better than anything else I&#x27;ve used for reducing my fine lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>but I notice other areas (around the mouth, frown lines) that have shown great improvement.  </li>
            <li>I see no difference, since I use some other great eye cream.</li>
            <li>You receive a clean, fresh dose every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum hasn&#x27;t done anything for me, I&#x27;m 28 and have my first fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>have never seen a product that skin can absorbs so quickly.</li>
            <li>My eyes are what my potential clients see the most of, and judge me the most by.</li>
            <li>and so I quickly ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li>My skin was firmer, refined and the tone was extraordinary.</li>
            <li>It has quickly become a staple in my skin care routine</li>
            <li>It started to work so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I started with the regular elite serum and had exceptional results.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product; I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s actually quite pleasant to wear, as it&#x27;s not oily, smelly or bothersome.</li>
            <li>This product is great for getting rid of puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li>More for preventative reasons than anything else, I started looking into skin products hoping to stave off premature wrinkling and baggy eyes, but never really felt comfortable giving most of them a chance.</li>
            <li>I am very consistent when using this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a youngish person, but for the first time in awhile I feel like I look my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the very first application I could feel the ¡§firming¡¨ effects as well as see the improvement immediately.</li>
            <li>This serum is pricey, but it is definitely worth the investment when you look younger and feel more confident about your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>There was no unpleasant aroma or stickiness that accompanied the product.</li>
            <li>This is a really good serum that appears to work on fine lines (my wife is 52) and reduce the appearance of dark circles or puffiness.  </li>
            <li>Caudalie Premier CRU eye cream was much more effective for fading my dark circles, absorbs quickly, brightens the undereye with its pearlescent cream and lifts and firms the eye area.  </li>
            <li>More than that, I need to look young and fit, well-rested and energetic as opposed to old and weary.</li>
            <li>better way to get the results you want than trying SkinPro&#x27;s new Elite Serum Rx.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say no other products I have tried makes my skin look and feel so healthy and natural.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference right away, by far this product is the best compared to other products.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing happened!!</li>
            <li>The not reason I gave 4 stars is because it costs so much skinpro please reduce the price!!</li>
            <li>Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength does what it says and more!  </li>
            <li>First of all, I did not hate the product or love the product as far as how it smelled, felt, etc.</li>
            <li>This is my first time!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy at the quick reply from this Company to replace broken product/item.</li>
            <li>when applying it is very light and soft .Also</li>
            <li>The serum is a very light, clear liquid.</li>
            <li>I also started to notice that the dark shadows I had always had under my eyes started to lighten and my face really started to pop with a nice glow because my eyes finally looked bright and well rested!</li>
            <li>Since it was a little pricey, I thought it would be better to spend that kind of money on something for my lip lines.  </li>
            <li>Living in Los Angeles, you can imagine the many skin care products constantly thrown in your face, but I’d have to say that so far, both my esthetician and I agree that this has been the most effective treatment by far.</li>
            <li>However, I found that the results are well worth it</li>
            <li>And for me personally it was the best $90 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the price because it works.</li>
            <li>and I like it far better than creams.  </li>
            <li>but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>This POWERFUL eye serum works in areas where cosmetic injections can not.</li>
            <li>It took about four months before I noticed a change, but it was worth the time I waited.</li>
            <li>My crow’s feet aren’t completely gone, but they have softened and I feel a lot better about that</li>
            <li>Two months into using the product, and I can legitimately say this was well worth</li>
            <li>There were so many days I deliberately tried to avoid eye contact with myself in the mirror after a late night, but the baggy eyes that used to greet me most every morning are significantly better now.</li>
            <li>After all this research I was convinced not only by my own experience</li>
            <li>The self-confidence I&#x27;ve gained alone is worth the cost of the product.</li>
            <li>A fresh dose is delivered through a device that looks and  behaves like a syringe.</li>
            <li>No eleven lines , forehead furrows or permanent wrinkles we like to call laugh lines</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely thrilled with Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength and am exploring SkinPro&#x27;s line of products designed to produce comparable results on the remainder of the face, the neck and décolleté .</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>The bags aren&#x27;t completely gone but they are much better than what they were.</li>
            <li>I have even received compliments that I look rested and fresh from family and friends.</li>
            <li>Professional products that cost 100 or more products that are OTC and products from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>It works, and it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the results.</li>
            <li>I immediately loved the way it made the sensitive skin around my eyes feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It doesn’t come cheap, but I can honestly say it’s worth every penny that I spent.</li>
            <li>but I think it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that with any product that you use, you will have to maintain so that&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; per se.</li>
            <li>Another bonus,  is that the ingredients are non-comedogenic, which means that it is safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also use this serum around my mouth to target my laugh lines and I can say those are softer too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to look for a diff product by SkinPro that targets the laugh lines, lines around the nose and forehead lines.</li>
            <li>So Far One Of The Better Eye Serums.</li>
            <li>They were open and honest with me about how my face was rapidly changing over the years.</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old and most days</li>
            <li>It might seem to be a bit pricey, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much for your quick reply to my problem...</li>
            <li>Actually, there was more improvement than I had experienced with any other product.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely well worth the money and gives you a beautiful appearance in your eyes once more reducing dark circles and puffiness!</li>
            <li>is a product that is effectively formulated to decrease dark circles, puffiness, and fine lines.</li>
            <li>But at seven weeks in, I&#x27;m so excited about what this serum has done for my skin that I&#x27;m ready to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beyond the unbelievable results, what I love most about the Elite Serum is how light it feels.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to look younger and have their eyes looking great again.to spread easily.</li>
            <li>I started using it once every couple of days, and once I saw a change, I&#x27;m now using it every morning right after I get out of the shower..</li>
            <li>It wasn’t greasy and soaked right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>and right</li>
            <li>I ended up giving this one a try, and it didn&#x27;t work right away, so I thought about using something else.</li>
            <li>Some ppl said they saw results right away.  </li>
            <li>The texture is also nice-it absorbs right into the skin with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>One pump is the right amount of serum for both eyes.  </li>
            <li>My skin was softer and smoother right away</li>
            <li>It came and I started using it right away.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I guess the skin just needs the right nutrients or something to make things look how they are supposed to.</li>
            <li>I saw results right away.</li>
            <li>What’s really exciting is that it’s actually oil free and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>My kids had commented after using the first Elite serum and were even more surprised after using the Rx version.&lt;br /&gt;After five years of trying products, I had never seen the improvement around my eyes that I have had with Elite Serum Rx.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To use Elite Serum Rx, you gently squeeze out just a drop and apply it to your clean eye area twice a day, preferably in the morning and in the evening.  </li>
            <li>Clear Glides on smooth    Absorbs quickly    </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been going through a trial error period with many different products, and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Not a ton of them, but the few I had were quite prominent and really noticeable when I smiled.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I have dark circles around my eyes, and I&#x27;ve never found anything that would help.</li>
            <li>The years have surely been good to me, but my eyes appear to have aged a hefty ten years, instead of one.</li>
            <li>I am getting more mature and am very aware of the impact of getting older used to have on my skin.</li>
            <li>A summer spent on the beach, lax sunscreen application, too many “beverages” and sunburns all contributed to a splotchy patchwork on my face that included under-eye circles, fine lines around my eyes, and flaky skin on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>It caught my attention because it was lab tested and contains medical grade ingredients, which seemed more legitimate than the majority of serums and creams that I&#x27;ve come across in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Elite Serum, I saw results pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the syringe, once I got the hang of it, rather than a little jar (where your finger gets most of the treatment rather than your eyes).</li>
            <li>; it had new award-winning stuff added and it said it was oil free.</li>
            <li>I definitely plan on repurchasing and would recommend this serum to anyone who wants a reliable and effective eye treatment.</li>
            <li>yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company ships their products super fast.  </li>
            <li>I had previously wrote a not so good review on this item.</li>
            <li>I love skinpro in general, I&#x27;m open to trying any products by them, because most of them have proven to work for me.</li>
            <li>I am 65 yrs old and it isn&#x27;t easy finding an eye cream that really works!  </li>
            <li>I was all cleared to wear makeup and with a little concealer underneath the eyes, I was good to go.  </li>
            <li>I hesitated to try Elite Serum RX Strength because it was a little pricey, but the reviews were really good, so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>I think this product helps more with dark circles than it does fine lines</li>
            <li>I will turn 50 years old at the end of this year and while I have very youthful looking skin, I do have fine lines on my forehead, around my eyes and smile</li>
            <li>I tried a little and liked it, a cool feeling with no residue.  </li>
            <li>Elite Serum RX really works!</li>
            <li>I still need to make it a goal to get more sleep, however use this on the bags on my eyes has helped vastly improve the condition of under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I just love this product and will definitely &lt;br /&gt;continue using it.</li>
            <li>Actually, my skin is now better than I&#x27;ve ever imagined it could be.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t bother me at first.  </li>
            <li>But I decided to look for an oil-free cream first and found Elite Serum on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Works great on wrinkles as long as you apply on daily basis.  </li>
            <li>She first had me try some by Sunday Riley.</li>
            <li>Elite Serum is the first serum I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I just orderd the Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength and expect even better results.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements.  </li>
            <li>After my first use I noticed a tightness around my eyes, and my puffiness from lack of sleep disappeared.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid is the key for maintaining water substances in human skin which is one of the key elements in flawless skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I could actually use it during the day it would work better for me, but I wear makeup all day.</li>
            <li>It definitely firms the under eye area for sure..</li>
            <li>I never looked like I got much sleep!</li>
            <li>I even signed up for their refill program (via their website) since it saves quite a bit, and I can put it on hold anytime (which I did after three months, since I&#x27;ve been slow-poking my way through the first month&#x27;s supply).</li>
            <li>This product has not only virtually eradicated the bags under my eyes but also gotten rid of most of the puffiness.</li>
            <li>So, I began going to bed earlier and resting more on the weekend, However, I still could not got rid of those circles.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m actually quite glad</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several weeks now, and I am able to notice the difference.</li>
            <li>I feel and look so much younger and people I know have asked me what I&#x27;m doing because my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 again can&#x27;t happen, looking like a much younger, more wide-awake and fresh-eyed woman works for me.</li>
            <li>I can see the lines have reduced in appearance, which has made me not use much makeup; I couldn&#x27;t be happier about that part!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>This one took care of both, and pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>appreciate the detailed explanations of the purpose, method of action and efficacy provided on the website.</li>
            <li>At first I was weary of trying this stuff.</li>
            <li>But most of all, I gained back my self-confidence, and the comments about me stopped.</li>
            <li>I am a consistent user of SkinPro products and Elite Serum</li>
            <li>The texture around my eyes is smooth, I actually look like I get a full night&#x27;s sleep now, even though I don&#x27;t, and a co-worker</li>
            <li>However, after the third month, I did not notice any more improvement.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to look younger and have their eyes looking great again.</li>
            <li>Plus there was the hassle of using so many different products on my face every day.</li>
            <li>Have tried many eye serums and thought this might be different.  </li>
            <li>I used it exactly as recomended (every day and every night.)</li>
            <li>Elite Serum RX Extra Strength is the latest and strongest  version of  a series of eye serums made by SkinPro.  </li>
            <li>First off, everyone has been raving about their leading product that has redefined beauty; called Elite Serum.</li>
            <li>As far as results,, my dark, puffy circles are greatly improved and the skin around my eyes looks healthier.</li>
            <li>The dispenser to the fragrance free, clear product, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product to make a noticeable improvement in my eye area and I am amazed.</li>
            <li>Try it - it really works!</li>
            <li>For me, the biggest concern is how to get smooth soft skin, along with tackling the problem of eye puffiness..</li>
            <li>The first product I came across was a type of anti-aging lotion.</li>
            <li>the product first came</li>
            <li>I’m actually pretty selective</li>
            <li>you are aging around the eyes (or are interested in premature aging methods)</li>
            <li>The fine lines seem to require a little more effort to treat but the Dispensing Syringe does help with the application</li>
            <li>The good results extended to minor wrinkles and the general look/feel of my skin, and the changes recently became more permanent and visible to the untrained eye.</li>
            <li>co-worker complimented me the other day saying my skin looked nice, so I am going to stick with this product and see what else happens.</li>
            <li>When I settled on Elite Serum, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much, but I figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams and this is the only one that I have seen a very visible improvement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pacing myself from writing a review until I&#x27;ve responsibly used this for about three months, a solid time frame to assess any notable changes while using a skin product.  </li>
            <li>Elite Serum Rx, combined with a definite healthy shift in lifestyle choices, really helped me reset the clock.</li>
            <li>The skin under my eyes was lightening and looking truly healthy for the first time in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received this product very quickly and customer service was very fast and prompt when I had emailed with a questions prior to purchasing.  </li>
            <li>After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try the product for myself.</li>
            <li>It really works, I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t really see a lot of results, but I figured I would give it a bit longer to work.</li>
            <li>They have other great products for the entire face, not just eyes.</li>
            <li>a satisfied and long time uses of the Elite Serum.</li>
            <li>Haloxyl, also called Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, can effectively reduce dark spots and puffiness by promoting blood circulation in the eyes.</li>
            <li>After I researched the active ingredient hyaluronic acid and read some great things about it, I decided it was definitely something I wanted to try.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, I have tried more facial products to help improve my skin.  </li>
            <li>admit I wasn&#x27;t interested in Elite Serum Rx initially because I&#x27;m not the kind of person who spends $80 on a cosmetic product, but I finally bit the bullet because I though I might as well shell out for the good stuff instead of continuing to throw my money at cheaper products that weren&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this sure is an expensive product, but you know what?</li>
            <li>It is a best selling product for a reason — I have used it for a couple of months now and the dark circles around my eyes have noticeably reduced, so too the puffiness although this took a little longer to fade.</li>
            <li>and I have seen more improvement than I had thought would be possible and saw more improvement than any other product I had used.</li>
            <li>I looked more awake and refreshed than I had in long time!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry like most products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to use, absorbs well, etc.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very particular about the products I use.</li>
            <li>serum is such a pleasure to use it easily integrates into your routine..</li>
            <li>Enough will come out to spread easily.</li>
            <li>I’m very pleased with this product and will definitely be keeping it in my regular skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how simple and easy to use this product was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent way more than this on many other beauty products combined with no results, so I decided it was worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Consequently, I can say for certain that the Elite Serum has undoubtedly worked for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no chemist, but whatever is in this serum is certain give plastic surgeons a run for their money.</li>
            <li>The product is so easy to apply and takes up just seconds of my day, so daily usage is no problem, and I didn&#x27;t think there would be much to lose.</li>
            <li>However, most products I&#x27;ve used have had minimal results and I was less than enthusiastic about them.</li>
            <li>For some reason I was starting to see fine lines under my eyes; maybe it&#x27;s aging.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit steep but definitely worth the splurge and considerably cheaper than the loads money I have thrown away on less effective products.</li>
            <li>However, after several weeks of use, I noticed that the fine lines and wrinkles started to dissipate.</li>
            <li>no amount of facial exercise and diet were making a dent into those fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the way the serum absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t made my T-zone oily (I use it on the lines on my forehead too!)  </li>
            <li>My first tube is just running out at around 11 weeks of steady applications.</li>
            <li>My skin felt immediately better, as far as hydrated and soft, but I did not see real results for about 4 weeks – after which time, wow!  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes and on my entire face (I apply to my forehead and around the mouth too) in general just feels fresher and smoother since I’ve started using this serum, and it’s also very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The Elite Syrum Rx is definitely not a facelift in a tube, but it&#x27;s a great product if you&#x27;re looking to improve your appearance a little and don&#x27;t have a lot of time, money and effort to invest.</li>
            <li>The formula for actually is different, and makes a huge difference as well.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>If you accidentally use too much, the excess rolls off your skin    </li>
            <li>because I had very saggy eyelids</li>
            <li>And getting them on Amazon is so much cheaper than getting them anywhere else</li>
            <li>Been using for a month and seeing wrinkles under eyes stating to decrease  and to anyone worried about wrinkled should definitely give this fabulous product a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to really fuss with makeup.  </li>
            <li>It really has smoothed out the crows feet and the bag lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>but not seeing any unusual transformations.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely important that anti-aging products are kept air-tight and do not have contact with outside elements.</li>
            <li>But, the real test came when I went to work (I work with all females in a cosmetic dentistry office)</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed it working very well..</li>
            <li>/&gt;They explained that  over  100,000, of people and much.</li>
            <li>I believe it will all be gone very soon...</li>
            <li>I really appreciate what Elite Serum Rx does for my eyes.</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway, kiddos.</li>
            <li>We’re talking about real science here.</li>
            <li>Real results.</li>
            <li>My skin is sagging, lacking elasticity and no matter how much weight I seem to lose, the skin is just not tightening up.  </li>
            <li>Twice daily use of the Elite Serum Rx, along with a complete over-haul of my diet and a focused effort to get more sleep has given me better than expected results.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t notice much help with puffiness but am not giving up yet as others have commented it may take a while.  </li>
            <li>on a beauty product, at most I&#x27;ve spent around $50</li>
            <li>but how much goes into the science of it.  </li>
            <li>so maybe it really would have helped with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; (the name makes it sound weirder than it is) did the trick for me overall.</li>
            <li>I really really like this product and woudl defiantly recommend it to family and friends who suffer with bags under their eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Elite Serum RX Strength really works.</li>
            <li>Its been 2 months haven&#x27;t seen a change like the reviews I&#x27;ve been reading about, really bummed because I didn&#x27;t want to have to turn to injections.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see the result very well.</li>
            <li>SkinPro staff has been knowledgeable,and very helpful.</li>
            <li>gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>This time I REALLY found it.  </li>
            <li>And while I don’t know what peptides really are, I do know that their addition to the serum makes Elite clinically proven to reduce eye wrinkles</li>
            <li>I have tried so may products and was beginning to feel like nothing was really going to help reduce the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was using Hydroxatone for about a year but didn&#x27;t really notice much of a change.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to others who want to nip the aging process in the bud!</li>
            <li>Also, really there is no glitter in this.</li>
            <li>the Elite Serum Rx has really improved my eye bag situation.</li>
            <li>however it is very pricey.</li>
            <li>It does not feel sticky or slimy and absorbs into the skin quite fast.</li>
            <li>It does not feel sticky or slimy and absorbs into the skin quite fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I started looking for another product for my eyes after my drugstore cream was running out, and frankly, not working very well.</li>
            <li>and I had no issues with it absorbing.  </li>
            <li>If someone is having absorbency issues I think it may be because they are using too much.  </li>
            <li>Elite Serum Rx eye cream really makes a difference for me.</li>
            <li>Using this product really boosted my confidence.</li>
            <li>Elite Serum Rx is that it is not irritating or greasy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>So I really just wanted to find a product that would make my skin smoother and softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>They are correct, as my crow’s feet are much improved, but I also wanted my skin to feel softer and look smoother.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>This product worked to help me look younger and healthier, and considering the fact that my appearance affects my sales success rate, that made it worth every penny that I paid for it.</li>
            <li>definitely went above and beyond by creating their own.</li>
            <li>First things first, SkinPro offers a guarantee.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, because of Elite Serum Rx’s great packaging and easy spread-ability a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant at first because of the price tag, but she swore up and down at how affective it is at reversing the signs of aging and stress and so, (along with a huge box of chocolates and a day at the spa!)</li>
            <li>After trying many other top of the line eye products only Elite Serum gave me a rested, young look I never had archieved before.  </li>
            <li>: I found the Elite Serum RX (Extra Strength) to be a very useful product.</li>
            <li>It also has some yummy ingredients in it like seaweed extract, oxygen and various other good nutrients.</li>
            <li>Natural seaweed extracts uniquely function to target glycation and preserve the skin&#x27;s natural collagen.</li>
            <li>I think this cream really goes deep down within your skin to rejuvenate it from the core because it has extra peptides in it which is very good for your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to try any facial products that aren&#x27;t recommended by my dermatologist because my skin is very sensitive and blemishes easily.</li>
            <li>This is not to say other skin care products did not achieve results, but the Elite Serum RX allowed me to see a difference more than anything else I tried.  </li>
            <li>The last two months I have noticed a significant difference in my eye area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike many other eye serum’s</li>
            <li>just the other day said I looked better rested.</li>
            <li>I would give it more stars if it weren&#x27;t for all the other claims.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased that it does not irritate my eyes, as other creams have done.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that the first few ingredients in this product are seaweed extract, Hylauronic Acid, and purified water which are known for moisturizing the skin from within.</li>
            <li>The dispenser is very easy to use, distributing the correct amount without waste.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Elite SerumRx is very easy to use and you do not have to worry about dipping your fingers into a jar and contaminating it with bacteria or dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I’ve always had oily skin my whole life, but since getting older, it’s now more dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to see a product that finally works especially after spending so much on products that made my skin red and flaky.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, Elite Serum RX Extra Strength , almost as if reading my mind, added a new ingredient to the serum called Syn®-TC from Pentapharm which increases the formation of collagen that helps smooth and soften the eye area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to dispense too much at once, so be careful.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Elite as long as it is available to us.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products its crazy to think about how many!</li>
            <li>Elite Serum Rx has made it to the short list of things I need to make my recovery a full one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products to lighten up the dark rings under my eyes and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li>I had been wearing glasses for years mostly just to disguise my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>the dark circles are getting more skin tone</li>
            <li>I also was pretty surprised to see that the charge at customs was hefty, which brings the price of the product at the $120.00 mark, but this has nothing of course, to do with the product ingredients.  </li>
            <li>They first appeared when I was just 12 years old.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my first syringe on Amazon and then realized I can purchase it directly through the SkinPro website.  </li>
            <li>and I don’t spend the mornings fretting about how to conceal the dark circles (and as a man, I do not have the luxury of being able to use concealer or</li>
            <li>On top of that, the dark circles under my eyes began to dissipate.</li>
            <li>For years I have tried so many products to help improve the appearance of my dark circles under my eyes and reduce the puffiness.</li>
            <li>encourage any one interested in anti aging to read the history of Elite&#x27;s development and its mechanisms of action.</li>
            <li>As with anything, to reap the full benefits, I have added this serum to my nightly skin care regimen and will continue using on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>So far, I have not experienced any side effects or skin irritation from this product, which makes it all the more worthwhile.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles and dark circles seemed to vanish leaving my eyes looking better than ever.</li>
            <li>With dark circles and crow&#x27;s feet invading my already puffy eyes, I set-out on a search to find more than just some remedial \\&quot;rat-tested\\</li>
            <li>I have tried several eye products over the last couple of years, but none of them worked as good as the Elite Serum Rx (Extra Strength)</li>
            <li>I guess I was lucky enough to get away with moisturizers and cheap eye creams for as long as I did.  </li>
            <li>The eye area is a little better but for me, the real results are in the lip area.  </li>
            <li>My new routine is Elite Serum Rx under my eyes and to my upper eye lids (on clean skin of course) and Vit C Serum on the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used undereye products for half the price of this one and they worked better.  </li>
            <li>This actually does what it says and is non irritating and great for my allergy prone eyes and super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older with more responsibilities and obligations, I get less rest and my undereyes get even darker now.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t completely gone, but they&#x27;ve filled in enough that my makeup doesn&#x27;t settle into them the way it once did.  </li>
            <li>If you want to at least LOOK great for your age and knock off the appearance of several years, give this a shot.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a second syringe and with this I&#x27;m noticing more extensive results.  </li>
            <li>It seems to get absorbed into skin fast, well and deep.  </li>
            <li>I know that the product is mainly intended to be used on wrinkles around the eyes, but it has worked just as well on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Needs better packaging so not so much serum wasted.</li>
            <li>Most of them were already using the Elite Serum RX - Extra Strength for months-and I was literally-the only one in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find the positive effects that the patented peptides had on my face.</li>
            <li>Ladies, I recommend you try Elite Serum Rx at least once and show your kids that you’re more than “just mom!”</li>
            <li>It feels amazing on tired eyes and perks them right up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Joanne Pittman, Georgetown, Tx.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This serum came highly recommended, but is an avg. product.</li>
            <li>recommend this product highly</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for women like me who don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on skincare but need a confidence boost, like I did.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My wife tried this based on the fact that it was rated so highly on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Elite Serum Rx.</li>
            <li>It is high priced though</li>
            <li>Pros:  great packaging; dispenses exact amount required; absorbs well into skin; no problem returning purchase through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: too harsh for my skin type (sensitive), left eye area red and sore after one use.</li>
            <li>I have been using Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength for a little over three months and it has had, by far, the best results of any other eye serum I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products with little results.</li>
            <li>This product is no better and no worse than all the other &#x27;great cures&#x27; on the market.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much to change the appearance of fine lines or dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so surprised too at how the winkles can really sneak in.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say that I was wrong.</li>
            <li>which skincare review offers I decide to review because some skincare companies tend to be a lot of bells and whistles without much result .  </li>
            <li>The biggest was after 2 full weeks of using it, I think with consistent use that the product will keep my dark circles from reappearing.</li>
            <li>It actually took me two syringes worth to notice a difference</li>
            <li>3 months later, I can say that it was worth it to do the research.</li>
            <li>It rejuvenates, making skin appear younger and fresh.</li>
            <li>I’m glad I did; in the matter of months, the dark circles under my eyes started to reflect my natural skin tone, and the puffiness around my eyes disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the expense, as it makes my skin radiant and even, and provides the convenience of having the benefits of several products rolled in to one syringe.</li>
            <li>The bags under my eyes pretty much disappeared with daily use.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many, StriVectin, Skinceuticals, Derma e, Estee Lauder, Reviva, Artistry, (just to name a few).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pretty much given up when I finally tried Elite Serum Rx.</li>
            <li>Extra Strength is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I look tired all of the time even when I&#x27;ve had a good night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, the results are not overnight or drastic, as many similar gimmick anti-aging products make false claims about.</li>
            <li>The treatments that I&#x27;ve gone through have made my body feel and look 10 years older than my very young 31.  </li>
            <li>However, given that I look visibly younger and much healthier and have never had that from other eye serums, it seems more than worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky enough that I look young for my age.  </li>
            <li>Elite Serum Rx did not disappoint because a few weeks later, my fine lines were disappearing and overall around my eyes looked more youthful and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s the only positive!  </li>
            <li>After a few more weeks, the area under my eyes began to get (considerably!)</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quality eye serum that has fast, lasting results.</li>
            <li>but the difference is the improvement on the fine lines and my upper lid and eye bags especially when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bounced around between about half a dozen other skin care products trying to solve this issue, but most of them did nothing more than a -run-of-the-mill moisturizer and some of them flat out didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt like I didn&#x27;t have an option but to live with these imperfections anymore.</li>
            <li>Still, I need to see some improvement--preferably sooner--when I am using a new product.</li>
            <li>I feel and look as though I am a new man.  </li>
            <li>I cannot wait for my new order</li>
            <li>I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>How about a trial size on new product.</li>
            <li>this new strength...</li>
            <li>I automatically receive a new syringe every 45 days</li>
            <li>I am always reserved with new beauty products, but I knew the ingredients were beneficial because I had been doing my research.</li>
            <li>In Nov.of this year I received the new Elite Serum Rx.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Defend, Protect, Rejuvenate&amp;#34; slogan seems to live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I believe that&#x27;s because with the new version they tried to make it thicker like an eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Elite Serum Rx - Extra Strength really does feel more powerful and effective than any of the products I have tired in the past.</li>
            <li>Dark  circles and fine eye lines remain.  </li>
            <li>So, until I find a miracle concealer and/or a miracle dark circle reducer, I will have to settle for trying to reduce the fine lines so that I can continue to wear the dreaded concealer.  </li>
            <li>I have used a ton of skin care products hoping to reduce my wrinkles and fine lines with no success.</li>
            <li>With all of the ingredients listed in this product, I expected a firmer result, a more obvious lift.  </li>
            <li>Eyes are such an important feature when it comes to the overall appearance of someone!  </li>
            <li>As for the so-called delivered mechanism, it&#x27;s laughable; many other products on the market do a much better job at squeezing the right amount.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by these results.</li>
            <li>She is always trying new skin care products and is pretty knowledgable and opinionated about the various brands out there.  </li>
            <li>many of us do when we are just plain feeling old.</li>
            <li>It even worked on my fine smile lines - they&#x27;re seriously almost gone now.</li>
            <li>I first tried it around one eye, and on the back of one hand, just to see if I would have any unfavorable reaction.</li>
            <li>Having tried so many from various vendors, (and most with no, or unfortunate results)</li>
            <li>I’m a researcher by nature, so I looked online, read tons of reviews and finally landed on a consistent product:</li>
            <li>It has noticeably reduced the lines and dark circles around my eyes and the skin is smooth and finer textured.</li>
            <li>Extra Strength is the first anti aging product I&#x27;ve found that delivers everything promised.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sold based of subjective feelings of small groups who report results  like &amp;#34; my face is softer&amp;#34; or &amp;#34; my skin glows&amp;#34; like so many of the creams and potions we&#x27;ve bought and soon discarded.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure which product is producing the most results or if it&#x27;s the combo of the two.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this product due to the stunning reviews and almost instant (within a week) improvements.</li>
            <li>All I can say is, WOW!</li>
            <li>I love the applicator since it allows me to take only the amount I need instead of dealing with excess cream that used to come out of my other bottle.</li>
            <li>serum is very easy to apply; not requiring tons of steps and complicated directions allows you to easily work it into your daily care routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still young, but have always suffered from dark circles and can see fine lines beginning to develop around my eye area.</li>
            <li>Thankfully her health is MUCH better now, but she’s tried nearly every skin cream and anti-aging solution out there- and all to very little affect.  </li>
            <li>The skin under my eyes is smooth and soft, and I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a little help there.</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge difference in puffiness and even the wrinkles are less.</li>
            <li>When I noticed the slight lines forming in the corners of my eyes and on my forehead, I was thrown into a state of genuine panic.</li>
            <li>Not only did I not see any improvement, the product seemed to make my dark circles more visible than they already were.</li>
            <li>I began to feel it working the moment I put it on, and I began to notice that it did begin lifting the skin very quickly, although I think it takes a little longer to see the complete long-term effects.</li>
            <li>so that could account for some of the positive changes, but regardless, this Serum is now a mandatory part of my daily regime.</li>
            <li>The dark circles, bags and wrinkles around my eyes have significantly improved.  </li>
            <li>The puffiness was significantly reduced, and so were the dark circles.</li>
            <li>a try because other people who had used it were writing very positive reviews, emphasizing a steady, gradual improvement.</li>
            <li>I do feel it is important to read their easy instructions, or you could do the wrong maneuver and break it.</li>
            <li>If you wait a bit and give it a few months, you will start to see the fine lines decreasing.</li>
            <li>I myself suffer from the misfortune of looking older than I am, mostly due to lack of proper self-maintenance and exercise, but have found that this product makes me look more like my actual age.</li>
            <li>I previously used the original Elite Serum and that product showed some improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend Elite Serum to anyone who feels they need a little refreshing.</li>
            <li>I used it for about a month and a half and didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li>I can see the difference between this product and other cheaper ‘quick fix’ solutions.</li>
            <li>but clearly it wasn’t working.  </li>
            <li>I’ve never been one to worry much about my appearance, especially wrinkles, until my 4-year old son pointed out that he could make his face wrinkle like mine -</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t help clear the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is clear and odorless, not tested on animals and won&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I work in the entertainment industry, which often times means extremely long nights, which I’m sure, have contributed to the dark, puffy circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Clear, odorless, non tacky, non oily, everything one would look for in a product.  </li>
            <li>It completely changed my life.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I decided to buy this serum after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>One would think that as much as this product costs that the manufacturer would provide dispensers that actually work.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t completely get rid of them, but I don&#x27;t think any product can.  </li>
            <li>But I have to say this product surprised me.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>In a week, my puffy eyes (my biggest problem) are diminishing before my eyes (pun intended), and my budding marionette lines are basically gone.</li>
            <li>Now that I am nearly 40</li>
            <li>Boy, was I surprised.</li>
            <li>with no irritation to my extremely sensitive eyes whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>When a syringe of Extra Strength arrived, the product really kicked in.</li>
            <li>; I don’t feel like I’m 100 years old with a preschooler running around.</li>
            <li>After doing some research on the web, all I read was how the only real treatment to help these lines was injectable fillers.  </li>
            <li>Looking in the mirror was often a complete embarrassment to me, what with all the wrinkles, lines and circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>There are lines forming near my eyes where there wasn’t before.</li>
            <li>Yes, this product is primarily for the eyes, but I use it on all the trouble areas on my face.  </li>
            <li>However, using the Elite Serum Rx, I have noticed very tangible results; friends and family members have commented that I finally look well rested</li>
            <li>It was developed by Irwin Grams, an award-winning cosmetic pharmacist with over thirty-seven years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes I&#x27;ll ask people I&#x27;ve met how old they think I look</li>
            <li>It is a topical agent that really helps defy age.</li>
            <li>I think often the products simply don&#x27;t work and plus, a natural aged look isn&#x27;t something we need to be constantly finding inventive cures for.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this serum seemed to work.  </li>
            <li>I called SkinPro direct and they sent out a replacement, no questions asked.  </li>
            <li>You twist to unlock, express as much as you want/ need and reseal with a twist in the opposite direction,  replace the cover and cap.</li>
            <li>I searched for a product that was an alternative to a filler, as a filler is really the only thing that can help, but at $500 a syringe, it was out of the question.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this issue since my early 20&#x27;s and nothing I&#x27;ve tried rids it.  </li>
            <li>I didn’t want my busy life to be a reflection on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it morning and night for about two months now and so far</li>
            <li>Was I getting old?</li>
            <li>I no longer feel the need to wear foundation and cover up on a daily basis, and my skin feels much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li>It was simple to use, was odorless and gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>take it from a 54 year old that takes care of herself and skin, and yes has some skin damage.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it’s 100% oil-free as my face tends to get a bit oily naturally.</li>
            <li>I am 29 years old.</li>
            <li>So far I like it, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Specifically, I started off with using a pea-sized amount under my eyes, where I experience frequent puffiness, at night.</li>
            <li>The company also hires professional and polite personnel.</li>
            <li>But after just two weeks, I noticed a marked improvement in my appearance.</li>
            <li>and I have to thank my mom for my soft skin.</li>
            <li>This eye serum was developed by scientists and the packaging and product reflect the quality this company is known for.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well rested</li>
            <li>I was initially surprised with the packaging.</li>
            <li>Five years as a freelancer really began to take a toll on my skin, especially my face.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 3 weeks, it feels nice and soothing to apply but the wrinkles and bags are still there and one eye is worse (bags)</li>
            <li>Additionally, the dispensing tip is very fine and only small amounts come out at a time, so there is no waste.</li>
            <li>It took a few weeks and there were periods of frustration (I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement the first month) but within the second month, my skin looked better than it had in a long time.!</li>
            <li>right now I have it shipped every 3rd month, and that&#x27;s using it twice daily.</li>
            <li>It only took a couple weeks before I started to notice that my wrinkles were becoming less defined.</li>
            <li>Although I originally purchased this product for the puffiness and wrinkles around my eyes my bigger concern was the vertical lines above my lip, some deep.  </li>
            <li>While it didn’t totally get rid of my deeper wrinkles, it helped smooth out my fine lines and get rid of the puffiness, not a huge change in my dark circles, yet though.</li>
            <li>After using for a little over month, my fine lines are nearly gone and my dark circles have diminished more than any other product I’ve used.</li>
            <li>No more switching for me a month going strong</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t do much, but all of a sudden my dark circles under my eyes started turning normal skin color..</li>
            <li>I also find that with other rich night creams that I end up with acne or blemishes in the morning from being too oily, but since using Elite I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin, I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup because the tone has evened out, and laugh lines and creases are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, some of which were very expensive, but this worked fine...</li>
            <li>No mess, no fuss.</li>
            <li>It contains Argireline and other powerful ingredients that can help you stay young-looking.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to decrease the puffiness under my eyes as well as dark circles that I’ve had for more than ten years, which gives me the appearance of not having gotten enough sleep.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was worried about it being too heavy as it&#x27;s described as being like a &#x27;rich eye cream&#x27;</li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t see some type of results rather quickly then it will loose my interest and fall out of my daily beauty regiment.</li>
            <li>I wanted to do something serious about my crow’s feet after having tried so many ineffective end-of-the-aisle products from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>Brighter looking skin around the eyes, my fine lines have disappeared, and no more puffiness as well.</li>
            <li>I felt 30 years older than I actually was.</li>
            <li>but it is still much older than my actual age</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I started using Elite Serum Rx and didn’t really see any results for a few weeks so as you can imagine, I was pretty bummed.</li>
            <li>After applying this product my skin featured no burning, redness, or even extreme tightness as it does with many other anti-aging serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on what it does for dark circles because I&#x27;m fortunate enough to not suffer from them.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it made my skin worse in a way as it was becoming much darker than when I had started.</li>
            <li>I previously used the original Elite Serum and that product showed some improvement, which is why I decided to try the new version hoping I would see more dramatic results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Elite Serum Extra Strength.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of creams that claim to be oil free but usually aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Within a week, the dark areas had lightened up significantly and my skin looks younger and brighter.</li>
            <li>Not only did her illness wreck her health, but in the process left her with quite a few more crow’s feet and darker bags than she had ever had before.  </li>
            <li>She normally uses either Revive Eye Renewal Cream (a serum) or La Prairie White Caviar eye serum.  </li>
            <li>My first syringe was almost empty before I felt like it was making any improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have almost no dark circles or puffiness anymore.</li>
            <li>While many of the other products had some of the same ingredients, they do not have the same amounts and the same combination that Elite has.</li>
            <li>It has the ability to provide a long term therapeutic solution to fine lines and wrinkles, dark circles and under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>Its hard to know which product to use, considering many of the products use the same core ingredients</li>
            <li>I started looking for a new eye cream and decided to try Elite Serum Rx because it contains Argireline and specific peptides to treat puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After six months of regular use the droopiness of my upper eyelids improved and the lower lids were much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I’m only forty, a professional business woman with two young children.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are in need of a review that is at least 50-200 words describing the product (based on the description provided) and an example or two of how this product helped you to feel younger or gave you better skin, why you chose this product over others and how you feel it compares to others.  </li>
            <li>Recently I began noticing that the eye cream I’d been using (Chanel Ultra Correction Total Eye Lift) wasn’t doing much to fight the newer lines and puffiness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for a few weeks , I have notice that the circles and a few wrinkles that was under my eyes has been clearing up really nice.</li>
            <li>My wife was skeptical and as such we waited to review this product until she had used it for a fair amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Especially since both my parents and sisters still look very young around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I think nationality and genetics plays a major role in my case.  </li>
            <li>, I just can&#x27;t say I see major improvements yet.</li>
            <li>skin has never been healthier, the smile and frown creases last only as long as the expression lasts.</li>
            <li>After using the Elite Serum for the past year I have noticed a significant difference in my appearance.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product thinking based off the video and positive comments it just might improve under eye darkness or some small lines on side of eyes; however it did not improve either situation after using the whole syringe.</li>
            <li>reiterate that I am typically suspicious about the whole range of serums and creams promising the world, but this serum actually delivered on its promise to drastically reduce puffiness and darkness.</li>
            <li>Even after only a few days of using it I noticed the puffiness around my eyes begin to reduce significantly</li>
            <li>Might seem a little pricy, but this is a five star product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Dark circles had faded but not completely diminished and fine lines are also starting to disappear.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a month now, and I am pleasantly surprised by how much it has reduced the perennial dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at my results after using the product for only one month,  I continued to re-order it and this Serum has been a staple in my skin care regimen</li>
            <li>Well, on my 8th day I was so bruised and barely opening my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that by my wedding they will barely be noticeable.</li>
            <li>Their professionals frequently gave me samples of the various eye creams and serums.</li>
            <li>So, since I spent so much money, I decided to just use it at night.  </li>
            <li>So, imagine my surprise when I looked in the mirror at 39 and saw an old woman looking back at me!  </li>
            <li>The first week after I started, I saw that the dark circles were almost gone.</li>
            <li>I have used them since I was around 20 years old and finally said, \\&quot;Forget it.\\&quot; Being an African-American that doesn&#x27;t smoke, drink, or do any drugs</li>
            <li>For that, I give it a 4 stars and once I have finished the product completely, I&#x27;ll come back and update as to whether or not I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>Over the years I’ve invested in many expensive facial products that are “worth it” only to find myself with no improvements and out a hundred bucks—but this one actually works.</li>
            <li>my skin seems more radiant instead of that tired</li>
            <li>I will persevere, perhaps it is one of those treatments that makes the condition worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li>Elite Serum Rx is a little sticky, not horrific, but it does have a slight stickiness to it.  </li>
            <li>Also, it helped calm down the tiny visible (to me anyway) lines around the eye are.</li>
            <li>I didn’t need half am much concealer as I’d been using--sorry MAC!--</li>
            <li>My first tube lasted me about a month and a half</li>
            <li>So I purchased the product and for the past month, I have seen a significant change in my undereyes even when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep.</li>
            <li>I have been self-conscious about my laugh lines and wrinkles for so long, and they would get me every time I strolled through the pharmacy for other meds and vitamins.</li>
            <li>I was ecstatic to see tremendous results, after only using Elite Serum RX daily for less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to get a long lasting fix, instead of just spending a bunch of money on creams that barely work.</li>
            <li>The swelling is now smooth to touch and the dark marks are much lighter and hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li>After only 10 days, the texture of the skin around the eyes has softened and the fine lines are slowly going away.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve had really terrible dry skin, especially during the winter, and I&#x27;ve tried to overcompensate with rich creams and moisturizers but nothing has ever really caused my skin to actually feel healthier itself, it&#x27;s only ever been a quick fix for the most part.</li>
            <li>It’s oil-free which means it won’t cause build-up in your pores, unlike some of the other products I’ve tried which have given me blemishes, and the peptides they’ve added to the ingredients really do make your skin feel younger—I can attest to that.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the bags under my eyes are starting to dissipate, which I am so happy about because I&#x27;ve looked half awake for the past few years.</li>
            <li>By a week, I noticed big difference, but it was starting to dry my under eye area out too much</li>
            <li>While I do have to say that the results aren&#x27;t instant, after using the serum for a few weeks I have noticed a pretty dramatic improvement in the thinness of my eye skin and fine lines in particular.</li>
            <li>and I was also surprised by how big the bottle actually was.</li>
            <li>but both are far more expensive than Elite Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also contains major peptides, such as Argireline, Syn-TC and Inyline.</li>
            <li>Elite Serum RX contains peptides that are especially created to treat major eye issues.</li>
            <li>I did the first time I used it and got a little in my eye</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes since I have a collection of partially used products in my cabinet that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My dark circles got much lighter and I&#x27;m using it just for two weeks, can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in couple weeks.</li>
            <li>The Elite Serum RX has really helped me with my dark circles and under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>Dark circles from allergies and sleep deprivation are much lighter.</li>
            <li>So, as a young man, now in my early 30&#x27;s, I have used eye creams, cucumbers, serums, and other products to help with bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I get compliments from people about my pretty eyes everyday.</li>
            <li>But I am getting married in a few months</li>
            <li>Every year naturally brings more wrinkles, and then last year she got extremely ill.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it out, I accidentally over-estimated, but after a few seconds of work with a cotton ball, I got it under control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried products for each concern in the past, but without success.</li>
            <li>absorbs in skin well around eyes - but too much comes out of tube even with a slight push.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the dark circles my whole life and have had to wear concealer for them daily.</li>
            <li>Now,  people tell me I look younger and a few very close friends have asked if I had surgery!</li>
            <li>and my skin usually can&#x27;t handle very heavy products, but this absorbed very nicely and didn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li>As such a teensy-weensy amount goes so far, one syringe should last a long time, if cared for as per the instructions.</li>
            <li>I am thirty years old and previously thought that I was too young to worry about anti-aging products.</li>
            <li>During that second month, not only did the wrinkles diminish until they were barely noticeable, the skin that I had applied it on actually looked (and felt) younger:  </li>
            <li>I use this product twice daily and within a few months I started to see positive changes.</li>
            <li>As I’m getting older I’ve been looking for something to help with the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Still a little weary, though I checked some of the testimonies and reviews from customers who have previously used the product and they reported significant, almost life-changing results.</li>
            <li>I used to just use cover up, but now that I’ve seen what kind of effect this had on my wrinkles (with virtually no ill effect; and I’ve had some bad reactions to some other kinds of rejuvenators)</li>
            <li>Things like dark spots, bags, and wrinkles took over causing me to appear way older than I actually was.</li>
            <li>The only con I have with this product is that if I accidentally use too much it can become a little tacky.  </li>
            <li>The only minor drawback for me was the price, which Is a little higher than similar products.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find the results at 20% compared to other products of similar ingredients.</li>
            <li>I read both good and bad reviews about this product.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Loving this line of products!</li>
            <li> Who the heck has this kind of customer service these days!?</li>
            <li> After researching methods to reduce eye puffiness, I found the website for this serum and was impressed with the innovative ingredients.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of suggestions from my flawless skinned friends, but one product intrigued me more than the rest....</li>
            <li> No matter how many YouTube videos I watch, my concealer does not look flawless like the girls in the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which many experts, including Dr. Oz, say is the best alternative to cosmetic injections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin is looking bright and refreshed.</li>
            <li> and honestly I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed.  </li>
            <li> All in all, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I am fairly patient, and I realize that repairing damaged tissue like the bags around my eyes is not an overnight process.</li>
            <li> I have read fair reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> The Good Goods</li>
            <li> I have used the elite serum for about 6 months and saw good results.</li>
            <li> I am 58 and have never had any procedures done because I have been blessed with good skin.</li>
            <li> She had been using it for a couple of months, with surprising results.</li>
            <li> Since that was not an option and the elite serum got good reviews</li>
            <li> We’re all fair skinned</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I was delighted to see the results that Elite Serum boasted.</li>
            <li> Good luck to anyone who makes the purchase.</li>
            <li> The scientific research, testing and documentation of the improvement in texture, tone, wrinkle depth assures you that you have chosen your serum wisely.</li>
            <li> Because of that, and the fact that I have a lot of face-to-face business meetings, it is important that I look my best.</li>
            <li> Plus, looking good makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not doing any justice to saying how good SkinPro has been for me.</li>
            <li> There are so many products on the market with incredible promises.  </li>
            <li> and I want her to feel good about herself.  </li>
            <li> The owner of this company did make good on it ...</li>
            <li> Seems To Absorb Fairly Well.</li>
            <li> I loved how the product looked and was wrapped</li>
            <li> delivery system is unique, impressive.</li>
            <li> So my wife and I are getting fairly up there in years, and while I of course still think she’s the most beautiful woman in the world</li>
            <li> I recently celebrated another Happy Birthday, yay!</li>
            <li> Not to mention most products leave your skin oily and if you&#x27;re a woman like me that loves makeup applying makeup over the serum or cream just looks clumpy and unnatural, but I&#x27;m happy to admit</li>
            <li> cannot express how SATISFIED and happy I am with this product.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I must say, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The reviews were great and the results I got after a month were even better.  </li>
            <li> While again there are a great many products out there</li>
            <li> , I saw the greatest level of success with this one.</li>
            <li> This organization has brought many great products in to the cosmeticeutical industry.</li>
            <li> I felt it did a great job, better than the Mary Kay and the ROC I had tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a year and the results are great.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The after sales support is also excellent, with on line replies to queries answered quickly and effectively.  </li>
            <li> I have not only seen incredible results myself, but I have also recommended it to friends and family, who have also been very happy with their results!  </li>
            <li> I am pretty impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Love SkinPro and Elite Serum Rx!</li>
            <li> I really love this product!</li>
            <li> More remarkably, was the change I noticed in the reduction of swelling under my mother&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> Both products require an additional moisturizer, but Caudalie worked so much better for me!  </li>
            <li> Love  it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to look any more!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> How great to see a productthat accurately details its ingredients..</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are an  amazing Web Site explained it  all from A to Z.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the customer service is beyond amazing.  </li>
            <li> The diagrams are attractive, yes , but they&#x27;re accurate and informative.</li>
            <li> For an added boost, I keep this amazing product in my fridge.</li>
            <li> Please refrain from using words like miracle, amazing,</li>
            <li> So I decided to take matters into my own hands.</li>
            <li> I liked that it was non- comedogenic.  </li>
            <li> And when I tried it I liked the way it felt.  </li>
            <li> It was nice</li>
            <li> Skin Pro is the absolute best at producing products that are based on science and research.  </li>
            <li> Truly an effective product.  </li>
            <li> really liked the syringe applicator</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
            <li> but I liked the idea of a serum.  </li>
            <li> it became so popular that it hit #1 on Amazon&#x27;s bestselling list.</li>
            <li> The product itself is nice.  </li>
            <li> Remarkably, and despite eating salty foods and enjoying our evening wine, each day I looked better than the day before.  </li>
            <li> And its great to know that they even have their own full product line to enhance and improve every area of beauty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible to have a product that really does everything that it claims to do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I decided to try this, and I already ordered two more applicators, one for my sister and one for my mother</li>
            <li> It feels so good on my skin, and by the second week I started noticing beautiful improvements (and no breakouts!).</li>
            <li> The Elite Serum Rx has been a real good friend to me so far!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for close to 5 weeks now from a girlfriend that began to use it, and I am pleased to say that I am satisfied with what I&#x27;m seeing in the mirror!</li>
            <li> Good for fine lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum is good for my eye area because I have started to see my fine lines disappear in a two month period.</li>
            <li> They have really improved on a product that was already very good.  </li>
            <li> I loved the results and how smoothly it went on around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have quite very impressed thus far.</li>
            <li> This really is a great product to use and is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The product did not have any kind of overwhelming scent to speak of.</li>
            <li> Over the years I’ve developed an impressive number of bags under my eyes (you can thank my kids for that)</li>
            <li> I am impressed so far and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if there was something more effective on the market</li>
            <li> BY FAR, THE BEST EYE PRODUCT THAT EXISTS!!  </li>
            <li> First off, the packaging is nice- sturdy, attractive box, and the syringe is protected and secured in a spongey packing material.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use with the syringe applicator and the texture is very smooth without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx - Extra Strength is the greatest thing that I&#x27;ve found in my trek to discover effective eye care.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best eye serum available.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product that contains very moisturizing ingredients!</li>
            <li> I tried it and at first I wasn&#x27;t happy with what I saw.  </li>
            <li> I do have is very smooth under eye area...</li>
            <li> product itself is a very light,</li>
            <li> Easy to use and amazing results.</li>
            <li> I also really liked the fact that it&#x27;s in a syringe, which makes it easy to carry around and apply.</li>
            <li> And I discovered that photographing your own eye isn’t easy at ALL, so please forgive the disaster of the attached photo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> This is easily one of the most effective creams I’ve ever applied in trying to get rid of the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always in front of people, and being able to be confident is very important.</li>
            <li> They seem more lifted and even toned as well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased.    </li>
            <li> I even feel more confident now when I leave my house without any makeup on to cover my raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Besides that, I just looked more refreshed and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using this for many months, and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried getting more sleep, the cucumber treatment, and a variety of cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> So I started using it on my bruises 3x’s a day (morning/noon/night), I just let the Elite Serum work its magic on healing and repairing my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love their line, everything seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> But the eye serum is one of my favorite products, it keeps my eyes glowing.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I may be using it more liberally than I should</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> And I have tried many.</li>
            <li> My skin just felt refreshed, healthier, and better moisturized...</li>
            <li> For many years, I worked in a specialty store&#x27;s dept.</li>
            <li> I found this Elite Serum RX outstanding in the genre.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy I bought it and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Best of all, you know it&#x27;s safe: it&#x27;s been on the market since 2013 and underwent two years of testing prior to that.</li>
            <li> I was glad I did.  </li>
            <li> , I was pleased.</li>
            <li> I want to make sure that I take care of my aging skin.</li>
            <li> Product does nothing more than leaving your skin</li>
            <li> , every year she gets more and more self-conscious about her aging skin.  </li>
            <li> Compared to everything else she has tried this has definitely worked the best.  </li>
            <li> tried so many products that promised results...</li>
            <li> went to a Web Site where woman, She explained push the top plastic piece to the end&lt;br</li>
            <li> trying many products like I said.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 3 times more potent for quicker results...</li>
            <li> more concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though the price of Elite Serum Rx was more than I wanted to spend, I figured I needed something that could help me out.</li>
            <li> It does more than just moisturize; it really helps take away the circles and puffiness around my eyes, and I don’t have to inject poisonous toxins into my face, and I like that a great deal.</li>
            <li> I had faithfully used two syringes of Elite Serum and was truly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> These lines bother me even more then the wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found just what I was looking for based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> Lovely options.  </li>
            <li> The Elite Serum leaves no shine and I am comfortable in my own skin.</li>
            <li> Every time I put on my under eye concealer, my makeup settles into the lines, drawing more attention to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eye area has never looked better.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t have that greasy texture like most products.</li>
            <li> There are so many products that promise &#x27;wrinkle reducing&#x27; capabilities.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that I would gladly try for 3-4 months, but not at this price.</li>
            <li> I personally enjoyed using the Elite Serum.</li>
            <li> Despite any age, your skin will appear tighter and more elastic.</li>
            <li> and I keep coming for more...</li>
            <li> I started with just using it at night for a week to make sure I didn&#x27;t develop any reactions.  </li>
            <li> It went on so smoothly around my eyes it felt amazing.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Top notch customer service.</li>
            <li> I love the syringe applicator to keep the product sterile and control the application amount..</li>
            <li> It might be better for wrinkles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the result I love seeing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still torn as to whether or not its working better than my Clinique All About Eyes, but I&#x27;m going to keep trying it.</li>
            <li> I also love that this company doesn&#x27;t do any testing on animals and</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that the dispense locks</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m aging it seems as though I&#x27;m getting more, and more wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The instant products worked the best but a lot of them would crack after application or my makeup would stick to it.  </li>
            <li> More over, I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I have tried more treatments for my face, eyes, forehead, and neck than I will ever admit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better eye creams on the market (and cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with many different types of products trying to find the best preventative and rejuvenating formula.  </li>
            <li> Cornell Univ came up with an algorithm (http://reviewskeptic.com) in which you can cut and paste a review and to see if review is truthful or not.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this cream.</li>
            <li> Should I have taken better care of my skin in my 20s?</li>
            <li> , I noticed that the skin around my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> I would continue using this until something better comes up.</li>
            <li> One more thing to add</li>
            <li> I was more then satisfied with the Elite Serum but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li> By applying it before going to sleep and after waking up I feel more confident and the skin around my eyes firmer and moisturised.</li>
            <li> Fabulous results!</li>
            <li> and when I came home for the holidays there was definitely a notable difference in the quality of her skin.</li>
            <li> Please be sure that this review is written with &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; emotion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to include pros and cons.  </li>
            <li> SYN®-COLL increases the amount of collagen your body produces to help make the skin cells more elastic, so they do not shrivel up and wrinkle.</li>
            <li> This is used in most anti-aging serums to rejuvenate and repair the tissue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sincerely, John Paul (BTW, I told my plastic surgeon he needs to recommend this product / company as well)</li>
            <li> As a product junkie, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried em all--particularly most Retin-A bearing products.</li>
            <li> Either I have the world&#x27;s most stubborn, product-resistant eyes in the world</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> THIS “MAGIC PEN” MY Elite Serum, IS THE ANTI-AGING SOLUTIONS</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 1 month and just love it.  </li>
            <li> You do not need to use a generous amount of cream to achieve outstanding results.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product and I must say I was really impressed.</li>
            <li> Suffering from insomnia surely doesn&#x27;t help, either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frantically, I phoned all my family and friends with the same inherited eye problems to tell them about this cosmetic treasure I had found and how it would make a wonderful birthday gift.</li>
            <li> There are so many products to choose from that make all sorts of claims about reducing wrinkles around the eyes and mouth and puffiness under the eyes.</li>
            <li> After some weeks using this product, the wrinkles and the puffiness are much more disguised..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried products like Olay Regenerist and Shiseido Regenerating Cream and while they were okay, I never got the &amp;#34;deep down&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And the reason why is because it is 100% needle free!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a better eye treatment - one that worked -</li>
            <li> I cannot express how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> Additionally, another benefit that I love about</li>
            <li> It spreads lightly, absorbs nicely, and you feel a refreshing, hydrating sensation after applying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not stranger to serums, I know collagen is our friend, and I have learned that you need to spend a bit more to get products that produce results.</li>
            <li> Love how you an feel tightened your skin.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a life saver in a skinny skinny tube. :)</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, it felt really good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to see what will happen after 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> The package is unique, the product itself is amazing, and it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> think you are doing pretty good for your age&amp;#34; or something to that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (and I liked the cool design of the syringe).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m aging, any fine lines that develop become SO much more prominent when I am wearing concealer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how I will look in the upcoming months!</li>
            <li> This product is simultaneously rich and weightless!</li>
            <li> What I like most about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have any strong fragrances or odors.</li>
            <li> The reason I use the two together is that there it&#x27;s not cost effective to use the Elite Serum Rx on the forehead and around the mouth because I would go through it too quickly.</li>
            <li> so maybe the serum will work better for women with fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed it helps to make fine lines not so prominent.  </li>
            <li> oily skin, which can be a huge pain because anything that I put on my face, even if its just around my eyes, tends to make my face even more greasy.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, I saw continued improvement a month into using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not even sure if these products are even available anywhere else.</li>
            <li> However, since I’ve tried the Elite Serum, my face is smooth yet again and my complexion has never looked better.</li>
            <li> thing I love about the serum is that it goes on light weight with no oily feeling, and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my moisturizers and makeup</li>
            <li> So far I am happy.  </li>
            <li> Being an avid Amazon Bargain Hunter, I was very pleased to find this product on here.</li>
            <li> Then, with a touch of serum at my finger tip, I dabbed it smoothly around the bottom of each eye, working my way to the top.</li>
            <li> However,  it&#x27;s the best money I have ever spent on a beauty product.  </li>
            <li> Even better is that its fragrance free so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;fresh look&#x27; was something that I honestly had not seen in some time.</li>
            <li> love that it goes on so easy, non greasy and makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> It leaves a great feeling around your eyes and has a very soft and light feeling when applying.</li>
            <li> Most amazingly, the hooding , one of the most humiliating signs that you are indeed getting older, is gradually diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in the fine lines I have yet, but I will give it more time.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally be able to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> t say enough good things about Elite Serum!</li>
            <li> After receiving, unwrapping, and setting my aging eyes on Elite Serum RX, I swiftly fell in love with the unique syringe-like applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about the Bellapulse System he was able to award me as I am</li>
            <li> I love them...and thank you also for friendly helpful personnel.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and no side affects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard great things about Elite Serum, but before I decided to try it, a friend told me about Elite Serum Rx, which is supposed to be the same thing, but even better.</li>
            <li> is that it’s easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a sensational product and I recommend this to anyone who wants to revitalize their skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, so I kept using it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This works very quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IS EASY TO APPLY</li>
            <li> Also, it is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> One of my best friends is a Botox diva (and looks fabulous), but I was not ready for the needle.</li>
            <li> So for me, this product is too strong.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this as I liked that one of the main ingredients was seaweed and it sounded like it would be very light  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full price though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Elite Serum Rx for almost 2yrs now to prevent the fine lines and wrinkles from developing around my eyes, mouth and forehead area.</li>
            <li> The most incredible result was with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> It all worked out just fine.</li>
            <li> The serum rx is wonderful and gets rid of the slight puffiness that remains.</li>
            <li> I was getting fed up with seeing a bunch of fine lines appearing around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> , another ingredient found in Elite Serum RX, is an octapeptide that can prevent the development of wrinkles and fine lines through the attenuation of muscle contractions.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t have a lot of fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I had fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> the fine lines turned into the fine line.  </li>
            <li> She said it goes on smooth, not greasy, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Smooths out Fine Lines</li>
            <li> much more where using Elite Serum with tremendous success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The most change I&#x27;ve seen was a mild softening around the corners of my eyes with Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> I go through it a lot more quickly.  </li>
            <li> From the very first time I used this product I knew it was going to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been using Elite Eye Serum for several years and am very pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li> This is my very first time to write a review because I am very excited about the product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the serum for 3 months I’ve seen a HUGE difference in wrinkles around my eyes though.</li>
            <li> I started using Elite Serum Rs and can tell a huge difference already.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 90% accurate.</li>
            <li> I dab that under my eyes and on where people get &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; even though I don&#x27;t have any, then use a AH oil free moisturizer on the rest of my face...</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I came across the Elite Serum - RX from Skin Pro.</li>
            <li> I use Elite Serum because its established reputation for reversing the signs of aging, its a light weight consistency and it has also toned the skins around my eye.</li>
            <li> The serum is perfume free which I like and absorbs well when I apply at night.</li>
            <li> I also noticed wrinkles reduction, no puffness around my eyes and just an overall great apearence.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous...</li>
            <li> guess what another fabulous plus...</li>
            <li> This product is fragrance free which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m getting great results above my lip.  </li>
            <li> You just place a dime size drop on your fingers and apply to where you see fit.</li>
            <li> I had some success, but still wanted to improve a bit more.  </li>
            <li> It contains scientifically advanced peptides that are proven to result in DNA rejuvenation.</li>
            <li> It is made in an advanced FDA-licensed laboratory in the United States.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s oil free</li>
            <li> Since she looked fabulous I had to order one myself.</li>
            <li> I like this product too because the company doesn&#x27;t do any animal testing which is important to me.</li>
            <li> That part of the description is really, really important.</li>
            <li> Since then, it&#x27;s been smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a difference like a filler would, but for a topical product, it works great.</li>
            <li> but this is a great daily product to use in conjunction with.</li>
            <li> Both products are paraben free which is a plus.</li>
            <li> But if you go for the cheaper brands, you&#x27;ll end up spending upwards of $100 anyway trying to find a cheap cream that works.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum all over my face to help with moisture, to even skin tone and smooth out lines and rid some puffiness.  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes looked supple, smooth and noticeably brighter.  </li>
            <li> It helped his bags so much under his eyes he wanted his own tube.</li>
            <li> I am grateful that this now has worked out smoothly.</li>
            <li> I sincerely believe that this is an excellent product for the delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li> But so far, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Those fine wrinkles have significantly smoothed out.  </li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx has made me feel more confident in my appearance as I reach a new age milestone!</li>
            <li> ¦s not like I¡¦m getting any younger, and the problem will go away º. Special thanks to Skin Pro and their great service!!  </li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the product and have high hopes of</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced some slight improvements but hoping for better with continued use.  </li>
            <li> Thank you SkinPro for creating such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> The results have been gradual but absolutely genuine, and I&#x27;m more than happy to continue to take a few seconds out of my day in order to keep my face this way.</li>
            <li> 100% original because I bought from its web site as well.</li>
            <li> and I’m excited to see if it continues to help.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and felt cool.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx may take some time, but now that I’ve finished with one syringe my wrinkles have significantly smoothed away.</li>
            <li> Within a pretty timely fashion I noticed a hair more brightness and vivaciousness in my image in the mirror.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this for 5 weeks and am very pleased with my results.</li>
            <li> I was actually excited when I woke up each morning to see the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within the first week, my puffy, droopy, tired-looking dilemmas seemed to magically disappear.</li>
            <li> The site recommends using for about 6 months before seeing significant improvements.</li>
            <li> The only improvement I have seen is with a couple of wrinkles on my neck that seem to be looking softer, and the gel is very smooth and feels nice, hence the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> He was apologetic and courteous and said a new one had been mailed.</li>
            <li> While nothing short of sand-blasting will create the skin of an 18-year-old on the eyelids of this 63-year-old woman, I can honestly say that my lids...from the lash line to the brows....as well as the under-eye area, look quite a bit better than they did before I started using this serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than pleased with the results I see thus far</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I¡¦d been using a product recommended by my plastic surgeon (for eye puffiness), for approximately 2 years, and experienced fair results.</li>
            <li> I spent a few days doing research on trending products, products with the best feedback, most effective ingredients and Elite Serum</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soaks right in when you put it on - which is so easy to do with the applicator.</li>
            <li> When you apply it to clean skin you can feel a slightly cool sensation to let you know its working.</li>
            <li> They sent me another order special delivery, and at no cost to me.</li>
            <li> I am super excited about settling on this serum and not have to go looking for others.</li>
            <li> product is certainly one of the most effective cosmetics when it comes to preventing the natural aging of skin.</li>
            <li> You really get the most out of your money.</li>
            <li> for\\&quot; is definitely true.</li>
            <li> I really thought that I would never look healthy again.  </li>
            <li> but I do feel good enough to wear my contacts now.  </li>
            <li> I usually try and take care of my eyes with rest and a good diet, but this product does a great job helping me out on days when I can’t take the time to care for myself the way I normally would do.</li>
            <li> but my purchase included a hand full of samples.  </li>
            <li> Matrixyl 3000 contains Matrikines are responsible for cutaneous repair and restructuration, and make your skin more youthful and glowing with health.  </li>
            <li> I keep my Elite Serum Rx in the fridge because I like the cool feel when applying it.  </li>
            <li> Since I am in my late twenties, I began my search on products once I noticed lines around my eyes and came across this superb serum.</li>
            <li> My under eye area looks and feels more hydrated and the skin around my eyes has a much smoother appearance.</li>
            <li> a 60 year old woman and a product like this will not do the trick all on its own</li>
            <li> I have tried more creams and concealers than I can count and gave up years ago on finding any real</li>
            <li> I hope to receive a full refund</li>
            <li> I wanted to look good for my sister’s wedding last month, but my skin was not cooperating.</li>
            <li> I loved youthology 90 second serum, but they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  </li>
            <li> still, not a bad serum.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is absolutely hands down the best I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best treatment for fine lines and dark circles I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> As others have said, there is no miracle serum per se, but this has worked far better than anything else I&#x27;ve used for reducing my fine lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> but I notice other areas (around the mouth, frown lines) that have shown great improvement.  </li>
            <li> I see no difference, since I use some other great eye cream.</li>
            <li> You receive a clean, fresh dose every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum hasn&#x27;t done anything for me, I&#x27;m 28 and have my first fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> have never seen a product that skin can absorbs so quickly.</li>
            <li> My eyes are what my potential clients see the most of, and judge me the most by.</li>
            <li> and so I quickly ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My skin was firmer, refined and the tone was extraordinary.</li>
            <li> It has quickly become a staple in my skin care routine</li>
            <li> It started to work so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I started with the regular elite serum and had exceptional results.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product; I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s actually quite pleasant to wear, as it&#x27;s not oily, smelly or bothersome.</li>
            <li> This product is great for getting rid of puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> More for preventative reasons than anything else, I started looking into skin products hoping to stave off premature wrinkling and baggy eyes, but never really felt comfortable giving most of them a chance.</li>
            <li> I am very consistent when using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a youngish person, but for the first time in awhile I feel like I look my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the very first application I could feel the ¡§firming¡¨ effects as well as see the improvement immediately.</li>
            <li> This serum is pricey, but it is definitely worth the investment when you look younger and feel more confident about your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> There was no unpleasant aroma or stickiness that accompanied the product.</li>
            <li> This is a really good serum that appears to work on fine lines (my wife is 52) and reduce the appearance of dark circles or puffiness.  </li>
            <li> Caudalie Premier CRU eye cream was much more effective for fading my dark circles, absorbs quickly, brightens the undereye with its pearlescent cream and lifts and firms the eye area.  </li>
            <li> More than that, I need to look young and fit, well-rested and energetic as opposed to old and weary.</li>
            <li> better way to get the results you want than trying SkinPro&#x27;s new Elite Serum Rx.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say no other products I have tried makes my skin look and feel so healthy and natural.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference right away, by far this product is the best compared to other products.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing happened!!</li>
            <li> The not reason I gave 4 stars is because it costs so much skinpro please reduce the price!!</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength does what it says and more!  </li>
            <li> First of all, I did not hate the product or love the product as far as how it smelled, felt, etc.</li>
            <li> This is my first time!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy at the quick reply from this Company to replace broken product/item.</li>
            <li> when applying it is very light and soft .Also</li>
            <li> The serum is a very light, clear liquid.</li>
            <li> I also started to notice that the dark shadows I had always had under my eyes started to lighten and my face really started to pop with a nice glow because my eyes finally looked bright and well rested!</li>
            <li> Since it was a little pricey, I thought it would be better to spend that kind of money on something for my lip lines.  </li>
            <li> Living in Los Angeles, you can imagine the many skin care products constantly thrown in your face, but I’d have to say that so far, both my esthetician and I agree that this has been the most effective treatment by far.</li>
            <li> However, I found that the results are well worth it</li>
            <li> And for me personally it was the best $90 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth the price because it works.</li>
            <li> and I like it far better than creams.  </li>
            <li> but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> This POWERFUL eye serum works in areas where cosmetic injections can not.</li>
            <li> It took about four months before I noticed a change, but it was worth the time I waited.</li>
            <li> My crow’s feet aren’t completely gone, but they have softened and I feel a lot better about that</li>
            <li> Two months into using the product, and I can legitimately say this was well worth</li>
            <li> There were so many days I deliberately tried to avoid eye contact with myself in the mirror after a late night, but the baggy eyes that used to greet me most every morning are significantly better now.</li>
            <li> After all this research I was convinced not only by my own experience</li>
            <li> The self-confidence I&#x27;ve gained alone is worth the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> A fresh dose is delivered through a device that looks and  behaves like a syringe.</li>
            <li> No eleven lines , forehead furrows or permanent wrinkles we like to call laugh lines</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely thrilled with Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength and am exploring SkinPro&#x27;s line of products designed to produce comparable results on the remainder of the face, the neck and décolleté .</li>
            <li> Worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> The bags aren&#x27;t completely gone but they are much better than what they were.</li>
            <li> I have even received compliments that I look rested and fresh from family and friends.</li>
            <li> Professional products that cost 100 or more products that are OTC and products from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It works, and it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the results.</li>
            <li> I immediately loved the way it made the sensitive skin around my eyes feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It doesn’t come cheap, but I can honestly say it’s worth every penny that I spent.</li>
            <li> but I think it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth mentioning that with any product that you use, you will have to maintain so that&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; per se.</li>
            <li> Another bonus,  is that the ingredients are non-comedogenic, which means that it is safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also use this serum around my mouth to target my laugh lines and I can say those are softer too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look for a diff product by SkinPro that targets the laugh lines, lines around the nose and forehead lines.</li>
            <li> So Far One Of The Better Eye Serums.</li>
            <li> They were open and honest with me about how my face was rapidly changing over the years.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old and most days</li>
            <li> It might seem to be a bit pricey, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much for your quick reply to my problem...</li>
            <li> Actually, there was more improvement than I had experienced with any other product.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely well worth the money and gives you a beautiful appearance in your eyes once more reducing dark circles and puffiness!</li>
            <li> is a product that is effectively formulated to decrease dark circles, puffiness, and fine lines.</li>
            <li> But at seven weeks in, I&#x27;m so excited about what this serum has done for my skin that I&#x27;m ready to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beyond the unbelievable results, what I love most about the Elite Serum is how light it feels.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to look younger and have their eyes looking great again.to spread easily.</li>
            <li> I started using it once every couple of days, and once I saw a change, I&#x27;m now using it every morning right after I get out of the shower..</li>
            <li> It wasn’t greasy and soaked right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> and right</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this one a try, and it didn&#x27;t work right away, so I thought about using something else.</li>
            <li> Some ppl said they saw results right away.  </li>
            <li> The texture is also nice-it absorbs right into the skin with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> One pump is the right amount of serum for both eyes.  </li>
            <li> My skin was softer and smoother right away</li>
            <li> It came and I started using it right away.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I guess the skin just needs the right nutrients or something to make things look how they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> I saw results right away.</li>
            <li> What’s really exciting is that it’s actually oil free and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> My kids had commented after using the first Elite serum and were even more surprised after using the Rx version.&lt;br /&gt;After five years of trying products, I had never seen the improvement around my eyes that I have had with Elite Serum Rx.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use Elite Serum Rx, you gently squeeze out just a drop and apply it to your clean eye area twice a day, preferably in the morning and in the evening.  </li>
            <li> Clear Glides on smooth    Absorbs quickly    </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been going through a trial error period with many different products, and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Not a ton of them, but the few I had were quite prominent and really noticeable when I smiled.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I have dark circles around my eyes, and I&#x27;ve never found anything that would help.</li>
            <li> The years have surely been good to me, but my eyes appear to have aged a hefty ten years, instead of one.</li>
            <li> I am getting more mature and am very aware of the impact of getting older used to have on my skin.</li>
            <li> A summer spent on the beach, lax sunscreen application, too many “beverages” and sunburns all contributed to a splotchy patchwork on my face that included under-eye circles, fine lines around my eyes, and flaky skin on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> It caught my attention because it was lab tested and contains medical grade ingredients, which seemed more legitimate than the majority of serums and creams that I&#x27;ve come across in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Elite Serum, I saw results pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the syringe, once I got the hang of it, rather than a little jar (where your finger gets most of the treatment rather than your eyes).</li>
            <li> ; it had new award-winning stuff added and it said it was oil free.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on repurchasing and would recommend this serum to anyone who wants a reliable and effective eye treatment.</li>
            <li> yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company ships their products super fast.  </li>
            <li> I had previously wrote a not so good review on this item.</li>
            <li> I love skinpro in general, I&#x27;m open to trying any products by them, because most of them have proven to work for me.</li>
            <li> I am 65 yrs old and it isn&#x27;t easy finding an eye cream that really works!  </li>
            <li> I was all cleared to wear makeup and with a little concealer underneath the eyes, I was good to go.  </li>
            <li> I hesitated to try Elite Serum RX Strength because it was a little pricey, but the reviews were really good, so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> I think this product helps more with dark circles than it does fine lines</li>
            <li> I will turn 50 years old at the end of this year and while I have very youthful looking skin, I do have fine lines on my forehead, around my eyes and smile</li>
            <li> I tried a little and liked it, a cool feeling with no residue.  </li>
            <li> Elite Serum RX really works!</li>
            <li> I still need to make it a goal to get more sleep, however use this on the bags on my eyes has helped vastly improve the condition of under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I just love this product and will definitely &lt;br /&gt;continue using it.</li>
            <li> Actually, my skin is now better than I&#x27;ve ever imagined it could be.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t bother me at first.  </li>
            <li> But I decided to look for an oil-free cream first and found Elite Serum on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Works great on wrinkles as long as you apply on daily basis.  </li>
            <li> She first had me try some by Sunday Riley.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum is the first serum I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I just orderd the Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength and expect even better results.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements.  </li>
            <li> After my first use I noticed a tightness around my eyes, and my puffiness from lack of sleep disappeared.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid is the key for maintaining water substances in human skin which is one of the key elements in flawless skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I could actually use it during the day it would work better for me, but I wear makeup all day.</li>
            <li> It definitely firms the under eye area for sure..</li>
            <li> I never looked like I got much sleep!</li>
            <li> I even signed up for their refill program (via their website) since it saves quite a bit, and I can put it on hold anytime (which I did after three months, since I&#x27;ve been slow-poking my way through the first month&#x27;s supply).</li>
            <li> This product has not only virtually eradicated the bags under my eyes but also gotten rid of most of the puffiness.</li>
            <li> So, I began going to bed earlier and resting more on the weekend, However, I still could not got rid of those circles.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m actually quite glad</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several weeks now, and I am able to notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I feel and look so much younger and people I know have asked me what I&#x27;m doing because my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 again can&#x27;t happen, looking like a much younger, more wide-awake and fresh-eyed woman works for me.</li>
            <li> I can see the lines have reduced in appearance, which has made me not use much makeup; I couldn&#x27;t be happier about that part!</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> This one took care of both, and pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> appreciate the detailed explanations of the purpose, method of action and efficacy provided on the website.</li>
            <li> At first I was weary of trying this stuff.</li>
            <li> But most of all, I gained back my self-confidence, and the comments about me stopped.</li>
            <li> I am a consistent user of SkinPro products and Elite Serum</li>
            <li> The texture around my eyes is smooth, I actually look like I get a full night&#x27;s sleep now, even though I don&#x27;t, and a co-worker</li>
            <li> However, after the third month, I did not notice any more improvement.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to look younger and have their eyes looking great again.</li>
            <li> Plus there was the hassle of using so many different products on my face every day.</li>
            <li> Have tried many eye serums and thought this might be different.  </li>
            <li> I used it exactly as recomended (every day and every night.)</li>
            <li> Elite Serum RX Extra Strength is the latest and strongest  version of  a series of eye serums made by SkinPro.  </li>
            <li> First off, everyone has been raving about their leading product that has redefined beauty; called Elite Serum.</li>
            <li> As far as results,, my dark, puffy circles are greatly improved and the skin around my eyes looks healthier.</li>
            <li> The dispenser to the fragrance free, clear product, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product to make a noticeable improvement in my eye area and I am amazed.</li>
            <li> Try it - it really works!</li>
            <li> For me, the biggest concern is how to get smooth soft skin, along with tackling the problem of eye puffiness..</li>
            <li> The first product I came across was a type of anti-aging lotion.</li>
            <li> the product first came</li>
            <li> I’m actually pretty selective</li>
            <li> you are aging around the eyes (or are interested in premature aging methods)</li>
            <li> The fine lines seem to require a little more effort to treat but the Dispensing Syringe does help with the application</li>
            <li> The good results extended to minor wrinkles and the general look/feel of my skin, and the changes recently became more permanent and visible to the untrained eye.</li>
            <li> co-worker complimented me the other day saying my skin looked nice, so I am going to stick with this product and see what else happens.</li>
            <li> When I settled on Elite Serum, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much, but I figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and this is the only one that I have seen a very visible improvement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pacing myself from writing a review until I&#x27;ve responsibly used this for about three months, a solid time frame to assess any notable changes while using a skin product.  </li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx, combined with a definite healthy shift in lifestyle choices, really helped me reset the clock.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes was lightening and looking truly healthy for the first time in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received this product very quickly and customer service was very fast and prompt when I had emailed with a questions prior to purchasing.  </li>
            <li> After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try the product for myself.</li>
            <li> It really works, I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t really see a lot of results, but I figured I would give it a bit longer to work.</li>
            <li> They have other great products for the entire face, not just eyes.</li>
            <li> a satisfied and long time uses of the Elite Serum.</li>
            <li> Haloxyl, also called Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, can effectively reduce dark spots and puffiness by promoting blood circulation in the eyes.</li>
            <li> After I researched the active ingredient hyaluronic acid and read some great things about it, I decided it was definitely something I wanted to try.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, I have tried more facial products to help improve my skin.  </li>
            <li> admit I wasn&#x27;t interested in Elite Serum Rx initially because I&#x27;m not the kind of person who spends $80 on a cosmetic product, but I finally bit the bullet because I though I might as well shell out for the good stuff instead of continuing to throw my money at cheaper products that weren&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this sure is an expensive product, but you know what?</li>
            <li> It is a best selling product for a reason — I have used it for a couple of months now and the dark circles around my eyes have noticeably reduced, so too the puffiness although this took a little longer to fade.</li>
            <li> and I have seen more improvement than I had thought would be possible and saw more improvement than any other product I had used.</li>
            <li> I looked more awake and refreshed than I had in long time!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry like most products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to use, absorbs well, etc.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very particular about the products I use.</li>
            <li> serum is such a pleasure to use it easily integrates into your routine..</li>
            <li> Enough will come out to spread easily.</li>
            <li> I’m very pleased with this product and will definitely be keeping it in my regular skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how simple and easy to use this product was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent way more than this on many other beauty products combined with no results, so I decided it was worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Consequently, I can say for certain that the Elite Serum has undoubtedly worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no chemist, but whatever is in this serum is certain give plastic surgeons a run for their money.</li>
            <li> The product is so easy to apply and takes up just seconds of my day, so daily usage is no problem, and I didn&#x27;t think there would be much to lose.</li>
            <li> However, most products I&#x27;ve used have had minimal results and I was less than enthusiastic about them.</li>
            <li> For some reason I was starting to see fine lines under my eyes; maybe it&#x27;s aging.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit steep but definitely worth the splurge and considerably cheaper than the loads money I have thrown away on less effective products.</li>
            <li> However, after several weeks of use, I noticed that the fine lines and wrinkles started to dissipate.</li>
            <li> no amount of facial exercise and diet were making a dent into those fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the way the serum absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t made my T-zone oily (I use it on the lines on my forehead too!)  </li>
            <li> My first tube is just running out at around 11 weeks of steady applications.</li>
            <li> My skin felt immediately better, as far as hydrated and soft, but I did not see real results for about 4 weeks – after which time, wow!  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes and on my entire face (I apply to my forehead and around the mouth too) in general just feels fresher and smoother since I’ve started using this serum, and it’s also very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The Elite Syrum Rx is definitely not a facelift in a tube, but it&#x27;s a great product if you&#x27;re looking to improve your appearance a little and don&#x27;t have a lot of time, money and effort to invest.</li>
            <li> The formula for actually is different, and makes a huge difference as well.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> If you accidentally use too much, the excess rolls off your skin    </li>
            <li> because I had very saggy eyelids</li>
            <li> And getting them on Amazon is so much cheaper than getting them anywhere else</li>
            <li> Been using for a month and seeing wrinkles under eyes stating to decrease  and to anyone worried about wrinkled should definitely give this fabulous product a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to really fuss with makeup.  </li>
            <li> It really has smoothed out the crows feet and the bag lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> but not seeing any unusual transformations.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely important that anti-aging products are kept air-tight and do not have contact with outside elements.</li>
            <li> But, the real test came when I went to work (I work with all females in a cosmetic dentistry office)</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed it working very well..</li>
            <li> /&gt;They explained that  over  100,000, of people and much.</li>
            <li> I believe it will all be gone very soon...</li>
            <li> I really appreciate what Elite Serum Rx does for my eyes.</li>
            <li> Thanks anyway, kiddos.</li>
            <li> We’re talking about real science here.</li>
            <li> Real results.</li>
            <li> My skin is sagging, lacking elasticity and no matter how much weight I seem to lose, the skin is just not tightening up.  </li>
            <li> Twice daily use of the Elite Serum Rx, along with a complete over-haul of my diet and a focused effort to get more sleep has given me better than expected results.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice much help with puffiness but am not giving up yet as others have commented it may take a while.  </li>
            <li> on a beauty product, at most I&#x27;ve spent around $50</li>
            <li> but how much goes into the science of it.  </li>
            <li> so maybe it really would have helped with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; (the name makes it sound weirder than it is) did the trick for me overall.</li>
            <li> I really really like this product and woudl defiantly recommend it to family and friends who suffer with bags under their eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Elite Serum RX Strength really works.</li>
            <li> Its been 2 months haven&#x27;t seen a change like the reviews I&#x27;ve been reading about, really bummed because I didn&#x27;t want to have to turn to injections.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see the result very well.</li>
            <li> SkinPro staff has been knowledgeable,and very helpful.</li>
            <li> gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> This time I REALLY found it.  </li>
            <li> And while I don’t know what peptides really are, I do know that their addition to the serum makes Elite clinically proven to reduce eye wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have tried so may products and was beginning to feel like nothing was really going to help reduce the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was using Hydroxatone for about a year but didn&#x27;t really notice much of a change.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to others who want to nip the aging process in the bud!</li>
            <li> Also, really there is no glitter in this.</li>
            <li> the Elite Serum Rx has really improved my eye bag situation.</li>
            <li> however it is very pricey.</li>
            <li> It does not feel sticky or slimy and absorbs into the skin quite fast.</li>
            <li> It does not feel sticky or slimy and absorbs into the skin quite fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I started looking for another product for my eyes after my drugstore cream was running out, and frankly, not working very well.</li>
            <li> and I had no issues with it absorbing.  </li>
            <li> If someone is having absorbency issues I think it may be because they are using too much.  </li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx eye cream really makes a difference for me.</li>
            <li> Using this product really boosted my confidence.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx is that it is not irritating or greasy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> So I really just wanted to find a product that would make my skin smoother and softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> They are correct, as my crow’s feet are much improved, but I also wanted my skin to feel softer and look smoother.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> This product worked to help me look younger and healthier, and considering the fact that my appearance affects my sales success rate, that made it worth every penny that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> definitely went above and beyond by creating their own.</li>
            <li> First things first, SkinPro offers a guarantee.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, because of Elite Serum Rx’s great packaging and easy spread-ability a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant at first because of the price tag, but she swore up and down at how affective it is at reversing the signs of aging and stress and so, (along with a huge box of chocolates and a day at the spa!)</li>
            <li> After trying many other top of the line eye products only Elite Serum gave me a rested, young look I never had archieved before.  </li>
            <li> : I found the Elite Serum RX (Extra Strength) to be a very useful product.</li>
            <li> It also has some yummy ingredients in it like seaweed extract, oxygen and various other good nutrients.</li>
            <li> Natural seaweed extracts uniquely function to target glycation and preserve the skin&#x27;s natural collagen.</li>
            <li> I think this cream really goes deep down within your skin to rejuvenate it from the core because it has extra peptides in it which is very good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to try any facial products that aren&#x27;t recommended by my dermatologist because my skin is very sensitive and blemishes easily.</li>
            <li> This is not to say other skin care products did not achieve results, but the Elite Serum RX allowed me to see a difference more than anything else I tried.  </li>
            <li> The last two months I have noticed a significant difference in my eye area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike many other eye serum’s</li>
            <li> just the other day said I looked better rested.</li>
            <li> I would give it more stars if it weren&#x27;t for all the other claims.</li>
            <li> I am also pleased that it does not irritate my eyes, as other creams have done.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that the first few ingredients in this product are seaweed extract, Hylauronic Acid, and purified water which are known for moisturizing the skin from within.</li>
            <li> The dispenser is very easy to use, distributing the correct amount without waste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Elite SerumRx is very easy to use and you do not have to worry about dipping your fingers into a jar and contaminating it with bacteria or dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I’ve always had oily skin my whole life, but since getting older, it’s now more dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to see a product that finally works especially after spending so much on products that made my skin red and flaky.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, Elite Serum RX Extra Strength , almost as if reading my mind, added a new ingredient to the serum called Syn®-TC from Pentapharm which increases the formation of collagen that helps smooth and soften the eye area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to dispense too much at once, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Elite as long as it is available to us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products its crazy to think about how many!</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx has made it to the short list of things I need to make my recovery a full one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products to lighten up the dark rings under my eyes and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> I had been wearing glasses for years mostly just to disguise my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> the dark circles are getting more skin tone</li>
            <li> I also was pretty surprised to see that the charge at customs was hefty, which brings the price of the product at the $120.00 mark, but this has nothing of course, to do with the product ingredients.  </li>
            <li> They first appeared when I was just 12 years old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my first syringe on Amazon and then realized I can purchase it directly through the SkinPro website.  </li>
            <li> and I don’t spend the mornings fretting about how to conceal the dark circles (and as a man, I do not have the luxury of being able to use concealer or</li>
            <li> On top of that, the dark circles under my eyes began to dissipate.</li>
            <li> For years I have tried so many products to help improve the appearance of my dark circles under my eyes and reduce the puffiness.</li>
            <li> encourage any one interested in anti aging to read the history of Elite&#x27;s development and its mechanisms of action.</li>
            <li> As with anything, to reap the full benefits, I have added this serum to my nightly skin care regimen and will continue using on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> So far, I have not experienced any side effects or skin irritation from this product, which makes it all the more worthwhile.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles and dark circles seemed to vanish leaving my eyes looking better than ever.</li>
            <li> With dark circles and crow&#x27;s feet invading my already puffy eyes, I set-out on a search to find more than just some remedial \\&quot;rat-tested\\</li>
            <li> I have tried several eye products over the last couple of years, but none of them worked as good as the Elite Serum Rx (Extra Strength)</li>
            <li> I guess I was lucky enough to get away with moisturizers and cheap eye creams for as long as I did.  </li>
            <li> The eye area is a little better but for me, the real results are in the lip area.  </li>
            <li> My new routine is Elite Serum Rx under my eyes and to my upper eye lids (on clean skin of course) and Vit C Serum on the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used undereye products for half the price of this one and they worked better.  </li>
            <li> This actually does what it says and is non irritating and great for my allergy prone eyes and super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older with more responsibilities and obligations, I get less rest and my undereyes get even darker now.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t completely gone, but they&#x27;ve filled in enough that my makeup doesn&#x27;t settle into them the way it once did.  </li>
            <li> If you want to at least LOOK great for your age and knock off the appearance of several years, give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a second syringe and with this I&#x27;m noticing more extensive results.  </li>
            <li> It seems to get absorbed into skin fast, well and deep.  </li>
            <li> I know that the product is mainly intended to be used on wrinkles around the eyes, but it has worked just as well on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Needs better packaging so not so much serum wasted.</li>
            <li> Most of them were already using the Elite Serum RX - Extra Strength for months-and I was literally-the only one in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find the positive effects that the patented peptides had on my face.</li>
            <li> Ladies, I recommend you try Elite Serum Rx at least once and show your kids that you’re more than “just mom!”</li>
            <li> It feels amazing on tired eyes and perks them right up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Joanne Pittman, Georgetown, Tx.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This serum came highly recommended, but is an avg. product.</li>
            <li> recommend this product highly</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for women like me who don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on skincare but need a confidence boost, like I did.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this based on the fact that it was rated so highly on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Elite Serum Rx.</li>
            <li> It is high priced though</li>
            <li> Pros:  great packaging; dispenses exact amount required; absorbs well into skin; no problem returning purchase through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: too harsh for my skin type (sensitive), left eye area red and sore after one use.</li>
            <li> I have been using Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength for a little over three months and it has had, by far, the best results of any other eye serum I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products with little results.</li>
            <li> This product is no better and no worse than all the other &#x27;great cures&#x27; on the market.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much to change the appearance of fine lines or dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so surprised too at how the winkles can really sneak in.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> which skincare review offers I decide to review because some skincare companies tend to be a lot of bells and whistles without much result .  </li>
            <li> The biggest was after 2 full weeks of using it, I think with consistent use that the product will keep my dark circles from reappearing.</li>
            <li> It actually took me two syringes worth to notice a difference</li>
            <li> 3 months later, I can say that it was worth it to do the research.</li>
            <li> It rejuvenates, making skin appear younger and fresh.</li>
            <li> I’m glad I did; in the matter of months, the dark circles under my eyes started to reflect my natural skin tone, and the puffiness around my eyes disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the expense, as it makes my skin radiant and even, and provides the convenience of having the benefits of several products rolled in to one syringe.</li>
            <li> The bags under my eyes pretty much disappeared with daily use.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many, StriVectin, Skinceuticals, Derma e, Estee Lauder, Reviva, Artistry, (just to name a few).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pretty much given up when I finally tried Elite Serum Rx.</li>
            <li> Extra Strength is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I look tired all of the time even when I&#x27;ve had a good night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, the results are not overnight or drastic, as many similar gimmick anti-aging products make false claims about.</li>
            <li> The treatments that I&#x27;ve gone through have made my body feel and look 10 years older than my very young 31.  </li>
            <li> However, given that I look visibly younger and much healthier and have never had that from other eye serums, it seems more than worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky enough that I look young for my age.  </li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx did not disappoint because a few weeks later, my fine lines were disappearing and overall around my eyes looked more youthful and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s the only positive!  </li>
            <li> After a few more weeks, the area under my eyes began to get (considerably!)</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quality eye serum that has fast, lasting results.</li>
            <li> but the difference is the improvement on the fine lines and my upper lid and eye bags especially when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bounced around between about half a dozen other skin care products trying to solve this issue, but most of them did nothing more than a -run-of-the-mill moisturizer and some of them flat out didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt like I didn&#x27;t have an option but to live with these imperfections anymore.</li>
            <li> Still, I need to see some improvement--preferably sooner--when I am using a new product.</li>
            <li> I feel and look as though I am a new man.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wait for my new order</li>
            <li> I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> How about a trial size on new product.</li>
            <li> this new strength...</li>
            <li> I automatically receive a new syringe every 45 days</li>
            <li> I am always reserved with new beauty products, but I knew the ingredients were beneficial because I had been doing my research.</li>
            <li> In Nov.of this year I received the new Elite Serum Rx.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Defend, Protect, Rejuvenate&amp;#34; slogan seems to live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I believe that&#x27;s because with the new version they tried to make it thicker like an eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx - Extra Strength really does feel more powerful and effective than any of the products I have tired in the past.</li>
            <li> Dark  circles and fine eye lines remain.  </li>
            <li> So, until I find a miracle concealer and/or a miracle dark circle reducer, I will have to settle for trying to reduce the fine lines so that I can continue to wear the dreaded concealer.  </li>
            <li> I have used a ton of skin care products hoping to reduce my wrinkles and fine lines with no success.</li>
            <li> With all of the ingredients listed in this product, I expected a firmer result, a more obvious lift.  </li>
            <li> Eyes are such an important feature when it comes to the overall appearance of someone!  </li>
            <li> As for the so-called delivered mechanism, it&#x27;s laughable; many other products on the market do a much better job at squeezing the right amount.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by these results.</li>
            <li> She is always trying new skin care products and is pretty knowledgable and opinionated about the various brands out there.  </li>
            <li> many of us do when we are just plain feeling old.</li>
            <li> It even worked on my fine smile lines - they&#x27;re seriously almost gone now.</li>
            <li> I first tried it around one eye, and on the back of one hand, just to see if I would have any unfavorable reaction.</li>
            <li> Having tried so many from various vendors, (and most with no, or unfortunate results)</li>
            <li> I’m a researcher by nature, so I looked online, read tons of reviews and finally landed on a consistent product:</li>
            <li> It has noticeably reduced the lines and dark circles around my eyes and the skin is smooth and finer textured.</li>
            <li> Extra Strength is the first anti aging product I&#x27;ve found that delivers everything promised.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sold based of subjective feelings of small groups who report results  like &amp;#34; my face is softer&amp;#34; or &amp;#34; my skin glows&amp;#34; like so many of the creams and potions we&#x27;ve bought and soon discarded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which product is producing the most results or if it&#x27;s the combo of the two.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this product due to the stunning reviews and almost instant (within a week) improvements.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, WOW!</li>
            <li> I love the applicator since it allows me to take only the amount I need instead of dealing with excess cream that used to come out of my other bottle.</li>
            <li> serum is very easy to apply; not requiring tons of steps and complicated directions allows you to easily work it into your daily care routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still young, but have always suffered from dark circles and can see fine lines beginning to develop around my eye area.</li>
            <li> Thankfully her health is MUCH better now, but she’s tried nearly every skin cream and anti-aging solution out there- and all to very little affect.  </li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes is smooth and soft, and I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a little help there.</li>
            <li> and I can see a huge difference in puffiness and even the wrinkles are less.</li>
            <li> When I noticed the slight lines forming in the corners of my eyes and on my forehead, I was thrown into a state of genuine panic.</li>
            <li> Not only did I not see any improvement, the product seemed to make my dark circles more visible than they already were.</li>
            <li> I began to feel it working the moment I put it on, and I began to notice that it did begin lifting the skin very quickly, although I think it takes a little longer to see the complete long-term effects.</li>
            <li> so that could account for some of the positive changes, but regardless, this Serum is now a mandatory part of my daily regime.</li>
            <li> The dark circles, bags and wrinkles around my eyes have significantly improved.  </li>
            <li> The puffiness was significantly reduced, and so were the dark circles.</li>
            <li> a try because other people who had used it were writing very positive reviews, emphasizing a steady, gradual improvement.</li>
            <li> I do feel it is important to read their easy instructions, or you could do the wrong maneuver and break it.</li>
            <li> If you wait a bit and give it a few months, you will start to see the fine lines decreasing.</li>
            <li> I myself suffer from the misfortune of looking older than I am, mostly due to lack of proper self-maintenance and exercise, but have found that this product makes me look more like my actual age.</li>
            <li> I previously used the original Elite Serum and that product showed some improvement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend Elite Serum to anyone who feels they need a little refreshing.</li>
            <li> I used it for about a month and a half and didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference between this product and other cheaper ‘quick fix’ solutions.</li>
            <li> but clearly it wasn’t working.  </li>
            <li> I’ve never been one to worry much about my appearance, especially wrinkles, until my 4-year old son pointed out that he could make his face wrinkle like mine -</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t help clear the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is clear and odorless, not tested on animals and won&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I work in the entertainment industry, which often times means extremely long nights, which I’m sure, have contributed to the dark, puffy circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Clear, odorless, non tacky, non oily, everything one would look for in a product.  </li>
            <li> It completely changed my life.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I decided to buy this serum after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> One would think that as much as this product costs that the manufacturer would provide dispensers that actually work.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely get rid of them, but I don&#x27;t think any product can.  </li>
            <li> But I have to say this product surprised me.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> In a week, my puffy eyes (my biggest problem) are diminishing before my eyes (pun intended), and my budding marionette lines are basically gone.</li>
            <li> Now that I am nearly 40</li>
            <li> Boy, was I surprised.</li>
            <li> with no irritation to my extremely sensitive eyes whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> When a syringe of Extra Strength arrived, the product really kicked in.</li>
            <li> ; I don’t feel like I’m 100 years old with a preschooler running around.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on the web, all I read was how the only real treatment to help these lines was injectable fillers.  </li>
            <li> Looking in the mirror was often a complete embarrassment to me, what with all the wrinkles, lines and circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> There are lines forming near my eyes where there wasn’t before.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is primarily for the eyes, but I use it on all the trouble areas on my face.  </li>
            <li> However, using the Elite Serum Rx, I have noticed very tangible results; friends and family members have commented that I finally look well rested</li>
            <li> It was developed by Irwin Grams, an award-winning cosmetic pharmacist with over thirty-seven years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes I&#x27;ll ask people I&#x27;ve met how old they think I look</li>
            <li> It is a topical agent that really helps defy age.</li>
            <li> I think often the products simply don&#x27;t work and plus, a natural aged look isn&#x27;t something we need to be constantly finding inventive cures for.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this serum seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> I called SkinPro direct and they sent out a replacement, no questions asked.  </li>
            <li> You twist to unlock, express as much as you want/ need and reseal with a twist in the opposite direction,  replace the cover and cap.</li>
            <li> I searched for a product that was an alternative to a filler, as a filler is really the only thing that can help, but at $500 a syringe, it was out of the question.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this issue since my early 20&#x27;s and nothing I&#x27;ve tried rids it.  </li>
            <li> I didn’t want my busy life to be a reflection on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it morning and night for about two months now and so far</li>
            <li> Was I getting old?</li>
            <li> I no longer feel the need to wear foundation and cover up on a daily basis, and my skin feels much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> It was simple to use, was odorless and gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> take it from a 54 year old that takes care of herself and skin, and yes has some skin damage.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it’s 100% oil-free as my face tends to get a bit oily naturally.</li>
            <li> I am 29 years old.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Specifically, I started off with using a pea-sized amount under my eyes, where I experience frequent puffiness, at night.</li>
            <li> The company also hires professional and polite personnel.</li>
            <li> But after just two weeks, I noticed a marked improvement in my appearance.</li>
            <li> and I have to thank my mom for my soft skin.</li>
            <li> This eye serum was developed by scientists and the packaging and product reflect the quality this company is known for.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well rested</li>
            <li> I was initially surprised with the packaging.</li>
            <li> Five years as a freelancer really began to take a toll on my skin, especially my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks, it feels nice and soothing to apply but the wrinkles and bags are still there and one eye is worse (bags)</li>
            <li> Additionally, the dispensing tip is very fine and only small amounts come out at a time, so there is no waste.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks and there were periods of frustration (I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement the first month) but within the second month, my skin looked better than it had in a long time.!</li>
            <li> right now I have it shipped every 3rd month, and that&#x27;s using it twice daily.</li>
            <li> It only took a couple weeks before I started to notice that my wrinkles were becoming less defined.</li>
            <li> Although I originally purchased this product for the puffiness and wrinkles around my eyes my bigger concern was the vertical lines above my lip, some deep.  </li>
            <li> While it didn’t totally get rid of my deeper wrinkles, it helped smooth out my fine lines and get rid of the puffiness, not a huge change in my dark circles, yet though.</li>
            <li> After using for a little over month, my fine lines are nearly gone and my dark circles have diminished more than any other product I’ve used.</li>
            <li> No more switching for me a month going strong</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t do much, but all of a sudden my dark circles under my eyes started turning normal skin color..</li>
            <li> I also find that with other rich night creams that I end up with acne or blemishes in the morning from being too oily, but since using Elite I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin, I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup because the tone has evened out, and laugh lines and creases are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, some of which were very expensive, but this worked fine...</li>
            <li> No mess, no fuss.</li>
            <li> It contains Argireline and other powerful ingredients that can help you stay young-looking.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to decrease the puffiness under my eyes as well as dark circles that I’ve had for more than ten years, which gives me the appearance of not having gotten enough sleep.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was worried about it being too heavy as it&#x27;s described as being like a &#x27;rich eye cream&#x27;</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t see some type of results rather quickly then it will loose my interest and fall out of my daily beauty regiment.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do something serious about my crow’s feet after having tried so many ineffective end-of-the-aisle products from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Brighter looking skin around the eyes, my fine lines have disappeared, and no more puffiness as well.</li>
            <li> I felt 30 years older than I actually was.</li>
            <li> but it is still much older than my actual age</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I started using Elite Serum Rx and didn’t really see any results for a few weeks so as you can imagine, I was pretty bummed.</li>
            <li> After applying this product my skin featured no burning, redness, or even extreme tightness as it does with many other anti-aging serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on what it does for dark circles because I&#x27;m fortunate enough to not suffer from them.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it made my skin worse in a way as it was becoming much darker than when I had started.</li>
            <li> I previously used the original Elite Serum and that product showed some improvement, which is why I decided to try the new version hoping I would see more dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Elite Serum Extra Strength.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of creams that claim to be oil free but usually aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Within a week, the dark areas had lightened up significantly and my skin looks younger and brighter.</li>
            <li> Not only did her illness wreck her health, but in the process left her with quite a few more crow’s feet and darker bags than she had ever had before.  </li>
            <li> She normally uses either Revive Eye Renewal Cream (a serum) or La Prairie White Caviar eye serum.  </li>
            <li> My first syringe was almost empty before I felt like it was making any improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have almost no dark circles or puffiness anymore.</li>
            <li> While many of the other products had some of the same ingredients, they do not have the same amounts and the same combination that Elite has.</li>
            <li> It has the ability to provide a long term therapeutic solution to fine lines and wrinkles, dark circles and under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> Its hard to know which product to use, considering many of the products use the same core ingredients</li>
            <li> I started looking for a new eye cream and decided to try Elite Serum Rx because it contains Argireline and specific peptides to treat puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After six months of regular use the droopiness of my upper eyelids improved and the lower lids were much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I’m only forty, a professional business woman with two young children.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are in need of a review that is at least 50-200 words describing the product (based on the description provided) and an example or two of how this product helped you to feel younger or gave you better skin, why you chose this product over others and how you feel it compares to others.  </li>
            <li> Recently I began noticing that the eye cream I’d been using (Chanel Ultra Correction Total Eye Lift) wasn’t doing much to fight the newer lines and puffiness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks , I have notice that the circles and a few wrinkles that was under my eyes has been clearing up really nice.</li>
            <li> My wife was skeptical and as such we waited to review this product until she had used it for a fair amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Especially since both my parents and sisters still look very young around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I think nationality and genetics plays a major role in my case.  </li>
            <li> , I just can&#x27;t say I see major improvements yet.</li>
            <li> skin has never been healthier, the smile and frown creases last only as long as the expression lasts.</li>
            <li> After using the Elite Serum for the past year I have noticed a significant difference in my appearance.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking based off the video and positive comments it just might improve under eye darkness or some small lines on side of eyes; however it did not improve either situation after using the whole syringe.</li>
            <li> reiterate that I am typically suspicious about the whole range of serums and creams promising the world, but this serum actually delivered on its promise to drastically reduce puffiness and darkness.</li>
            <li> Even after only a few days of using it I noticed the puffiness around my eyes begin to reduce significantly</li>
            <li> Might seem a little pricy, but this is a five star product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Dark circles had faded but not completely diminished and fine lines are also starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month now, and I am pleasantly surprised by how much it has reduced the perennial dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at my results after using the product for only one month,  I continued to re-order it and this Serum has been a staple in my skin care regimen</li>
            <li> Well, on my 8th day I was so bruised and barely opening my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that by my wedding they will barely be noticeable.</li>
            <li> Their professionals frequently gave me samples of the various eye creams and serums.</li>
            <li> So, since I spent so much money, I decided to just use it at night.  </li>
            <li> So, imagine my surprise when I looked in the mirror at 39 and saw an old woman looking back at me!  </li>
            <li> The first week after I started, I saw that the dark circles were almost gone.</li>
            <li> I have used them since I was around 20 years old and finally said, \\&quot;Forget it.\\&quot; Being an African-American that doesn&#x27;t smoke, drink, or do any drugs</li>
            <li> For that, I give it a 4 stars and once I have finished the product completely, I&#x27;ll come back and update as to whether or not I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Over the years I’ve invested in many expensive facial products that are “worth it” only to find myself with no improvements and out a hundred bucks—but this one actually works.</li>
            <li> my skin seems more radiant instead of that tired</li>
            <li> I will persevere, perhaps it is one of those treatments that makes the condition worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx is a little sticky, not horrific, but it does have a slight stickiness to it.  </li>
            <li> Also, it helped calm down the tiny visible (to me anyway) lines around the eye are.</li>
            <li> I didn’t need half am much concealer as I’d been using--sorry MAC!--</li>
            <li> My first tube lasted me about a month and a half</li>
            <li> So I purchased the product and for the past month, I have seen a significant change in my undereyes even when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep.</li>
            <li> I have been self-conscious about my laugh lines and wrinkles for so long, and they would get me every time I strolled through the pharmacy for other meds and vitamins.</li>
            <li> I was ecstatic to see tremendous results, after only using Elite Serum RX daily for less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to get a long lasting fix, instead of just spending a bunch of money on creams that barely work.</li>
            <li> The swelling is now smooth to touch and the dark marks are much lighter and hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> After only 10 days, the texture of the skin around the eyes has softened and the fine lines are slowly going away.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve had really terrible dry skin, especially during the winter, and I&#x27;ve tried to overcompensate with rich creams and moisturizers but nothing has ever really caused my skin to actually feel healthier itself, it&#x27;s only ever been a quick fix for the most part.</li>
            <li> It’s oil-free which means it won’t cause build-up in your pores, unlike some of the other products I’ve tried which have given me blemishes, and the peptides they’ve added to the ingredients really do make your skin feel younger—I can attest to that.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the bags under my eyes are starting to dissipate, which I am so happy about because I&#x27;ve looked half awake for the past few years.</li>
            <li> By a week, I noticed big difference, but it was starting to dry my under eye area out too much</li>
            <li> While I do have to say that the results aren&#x27;t instant, after using the serum for a few weeks I have noticed a pretty dramatic improvement in the thinness of my eye skin and fine lines in particular.</li>
            <li> and I was also surprised by how big the bottle actually was.</li>
            <li> but both are far more expensive than Elite Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also contains major peptides, such as Argireline, Syn-TC and Inyline.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum RX contains peptides that are especially created to treat major eye issues.</li>
            <li> I did the first time I used it and got a little in my eye</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes since I have a collection of partially used products in my cabinet that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My dark circles got much lighter and I&#x27;m using it just for two weeks, can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in couple weeks.</li>
            <li> The Elite Serum RX has really helped me with my dark circles and under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> Dark circles from allergies and sleep deprivation are much lighter.</li>
            <li> So, as a young man, now in my early 30&#x27;s, I have used eye creams, cucumbers, serums, and other products to help with bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I get compliments from people about my pretty eyes everyday.</li>
            <li> But I am getting married in a few months</li>
            <li> Every year naturally brings more wrinkles, and then last year she got extremely ill.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it out, I accidentally over-estimated, but after a few seconds of work with a cotton ball, I got it under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried products for each concern in the past, but without success.</li>
            <li> absorbs in skin well around eyes - but too much comes out of tube even with a slight push.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the dark circles my whole life and have had to wear concealer for them daily.</li>
            <li> Now,  people tell me I look younger and a few very close friends have asked if I had surgery!</li>
            <li> and my skin usually can&#x27;t handle very heavy products, but this absorbed very nicely and didn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li> As such a teensy-weensy amount goes so far, one syringe should last a long time, if cared for as per the instructions.</li>
            <li> I am thirty years old and previously thought that I was too young to worry about anti-aging products.</li>
            <li> During that second month, not only did the wrinkles diminish until they were barely noticeable, the skin that I had applied it on actually looked (and felt) younger:  </li>
            <li> I use this product twice daily and within a few months I started to see positive changes.</li>
            <li> As I’m getting older I’ve been looking for something to help with the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Still a little weary, though I checked some of the testimonies and reviews from customers who have previously used the product and they reported significant, almost life-changing results.</li>
            <li> I used to just use cover up, but now that I’ve seen what kind of effect this had on my wrinkles (with virtually no ill effect; and I’ve had some bad reactions to some other kinds of rejuvenators)</li>
            <li> Things like dark spots, bags, and wrinkles took over causing me to appear way older than I actually was.</li>
            <li> The only con I have with this product is that if I accidentally use too much it can become a little tacky.  </li>
            <li> The only minor drawback for me was the price, which Is a little higher than similar products.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find the results at 20% compared to other products of similar ingredients.</li>
            <li> I read both good and bad reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through one syringe so far and have noticed an improvement, although not huge, but I&#x27;ve ordered a second and hope to see a bigger difference after this one is complete.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx has by far left a lasting impression upon my skin compared to all the other OTC products.</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin, so it&#x27;s difficult for me to find a good fit, even though I try to use expensive, high quality creams and serums to avoid irritation.</li>
            <li> When I found out about the new Elite Serum RX and that it had added ingredients to help with the dark circles I knew I had to try it too.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old with some sagging under eyes and creepiness above the eyes due to weight loss and of course age.</li>
            <li> , people often think I&#x27;m a little older by the eyes.</li>
            <li> It has helped to soften those pesky fine lines that have been creeping up over the past few years.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient-Argireline, has recently been developed and tested, to reduce wrinkles and signs of aging around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with puffiness and dark circles!</li>
            <li> I kept emailing to push my next shipment out further, because the product lasts so long.</li>
            <li> This serum packs a real punch far beyond any other brand I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> An exceptional product with some serious research behind it.</li>
            <li> Even my co-workers commented that I looked more awake and rested than usual when I had barely any sleep the previous night with two small children refusing to go to bed.</li>
            <li> Once I noticed improvement with the wrinkles I tried it on the dark patches under my eyes, and it began to gradually clear up.</li>
            <li> Within about two weeks, I could noticeably tell that the dark circles under my eyes had diminished considerably.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it completely eliminated my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Haloxyl will increase the blood flow to the area around and under the eyes, eliminating dark circles and decreasing the puffiness in the sensitive area.</li>
            <li> The reduced wrinkles gave me added confidence to look clients directly in the eye, knowing that they would see my eyes and not my wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> so I did not use long enough to see any results.</li>
            <li> His bags were not completely gone but a vast improvement was noted.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t aged horrifically,but over the last many months I&#x27;ve noticed the lines around my eyes are now a little deeper, circles a little darker and bags a little puffier.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product like Elite Serum RX for years, unfortunately all the products I&#x27;ve tried that claim to diminish fine lines around your eyes simply don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The only one that I have used regularly was too heavy, and didn&#x27;t do much for the dark circles under my eyes beyond moisturizing them.</li>
            <li> A while back I started noticing that I looked more tired than usual - even in the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend Elite Serum to everyone and I will continue using this product as long as it&#x27;s on the market!</li>
            <li> Granted, they were puzzled that my looks weighed so heavily on me because they only know me as old Mom and didn’t think it mattered.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, it will be a 5 Star rating once posted, but for now you can simply email me your rough draft for approval.  </li>
            <li> I am a 50+ year-old male, and I am, unfortunately, single.</li>
            <li> My entire family, male and female, has the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> After trying just about every serum, cream, mask, cold pack, and cucumber variety known to humankind, I had finally decided that enough was enough and that more extreme, drastic measures were in order.</li>
            <li> I am a 60+ woman who was concerned about loose, baggy looking skin above and below my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had tried numerous other products prior to finding out about the Elite Serum.  </li>
            <li> emphasize that I was doubly injured because I paid for 3 products , the tax paid in the amount of 100 % of these 3 products , I only received a tube , and this still only used the half because ,</li>
            <li> The only draw back are the price a hundred for it to last a month and half.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum RX Extra Strength certainly isn’t the least expensive product on the market, but after having tried cheaper options with very little improvement, I feel very strongly that Elite Serum RX</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I have no wrinkles, I do have thin skin, fine lines and rather pronounced dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cheap stuff like cocobutter and expensive stuff like Dermaheal.</li>
            <li> Not only has it helped my puffy and dark bags under my eyes but it has also helped my overall completion of my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It went on clear and dried in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> I realize 35 is not old by any means</li>
            <li> I haven’t been using it for that long</li>
            <li> I have been scared of needles for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t read anywhere that sluffing and peeling was to be expected, like in using a Retinol product or having a facial peel.  </li>
            <li> The product lasts a long time which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The products lasts a long time, I had called customer service once because I thought maybe I was applying the product incorrectly as it lasted for around 90 or so days.</li>
            <li> use the product twice daily combined with the Delfogo Wrinkle Eraser Cream (also by SkinPro) for roughly 2 months</li>
            <li> This serum has tightened these areas and the tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> After repeating this routine for a few nights, every morning I could visibly see a gradual difference, as far as an improvement in the appearance of my under-eye bags.</li>
            <li> No needles or strange procedures.</li>
            <li> so long my skin became immune to it.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It really helps to relax the crows feet that age is slowly bringing on around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My advice is try it give it time for me a little less 7 months before really noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> With her approval, I purchased with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 10 days of using the product, I started to notice a difference, nothing huge, I just felt &amp;#34;more awake&amp;#34; like my eyes looked less tired.  </li>
            <li> Now after daily use morning and at night before sleeping, I&#x27;m noticing the puffiness and darkness are much less and my confidence is back!</li>
            <li> Now, two and a half months later, the results are definitely noticeable!  </li>
            <li> Now that I’ve been using it for 3 months, I went from having bags under my eyes to only having slight imperfections that only I notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a month and a half the red areas next to my nose have just about disappeared and the texture of my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> other eye creams I tried were incredibly messy, and no matter how much soap I used never really seemed to come off my hands after I&#x27;d finished applying.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it once a day, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference - smoother skin with less wrinkles (without having made any other major changes).  </li>
            <li> This is a life saver, I really had bad puffy eyes with dark circles under them and some fine lines around the outer edge of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I really never did much of anything in the way of skincare other than plain soap and water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few drug store products and a few high end products but nothing has provided lasting results yet.  </li>
            <li> I hate seeing those fine lines creeping in around my eyes and mouth as much as anyone.</li>
            <li> There are other things i tried that never came close to the improvements i have a result of regular use of the serum.</li>
            <li> I need to look sharp and clear-eyed to convince them that I have what it takes to do the job properly.</li>
            <li> The serum itself is not oily or runny at all, so you don’t have to worry about it getting into your actual eye, which is a problem I’ve often had with other eye creams.</li>
            <li> not sure what made me splurge to buy this in the first place, as it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side for me when it comes to things like cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Well I actually gave up for a while trying to do something other than cosmetic surgery which was not an option for me.</li>
            <li> He was extremely helpful and actually procured a product I had been looking for.</li>
            <li> Other products hadn&#x27;t worked, fillers and the like are not an option, and under eye concealer is just so obvious.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has trouble with wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> The product moisturizes and goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Both are fantastic products, but incredibly expensive, and she was hoping for a serum that would do the same job at substantially less cost.  </li>
            <li> Underneath my eyes used to be bumpy and dry and that has cleared up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about droopy looking upper eye lids that hang real low with but black hollow circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I’ve tried several other products, from the Walgreens special to the “expensive” stuff at the mall, but nothing was quite tackling the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still relatively young, but as someone who routinely sacrifices sleep in favor of having fun at night, I&#x27;m already no stranger to puffy eyes in the morning, and I&#x27;ve been worried that my active social life would one day make me very, very sorry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t one single crow&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> My dark circles actually went away...</li>
            <li> but definitely the dark circles under eyes are gone.</li>
            <li> After spending what seems like a fortune on concealer to try and cover the dark, puffy bags under my eyes, I decided to try something different.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended I try a product to actually fix the dark circles instead of just cover them up</li>
            <li> My eyes are brighter, dark circles are lightening up and to my surprise the festoon bumps on my upper cheeks are beginning to diminish.  </li>
            <li> I never had an issue with dark circles until my last year in college.  </li>
            <li> I never knew that dark circles were something that you could suddenly develop.  </li>
            <li> and I could actually see the dark circles under my eyes in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were definitely not over night results, but over time the dark circles lessened.  </li>
            <li> The pockets of puffiness that were there were smaller and the circles below were not as dark.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and eye creams usually irritate my eyes or make me break out.</li>
            <li> the key to treating my dark circles is the Haloxyl in this product.  </li>
            <li> Specifically there were dark shadows around my eyes and it seemed as though I did not get enough sleep.  </li>
            <li> It also reverses the fluid build-up that occurs during sleep and causes puffy eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I had dark circles around my eyes for as long as I could remember and tried things that may have helped temporarily or just flat out</li>
            <li> I still have dark circles, and my lines haven&#x27;t lessened, and I&#x27;m well into my second tube.</li>
            <li> In one week I might pull a 12 hour day shift and then 2 days later a night shift, so my under eyes are always puffy and now I am noticing bags and dark</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs help with puffiness, dark circles, or wrinkles around their eyes.</li>
            <li> Anti-aging products can loose their luster when they are contaminated.</li>
            <li> to my amateur photography, it’s hard to notice a huge result, but you can probably see that it appears there is a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> only down side is that you have to keep using it</li>
            <li> This is worth every hard earned dime!!</li>
            <li> Not only do I have less lines around my eyes, but it also improved the appearance of the dark circles under my eyes that I never thought was a big deal until I saw the difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few days I began to see my crows feet smoothing out, which is something my other cream failed to do, and my eyes looked more awake and lifted.</li>
            <li> In a matter of a few weeks, I noticed a clear reduction in the dark regions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Babor makes a product just like it for less than 1/2 the price, if you just want a basic serum.</li>
            <li> felt a slight burn after initially putting on but it went away within minutes</li>
            <li> and I noticed less puffiness by the 2nd day of using it!  </li>
            <li> Not only did make a difference in my bags, but the crows feet beside my eyes eventually became less noticeable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and only ok and definitely not exceptional.</li>
            <li> The dark bags suddenly seemed to fade, the puffiness flattened out, and my wrinkles still to this day become harder and harder to see.</li>
            <li> That being said, there&#x27;s also nothing wrong with a little help from something that actually works pretty well for a specific problem you are having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, the one year anniversary of her diagnosis came up recently, and while I myself am not very good at picking out presents and such, her friend recommended that I get her Elite.  </li>
            <li> Like almost everyone here, I have tried numerous eye products for my dark circles and puffy eyes-including Preparation H!  </li>
            <li> It has now been a little over a month since I started using Elite Serum RX Extra Strength and the puffiness under my eyes</li>
            <li> , every night before I go to bed and in the morning before I put on my makeup, I put the serum around my eyes and even a little around the cracks above my lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while now, although I haven&#x27;t finished an entire syringe yet.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Elite Serum Rx because the other &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; eye creams and anti-wrinkle products I had tried either left my skin slightly greasy afterward or they reduced wrinkles without doing anything about my under-eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have tried a range of other products, including something made by Kiehl’s, to limited effect.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like I waited too late to start a beauty regimen, but the old motto “</li>
            <li> The dark circles aren’t completely gone, but they have noticeably lightened up and no more puffiness.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on this product + the Wrinkle Eraser Cream + the Neck Cream</li>
            <li> It arrived a few days later</li>
            <li> However, I have seen some changes in the last few years after going through menopause, and it was time to change something.</li>
            <li> It was a lesson learned and dollars spent.</li>
            <li> Used faithfully morning and night for over 2 months, I see absolutely no improvement in the puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but I have to be careful what I use.</li>
            <li> Even the occasional contact with the eye itself is relieved immediately with a few eye drops or water.  </li>
            <li> Tried numerous over the counter products and quite a few through websites.</li>
            <li> It only took a few weeks for me to see an improvement in the darkness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to apply too close to your eyelid.  </li>
            <li> My one small complaint is that the product is at a slightly higher price point than I am used to.</li>
            <li> It may work for some, but certainly not for me.  </li>
            <li> Other ingredients included in this product are red and green seaweed extracts, which treat skin roughness and dryness, and hyaluronic acid, which prevents the signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> I contacted skinpro and went through the steps I had done and the representative told me it was broken and a new one would be sent out as soon as possible but there would be a slight delay due to the holiday (labor day).</li>
            <li> As a person who has dealt with dark circles under my eyes for years, I&#x27;ve tried several different products to eliminate or at least reduce the problem.</li>
            <li> and I’ve tried various eye creams that did little to reduce the dark circles.</li>
            <li> After doing my research and deciding on trying Elite Serum Extra Strength, I figured that I would see at least a minor difference after maybe 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had puffiness under my eyes for years and as I get older it seems to be getting worse.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> almost creamy texture and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it might just eliminate your need for other under-eye products.</li>
            <li> I’ve personally tried a lot of eye creams that irritated my skin and failed to live up to their claims.</li>
            <li> A big disappointment after reading positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Why aren&#x27;t all other products out there using this type of delivery method?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with other items I&#x27;ve purchased from this company.</li>
            <li> Reordered from Cory who is representative for products and he was extremely helpful in maKing</li>
            <li> The box was accompanied by informational cards with directions, list of ingredients, recommendations, and other info.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 out of 5 because of the time it took to notice results, other than that</li>
            <li> I went from store to store&lt;br /&gt;in search of creams...and other products to  </li>
            <li> it on your finger,  I was only taking a little bit spreading a little bit  over 2 eyes...</li>
            <li> Take my word for it... but also check the other tons of reviews..  and user testimonies.</li>
            <li> The customer service people are prompt in returning calls and extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> After trying some of the other products on the market, I didn&#x27;t think anything was going to work.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve been struggling with a mixture of setting powders, concealers, and other anti-wrinkle moisturizing products, do yourself a favor and order this.</li>
            <li> At  first I was skeptical whether it would do anything for my problem areas.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx seems to surpass any other product I have used in reducing my puffiness.</li>
            <li> I find the value for the money is on par with some of the other eye creams/gels/serums on the market.  </li>
            <li> The other 2 are SKI II and Guerlain</li>
            <li> so I checked into the other products from SkinPro and opted for the Elite Serum Rx.  </li>
            <li> I am now going to shop for their other skin products to see what they offer.</li>
            <li> Still no miracles in any of the other claimed areas, but I&#x27;m continuing to use it for under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> He seemed extremely knowledgeable about all Skin Pro&#x27;s products and was helpful in setting up a shipping schedule that will work for me.</li>
            <li> Based on other&#x27;s reviews, I bought this product for Mother&#x27;s Day for her to try out, because she&#x27;s my mom</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but gave it a try.</li>
            <li> within a few days I received...a few days later I saw results.</li>
            <li> She carries the SkinMedica line and had me try a few different products totaling a few hundred bucks</li>
            <li> It is a clear serum with the only con being that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> the years, from working so much I can often look tired and have a few lines underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with dark circles and puffiness around my eyes for years, due to the nature of my job and sleep schedule.</li>
            <li> so I backed down to every other day</li>
            <li> If you compare this price to other high end creams, its really not that expensive.</li>
            <li> With all the long nights I have in front of my computer I often look like a mess, so I have heavy bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable in comparison to the other extraordinarily expensive serums she was using.  </li>
            <li> Results will be seen after at least 3 weeks, that is when  I started seeing small visual differences brighter skin,the eye area less wrinkled and spots definitely faded.</li>
            <li> Just pump a little bit of serum out of the syringe and onto your finger, applying it where necessary, and go about doing whatever else you usually do with your face.</li>
            <li> For a while now , I have been in need for a product to minimize the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horribly dark bags under my eyes, puffiness, and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have been battling issues with dark circles and bags under my eyes for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from dark circles in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have festoons which really require laser treatment.  </li>
            <li> but there I was, with dark circles.  </li>
            <li> In fact, when I started to get bags and dark circles under my eyes that my makeup wouldn’t hide, I thought I was going to have to get Botox done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in puffiness, no so much dark circles yet, but I know that takes time.</li>
            <li> When I wore my contacts I felt like dark eyes was all people could see.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The dark bags are gone and her wrinkles have thinned out a lot.  </li>
            <li> 2009 I had theses bags and dark shadows...</li>
            <li> Dark circles underneath them.  </li>
            <li> I’ve been doing a lot of research on the internet on how to reduce the severity of the dark circle under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have been using product for two months and have eliminated dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> We should all pay attention to what we put on our faces, especially around the delicate eye regions.</li>
            <li> I have constantly been swindled with products that claim to do what this one does, all of which claimed one hundred percent satisfaction, but have found that they are not nearly as effective.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles looked like something out of a Quentin Tarantino movie and the wrinkles and saggy skin were just hideous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only in my late 20&#x27;s, but a decade of stress and sleep deprivation has resulted in premature crow&#x27;s feet and bags under my eyes that makeup is no longer covering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and suffer with dark circles rather than wrinkles and puffiness</li>
            <li> I’ve also seen a noticeable decrease in the dark circles and bags I have become so accustomed to.</li>
            <li> I also work graveyard shifts and it seem like no matter what remedy I try, I cannot get rid of the dark schedules under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes since I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> I had a decrease in eye puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles and eye puffiness are now almost non existent.  </li>
            <li> , I noticed my crow’s feet begin to fade, and even the dark spots under and around my eyes begin to lighten!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this twice a day until it was gone I could tell no difference in dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo434KDZUDLOJC]]I had used Elite Serum for about three months and had seen some improvement in the dark, puffy circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> While a lot of the puffiness was gone, there were still dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Helped my dark circles</li>
            <li> is almost gone while the dark circles continue to fade.</li>
            <li> But, I’ve got crows-feet and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I’ve always been self-conscious about the unsightly dark circles that were beneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> It had diminished dark areas, and gave me an all over glow around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My dark circles have also lightened up and I knew it was working when two people asked me what I was using.</li>
            <li> But it has done nothing for dark circles, puffiness or softening wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Definitely NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago I noticed dark circles and puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> that moment on I’ve been on the search for a product that would reverse signs of aging and rid my eye and forehead area of dark spots, wrinkles, and bags.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Lightens Dark Circles</li>
            <li> I requested at least 60 days to review this product because a week or two is not nearly enough time to see if skincare is showing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyways I&#x27;m anemic, which is an iron deficiency, so when I&#x27;m not up on my iron intake my eyes are dark and puffy.</li>
            <li> But let me say when I use this, it conceals my puffy dark eyes the minute I put it on.</li>
            <li> , it can seem expensive versus drug store product; however, it lasts a long time and amounts used are modest.  </li>
            <li> I am a young looking 60 plus woman but have noticed a problem with TIRED eyes.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid is one of the newest injectable facial treatment gels designed to slow and hide the effects of aging.</li>
            <li> Totally oil-free and no caked or thick feeling either.</li>
            <li> I break out easily, have had terrible dark spots, dull skin and have recently begun developing the early signs of wrinkles as well.</li>
            <li> and I think if you started using it at an even younger age it would literally slow down what the hands of time does a woman&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> The puffiness has gone down and the dark circles are lighter than what they were when I started using the product.</li>
            <li> Dark spot products never diminished the dark spots and products that were supposed to brighten my skin typically made me break out.</li>
            <li> but they did go down some.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;the puffery is gone down about 85%.and</li>
            <li> It works as claimed, breaking down and flushing out the under eye area.  </li>
            <li> And it’s not greasy at all, no shine to powder down.</li>
            <li> I ran out for a couple of weeks after a credit card snaffu , had to resort to using other &#x27;sub-par&#x27; products, and my eyes showed it!</li>
            <li> I have less puffiness, dark circles but also</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for already 3 weeks and don&#x27;t think my dark circles got any less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Upon looking in the mirror and seeing some slight lines of aging, swelling &amp; dark marks around my eyes I decided to do some research through trial and error and discovered</li>
            <li> Simply depress the plunger and have a small bead drop onto your finger.</li>
            <li> All those other products, feeling heavy and overly creamy on your skin?</li>
            <li> They are looking less hoodish and owlish looking.</li>
            <li> the wrinkles around the eyes are less now too.</li>
            <li> It took about a week and a half for me to start seeing results, but I did start seeing results.</li>
            <li> plumping my skin, and giving it a less crepey appearance.</li>
            <li> I still have to use concealer but a lot less of it.  </li>
            <li> I  apply with a Qtip (this always uses less product and doesn&#x27;t pull on thin-skinned areas).  </li>
            <li> But with this, I notice all of my puffiness gone within a half hour.  </li>
            <li> I noticed immediate results, less puffiness, less lines.  </li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t disappeared but they are certainly less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Slight bags and puffiness were noticeably improved.</li>
            <li> The lip lines are noticeably less, even the deeper lines.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be making a slight difference around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I used this for a month and a half</li>
            <li> Now my crease is much less visible after the use for 6 months.  </li>
            <li> In less then 6 weeks my lines are 75% improved.</li>
            <li> After an initial interview, they told me they would need me to write fake reviews for various products.</li>
            <li> Lines are less, and gone is a lot of that crepey look under the eye.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just thicker than your typical serum.  </li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes were less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize you could get such serious eye wrinkles in your thirties.</li>
            <li> It really made my face look less tired and stressed because my worn-out eyes were slowly vanishing.</li>
            <li> Besides, Elite Serum RX - Extra Strength isn&#x27;t painfully injected, my face isn&#x27;t stiff, my saggy eye lids are firmer, my sensitive sense of smell adores the odorless scent, my crow&#x27;s feet have taken flight, my bags are folded and flat, and my raccoon eyes are extinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basically, it was for the little puffiness beneath my eyes as well as the dark circles.</li>
            <li> After years of trying an infinite number of well-known beauty products to disappear the dark puffy circles under my eyes - with little to no results at all, I was hesitant about purchasing this one, but after reading the reviews it got I decided to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> It was going down a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> No more conditioners Elite Serum is made with a cosmetic base consisting only of red and green seaweed extracts and pure hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> After finally receiving this product it is no good.  </li>
            <li> my philosophy was \\&quot;Don&#x27;t mess with something that&#x27;s working\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes looks firm and the dark circles were gone after about a week.</li>
            <li> In the explination of this product the seller states &amp;#34;eliminates puffiness&amp;#34; that unfortunitally was not true for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried plenty of drugstore methods to deal with the bags and dark circles under my eyes, but it all either didn&#x27;t work at all or stopped working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I would even go tanning a few times a week because I felt like if I was tan, the lines were less noticeable,</li>
            <li> The concealer I used was not enough to reduce my tired, puffy eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have genetic dark circles and advancing age and health problems have only made them worse.</li>
            <li> Hate is probably too strong a word</li>
            <li> I was a little embarrassed to tell people I was using an wrinkle fighting serum</li>
            <li> The formula has been upgraded, so you should start seeing some results a little faster.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to give it a little longer?  </li>
            <li> They all had little to no results at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while now and notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little patience so stick with it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this 2 times a day for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I don’t usually write reviews about health and beauty products, but I like to give credit where credit is due.  </li>
            <li> The little puffiness that remained was gone too.</li>
            <li> and it stung a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Elite Serum RX for a little bit over a month now</li>
            <li> Too expensive and didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Where other products would fail after a few weeks, this stuff made a major difference in just over a month.</li>
            <li> I know that everyone reacts differently to facial products, but I highly recommend using this one—you won’t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes when I smile have become so bad.  </li>
            <li> Everything I tried was itchy, or too oily, dried my skin out, etc.</li>
            <li> Everyday I&#x27;d see the smallest improvements in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Cut to a few months ago when I started using Elite Serum Rx.  </li>
            <li> been using it for few months but</li>
            <li> but when a few people thought I was 35</li>
            <li> I was bummed as this is not a cheap Target product.  </li>
            <li> and they noticed the results and commented on my eyes within a few days of use.</li>
            <li> few months ago I discovered I had bags under my eyes....</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> so I took my kids’ advice and started looking online for something heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving it another few months just to see if it would do anything, and it did.</li>
            <li> A few days after that my skin turned leathery and started to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few people commented on this</li>
            <li> I noticed this after a few applications.</li>
            <li> It added a literal few seconds to my nightly brushing my teeth, etc.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes looks firm, and my face has a glow.</li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy</li>
            <li> I have been using the Elite Serum for a few months now</li>
            <li> did jam after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted over $100 on products that don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> but Elite Serum Rx had a few ingredients that peaked my interest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yesterday on 9/23/13, I received a call from a representative from Skin Pro International explaining to me the situation with the broken syringe and their steps to correct the problem so it didn&#x27;t happened again.</li>
            <li> I even ran out of my elite serum and didn&#x27;t replace it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying a few over the counter products and even went in to my dermatoligist for a skin care consult.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, not too watery.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy; it feels like it is nourishing my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother using anymore because it&#x27;s just a waste.</li>
            <li> This product dried the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and the lines around my eye are all but disappeared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll save you the trouble: just go with Elite Serum Rx and end the search today.</li>
            <li> The one part missing from my regimen was an eye treatment.  </li>
            <li> I detest heavy, oily creams, but I want substance, too.</li>
            <li> then I see the difference after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a few products off Amazon before, none of which were anything to write home about or even write a review</li>
            <li> Instead of tired looking eyes, I look about 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of a lot of the anti-aging stuff out there.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got an ugly crease under my right eye from goggles.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of months, they are significantly less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of these products, but a friend recommended it, and since I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for something to deal with the lines and the circles and all the stuff I find at Walmart and other big box stores (even Sephora!)</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it&#x27;s expensive and since I use it on other areas of my face</li>
            <li> At first, I was a little shell shocked at the price, but the saying \\&quot;you get what you pay</li>
            <li> Now she looks almost just like she did right before she got sick.  </li>
            <li> I made a joke about my bad luck; inheriting dark circles under my eyes from our mother when told me she has been using a new product for dark circles / under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> Using Elite Serum Rx not only helped reduce my eye wrinkles, it made the skin around my eyes softer and took away the dark circles around my eyes that sometimes made me look like a scary raccoon.</li>
            <li> Took care of my tired eyes and minimal dark circles.</li>
            <li> I tried another product (Loreal Eye Defense) as it supposedly contained some new thing that was just the thing to get rid of my annoying facial lines.  </li>
            <li> After using the serum for a few weeks, I began to notice subtle changes in the puffiness and dark circles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> So, I buckled down and made the purchase, not hoping for a miracle, but at least wanting some help with this problem area of mine.</li>
            <li> Also, this product leaves a weird residue on the skin that later starts to leave little flakes around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are gone!!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this to anyone who is serious about getting rid of dark or puffy circles.</li>
            <li> Price point is not too bad, but if you really like it, they have a Replenishment program on their website that is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything bad to say.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the wrinkles...</li>
            <li> I usually have puffiness in the morning, maybe from allergies or just hereditary...</li>
            <li> even a small widget......after you put on the cream ...</li>
            <li> even small lines over the eye bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stopped spending all that extra money on expensive eye creams that claim to help but do nothing for aging skin.</li>
            <li> and I started to notice that my crows feet actually looked worse!</li>
            <li> The puffiness is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it comes in  small tube so that it is easy-to-carry in my purse</li>
            <li> and  I can already see the faint lines I was so worried about starting to fade.</li>
            <li> About 8 months ago I saw on a website not sure which before and after photos of a gentleman of about 70 years of age, I think.</li>
            <li> In contrast to similar anti-aging skin creams, this serum seems to be on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After that failed attempt at my ultimate goal, I almost lost hope.</li>
            <li> but I just do a small drop when I wake up and in the evening before bed.</li>
            <li> A lot of other manufacturers say to apply &amp;#34;small amounts&amp;#34; and they are just talking, but in this case they really mean it!</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother with fewer little lines (under the eyes) and less crepiness (ugly word) above my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I hate to spend money on lotions and stuff for myself, but I’m actually considering getting some- just to see if it works on me the same.</li>
            <li> I mean real dark until I bought this serum.</li>
            <li> These are the same people who, just a few months ago, were asking me what was wrong, why I looked so tired all the time.</li>
            <li> After using Elite Serum RX twice a day for six weeks, I can&#x27;t see any noticeable change except that my heriditary dark circles seem to be worse.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect any miracles in those areas anyway, so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;TO TIRED DARK CIRCLES AND THE COLLAGEN</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ridiculous amount of high-end, expensive ($100+) products that promise to help with numerous skin issues but never saw results.</li>
            <li> I cannot see any difference after using this product, it is so very expensive with no results, I am going to try to s3end it back a waste odf money.</li>
            <li> I could hardly wait to get it in the mail.</li>
            <li> To say the least nothing worked to my favor</li>
            <li> &quot; style applicator means I&#x27;m not wasting product, and I&#x27;m not getting my hands dirty and possibly contaminating the product.</li>
            <li> I like using it under my makeup too especially in this cold weather.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t bothered by the feeling of it on my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> it’s never too late to start” is burned in my mind.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to night owls like me who can no longer stay up late and look like it.</li>
            <li> me at least)</li>
            <li> I have been using elite serum now for at least 6 months</li>
            <li> At least it looks that way to me.</li>
            <li> After receiving it I was expecting at least something, anything to happen.</li>
            <li> Give it at least a week</li>
            <li> This is not good or usual in the African-American community.</li>
            <li> I look at least 40.</li>
            <li> Squinting in front of a computer screen all day (at least 12 hours) has wreaked havoc on the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing how they are slowly decreasing.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t tacky or thick .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best-selling eye treatment on Amazon, which has to mean something.</li>
            <li> will mean I have to buy again in a week or so or reduce usage.</li>
            <li> Expensive    Slow to improve dark circles    </li>
            <li> It also uses a high concentration of pharmaceutical grade ingredients as well as seaweed extract base.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my eyes and am so far disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Even subtly.  </li>
            <li> The under-eye situation was seriously improved.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m ecstatic and have nothing but praise for this little syringe.</li>
            <li> Simple to apply and doesn’t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum works on the same areas, without having to worry about any painful injections.</li>
            <li> until I smile, and then that area crinkles terribly.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d be wasting my money trying yet another anti-aging serum, it seemed like every other I tried did not have the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye product to basically help with brightening my eyes, puffiness, the dark dark circles that I hate.</li>
            <li> I used to have low self esteem problems due to the fact of how horrible my eyes looked.</li>
            <li> and I was one day too late!</li>
            <li> My mom suffers from dark under eye shadows.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;that were very hard to get rid of...</li>
            <li> Not only were the dreadful dark circles gone, but I also noticed the skin around my eyes was smoother too.  </li>
            <li> As you can see in the photos, my healing process was very slow but eventually</li>
            <li> I have tried concealers to hide but got tired of doing it.</li>
            <li> However before I jump to that I wanted to see if there was anything in the market  to refresh my tired eyes.  </li>
            <li> definitely during the day it&#x27;s annoying.  </li>
            <li> Although the look imitates a syringe, it is actually a cream base.</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;re begging me for my secret.</li>
            <li> but the syringe was broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product, but not surprised.</li>
            <li> In fact, I’ve become so fed up with comments from friends and co-workers who tell me that I “look tired” that I decided once and for all to do something about it.</li>
            <li> I usually avoid anything like a moisturizer because I’m so afraid of breaking out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products before that burned my eye area or dried out my skin so badly that my lines looked worse.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 7 months now and have seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of my past experiences, and I was afraid of wasting money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker and have developed nasty lines around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, especially for the money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> EXPENSIVE RIP OFF!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry customer service...</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel guilty about using a face product.</li>
            <li> ill keep using it until its done but seen no results</li>
            <li> After using about ten days I started to itch terribly.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> and though it was expensive, I figured I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Elite Serum RX is an expensive item</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> About year ago, I started noticing some faint lines around the corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Then I came across a NYTimes articles about fake reviews.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this had done nothing for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The fact is, it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to SkinPro products!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I was unsure of Elite Serum RX&#x27;s long-lasting results, I admit being a tad-bit skeptical of the price, yet, that didn&#x27;t deter me from adding it to my Amazon wish list.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical but bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> I was still skeptical and continued using it for another month.</li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> With some other products that I have tried, it would leave a shine on my face and made me look like I had terrible skin.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the Pro Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is already January 06 , and even after having received the products less be billed twice for products not received , and have used a product that damaged my skin , I have not had a refund of what I paid .&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t feel like it helps my terrible dark undereye circles at all...</li>
            <li> it rolled cold serum over the bags.</li>
            <li> but I was afraid it was a placebo.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to shop a remedy.  </li>
            <li> I hate looking tired and haggard.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The con with this serum is that its way too expensive but it works!</li>
            <li> Needless to say this works!</li>
            <li> When I learned about Elite Serum Rx, I was very skeptical and thought it was another dud</li>
            <li> I was really in a bad place with my self-confidence, not wanting to go out some days and even bailing on plans with friends and family because of the way I looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike Botox, this Serum does not require painful injections, which I have always been apprehensive about.  </li>
            <li> I was frustrated from wasting money and was reluctant to try another brand.</li>
            <li> I was sick of baggy eyes and crows feet.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very disappointed .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered products off line before and when I get them, I&#x27;m disappointed to find out they have fragrance as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I was incredibly disappointed with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so this was very disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> I used to hate to look at myself in the mirror, and now I&#x27;m checking my reflection all the time because I just can&#x27;t believe those circles are gone.</li>
            <li> God awful ugly bags.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very bad condition...</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> oh, what a horrible feeling that was!</li>
            <li> I have awful lines around my eyes that started to appear as soon as I hit 30.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product to get rid of those nasty lines that betray your age, you&#x27;ve found it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been searching for a product like Elite Serum RX for years, unfortunately all the products I&#x27;ve tried that claim to diminish fine lines around your eyes simply don&#x27;t work. Not to mention most products leave your skin oily and if you&#x27;re a woman like me that loves makeup applying makeup over the serum or cream just looks clumpy and unnatural, but I&#x27;m happy to admit Elite Serum RX really works! Not only do I have less lines around my eyes, but it also improved the appearance of the dark circles under my eyes that I never thought was a big deal until I saw the difference after using this product. Plus, no clumpy makeup. This product&#x27;s a must in every woman&#x27;s makeup bag!</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t do much, but all of a sudden my dark circles under my eyes started turning normal skin color.. I&#x27;m not even glorifying the results.. My dark circles actually went away... They seem more lifted and even toned as well. I started using it once every couple of days, and once I saw a change, I&#x27;m now using it every morning right after I get out of the shower.. I dab that under my eyes and on where people get &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; even though I don&#x27;t have any, then use a AH oil free moisturizer on the rest of my face...&lt;br /&gt;The con with this serum is that its way too expensive but it works!</li>
            <li> Really like this product. It erased wrinkles around my eyes and reduced the puffines.  Will order it again.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I think it is working to eliminate puffiness.</li>
            <li> With all the long nights I have in front of my computer I often look like a mess, so I have heavy bags under my eyes. I am pretty impressed with this product. I still need to make it a goal to get more sleep, however use this on the bags on my eyes has helped vastly improve the condition of under my eyes. This product is great for getting rid of puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st product I&#x27;ve tried from SkinPro and I&#x27;m pleased.    Pros: No fragrance    Clear Glides on smooth    Absorbs quickly    No sticky residue    Treats all under eye issues    Cons: Expensive    Slow to improve dark circles    If you accidentally use too much, the excess rolls off your skin    All in all, a good purchase. I notice improvements around my eyes which makes me happy. Price point is not too bad, but if you really like it, they have a Replenishment program on their website that is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  I&#x27;ve been using for 2 months.</li>
            <li> For a while now , I have been in need for a product to minimize the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.I have tried every home remedy from soaked tea bags , cucumbers,potato skins, and almost every eye cream there is.To say the least nothing worked to my favor and I have been using foundations and concealers which just hides my problem.While looking for another eye treatment product, I came across this one the Elite Serum RX extra strength .I cannot express how SATISFIED and happy I am with this product.&lt;br /&gt; when applying it is very light and soft .Also it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry like most products.After using this product for a few weeks , I have notice that the circles and a few wrinkles that was under my eyes has been clearing up really nice.I even feel more confident now when I leave my house without any makeup on to cover my raccoon eyes.I just love this product and will definitely &lt;br /&gt;continue using it.</li>
            <li> As a person who has dealt with dark circles under my eyes for years, I&#x27;ve tried several different products to eliminate or at least reduce the problem. However, most products I&#x27;ve used have had minimal results and I was less than enthusiastic about them. Fortunately, I came across the Elite Serum - RX from Skin Pro. It caught my attention because it was lab tested and contains medical grade ingredients, which seemed more legitimate than the majority of serums and creams that I&#x27;ve come across in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Elite Serum, I saw results pretty quickly. In fact, after applying it underneath my eyes, I could feel somewhat of a tightening sensation within 10 minutes and could tell that it was working. Within about two weeks, I could noticeably tell that the dark circles under my eyes had diminished considerably. Besides that, I just looked more refreshed and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consequently, I can say for certain that the Elite Serum has undoubtedly worked for me. I also really liked the fact that it&#x27;s in a syringe, which makes it easy to carry around and apply. The only minor drawback for me was the price, which Is a little higher than similar products. However, I found that the results are well worth it and I would recommend this to anyone who is serious about getting rid of dark or puffy circles.</li>
            <li> I turned 38 and started freaking-out about aging gracefully. I never heard of Elite Serum Rx until I started shopping at Amazon. I loved the results and how smoothly it went on around my eyes. Basically, it was for the little puffiness beneath my eyes as well as the dark circles. Now after daily use morning and at night before sleeping, I&#x27;m noticing the puffiness and darkness are much less and my confidence is back! Not only has it helped my puffy and dark bags under my eyes but it has also helped my overall completion of my skin. I&#x27;ve tried so many products with little results. I&#x27;m staying with Elite Serum Rx. You really get the most out of your money. And for me personally it was the best $90 I have ever spent. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older with more responsibilities and obligations, I get less rest and my undereyes get even darker now.I have tried concealers to hide but got tired of doing it.So I did try some undereye products that didn&#x27;t improve the darkness under my eyes Until my mother recommended I try Elite Serum Extra Strength.She had been using it for 6 months and noticed a change in her undereyes.So I purchased the product and for the past month, I have seen a significant change in my undereyes even when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep.They are looking less hoodish and owlish looking.People at work been telling my eyes looking brighter and it is a relief not to have to use concealer anymore.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. The product instantly reverses the signs of aging. I use Elite Serum because its established reputation for reversing the signs of aging, its a light weight consistency and it has also toned the skins around my eye. It also has some yummy ingredients in it like seaweed extract, oxygen and various other good nutrients. I have less puffiness, dark circles but also the wrinkles around the eyes are less now too. i attribute this all to the product. There are other things i tried that never came close to the improvements i have a result of regular use of the serum. This is just what I wanted. I&#x27;m so surprised too at how the winkles can really sneak in. I am getting more mature and am very aware of the impact of getting older used to have on my skin. I told my friends about the product when they asked me about my youthful appearance. They told me they wanted to purchase some too. I have quite very impressed thus far.</li>
            <li> The serum is a very light, clear liquid. It is odorless and quite watery. There is no feeling of grease, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen a product that skin can absorbs so quickly. When apply this serum under the eyes, the skin absorbs it fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is certainly one of the most effective cosmetics when it comes to preventing the natural aging of skin.</li>
            <li> The Elite Serum product works wonderfully for the relief of puffy eyes.  I had tried numerous other products prior to finding out about the Elite Serum.  Now,...I would never use anything else.  Try it every morning and at bedtime and you should see favorable result in a matter of a week or 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it can seem expensive versus drug store product; however, it lasts a long time and amounts used are modest.  Easy to use, and no side affects.</li>
            <li> After about 1 month of use, I have seen no visible improvement.  Dark  circles and fine eye lines remain.  I will be trying another product.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the wrinkles...but definitely the dark circles under eyes are gone. Skin is looking bright and refreshed. Have been using this for many months, and will continue to use it. Very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx - Extra Strength is the greatest thing that I&#x27;ve found in my trek to discover effective eye care. I&#x27;ve had horribly dark bags under my eyes, puffiness, and wrinkles. I felt 30 years older than I actually was. It was truly getting to me. After a while, I realized that I had truly lost the majority of my confidence. I had also hit a bump in the road in trying to find some sort of eye cream that may help me out. Everything I tried was itchy, or too oily, dried my skin out, etc. I felt like I didn&#x27;t have an option but to live with these imperfections anymore. It was then that a friend told me to check out Elite Serum Rx. I was skeptical because of my past experiences, and I was afraid of wasting money. I am so so SO beyond happy I found this! It completely changed my life. I saw instant results. The dark bags suddenly seemed to fade, the puffiness flattened out, and my wrinkles still to this day become harder and harder to see. I recommend this 100%!!</li>
            <li> I have used a number of eye creams over the years; with varying results. I am fairly patient, and I realize that repairing damaged tissue like the bags around my eyes is not an overnight process. Still, I need to see some improvement--preferably sooner--when I am using a new product. I was impressed with Elite Serum Rx for just that reason. I could see visible improvement in a fairly short time span. More importantly, I saw continued improvement a month into using it.&lt;br /&gt;I am in sales, so my appearance will tell my customers things that I may not. I need to look sharp and clear-eyed to convince them that I have what it takes to do the job properly. More than that, I need to look young and fit, well-rested and energetic as opposed to old and weary. My eyes are what my potential clients see the most of, and judge me the most by. This product worked to help me look younger and healthier, and considering the fact that my appearance affects my sales success rate, that made it worth every penny that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I have been battling issues with dark circles and bags under my eyes for years. I&#x27;ve tried getting more sleep, the cucumber treatment, and a variety of cosmetic products. I&#x27;d heard great things about Elite Serum, but before I decided to try it, a friend told me about Elite Serum Rx, which is supposed to be the same thing, but even better. I must say, I am very pleased with the results. At first, I was a little shell shocked at the price, but the saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; is definitely true. I&#x27;ve spent way more than this on many other beauty products combined with no results, so I decided it was worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many other eye creams I tried were incredibly messy, and no matter how much soap I used never really seemed to come off my hands after I&#x27;d finished applying. This \\&quot;pen\\&quot; style applicator means I&#x27;m not wasting product, and I&#x27;m not getting my hands dirty and possibly contaminating the product. Why aren&#x27;t all other products out there using this type of delivery method?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I decided to buy this serum after reading the reviews. The serum is perfume free which I like and absorbs well when I apply at night. I like using it under my makeup too especially in this cold weather. After using it for a month, I can say I have seen some lines disappear but not all. I will definitely need to use it longer before I can see all my wrinkles go away . The con is the price tag ,which is twice to what I am used to spending on anti aging products. If it meets my expectations then I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally be able to purchase this product.  I have read fair reviews on this product.  After finally receiving this product it is no good.  This product did nothing for eyes at all.  I will never purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I can get the same effect by applying egg whites around my eyes.  I spent a lot of money on this product + the Wrinkle Eraser Cream + the Neck Cream and it has been similar to applying water to my face, eyes and neck.  Absolutely nothing happened!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from dark circles in my eyes. I mean real dark until I bought this serum. It took about a week and a half for me to start seeing results, but I did start seeing results. It&#x27;s like it completely eliminated my dark circles. Everyday I&#x27;d see the smallest improvements in my eyes. The biggest was after 2 full weeks of using it, I think with consistent use that the product will keep my dark circles from reappearing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Elite Serum Rx for almost 2yrs now to prevent the fine lines and wrinkles from developing around my eyes, mouth and forehead area. Initially I was asked to review the product by the PR team at Skin Pro.  After I researched the active ingredient hyaluronic acid and read some great things about it, I decided it was definitely something I wanted to try. I was pleasantly surprised at my results after using the product for only one month,  I continued to re-order it and this Serum has been a staple in my skin care regimen ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier this year I underwent Upper Blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery) because I had very saggy eyelids and they were affecting my vision. I didn’t think the surgery was such a big deal because all the photos I’ve seen everyone was all healed and wearing makeup after their 8th day.  Well, on my 8th day I was so bruised and barely opening my eyes.  Who knew that I was a bruiser!  The only thing the Doctor told me to use was Arnica Gel, I was using it day and night but clearly it wasn’t working.  So I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started looking through my stash of to see if I had anything that might work. I picked up my Elite Serum and said humm.... I wonder if this would work on healing bruises.  So I started using it on my bruises 3x’s a day (morning/noon/night), I just let the Elite Serum work its magic on healing and repairing my skin.  As you can see in the photos, my healing process was very slow but eventually by day 20 my bruises have almost disappeared.  I was all cleared to wear makeup and with a little concealer underneath the eyes, I was good to go.  Who knew Elite Serum also had healing properties as well!  I will definitely recommend Elite Serum to everyone and I will continue using this product as long as it&#x27;s on the market!</li>
            <li> Not a miracle - but close to it!  After six months of regular use the droopiness of my upper eyelids improved and the lower lids were much smoother.  The after sales support is also excellent, with on line replies to queries answered quickly and effectively.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> For the last 2 years I&#x27;ve been dealing with brain cancer.  The treatments that I&#x27;ve gone through have made my body feel and look 10 years older than my very young 31.  My radiation and chemo treatments have made my skin like paper.  I really thought that I would never look healthy again.  Cut to a few months ago when I started using Elite Serum Rx.  My skin is no longer my enemy.  Actually, my skin is now better than I&#x27;ve ever imagined it could be.  I feel and look as though I am a new man.  Elite Serum Rx has made it to the short list of things I need to make my recovery a full one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with other items I&#x27;ve purchased from this company. I love their line, everything seems to work for me. And getting them on Amazon is so much cheaper than getting them anywhere else, I&#x27;m not even sure if these products are even available anywhere else. But the eye serum is one of my favorite products, it keeps my eyes glowing. I get compliments from people about my pretty eyes everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve received dispensers that don&#x27;t work.  You press the plunger, but nothing comes out.  One would think that as much as this product costs that the manufacturer would provide dispensers that actually work.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> After spending what seems like a fortune on concealer to try and cover the dark, puffy bags under my eyes, I decided to try something different.  A friend recommended I try a product to actually fix the dark circles instead of just cover them up and while I didn&#x27;t want to spend money on something that didn&#x27;t work, I did some research and found Elite Serum RX.  The reviews were great and the results I got after a month were even better.  Not only were the dreadful dark circles gone, but I also noticed the skin around my eyes was smoother too.  This really is a great product to use and is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and. 100% original because I bought from its web site as well. Both r same&lt;br /&gt;Happy with it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Been using for a month and seeing wrinkles under eyes stating to decrease  and to anyone worried about wrinkled should definitely give this fabulous product a try. Reordered from Cory who is representative for products and he was extremely helpful in maKing sure I was picking the perfect products for all my concerns. I cannot wait for my new order</li>
            <li> I am a young looking 60 plus woman but have noticed a problem with TIRED eyes.  Unfortunately I have festoons which really require laser treatment.  However before I jump to that I wanted to see if there was anything in the market  to refresh my tired eyes.  I came across Elite serum and have been using it for about a month. My eyes are brighter, dark circles are lightening up and to my surprise the festoon bumps on my upper cheeks are beginning to diminish.  I sincerely believe that this is an excellent product for the delicate eye area.  No matter what your age, no matter what your problem, give it a try.  How great to see a productthat accurately details its ingredients..</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I may be using it more liberally than I should but I notice other areas (around the mouth, frown lines) that have shown great improvement.  This stuff works!</li>
            <li> I never had an issue with dark circles until my last year in college.  I was about 25, studying for my masters and working 2 jobs to pay for it all.  I never knew that dark circles were something that you could suddenly develop.  I thought you either have them or you don&#x27;t.  Hereditary, or born with them, whatever, but there I was, with dark circles.  They didn&#x27;t bother me at first.  I&#x27;ve never been one to really fuss with makeup.  I didn&#x27;t even bother to try and conceal them until I noticed that they had gone from \\&quot;dark\\&quot; to a purplish - blue hue.  I bought some under eye concealer and covered them.  No biggie.  But I am getting married in a few months and we just got our engagement pics back and I could actually see the dark circles under my eyes in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elite Serum Rx-Extra Strength was recommended to me and I&#x27;ve been impressed with the results.  They were definitely not over night results, but over time the dark circles lessened.  It didn&#x27;t completely get rid of them, but I don&#x27;t think any product can.  It Elite Serum Rx did make it so that my circles are concealed with concealer.  I&#x27;m hoping that by my wedding they will barely be noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the Pro Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is already January 06 , and even after having received the products less be billed twice for products not received , and have used a product that damaged my skin , I have not had a refund of what I paid .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emphasize that I was doubly injured because I paid for 3 products , the tax paid in the amount of 100 % of these 3 products , I only received a tube , and this still only used the half because , wrinkled skin all of my eyelids .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pocket was injured and my skin too and you gave a damn about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Elite Serum for about 8 months and I am completelly sactisfied with the results.  After trying many other top of the line eye products only Elite Serum gave me a rested, young look I never had archieved before.  The most incredible result was with my dark circles. I had always had them but after using Elite Serum for about 2 weeks they were gone! No concealers needed. That for me is life changing. I also noticed wrinkles reduction, no puffness around my eyes and just an overall great apearence.  And now with the extra strenght version I get double the benefits.  Thank you SkinPro for creating such an amazing product! I cannot live without it. I totally recoment this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My dark circles got much lighter and I&#x27;m using it just for two weeks, can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Elite Serum for a couple of years now, and while it is not a miracle, it is the best eye product I have found for puffiness. And I have tried many. I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Joanne Pittman, Georgetown, Tx.</li>
            <li> Review By: Mom/(Gift Recipient) The Good Goods: I found the Elite Serum RX (Extra Strength) to be a very useful product. First off, the packaging is nice- sturdy, attractive box, and the syringe is protected and secured in a spongey packing material. The box was accompanied by informational cards with directions, list of ingredients, recommendations, and other info. I found the product simple to use. I do feel it is important to read their easy instructions, or you could do the wrong maneuver and break it. Read the intel though, and the product expels easy-peasy, and I felt in control of the amount used. The product did not have any kind of overwhelming scent to speak of. I first tried it around one eye, and on the back of one hand, just to see if I would have any unfavorable reaction. It all worked out just fine. I wasn&#x27;t bothered by the feeling of it on my delicate skin. My skin just felt refreshed, healthier, and better moisturized...plumping my skin, and giving it a less crepey appearance. For many years, I worked in a specialty store&#x27;s dept. next to the cosmetic&#x27;s area. Their professionals frequently gave me samples of the various eye creams and serums. Having tried so many from various vendors, (and most with no, or unfortunate results) I found this Elite Serum RX outstanding in the genre. As such a teensy-weensy amount goes so far, one syringe should last a long time, if cared for as per the instructions. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I have used Elite Serum Rx-extra strength for three weeks, I have had no results. I will continue until, and see if there is any change.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx has changed the way I feel about myself.  I used to have low self esteem problems due to the fact of how horrible my eyes looked. I&#x27;m talking about droopy looking upper eye lids that hang real low with but black hollow circles under my eyes.  This is not a miracle product.  I&#x27;ve used 3 &amp;#34;syringes&amp;#34; but the difference has been noticeable.  I use it on my upper eye lids, which helped to tighten up the droop and under my eyes for the circles.  I still have to use concealer but a lot less of it.  I use it twice a day but I think I&#x27;m to the point where I can just use it at night now.  I also bought an under eye concealer that has caffeine so I use that in the morning too.</li>
            <li> I usually avoid anything like a moisturizer because I’m so afraid of breaking out. In fact, when I started to get bags and dark circles under my eyes that my makeup wouldn’t hide, I thought I was going to have to get Botox done.  But I decided to look for an oil-free cream first and found Elite Serum on Amazon.  I liked that it was non- comedogenic.  And when I tried it I liked the way it felt.  It wasn’t greasy and soaked right into my skin.  When I woke up the next morning I could see a difference under my eyes.  The pockets of puffiness that were there were smaller and the circles below were not as dark.  I’ve continued to use it and continue to see improvements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products to lighten up the dark rings under my eyes and nothing has worked. I hesitated to try Elite Serum RX Strength because it was a little pricey, but the reviews were really good, so I gave it a shot. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes since I have a collection of partially used products in my cabinet that didn&#x27;t work. But I have to say this product surprised me. Within a week, the dark areas had lightened up significantly and my skin looks younger and brighter. I used to hate to look at myself in the mirror, and now I&#x27;m checking my reflection all the time because I just can&#x27;t believe those circles are gone. It&#x27;s totally worth the price because it works. I&#x27;m very happy I bought it and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much to change the appearance of fine lines or dark circles.  Too expensive and didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Works great on wrinkles as long as you apply on daily basis.  Skip a day and wrinkles are back immediately.</li>
            <li> been using it for few months but no results  I previously used the original Elite Serum and that product showed some improvement.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review with the fact that I’m not a big expert on skin care, especially anything “age-defying”. I do not have lot of experience with anything for wrinkles because A. I am a man and B. I’m only 25...but when a few people thought I was 35 I knew I had to find a remedy. I realize 35 is not old by any means but it is still much older than my actual age and when I took a look in the mirror I noticed the crow’s feet around my eyes probably has something to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, I began searching for the remedy. I asked my fiancé if I could try some of her eye cream. She first had me try some by Sunday Riley. It was nice but I didn’t notice any difference even after 6 weeks of regular use so I began searching for something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across the Elite Serum Rx on a forum and so I quickly ordered from Amazon. It arrived a few days later and I began using the stuff religiously. Right off the bat, it felt really good on my skin. It’s not oily at all. I have really sensitive skin but I’ve been using Elite Serum for close to 3 months now and have never had any clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the serum for 3 months I’ve seen a HUGE difference in wrinkles around my eyes though. It really has smoothed out the crows feet and the bag lines under my eyes. I was a little embarrassed to tell people I was using an wrinkle fighting serum but friends have definitely noticed the difference. I’m a big fan of the Elite Serum Rx.</li>
            <li> This is easily one of the most effective creams I’ve ever applied in trying to get rid of the bags under my eyes. In a matter of a few weeks, I noticed a clear reduction in the dark regions. The skin around my eyes and on my entire face (I apply to my forehead and around the mouth too) in general just feels fresher and smoother since I’ve started using this serum, and it’s also very easy to apply. The serum itself is not oily or runny at all, so you don’t have to worry about it getting into your actual eye, which is a problem I’ve often had with other eye creams. I&#x27;m a contact lens wearer so anything that is runny and has the ability to get into my eyes is obviously a problem.  Between comfort and efficacy, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and eye creams usually irritate my eyes or make me break out. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of creams that claim to be oil free but usually aren&#x27;t. Elite Serum is the first serum I&#x27;ve ever used and I like it far better than creams.  It does have a thickness to it somewhat like a cream, but doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue. While it didn’t totally get rid of my deeper wrinkles, it helped smooth out my fine lines and get rid of the puffiness, not a huge change in my dark circles, yet though. I haven’t been using it for that long and I’m excited to see if it continues to help.</li>
            <li> I needed something to get rid of the lines around my eyes and mouth, but Botox wasn’t an option. Me and needles simply don’t mix. I have been scared of needles for as long as I can remember. Elite Serum works on the same areas, without having to worry about any painful injections. It went on smooth and felt cool. No mess, no fuss. Simple to apply and doesn’t smell bad either. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used the elite serum for about 6 months and saw good results. The serum rx is wonderful and gets rid of the slight puffiness that remains. I am very happy with the product. I am a senior citizen who looks great,(If I might say so myself) thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I am 58 and have never had any procedures done because I have been blessed with good skin. However, I have seen some changes in the last few years after going through menopause, and it was time to change something. One of my best friends is a Botox diva (and looks fabulous), but I was not ready for the needle. So instead, I went online to do my homework (it does help that I worked in a lab some years ago). I was impressed with SkinPro and the research they put into their products and  decided to give the Elite Serum Rx a try. What a difference in my skin! Elite Serum Rx turned back the clock for me. In a week, my puffy eyes (my biggest problem) are diminishing before my eyes (pun intended), and my budding marionette lines are basically gone. I also use it on my forehead with great results. In fact, my Botox diva friend already asked me if I had started doing Botox like her !!! Love SkinPro and Elite Serum Rx!</li>
            <li> I have been using Elite Eye Serum for several years and am very pleased with the results!  The dark circles, bags and wrinkles around my eyes have significantly improved.  I just orderd the Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength and expect even better results.  Skin Pro is the absolute best at producing products that are based on science and research.  Not only that, but they have awesome customer service.</li>
            <li> The Elite Syrum Rx is definitely not a facelift in a tube, but it&#x27;s a great product if you&#x27;re looking to improve your appearance a little and don&#x27;t have a lot of time, money and effort to invest. It&#x27;s the best-selling eye treatment on Amazon, which has to mean something. The formula has been upgraded, so you should start seeing some results a little faster. Best of all, you know it&#x27;s safe: it&#x27;s been on the market since 2013 and underwent two years of testing prior to that.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d be wasting my money trying yet another anti-aging serum, it seemed like every other I tried did not have the results I wanted. The last product I tried, a Clinique product, moisturized well, but that was all it did.  I decided on Elite Serum RX. I have been using it for about a month now and I really like it. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in puffiness, no so much dark circles yet, but I know that takes time.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would prevent me from re-purchasing this is the price.  Otherwise, great product and does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> How about a trial size on new product. Sounds too stong. 3 yr user of regular. Was$$$. Now like generic drugs.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine turned me on to this eye cream recommended by Dr Oz. She had been using it for a couple of months, with surprising results. I tried a little and liked it, a cool feeling with no residue.  I had been wearing glasses for years mostly just to disguise my dark circles.  When I wore my contacts I felt like dark eyes was all people could see.  I started using Elite Serum Rx twice a day.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements.  I was bummed as this is not a cheap Target product.  I stuck with it.  Since I had already bought it, I wasn&#x27;t going to throw it away.  I was glad I did.  It actually took me two syringes worth to notice a difference but it was worth it.  I still use under eye concealar and probably always will but I do feel good enough to wear my contacts now.  I gave this 4 out of 5 because of the time it took to notice results, other than that, I was pleased.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought, &amp;#34;How could I go wrong??&amp;#34;  So gave it a shot and have been using for about a month now.  It&#x27;s easy enough to use, absorbs well, etc. but not seeing any unusual transformations.  Even subtly.  Maybe I need to give it a little longer?  I  apply with a Qtip (this always uses less product and doesn&#x27;t pull on thin-skinned areas).  Will wait and see.  If anything great happens I&#x27;ll let you know....</li>
            <li> As a mother of three I often wake with the puffy eye syndrome from lack of sleep. SkinPro formulated the Elite Serum, an airless syringe to dispense a proper amount of product and keeps it sanitary. Anti-aging products can loose their luster when they are contaminated. It is extremely important that anti-aging products are kept air-tight and do not have contact with outside elements. One 14 ml airless syringe is enough for a 45-60 day supply when used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;What better way to get the results you want than trying SkinPro&#x27;s new Elite Serum Rx. It has the ability to provide a long term therapeutic solution to fine lines and wrinkles, dark circles and under eye puffiness. After my first use I noticed a tightness around my eyes, and my puffiness from lack of sleep disappeared. Now that I am nearly 40 I want to make sure that I take care of my aging skin. Sometimes I feel like I waited too late to start a beauty regimen, but the old motto “it’s never too late to start” is burned in my mind. I know that with using the proper cosmetic products I can prolong aging skin.  The Elite Serum RX has really helped me with my dark circles and under eye puffiness. No more conditioners Elite Serum is made with a cosmetic base consisting only of red and green seaweed extracts and pure hyaluronic acid. Natural seaweed extracts uniquely function to target glycation and preserve the skin&#x27;s natural collagen. Hyaluronic Acid is the key for maintaining water substances in human skin which is one of the key elements in flawless skin. Hyaluronic Acid is one of the newest injectable facial treatment gels designed to slow and hide the effects of aging. This POWERFUL eye serum works in areas where cosmetic injections can not.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Don&#x27;t leave home without it! The not reason I gave 4 stars is because it costs so much skinpro please reduce the price!!</li>
            <li> Using is for over a month.  Virtually no improvement.  Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for puffiness from Clinique, Deravera, rollerballs, department store brands, Philosophy, Origins....everything.  I usually have puffiness in the morning, maybe from allergies or just hereditary... But with this, I notice all of my puffiness gone within a half hour.  It lasts all day.  It makes me look like a should, without the puffiness.  I hope this never gets discontinued!!!</li>
            <li> Hate is probably too strong a word but I don&#x27;t think it worked at all! I used it religiously for 30 days and saw no difference around my eyes. I went to return it and I was one day too late! Save your money, this product does not work!</li>
            <li> What a rip off! Product does nothing more than leaving your skin sticky.&lt;br /&gt;An EXPENSIVE RIP OFF!&lt;br /&gt;Babor makes a product just like it for less than 1/2 the price, if you just want a basic serum. If you need more, go to Sephora and print out their 3 best sellers.</li>
            <li> As I’m getting older I’ve been looking for something to help with the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. I’ve tried several other products, from the Walgreens special to the “expensive” stuff at the mall, but nothing was quite tackling the job. I’m a researcher by nature, so I looked online, read tons of reviews and finally landed on a consistent product: Elite Serum Rx.  So, I buckled down and made the purchase, not hoping for a miracle, but at least wanting some help with this problem area of mine. Boy, was I surprised. I noticed immediate results, less puffiness, less lines.  But, the real test came when I went to work (I work with all females in a cosmetic dentistry office) and they noticed the results and commented on my eyes within a few days of use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it don&#x27;t work and when u use it with make-up it feels like grit under your eyes and rolls up.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to cancelled and it took forever and they kept sending it and charging my credit card after I called&lt;br /&gt;And emailed.  Sorry customer service...</li>
            <li> So my wife and I are getting fairly up there in years, and while I of course still think she’s the most beautiful woman in the world, every year she gets more and more self-conscious about her aging skin.  Every year naturally brings more wrinkles, and then last year she got extremely ill.  Not only did her illness wreck her health, but in the process left her with quite a few more crow’s feet and darker bags than she had ever had before.  Thankfully her health is MUCH better now, but she’s tried nearly every skin cream and anti-aging solution out there- and all to very little affect.  Well, the one year anniversary of her diagnosis came up recently, and while I myself am not very good at picking out presents and such, her friend recommended that I get her Elite.  I was a bit hesitant at first because of the price tag, but she swore up and down at how affective it is at reversing the signs of aging and stress and so, (along with a huge box of chocolates and a day at the spa!) I bought it for her.  Now, two and a half months later, the results are definitely noticeable!  I’m not saying this stuff is a “miracle cure” or anything, but there has been a definite difference in a very short period of time.  The dark bags are gone and her wrinkles have thinned out a lot.  Now she looks almost just like she did right before she got sick.  Compared to everything else she has tried this has definitely worked the best.  She still uses it and hopefully the trend will continue!  I hate to spend money on lotions and stuff for myself, but I’m actually considering getting some- just to see if it works on me the same.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed it working very well.. Maybe if I could actually use it during the day it would work better for me, but I wear makeup all day. I found it doesn&#x27;t work well under my foundation. I also dropped the tube once and it broke so that&#x27;s a bummer considering I payed 90 dollars for it.</li>
            <li> As a male who&#x27;s about to celebrate my 58 birthday the last thing on my mind was using a skin rejuvenation product, yet my daughter has commented several times about baggy eyes, and hoped it didn&#x27;t run in the family.  My wife actually uses this Serum, so I said what the heck. After a couple of weeks I noticed I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m sleepy all the time and I don&#x27;t feel guilty about using a face product. This stuff appears to be improving my appearance and that&#x27;s all that matters. I recommend it to night owls like me who can no longer stay up late and look like it. Simple fact is, the stuff works.</li>
            <li> A Plastic Surgeon told me to use Elite Serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I discovered I had bags under my eyes....I went from store to store&lt;br /&gt;in search of creams...and other products to  help my condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried so many products that promised results...even a small widget......after you put on the cream ...you use the viberator...actually all it seemed to do was distribute the fat around.  Then  I bought a roller...it rolled cold serum over the bags. No luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then product after product. Name Brand products....none worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spending money...losing it.  So discouraging...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then like a Miracle...I did a search on Google...and came up with skin pro.com and discovered Elite Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are an  amazing Web Site explained it  all from A to Z.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They explained that  over  100,000, of people and much. much more where using Elite Serum with tremendous success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it...within a few days I received...a few days later I saw results. incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very bad condition...even small lines over the eye bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that were very hard to get rid of...but they did go down some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a Web Site where woman, She explained push the top plastic piece to the end&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;spray it on your finger,  I was only taking a little bit spreading a little bit  over 2 eyes...it was defininately working...but taking longer...It was going down a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since 2009 I had theses bags and dark shadows...trying many products like I said.....no luck...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was this year I discovered Elite Serum...Fabulous...like a Miracle...After using the amount the prior woman told me...amazing the lines are vanishing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the puffery is gone down about 85%.and the dark circles are getting more skin tone color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now guess what another fabulous plus...Skin Pro has recently made their Elite Serum&lt;br /&gt;more concentrated.. It&#x27;s 3 times more potent for quicker results...Elite Serum RX more concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this new strength...I believe it will all be gone very soon...Take my word for it... but also check the other tons of reviews..  and user testimonies.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! It really works, I really recommend it! I saw a difference right away, by far this product is the best compared to other products.</li>
            <li> Good for fine lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elite Serum Rx is great. I&#x27;m prone to have some break-outs so I&#x27;m very particular about the products I use. This product is fragrance free which is a huge plus.  I&#x27;ve ordered products off line before and when I get them, I&#x27;m disappointed to find out they have fragrance as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Elite Serum under my concealer every day.  I also apply it at night.  Also, I have noticed some of my wrinkles/fine lines have diminished as well. They haven&#x27;t disappeared but they are certainly less noticeable.  My makeup doesn&#x27;t settle into them like it used to.  I think my skin looks smoother all over as well.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  I&#x27;ve used undereye products for half the price of this one and they worked better.  Also, this product leaves a weird residue on the skin that later starts to leave little flakes around the eye area.  I guess that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem at night but definitely during the day it&#x27;s annoying.  So, since I spent so much money, I decided to just use it at night.  I used it faithfully for a month.  Nothing!</li>
            <li> Even though the price of Elite Serum Rx was more than I wanted to spend, I figured I needed something that could help me out. After debating about it for a bit, I decided to give it a try. At first, I didn&#x27;t really see a lot of results, but I figured I would give it a bit longer to work. It took a few months before it really started to make a difference. If you wait a bit and give it a few months, you will start to see the fine lines decreasing. Men and women alike can benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate what Elite Serum Rx does for my eyes. I usually try and take care of my eyes with rest and a good diet, but this product does a great job helping me out on days when I can’t take the time to care for myself the way I normally would do.It does more than just moisturize; it really helps take away the circles and puffiness around my eyes, and I don’t have to inject poisonous toxins into my face, and I like that a great deal.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do something serious about my crow’s feet after having tried so many ineffective end-of-the-aisle products from the drugstore. I have been self-conscious about my laugh lines and wrinkles for so long, and they would get me every time I strolled through the pharmacy for other meds and vitamins. I was fed up dropping cash left and right so I took my kids’ advice and started looking online for something heavy duty. Granted, they were puzzled that my looks weighed so heavily on me because they only know me as old Mom and didn’t think it mattered. Thanks anyway, kiddos. 3 months later, I can say that it was worth it to do the research. Elite Serum Rx may take some time, but now that I’ve finished with one syringe my wrinkles have significantly smoothed away. No sighing and tossing this in the garbage, wondering what’s next to try. Once I noticed improvement with the wrinkles I tried it on the dark patches under my eyes, and it began to gradually clear up. I used to just use cover up, but now that I’ve seen what kind of effect this had on my wrinkles (with virtually no ill effect; and I’ve had some bad reactions to some other kinds of rejuvenators) I’m going to take a second shot at it and see how else I can transform my looks. Ladies, I recommend you try Elite Serum Rx at least once and show your kids that you’re more than “just mom!”</li>
            <li> While nothing short of sand-blasting will create the skin of an 18-year-old on the eyelids of this 63-year-old woman, I can honestly say that my lids...from the lash line to the brows....as well as the under-eye area, look quite a bit better than they did before I started using this serum.  My skin is smoother with fewer little lines (under the eyes) and less crepiness (ugly word) above my eyes.  I don&#x27;t think the instructions specified this, but I use it on my entire upper lid...with no irritation to my extremely sensitive eyes whatsoever.  No fumes, no greasiness....no &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; to this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does not interfere with any eye makeup I&#x27;ve used or with my SPF cream (which is a mineral-based one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve found my eye product for life.</li>
            <li> I had faithfully used two syringes of Elite Serum and was truly pleased with the results. Slight bags and puffiness were noticeably improved. When a syringe of Extra Strength arrived, the product really kicked in. The skin under my eyes is smooth and soft, and I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a little help there. The customer service people are prompt in returning calls and extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> I was getting fed up with seeing a bunch of fine lines appearing around my eyes and mouth. After trying some of the other products on the market, I didn&#x27;t think anything was going to work. I ended up giving this one a try, and it didn&#x27;t work right away, so I thought about using something else. I ended up giving it another few months just to see if it would do anything, and it did. It took about four months before I noticed a change, but it was worth the time I waited.</li>
            <li> I’ve never been one to worry much about my appearance, especially wrinkles, until my 4-year old son pointed out that he could make his face wrinkle like mine - oh, what a horrible feeling that was! When I told my girlfriend about it, she told me about the Elite Serum. When I went online I found the extra strength and I had to try it; it had new award-winning stuff added and it said it was oil free. What’s really exciting is that it’s actually oil free and so easy to apply. I love the syringe, once I got the hang of it, rather than a little jar (where your finger gets most of the treatment rather than your eyes). My crow’s feet aren’t completely gone, but they have softened and I feel a lot better about that; I don’t feel like I’m 100 years old with a preschooler running around. All in all, this is a really great product. I wish I had started using it sooner.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength does what it says and more!  Although I originally purchased this product for the puffiness and wrinkles around my eyes my bigger concern was the vertical lines above my lip, some deep.  These lines bother me even more then the wrinkles around my eyes.  After receiving the product I actually wanted to send it back.  Since it was a little pricey, I thought it would be better to spend that kind of money on something for my lip lines.  After doing some research on the web, all I read was how the only real treatment to help these lines was injectable fillers.  Since that was not an option and the elite serum got good reviews I thought I&#x27;d just keep the product and use it on my lip area too.  I am so happy I did!  I still can&#x27;t believe the results.  I&#x27;ve only used the product for about a week and already I can see the difference.  The eye area is a little better but for me, the real results are in the lip area.  The lip lines are noticeably less, even the deeper lines.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using the product longer.  I highly recommend Elite Serum Extra Strength.  I bought this product for my eyes but I&#x27;m getting great results above my lip.  I&#x27;m overjoyed with the results!  You will be too!</li>
            <li> I see no difference, since I use some other great eye cream. It definitely firms the under eye area for sure..</li>
            <li> For some reason I was starting to see fine lines under my eyes; maybe it&#x27;s aging. So I researched some of the recommended products on Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I found just what I was looking for based on the reviews. Elite Serum Rx did not disappoint because a few weeks later, my fine lines were disappearing and overall around my eyes looked more youthful and rejuvenated. I would highly recommend this product. It doesn&#x27;t break the bank and it does what it promises.</li>
            <li> Seems to be making a slight difference around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Looking in the mirror was often a complete embarrassment to me, what with all the wrinkles, lines and circles around my eyes. I never looked like I got much sleep! I would even go tanning a few times a week because I felt like if I was tan, the lines were less noticeable, yet all I was doing was creating future damage.  It was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Elite Serum Rx through search here on Amazon. It’s not a gimmick either. We’re talking about real science here. Real results. Totally oil-free and no caked or thick feeling either. All those other products, feeling heavy and overly creamy on your skin? I ditched those. I finally am starting to gain some confidence back and don&#x27;t cringe when I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> ive been using for a month and i havent noticed a difference under my eyes, ill keep using it until its done but seen no results</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I noticed any difference. I have been using the product for already 3 weeks and don&#x27;t think my dark circles got any less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Well, gosh.  I didn&#x27;t think this would work as well as it has.  As others have said, there is no miracle serum per se, but this has worked far better than anything else I&#x27;ve used for reducing my fine lines around the eyes.  I have only been using it once a day, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference - smoother skin with less wrinkles (without having made any other major changes).  I do intend to increase my usage to twice a day.  However, I don&#x27;t feel like it helps my terrible dark undereye circles at all...nothing does (sigh), although I keep trying.  I&#x27;ve had the dark circles my whole life and have had to wear concealer for them daily. Now that I&#x27;m aging, any fine lines that develop become SO much more prominent when I am wearing concealer.  It&#x27;s like I have the choice between looking like I lost a boxing match, or looking crepe-y (and not in the romantic French pancake way).  Lovely options.  So, until I find a miracle concealer and/or a miracle dark circle reducer, I will have to settle for trying to reduce the fine lines so that I can continue to wear the dreaded concealer.  This product has helped me do that, and for that, I am grateful.  I even signed up for their refill program (via their website) since it saves quite a bit, and I can put it on hold anytime (which I did after three months, since I&#x27;ve been slow-poking my way through the first month&#x27;s supply).</li>
            <li> With all of the ingredients listed in this product, I expected a firmer result, a more obvious lift.  I was very surprised to find the results at 20% compared to other products of similar ingredients. Looks as though a lot of &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34; went into describing the product from the manufacturer, but they didn&#x27;t deliver in the end result.  It would be a &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; type of product for someone in their 20&#x27;s that wanted a bit of a lift.  I also was pretty surprised to see that the charge at customs was hefty, which brings the price of the product at the $120.00 mark, but this has nothing of course, to do with the product ingredients.  I&#x27;d suggest shoppers to look around at a medi-centre for a wrinkle product before buying this one.</li>
            <li> Pros:  great packaging; dispenses exact amount required; absorbs well into skin; no problem returning purchase through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: too harsh for my skin type (sensitive), left eye area red and sore after one use.</li>
            <li> I used this for a month and a half and it didn&#x27;t help clear the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> After using about ten days I started to itch terribly.  I turned red, also from the itching. A few days after that my skin turned leathery and started to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t read anywhere that sluffing and peeling was to be expected, like in using a Retinol product or having a facial peel.  So for me, this product is too strong.</li>
            <li> As I age, I notice that my body isn’t the same as it used to be. There are lines forming near my eyes where there wasn’t before. Dark circles underneath them.  My skin is sagging, lacking elasticity and no matter how much weight I seem to lose, the skin is just not tightening up.  However, since I’ve tried the Elite Serum, my face is smooth yet again and my complexion has never looked better. Yes, this product is primarily for the eyes, but I use it on all the trouble areas on my face.  Although the look imitates a syringe, it is actually a cream base. You just place a dime size drop on your fingers and apply to where you see fit. One of the biggest plus about this product is that it’s oil-free. With some other products that I have tried, it would leave a shine on my face and made me look like I had terrible skin. The Elite Serum leaves no shine and I am comfortable in my own skin. I highly recommend this to anyone who has trouble with wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I’ve been doing a lot of research on the internet on how to reduce the severity of the dark circle under my eyes.  They first appeared when I was just 12 years old.  I think nationality and genetics plays a major role in my case.  My entire family, male and female, has the dark circles.  We’re all fair skinned Scandinavians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the key to treating my dark circles is the Haloxyl in this product.  It works as claimed, breaking down and flushing out the under eye area.  Twice daily use of the Elite Serum Rx, along with a complete over-haul of my diet and a focused effort to get more sleep has given me better than expected results.  The best I’ve found on the market, I&#x27;ll use nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my first syringe on Amazon and then realized I can purchase it directly through the SkinPro website.  I automatically receive a new syringe every 45 days so I don&#x27;t have to be bother with ordering or worry about running out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that contains very moisturizing ingredients! I use this product twice daily and within a few months I started to see positive changes. Brighter looking skin around the eyes, my fine lines have disappeared, and no more puffiness as well. I also love the fact that the first few ingredients in this product are seaweed extract, Hylauronic Acid, and purified water which are known for moisturizing the skin from within. It also contains major peptides, such as Argireline, Syn-TC and Inyline.</li>
            <li> I have been using product for two months and have eliminated dark circles under my eyes.  I haven&#x27;t notice much help with puffiness but am not giving up yet as others have commented it may take a while.  The product lasts a long time which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still relatively young, but as someone who routinely sacrifices sleep in favor of having fun at night, I&#x27;m already no stranger to puffy eyes in the morning, and I&#x27;ve been worried that my active social life would one day make me very, very sorry. More for preventative reasons than anything else, I started looking into skin products hoping to stave off premature wrinkling and baggy eyes, but never really felt comfortable giving most of them a chance. When I settled on Elite Serum, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much, but I figured it was worth a shot. The product is so easy to apply and takes up just seconds of my day, so daily usage is no problem, and I didn&#x27;t think there would be much to lose. Two months into using the product, and I can legitimately say this was well worth whatever risk I took.There were so many days I deliberately tried to avoid eye contact with myself in the mirror after a late night, but the baggy eyes that used to greet me most every morning are significantly better now. The results have been gradual but absolutely genuine, and I&#x27;m more than happy to continue to take a few seconds out of my day in order to keep my face this way.</li>
            <li> Over the years I’ve invested in many expensive facial products that are “worth it” only to find myself with no improvements and out a hundred bucks—but this one actually works. Over the years I’ve developed an impressive number of bags under my eyes (you can thank my kids for that) and I’ve tried various eye creams that did little to reduce the dark circles. This product has not only virtually eradicated the bags under my eyes but also gotten rid of most of the puffiness. I can actually recognize the woman I used to be before motherhood took over, and my skin feels softer than it has in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I especially like about this serum is that it’s easy to use. Just pump a little bit of serum out of the syringe and onto your finger, applying it where necessary, and go about doing whatever else you usually do with your face. It’s oil-free which means it won’t cause build-up in your pores, unlike some of the other products I’ve tried which have given me blemishes, and the peptides they’ve added to the ingredients really do make your skin feel younger—I can attest to that. I know that everyone reacts differently to facial products, but I highly recommend using this one—you won’t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> 80 bucks is a lot to spend(for me at least) on a beauty product, at most I&#x27;ve spent around $50 but my purchase included a hand full of samples.  I haven&#x27;t aged horrifically,but over the last many months I&#x27;ve noticed the lines around my eyes are now a little deeper, circles a little darker and bags a little puffier.  I guess I was lucky enough to get away with moisturizers and cheap eye creams for as long as I did.  Every time I put on my under eye concealer, my makeup settles into the lines, drawing more attention to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I started using Elite Serum Rx and didn’t really see any results for a few weeks so as you can imagine, I was pretty bummed. I had paid 80 freakin bucks for the thing though, so I kept it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was two months ago and I’ve been using Elite Serum ever since. My eye area has never looked better. Truly an effective product.  Be patient with it though.  Some ppl said they saw results right away.  I don&#x27;t know how, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month now, and I am pleasantly surprised by how much it has reduced the perennial dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I have tried a range of other products, including something made by Kiehl’s, to limited effect. However, using the Elite Serum Rx, I have noticed very tangible results; friends and family members have commented that I finally look well rested and I don’t spend the mornings fretting about how to conceal the dark circles (and as a man, I do not have the luxury of being able to use concealer or foundation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reiterate that I am typically suspicious about the whole range of serums and creams promising the world, but this serum actually delivered on its promise to drastically reduce puffiness and darkness. My one small complaint is that the product is at a slightly higher price point than I am used to. However, given that I look visibly younger and much healthier and have never had that from other eye serums, it seems more than worth the extra cost. Additionally, the dispensing tip is very fine and only small amounts come out at a time, so there is no waste.</li>
            <li> This serum came highly recommended, but is an avg. product. No effect on puffiness or bags. Sorry. still, not a bad serum. Very thin. It&#x27;s easy to dispense too much at once, so be careful.</li>
            <li> A while back I started noticing that I looked more tired than usual - even in the middle of the day.  Specifically there were dark shadows around my eyes and it seemed as though I did not get enough sleep.  A few people commented on this and I began to worry if my age finally caught up with me.  So, I did some research and began using some different types of skin products to get rid of this problem.  I even tried the regular version of Elite Serum.  I had some success, but still wanted to improve a bit more.  So, I began going to bed earlier and resting more on the weekend, However, I still could not got rid of those circles.  Then, I was asked to be a part of a beta team for Elite Serum RX.  I decided to give it a shot and was definitely impressed at the difference it made.  Having used the regular version of Elite Serum, I decided to do some research on Elite Serum RX.  It was developed by Irwin Grams, an award-winning cosmetic pharmacist with over thirty-seven years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry.  It also uses a high concentration of pharmaceutical grade ingredients as well as seaweed extract base. It contains scientifically advanced peptides that are proven to result in DNA rejuvenation. It is made in an advanced FDA-licensed laboratory in the United States.  Elite Serum RX contains peptides that are especially created to treat major eye issues. It contains Argireline and other powerful ingredients that can help you stay young-looking.  Argireline, also known as Acetyl Hexapeptide-3, can help reduce wrinkles. Snap-8, another ingredient found in Elite Serum RX, is an octapeptide that can prevent the development of wrinkles and fine lines through the attenuation of muscle contractions. Haloxyl, also called Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, can effectively reduce dark spots and puffiness by promoting blood circulation in the eyes. It also reverses the fluid build-up that occurs during sleep and causes puffy eyes and dark circles. Matrixyl 3000 and SYN®-COLLare also contained in the Elite Serum RX.  There is also SYN®-COLL, an element that stimulates collagen synthesis and mimics the ability of the body to produce collagen through tissue growth factor. Other ingredients included in this product are red and green seaweed extracts, which treat skin roughness and dryness, and hyaluronic acid, which prevents the signs of aging.  Matrixyl 3000 contains Matrikines are responsible for cutaneous repair and restructuration, and make your skin more youthful and glowing with health.  After all this research I was convinced not only by my own experience but how much goes into the science of it.  This is not to say other skin care products did not achieve results, but the Elite Serum RX allowed me to see a difference more than anything else I tried.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for weeks now and honestly I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed.  It truly has made a big difference in my appearance.  I&#x27;ve been getting complimented by those around me and sometimes I&#x27;ll ask people I&#x27;ve met how old they think I look and their guess is 2 or three years younger than I actually am.  While again there are a great many products out there, I saw the greatest level of success with this one.</li>
            <li> Upon looking in the mirror and seeing some slight lines of aging, swelling &amp; dark marks around my eyes I decided to do some research through trial and error and discovered Elite Serum Rx has by far left a lasting impression upon my skin compared to all the other OTC products. After just a couple months of daily usage I see a noticeable difference in my skin tone. The swelling is now smooth to touch and the dark marks are much lighter and hardly noticeable. The fine lines seem to require a little more effort to treat but the Dispensing Syringe does help with the application and I&#x27;m hoping to see signs of improvement in that area as well. All in all I&#x27;m more than pleased with the results I see thus far, it&#x27;s oil free so it doesn&#x27;t have that greasy texture like most products. My skin feels enhanced and revitalized! I&#x27;m excited to see how I will look in the upcoming months!</li>
            <li> Initially I had my doubts about Elite Serum Rx- Extra Strength. There are so many products that promise &#x27;wrinkle reducing&#x27; capabilities.  If you know me, then you know I did a bit of research into the actual ingredients of the product before I bought it. We should all pay attention to what we put on our faces, especially around the delicate eye regions. I&#x27;ve used products before that burned my eye area or dried out my skin so badly that my lines looked worse.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the positive effects that the patented peptides had on my face. The use of peptides in order to rejuvenate skin has been going on for a while by SkinPro definitely went above and beyond by creating their own. I began applying the serum under and around my eyes to try to get ride of my unflattering crows feet. It only took a couple weeks before I started to notice that my wrinkles were becoming less defined. On top of that, the dark circles under my eyes began to dissipate. This &#x27;fresh look&#x27; was something that I honestly had not seen in some time. Eyes are such an important feature when it comes to the overall appearance of someone!  The only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 is because of the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Elite Serum Rx for about a month now and I love it. The texture of my skin is softer and smoother than I can ever remember it being. I&#x27;m not a person with a lot of patience, so if I don&#x27;t see some type of results rather quickly then it will loose my interest and fall out of my daily beauty regiment. I use this faithfully everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the texture of my skin improving, but some of the wrinkles I have been seeing aren&#x27;t quite as obvious. I am very excited to see what will happen after 3-6 months. I turned 50 this year and have been noticing a lot of changes in my facial skin especially, but with this Elite Serum my skin seems more radiant instead of that tired feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product highly and I think if you started using it at an even younger age it would literally slow down what the hands of time does a woman&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> First of all, I did not hate the product or love the product as far as how it smelled, felt, etc. The biggest problem was that even though I used TINY amounts, this product did not last a month so I did not use long enough to see any results. Also, I don&#x27;t have a lot of fine lines and wrinkles so maybe it really would have helped with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do have is very smooth under eye area...until I smile, and then that area crinkles terribly. I should have known that this product would not help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that I would gladly try for 3-4 months, but not at this price.</li>
            <li> SkinPro is a leader in skin care and dermatological health. This organization has brought many great products in to the cosmeticeutical industry. I personally enjoyed using the Elite Serum. The Elite Serum is unlike any product I have ever experienced. It is a topical agent that really helps defy age. This is because it re-hydrates skin providing it with moisturizing ingredients. It rejuvenates, making skin appear younger and fresh. Furthermore, I was delighted to see the results that Elite Serum boasted. My skin was firmer, refined and the tone was extraordinary. Despite any age, your skin will appear tighter and more elastic. I noticed this after a few applications. More remarkably, was the change I noticed in the reduction of swelling under my mother&#x27;s eyes. This is a sensational product and I recommend this to anyone who wants to revitalize their skin.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t see any difference in the skin around my eye...hated the packaging</li>
            <li> I myself suffer from the misfortune of looking older than I am, mostly due to lack of proper self-maintenance and exercise, but have found that this product makes me look more like my actual age. The lines around my eyes when I smile have become so bad.  I have constantly been swindled with products that claim to do what this one does, all of which claimed one hundred percent satisfaction, but have found that they are not nearly as effective.  I spent a few days doing research on trending products, products with the best feedback, most effective ingredients and Elite Serum Rx is what I came up with.  The package is unique, the product itself is amazing, and it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I cannot see any difference after using this product, it is so very expensive with no results, I am going to try to s3end it back a waste odf money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of a lot of the anti-aging stuff out there. I think often the products simply don&#x27;t work and plus, a natural aged look isn&#x27;t something we need to be constantly finding inventive cures for. That being said, there&#x27;s also nothing wrong with a little help from something that actually works pretty well for a specific problem you are having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; (the name makes it sound weirder than it is) did the trick for me overall. Within a pretty timely fashion I noticed a hair more brightness and vivaciousness in my image in the mirror. You only have to put a tiny bit of the stuff on a couple times a day or so. It added a literal few seconds to my nightly brushing my teeth, etc. routine. I even had the for me quite infrequent experience of a coworker mentioning that &amp;#34;I think you are doing pretty good for your age&amp;#34; or something to that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what made me splurge to buy this in the first place, as it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side for me when it comes to things like cosmetics. Maybe I was just having one of those days many of us do when we are just plain feeling old. But I&#x27;m actually quite glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking based off the video and positive comments it just might improve under eye darkness or some small lines on side of eyes; however it did not improve either situation after using the whole syringe. It was a lesson learned and dollars spent.</li>
            <li> I really really like this product and woudl defiantly recommend it to family and friends who suffer with bags under their eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for almost a year , I use it all over my skin not just around the eyes and I keep coming for more...I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks, it feels nice and soothing to apply but the wrinkles and bags are still there and one eye is worse (bags) :0 I will persevere, perhaps it is one of those treatments that makes the condition worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to try any facial products that aren&#x27;t recommended by my dermatologist because my skin is very sensitive and blemishes easily. A friend recommended Elite Serum Rx and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. I have been using it for several weeks now, and I am able to notice the difference. The skin around my eyes looks firm, and my face has a glow. What I like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  I started with just using it at night for a week to make sure I didn&#x27;t develop any reactions.  Then once I knew my skin wasn&#x27;t going to react, I started using it in the am and pm.</li>
            <li> For years I have tried so many products to help improve the appearance of my dark circles under my eyes and reduce the puffiness. All the products I have tried just sit underneath my bathroom sink practically wasting away. They all had little to no results at all. I have been using the Elite Serum for a few months now and I have seen more improvement than I had thought would be possible and saw more improvement than any other product I had used. It went on so smoothly around my eyes it felt amazing. Elite Serum Rx is the greatest thing I have discovered to help with eye care. It has helped me gain my confidence back and makes me look 10 years younger. This product is definitely well worth the money and gives you a beautiful appearance in your eyes once more reducing dark circles and puffiness! I highly recommend this product to anyone with puffiness and dark circles!</li>
            <li> I have never been someone who has taken care of their skin like I should.  I&#x27;d never moisturized, used sunscreen...I really never did much of anything in the way of skincare other than plain soap and water.  I&#x27;d always had great skin, so my philosophy was \\&quot;Don&#x27;t mess with something that&#x27;s working\\&quot;.  So, imagine my surprise when I looked in the mirror at 39 and saw an old woman looking back at me!  The dark circles looked like something out of a Quentin Tarantino movie and the wrinkles and saggy skin were just hideous.  It became quickly obvious that my lack of effort wasn&#x27;t working anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some browsing and came across Elite Serum RX Strength and though it was expensive, I figured I would give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  I began looking years younger almost immediately. The circles began to fade and the skin tightened up around the corners and under my eyes.  It&#x27;s easy to use, so I kept using it and I have been impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for women like me who don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on skincare but need a confidence boost, like I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued by under-eye circles for years and nothing I&#x27;ve tried has worked...until now. Elite Serum RX Strength really works. I noticed improvement within days. And now you&#x27;d never know it was ever a problem for me. I feel and look so much younger and people I know have asked me what I&#x27;m doing because my skin looks so much better. I don&#x27;t hesitate to tell them what I&#x27;m using. These are the same people who, just a few months ago, were asking me what was wrong, why I looked so tired all the time. Now they&#x27;re begging me for my secret. What a difference this product has made in my life. The self-confidence I&#x27;ve gained alone is worth the cost of the product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used faithfully morning and night for over 2 months, I see absolutely no improvement in the puffiness under my eyes.  It may work for some, but certainly not for me.  A complete waste of money.  I had high hopes for this product; I should have known better.  Maybe somewhere out there is an eye product that actually works, it ISN&#x27;T this one.</li>
            <li> Its been 2 months haven&#x27;t seen a change like the reviews I&#x27;ve been reading about, really bummed because I didn&#x27;t want to have to turn to injections. Looks like I will be going that way. Good luck to anyone who makes the purchase.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all, dislike the slimy texture, I do not mind to spend money if the product works, but did not!!!</li>
            <li> I started using this product in June.  I read both good and bad reviews about this product.  It&#x27;s one thing to promise immediate results, but an entirely different thing to promise lasting results. I was surprised at how well this serum seemed to work.  I have awful lines around my eyes that started to appear as soon as I hit 30.  I can&#x27;t disguise them with foundation because my makeup settles into them which makes them look worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product twice a day, am and pm.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  It is clear and odorless, not tested on animals and won&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the syringe applicator but mine too did jam after a few uses.  I called SkinPro direct and they sent out a replacement, no questions asked.  Top notch customer service.</li>
            <li> I’ve always had oily skin my whole life, but since getting older, it’s now more dry and sensitive.  My issue is puffiness under the eyes but I have to be careful what I use. I thought I would try this as I liked that one of the main ingredients was seaweed and it sounded like it would be very light  (and I liked the cool design of the syringe).&lt;br /&gt;I felt a slight burn after initially putting on but it went away within minutes and I noticed less puffiness by the 2nd day of using it!  By a week, I noticed big difference, but it was starting to dry my under eye area out too much so I backed down to every other day, it’s been 2 weeks and I can see a huge difference in puffiness and even the wrinkles are less. But for me the puffiness was the biggest concern. I felt it did a great job, better than the Mary Kay and the ROC I had tried.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum RX is an expensive item so I used a gift card and some reward points to purchase it.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full price though because after using for almost a month now, I&#x27;ve seen no improvement in the bags under my eyes.  I do not have wrinkles so maybe the serum will work better for women with fine lines and wrinkles.  For me, it&#x27;s bags under my eyes that&#x27;s the issue and Elite Serum has not made any visible improvement whatsoever.  For people like me who have bags rather than wrinkles, it is my hope that this review will save you money.</li>
            <li> A dear friend of mine ordered Elite Serum RX and looked 10 years younger. The wrinkles under her eyes are just gone! Since she looked fabulous I had to order one myself. I can see buying these as gifts for my sisters and using it as part of my regular makeup routine from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only in my late 20&#x27;s, but a decade of stress and sleep deprivation has resulted in premature crow&#x27;s feet and bags under my eyes that makeup is no longer covering. I&#x27;ve wasted over $100 on products that don&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve tried a few drug store products and a few high end products but nothing has provided lasting results yet.  I started using Elite Serum Rs and can tell a huge difference already.  Those fine wrinkles have significantly smoothed out.  They aren&#x27;t completely gone, but they&#x27;ve filled in enough that my makeup doesn&#x27;t settle into them the way it once did.  I keep my Elite Serum Rx in the fridge because I like the cool feel when applying it.  It also seems to help decrease the puffiness on contact too.  I like this product too because the company doesn&#x27;t do any animal testing which is important to me.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this based on the fact that it was rated so highly on Amazon.  She normally uses either Revive Eye Renewal Cream (a serum) or La Prairie White Caviar eye serum.  Both are fantastic products, but incredibly expensive, and she was hoping for a serum that would do the same job at substantially less cost.  THIS IS IT.  This is a really good serum that appears to work on fine lines (my wife is 52) and reduce the appearance of dark circles or puffiness.  My wife was skeptical and as such we waited to review this product until she had used it for a fair amount of time.  It has done the same job as the more expensive serums.  The dispenser is very easy to use, distributing the correct amount without waste.  The price was reasonable in comparison to the other extraordinarily expensive serums she was using.  She will order it again.</li>
            <li> Its hard to know which product to use, considering many of the products use the same core ingredients but Elite Serum Rx had a few ingredients that peaked my interest. The formula for actually is different, and makes a huge difference as well. I had dark circles around my eyes for as long as I could remember and tried things that may have helped temporarily or just flat out didn&#x27;t work. I also have naturally&lt;br /&gt; oily skin, which can be a huge pain because anything that I put on my face, even if its just around my eyes, tends to make my face even more greasy.  Elite Serum didn’t exacerbate it at all, or affect my face washing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is convenient.  You&lt;br /&gt; don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping a jar or bottle upright or worry about knocking it over and spilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.  I&#x27;ve experienced some slight improvements but hoping for better with continued use.  I&#x27;ll keep you&lt;br /&gt; posted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but felt obligated to share my experience on a pricey product.  After using Elite Serum RX twice a day for six weeks, I can&#x27;t see any noticeable change except that my heriditary dark circles seem to be worse.  I love the syringe applicator to keep the product sterile and control the application amount..but that&#x27;s the only positive!  I&#x27;m 65 and suffer with dark circles rather than wrinkles and puffiness so this was very disappointing for me. It lacks moisturizer and didn&#x27;t even make the eye area feel refreshed! It might be better for wrinkles and puffiness.  Caudalie Premier CRU eye cream was much more effective for fading my dark circles, absorbs quickly, brightens the undereye with its pearlescent cream and lifts and firms the eye area.  I&#x27;m going back to Caudalie and I&#x27;m not even waiting until my Elite is gone!  It&#x27;s comparable in price at $99 for a pump bottle that lasted 3 months using twice/day.  Both products require an additional moisturizer, but Caudalie worked so much better for me!  I just wish it had the Elite syringe!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest. Nothing from a tube or bottle is going to make you younger. No one can turn back the clock. Thank goodness you can look like you did!!! If you want to at least LOOK great for your age and knock off the appearance of several years, give this a shot. I hate seeing those fine lines creeping in around my eyes and mouth as much as anyone. I hate looking tired and haggard. While looking like I&#x27;m 21 again can&#x27;t happen, looking like a much younger, more wide-awake and fresh-eyed woman works for me. That&#x27;s the result I love seeing. I love the confidence boost of looking my very best.</li>
            <li> The Elite Serum Rx has been a real good friend to me so far! Since I am in my late twenties, I began my search on products once I noticed lines around my eyes and came across this superb serum. I have been using it for close to 5 weeks now from a girlfriend that began to use it, and I am pleased to say that I am satisfied with what I&#x27;m seeing in the mirror! I can see the lines have reduced in appearance, which has made me not use much makeup; I couldn&#x27;t be happier about that part! I&#x27;m still torn as to whether or not its working better than my Clinique All About Eyes, but I&#x27;m going to keep trying it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a year and the results are great.  It has noticeably reduced the lines and dark circles around my eyes and the skin is smooth and finer textured.</li>
            <li> Not noticeable results, will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best eye serum available.  Nothing else on the market comes close ad I&#x27;ve tried them all!  This actually does what it says and is non irritating and great for my allergy prone eyes and super sensitive skin.  I also love that this company doesn&#x27;t do any testing on animals and the customer service is beyond amazing.  Love  it!</li>
            <li> What I like most about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have any strong fragrances or odors. Since I have allergies, this was a big thing for me. Products with a smell cause my eyes to water and turn red and itchy.  I can use this product without having to worry about having an allergic reaction. I also love the fact that the dispense locks so I can toss it in my makeup bag with everything else and not have to worry about it breaking or leaking.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from skinpro international, received it promptly but the syringe was broken. I contacted skinpro and went through the steps I had done and the representative told me it was broken and a new one would be sent out as soon as possible but there would be a slight delay due to the holiday (labor day). I still have not received the product or further contact from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday on 9/23/13, I received a call from a representative from Skin Pro International explaining to me the situation with the broken syringe and their steps to correct the problem so it didn&#x27;t happened again. He was apologetic and courteous and said a new one had been mailed. I received it yesterday and it works perfectly. I liked the feel of the product and have high hopes of it&#x27;s quality. I did research before buying. I only wish someone from Skin Pro had contacted me before and explain what the problem was to clarify the delay. This is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I have been using elite serum now for at least 6 months and I love it! It really helps to relax the crows feet that age is slowly bringing on around my eyes. I stopped spending all that extra money on expensive eye creams that claim to help but do nothing for aging skin. I even ran out of my elite serum and didn&#x27;t replace it for a few weeks and I started to notice that my crows feet actually looked worse! Get elite serum...you won&#x27;t be disappointed! It really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it. Didn&#x27;t see the result very well.</li>
            <li> Not the best product I&#x27;ve used but not the worst.  It&#x27;s a middle of the road product.  I don&#x27;t have any specific complaints, I just can&#x27;t say I see major improvements yet.</li>
            <li> This product is no better and no worse than all the other &#x27;great cures&#x27; on the market.  I have seen no result from using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an eye serum to get rid of my wrinkles. As I&#x27;m aging it seems as though I&#x27;m getting more, and more wrinkles under my eyes. So I&#x27;ve been going through a trial error period with many different products, and so far this is my favorite. I still have a couple wrinkles, but as I keep using it I&#x27;m noticing how they are slowly decreasing.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Elite Serum Rx because the other &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; eye creams and anti-wrinkle products I had tried either left my skin slightly greasy afterward or they reduced wrinkles without doing anything about my under-eye puffiness. This one took care of both, and pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way too. That part of the description is really, really important. A lot of other manufacturers say to apply &amp;#34;small amounts&amp;#34; and they are just talking, but in this case they really mean it! The first time I tried it out, I accidentally over-estimated, but after a few seconds of work with a cotton ball, I got it under control. Since then, it&#x27;s been smooth sailing. (Literally!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been struggling with a mixture of setting powders, concealers, and other anti-wrinkle moisturizing products, do yourself a favor and order this. A little bit goes a long way, and it might just eliminate your need for other under-eye products.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx  Extra Strength is the first anti aging product I&#x27;ve found that delivers everything promised.  After four months of use I haven&#x27;t one single crow&#x27;s foot. The puffiness is a thing of the past. Dark circles from allergies and sleep deprivation are much lighter. Most amazingly, the hooding , one of the most humiliating signs that you are indeed getting older, is gradually diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;This serum is such a pleasure to use it easily integrates into your routine.. It is light and smooth without the annoying slip of silicone based products.  It isn&#x27;t tacky or thick . It has never caused irritation . Even the occasional contact with the eye itself is relieved immediately with a few eye drops or water.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or itch. No tearing !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the detailed explanations of the purpose, method of action and efficacy provided on the website. The diagrams are attractive, yes , but they&#x27;re accurate and informative. You&#x27;ll know which of the state of the art peptides you are using and why. The scientific research, testing and documentation of the improvement in texture, tone, wrinkle depth assures you that you have chosen your serum wisely. It isn&#x27;t marketed based on anectdotal claims . It isn&#x27;t sold based of subjective feelings of small groups who report results  like &amp;#34; my face is softer&amp;#34; or &amp;#34; my skin glows&amp;#34; like so many of the creams and potions we&#x27;ve bought and soon discarded. The clinical observers detail the improvements and the mirror confirms them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery system is unique, impressive. A fresh dose is delivered through a device that looks and  behaves like a syringe. You twist to unlock, express as much as you want/ need and reseal with a twist in the opposite direction,  replace the cover and cap. You receive a clean, fresh dose every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SkinPro staff has been knowledgeable,and very helpful. I will continue to use Elite as long as it is available to us. I know I can trust the productand the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never been healthier, the smile and frown creases last only as long as the expression lasts. No eleven lines , forehead furrows or permanent wrinkles we like to call laugh lines remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encourage any one interested in anti aging to read the history of Elite&#x27;s development and its mechanisms of action. You won&#x27;t need a celebrity endorsement or outlandish claims to convince you to try it. Once you use it your face will convince you to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely thrilled with Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength and am exploring SkinPro&#x27;s line of products designed to produce comparable results on the remainder of the face, the neck and décolleté .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker and have developed nasty lines around my mouth.  Not a ton of them, but the few I had were quite prominent and really noticeable when I smiled.  I tried creams to help reduce the appearance of the lines, but nothing seemed to help. The instant products worked the best but a lot of them would crack after application or my makeup would stick to it.  I searched for a product that was an alternative to a filler, as a filler is really the only thing that can help, but at $500 a syringe, it was out of the question.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while now and notice a difference.  I know it&#x27;s an eye product, but it has properties that help with lines and their website said it can work on lines anywhere on the face.  Worth the investment.  It doesn&#x27;t make a difference like a filler would, but for a topical product, it works great.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference. gentle on the skin. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> At first I was weary of trying this stuff. I&#x27;ve never used a cosmetic product purchased from the internet before.  I like to see it, touch it, feel it before I buy it.  More over, I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve tried lotions/creams for my skin before. I&#x27;ve tried cheap stuff like cocobutter and expensive stuff like Dermaheal. They all promised younger skin but  I didn&#x27;t feel much different with any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this serum while looking for ingredients I hadn&#x27;t tried yet.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now. It felt like it was working but I was afraid it was a placebo. Turns out it wasn&#x27;t.  I am impressed so far and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 and I don&#x27;t have any signs of aging whatsoever.  I&#x27;m lucky enough that I look young for my age.  My issue is bags.  God awful ugly bags.  I&#x27;ve had this issue since my early 20&#x27;s and nothing I&#x27;ve tried rids it.  I&#x27;ve tried cucumbers and tea bags, all of the home rememdies that claim to reduce puffiness.  I don&#x27;t even bother to wear my contacts anymore.  I wear my glasses because my glasses help to hide the puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying a few over the counter products and even went in to my dermatoligist for a skin care consult.  She carries the SkinMedica line and had me try a few different products totaling a few hundred bucks and I was incredibly disappointed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Elite Serum Rx on a blog that I follow.  I tried it and at first I wasn&#x27;t happy with what I saw.  I didn&#x27;t think the product was making a difference.  It took me awhile to notice.  My first syringe was almost empty before I felt like it was making any improvement.  I guess each person&#x27;s body is different.  I decided to try a second syringe and with this I&#x27;m noticing more extensive results.  The bags aren&#x27;t completely gone but they are much better than what they were.</li>
            <li> I have tried more treatments for my face, eyes, forehead, and neck than I will ever admit.  Awhile back I was researching, again, for that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; for the wrinkles around my eyes. This time I REALLY found it.  It is not a &amp;#34;instant fix&amp;#34; but if you want permanent results then this is for you.  It takes a little patience so stick with it.  Not years of patience.......just a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not work for this company...I am just another woman wanting to look the best she can.......like the rest of you.  Please try this and I promise you will never regret it!!</li>
            <li> My eye area was the issue. I had fine lines and wrinkles. I’m only forty, a professional business woman with two young children. I didn’t want my busy life to be a reflection on my skin. I was on a mission that led nowhere, having tried over ten different eye serums in a 6 mo period. After using Elite Serum Rx for only four weeks, I felt my skin tightening. I continued with the serum because it felt like it was working. I’m glad I did; in the matter of months, the dark circles under my eyes started to reflect my natural skin tone, and the puffiness around my eyes disappeared.  I looked visibly younger, healthier. But most of all, I gained back my self-confidence, and the comments about me stopped. If you do buy this serum, stick with it and don’t give up. It will eventually work—trust me! And while I don’t know what peptides really are, I do know that their addition to the serum makes Elite clinically proven to reduce eye wrinkles</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx has made me feel more confident in my appearance as I reach a new age milestone! It has helped to soften those pesky fine lines that have been creeping up over the past few years. I’ve also seen a noticeable decrease in the dark circles and bags I have become so accustomed to. This serum packs a real punch far beyond any other brand I have tried in the past. The price is a bit steep but definitely worth the splurge and considerably cheaper than the loads money I have thrown away on less effective products. It has quickly become a staple in my skin care routine and I do not see that changing any time soon!</li>
            <li> This is my very first time to write a review because I am very excited about the product.  I&#x27;m a swimmer and I&#x27;ve got an ugly crease under my right eye from goggles.  I was desperate to shop a remedy.  I found this Elite Serum Rx online and gave it a try.  I noticed a change on the third morning.  It started to work so quickly.  I like the texture.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, not too watery.  A tiny dip on a finger smooths out not only on under eye area but to entire face.  It seems to get absorbed into skin fast, well and deep.  I like the airtight container, too.  Now my crease is much less visible after the use for 6 months.  I continue to subscribe it.</li>
            <li> No any changes or improvements have been noticed by me. It was a waste of money. As for the so-called delivered mechanism, it&#x27;s laughable; many other products on the market do a much better job at squeezing the right amount. I won&#x27;t buy it again. I&#x27;m sure there are better eye creams on the market (and cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer</li>
            <li> I like The Elite Serum RX.  At  first I was skeptical whether it would do anything for my problem areas. However, after several weeks of use, I noticed that the fine lines and wrinkles started to dissipate. At least it looks that way to me. I like the way that it feels  on my skin, too. It&#x27;s not too heavy; it feels like it is nourishing my skin. I appreciate that it comes in  small tube so that it is easy-to-carry in my purse and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I have tried many products, some of which were very expensive, but this worked fine...it did what it said it would do...without costing an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My co-worker complimented me the other day saying my skin looked nice, so I am going to stick with this product and see what else happens. But so far, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> About year ago, I started noticing some faint lines around the corner of my eyes. Since then, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with many different types of products trying to find the best preventative and rejuvenating formula.  I also work graveyard shifts and it seem like no matter what remedy I try, I cannot get rid of the dark schedules under my eyes. My research brought me to the benefits of seaweed extracts when I came across Elite Serum. I am always reserved with new beauty products, but I knew the ingredients were beneficial because I had been doing my research. I also was sold on the fact that it was manufactured in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I love about the serum is that it goes on light weight with no oily feeling, and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my moisturizers and makeup I use daily. When you apply it to clean skin you can feel a slightly cool sensation to let you know its working. I have been using this 2 times a day for a little over a month and  I can already see the faint lines I was so worried about starting to fade. The skin under my eyes looks firm and the dark circles were gone after about a week. I have even received compliments that I look rested and fresh from family and friends. I already ordered my next 40 day supply and I will be recommending this to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have used this product every day, 1-2 times per day, for 4 weeks. I haven;t seen any improvement. To be fair, I have dark circles around my eyes, and I&#x27;ve never found anything that would help. I&#x27;m disappointed in this product, but not surprised.</li>
            <li> Not only did I not see any improvement, the product seemed to make my dark circles more visible than they already were. I previously used the original Elite Serum and that product showed some improvement, which is why I decided to try the new version hoping I would see more dramatic results. Needless to say, I was very disappointed .</li>
            <li> Oh my GOSH.... I have had dark circles under my eyes since I was a kid.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products its crazy to think about how many! Professional products that cost 100 or more products that are OTC and products from my dermatologist. THIS PRODUCT works!!! My dark circles are gone!! I go to work now without under eye makeup on because they are gone gone gone :) cannot tell you how thrilled I am!!!!</li>
            <li> I always read reviews. This product had such glowing reviews that I purchased. After receiving it I was expecting at least something, anything to happen. Then I came across a NYTimes articles about fake reviews. Cornell Univ came up with an algorithm (http://reviewskeptic.com) in which you can cut and paste a review and to see if review is truthful or not. It&#x27;s 90% accurate. I then cut and pasted the 5 star reviews of this product and all came up \\&quot;deceptive\\&quot;. I then posted all of my reviews and the program stated, \\&quot;truthful\\&quot;. I do a lot of shopping online and believed reviews. Do not believe the reviews of this product. Please check it out: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/technology/finding-fake-reviews-online.html</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had puffiness under my eyes for years and as I get older it seems to be getting worse.I look tired all of the time even when I&#x27;ve had a good night&#x27;s rest. I have tried so may products and was beginning to feel like nothing was really going to help reduce the puffiness under my eyes. I was using Hydroxatone for about a year but didn&#x27;t really notice much of a change. I wanted to see if there was something more effective on the market so I decided to try this product based on all of the great reviews on Amazon. I have been using it morning and night for about two months now and so far Elite Serum Rx seems to surpass any other product I have used in reducing my puffiness. My under eye area looks and feels more hydrated and the skin around my eyes has a much smoother appearance. The texture is also nice-it absorbs right into the skin with no greasy feel. So far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best treatment for fine lines and dark circles I&#x27;ve ever used. Give it at least a week and you&#x27;ll be amazed. It even worked on my fine smile lines - they&#x27;re seriously almost gone now.</li>
            <li> Received this product very quickly and customer service was very fast and prompt when I had emailed with a questions prior to purchasing.  So far I have used this for 5 weeks and am very pleased with my results. I find the value for the money is on par with some of the other eye creams/gels/serums on the market.  The only con I have with this product is that if I accidentally use too much it can become a little tacky.  One pump is the right amount of serum for both eyes.  Don&#x27;t bother using anymore because it&#x27;s just a waste.</li>
            <li> This serum hasn&#x27;t done anything for me, I&#x27;m 28 and have my first fine lines under my eyes. Ivery used it for almost 9 months and no difference it only moisture my eyes</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this cream. The only draw back are the price a hundred for it to last a month and half. I can&#x27;t keep spending that kinda money. But it works great! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am thirty years old and previously thought that I was too young to worry about anti-aging products. When I noticed the slight lines forming in the corners of my eyes and on my forehead, I was thrown into a state of genuine panic. Was I getting old? Should I have taken better care of my skin in my 20s? Was the damage reversible? I am happy to say that Elite Serum Rx has greatly calmed all of my fears. After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try the product for myself. I use it in the morning and at night, on all of the lines that I have been noticing. After a couple of months, they are significantly less noticeable! I no longer feel the need to wear foundation and cover up on a daily basis, and my skin feels much softer and healthier. I know that the product is mainly intended to be used on wrinkles around the eyes, but it has worked just as well on my forehead. I highly recommend this product to others who want to nip the aging process in the bud!</li>
            <li> I use this on my eyelids after I wash my face at night before bed. I also use in the morning on eyelids and under eyes if needed. For some reason, all my puffiness is over my eyes not under. Needless to say this works! I no longer have multiple folds on my eyelids when I open them. For an added boost, I keep this amazing product in my fridge. It feels amazing on tired eyes and perks them right up. Also, really there is no glitter in this. It is a clear serum with the only con being that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd purchase that I made. It won&#x27;t give you an overnight miracle but with continued use, I noticed that the skin around my eyes look better. I&#x27;m 51 and it did not take off the deep wrinkles at the corner of my eyes but the difference is the improvement on the fine lines and my upper lid and eye bags especially when I wake up in the morning. Highly recommended. I would continue using this until something better comes up.</li>
            <li> I began using this product about six months ago.  I started with the regular elite serum and had exceptional results.  It was a noticeable different in the eye area.  I had a decrease in eye puffiness and dark circles.  So when I received the elite serum extra strength two months ago I thought it would basically be the same.  The last two months I have noticed a significant difference in my eye area.  My dark circles and eye puffiness are now almost non existent.  I have tried many eye creams and this is the only one that I have seen a very visible improvement.  They have really improved on a product that was already very good.  One more thing to add I am very consistent when using this product.  I use it twice a day every day.  An added bonus is that they have excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Relative to Elite Serum Rx&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just thought I needed to comment on Elite Serum Strength and Extra Serum Rx. I&#x27;ve had severe bags under my eyes for over 35 years. Tried numerous over the counter products and quite a few through websites. Friends and family told me they are all the same and none worked.  Well I actually gave up for a while trying to do something other than cosmetic surgery which was not an option for me. About 8 months ago I saw on a website not sure which before and after photos of a gentleman of about 70 years of age, I think. he at that point used the product for 4 months. The before and after photos really impressed me. His bags were not completely gone but a vast improvement was noted. The product used was Elite Serum, I ordered it and had used it for about 7 months. In Nov.of this year I received the new Elite Serum Rx. I have to tell you I was more then satisfied with the Elite Serum but the Elite Serum Rx has really improved my eye bag situation. I highly recommend the Elite Serum Rx. The products lasts a long time, I had called customer service once because I thought maybe I was applying the product incorrectly as it lasted for around 90 or so days. My advice is try it give it time for me a little less 7 months before really noticeable improvement. Oh by the way I&#x27;m a 73 year male.  GK  Chicago, IL</li>
            <li> Might seem a little pricy, but this is a five star product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Fed up with pricey products from Sephora, I decided to tried Elite Serum Rx based on the reviews.  I&#x27;m pleased.  Not only did make a difference in my bags, but the crows feet beside my eyes eventually became less noticeable too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soaks right in when you put it on - which is so easy to do with the applicator. And it’s not greasy at all, no shine to powder down. I am a 60 year old woman and a product like this will not do the trick all on its own so I will still use Botox and fillers but this is a great daily product to use in conjunction with.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx ranks in the top 3 best products I&#x27;ve used.  The other 2 are SKI II and Guerlain but both are far more expensive than Elite Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it goes on so easy, non greasy and makes my skin so smooth. I have problems with dryness on my face, and it seems to spread when I apply my eye products, but I don&#x27;t have this problem with Elite Serum.  I think this product helps more with dark circles than it does fine lines, that&#x27;s just what I&#x27;ve noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always buy ahead of time of finishing my bottle. Could not imagine going a day without it.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews regarding Elite Serum Rx,I decided to try it and bought some. I will turn 50 years old at the end of this year and while I have very youthful looking skin, I do have fine lines on my forehead, around my eyes and smile lines.&lt;br /&gt;I use the product twice daily combined with the Delfogo Wrinkle Eraser Cream (also by SkinPro) for roughly 2 months and I can definitely already tell the difference! I&#x27;m not sure which product is producing the most results or if it&#x27;s the combo of the two. The reason I use the two together is that there it&#x27;s not cost effective to use the Elite Serum Rx on the forehead and around the mouth because I would go through it too quickly. Both products are paraben free which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx - Extra Strength really does feel more powerful and effective than any of the products I have tired in the past. It is a best selling product for a reason — I have used it for a couple of months now and the dark circles around my eyes have noticeably reduced, so too the puffiness although this took a little longer to fade. By applying it before going to sleep and after waking up I feel more confident and the skin around my eyes firmer and moisturised. The &amp;#34;Defend, Protect, Rejuvenate&amp;#34; slogan seems to live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> absorbs in skin well around eyes - but too much comes out of tube even with a slight push.  Needs better packaging so not so much serum wasted.</li>
            <li> This product dried the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I use it above as well as below my eyes.  Fabulous results!</li>
            <li> I have been using Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength for a little over three months and it has had, by far, the best results of any other eye serum I have ever used. This serum delivers the results that it promises. Even after only a few days of using it I noticed the puffiness around my eyes begin to reduce significantly, I noticed my crow’s feet begin to fade, and even the dark spots under and around my eyes begin to lighten!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is very easy to apply; not requiring tons of steps and complicated directions allows you to easily work it into your daily care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many other eye serum’s, Elite caused me no adverse skin reactions. After applying this product my skin featured no burning, redness, or even extreme tightness as it does with many other anti-aging serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quality eye serum that has fast, lasting results.</li>
            <li> This serum has simplified my regimen. My skin was softer and smoother right away however it is very pricey. Results will be seen after at least 3 weeks, that is when  I started seeing small visual differences brighter skin,the eye area less wrinkled and spots definitely faded. All said it&#x27;s a keeper.  I am a consistent user of SkinPro products and Elite Serum is one of my favs.  They have other great products for the entire face, not just eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used a ton of skin care products hoping to reduce my wrinkles and fine lines with no success. I started using the Elite serum and are seeing great results. I use this at night, and in the morning. In less then 6 weeks my lines are 75% improved. I have almost no dark circles or puffiness anymore. The only con is it is so pricey and I may have to reduce use to keep it longer.</li>
            <li> About a month ago I was on vacation with my sister.  She is always trying new skin care products and is pretty knowledgable and opinionated about the various brands out there.  I made a joke about my bad luck; inheriting dark circles under my eyes from our mother when told me she has been using a new product for dark circles / under eye puffiness. lines, etc.  I have tried more creams and concealers than I can count and gave up years ago on finding any real improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were at her beach house for 10 days and I used her Elite Serum RX every day that we were there.  Remarkably, and despite eating salty foods and enjoying our evening wine, each day I looked better than the day before.  I was actually excited when I woke up each morning to see the results. On the last day of our vacation, I got on Amazon and ordered a tube for myself.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and the lines around my eye are all but disappeared. I am always skeptical of these products, but a friend recommended it, and since I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for something to deal with the lines and the circles and all the stuff I find at Walmart and other big box stores (even Sephora!) didn&#x27;t work, I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and give this a try. It was about two weeks before I saw a vast improvement, and an even shorter time before my friends (including the one who recommended it) took notice. I will definitely be reordering once I&#x27;m out.     If you are looking for a product to get rid of those nasty lines that betray your age, you&#x27;ve found it! It might seem a bit pricey (and it probably is) but it was well-worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom when she said she wanted to do something about the lines around her eyes. She used it for 3 months and when I came home for the holidays there was definitely a notable difference in the quality of her skin.</li>
            <li> Like almost everyone here, I have tried numerous eye products for my dark circles and puffy eyes-including Preparation H!  NOTHING has worked.  I thought I&#x27;d try this product due to the stunning reviews and almost instant (within a week) improvements. Sadly, this had done nothing for my eyes.  They actually look darker than before and just as puffy.  The only improvement I have seen is with a couple of wrinkles on my neck that seem to be looking softer, and the gel is very smooth and feels nice, hence the 2 stars. BUT this is not what I bought it for. I bought it for my eyes and am so far disappointed.  I know it can take awhile and I will continue to post 1-2 monthly reviews in hopes of some improvement.  My fingers are crossed...</li>
            <li> I don’t usually write reviews about health and beauty products, but I like to give credit where credit is due.  The effects of age had begun to take it’s toll on my face and no amount of facial exercise and diet were making a dent into those fine lines.  I tried another product (Loreal Eye Defense) as it supposedly contained some new thing that was just the thing to get rid of my annoying facial lines.  While it was just the thing to get rid of my disposable income, it did NOT make a dent into the dents in my face.  Elite Serum Rx (extra strength) did do the trick though.  It was simple to use, was odorless and gentle on my skin.  My skin felt immediately better, as far as hydrated and soft, but I did not see real results for about 4 weeks – after which time, wow!  What a difference.  I do want to disclose that I also upped my water intake and have cleaned up my diet and incorporated exercise as well so that could account for some of the positive changes, but regardless, this Serum is now a mandatory part of my daily regime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with dark circles and puffiness around my eyes for years, due to the nature of my job and sleep schedule. I&#x27;ve bounced around between about half a dozen other skin care products trying to solve this issue, but most of them did nothing more than a -run-of-the-mill moisturizer and some of them flat out didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I wasn&#x27;t interested in Elite Serum Rx initially because I&#x27;m not the kind of person who spends $80 on a cosmetic product, but I finally bit the bullet because I though I might as well shell out for the good stuff instead of continuing to throw my money at cheaper products that weren&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this sure is an expensive product, but you know what? IT WORKS. First, it&#x27;s actually quite pleasant to wear, as it&#x27;s not oily, smelly or bothersome. It only took a few weeks for me to see an improvement in the darkness around my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using the product now for three months (still on the same tube, too) and it&#x27;s night and day. The texture around my eyes is smooth, I actually look like I get a full night&#x27;s sleep now, even though I don&#x27;t, and a co-worker just the other day said I looked better rested. I&#x27;m a youngish person, but for the first time in awhile I feel like I look my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this product is its price. The fact is, it&#x27;s expensive. But if you go for the cheaper brands, you&#x27;ll end up spending upwards of $100 anyway trying to find a cheap cream that works. I&#x27;ll save you the trouble: just go with Elite Serum Rx and end the search today. It works, and it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to SkinPro products!  I have been using the Vitamin C Serum all over my face to help with moisture, to even skin tone and smooth out lines and rid some puffiness.  From the same line (Delfogo) I also started using the Corrective Anti-Aging mask which I use on a maintenance level several times a week.  The one part missing from my regimen was an eye treatment.  I was using the Vitamin C around my eyes, but it isn&#x27;t necessarily formulated for use around the eyes so I checked into the other products from SkinPro and opted for the Elite Serum Rx.  So far I am happy.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and I&#x27;ve noticed it helps to make fine lines not so prominent.  I can&#x27;t comment on what it does for dark circles because I&#x27;m fortunate enough to not suffer from them.  My new routine is Elite Serum Rx under my eyes and to my upper eye lids (on clean skin of course) and Vit C Serum on the rest of my face.  I repeat this at bed (again, after I cleanse my face.)  I use the mask once or twice a week.  Loving this line of products!</li>
            <li> I recently applied for a job online through Craigslist looking for freelance writers that would be needed to improve companies online reputation. After an initial interview, they told me they would need me to write fake reviews for various products. Below is the email I received when I agreed to participate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are in need of a review that is at least 50-200 words describing the product (based on the description provided) and an example or two of how this product helped you to feel younger or gave you better skin, why you chose this product over others and how you feel it compares to others.  Ultimately, it will be a 5 Star rating once posted, but for now you can simply email me your rough draft for approval.  Upon approval I will provide you with final instruction. Please be sure that this review is written with &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; emotion.  We don&#x27;t want an over the top, over exaggerated review.  It&#x27;s ok to include pros and cons.  Please refrain from using words like miracle, amazing, etc.  Just write as if you were telling your friend about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT BELIEVE ANY REVIEWS FOR THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Concerned Amazon User</li>
            <li> After using this twice a day until it was gone I could tell no difference in dark circles or puffiness. A lot of money for nothing.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo434KDZUDLOJC]]I had used Elite Serum for about three months and had seen some improvement in the dark, puffy circles under my eyes. Actually, there was more improvement than I had experienced with any other product. However, after the third month, I did not notice any more improvement. While a lot of the puffiness was gone, there were still dark circles under my eyes. When I found out about the new Elite Serum RX and that it had added ingredients to help with the dark circles I knew I had to try it too. I could hardly wait to get it in the mail. It came and I started using it right away. The first week after I started, I saw that the dark circles were almost gone. The little puffiness that remained was gone too. My kids had commented after using the first Elite serum and were even more surprised after using the Rx version.&lt;br /&gt;After five years of trying products, I had never seen the improvement around my eyes that I have had with Elite Serum Rx. While many of the other products had some of the same ingredients, they do not have the same amounts and the same combination that Elite has. It has peptides that have been proven to help with the aging process around the eyes. Haloxyl will increase the blood flow to the area around and under the eyes, eliminating dark circles and decreasing the puffiness in the sensitive area. SYN®-COLL increases the amount of collagen your body produces to help make the skin cells more elastic, so they do not shrivel up and wrinkle. It contains Matrixyl 3000 too. This is used in most anti-aging serums to rejuvenate and repair the tissue.&lt;br /&gt;Elite SerumRx is very easy to use and you do not have to worry about dipping your fingers into a jar and contaminating it with bacteria or dead skin cells. It comes in a syringe-like vial that keeps the product in an air-tight, sterile environment. Simply depress the plunger and have a small bead drop onto your finger. That is all it takes, under and over each eye. Enough will come out to spread easily. It does not feel sticky or slimy and absorbs into the skin quite fast. After applying, you can go through the rest of your routine. Apply moisturizer and then any make-up. Elite Serum Rx will not change the way your make-up looks or feels.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to look younger and have their eyes looking great again.to spread easily.

            <li> Helped my dark circles</li>
            <li> My skin has always been a headache. I break out easily, have had terrible dark spots, dull skin and have recently begun developing the early signs of wrinkles as well. I&#x27;ve tried products for each concern in the past, but without success. Dark spot products never diminished the dark spots and products that were supposed to brighten my skin typically made me break out. Plus there was the hassle of using so many different products on my face every day. Finding this product was literally like breathing a sigh of relief. It feels so good on my skin, and by the second week I started noticing beautiful improvements (and no breakouts!). It&#x27;s incredible to have a product that really does everything that it claims to do! Well worth the expense, as it makes my skin radiant and even, and provides the convenience of having the benefits of several products rolled in to one syringe. I highly recommend! You WILL see results!</li>
            <li> So, as a young man, now in my early 30&#x27;s, I have used eye creams, cucumbers, serums, and other products to help with bags under my eyes. I have used them since I was around 20 years old and finally said, \\&quot;Forget it.\\&quot; Being an African-American that doesn&#x27;t smoke, drink, or do any drugs, people often think I&#x27;m a little older by the eyes. This is not good or usual in the African-American community. Especially since both my parents and sisters still look very young around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, from working so much I can often look tired and have a few lines underneath my eyes. This works very quickly. Even quicker than it says. Sometimes, I guess the skin just needs the right nutrients or something to make things look how they are supposed to. I speak a lot and I&#x27;m always in front of people, and being able to be confident is very important. I&#x27;m thankful to SkinPro for making this product. It&#x27;s worth the results.</li>
            <li> I¡¦d been using a product recommended by my plastic surgeon (for eye puffiness), for approximately 2 years, and experienced fair results. I researched a variety of sites looking for reviews on any and all similar products.&lt;br /&gt;I found a very good review of Elite Serum RX (forgive me, I don¡¦t recall the site), and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I can¡¦t say enough good things about Elite Serum! After the very first application I could feel the ¡§firming¡¨ effects as well as see the improvement immediately. The bags under my eyes pretty much disappeared with daily use. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to mention an instance when the USPS lost my order. The manufacturer, Skin Pro International emailed me within minutes (literally) and called me the next day to follow up. They sent me another order special delivery, and at no cost to me. All I can say is, WOW! Who the heck has this kind of customer service these days!? This experience along with the great results of using Elite Serum, has made me  customer for life. It¡¦s not like I¡¦m getting any younger, and the problem will go away º. Special thanks to Skin Pro and their great service!!  Sincerely, John Paul (BTW, I told my plastic surgeon he needs to recommend this product / company as well)</li>
            <li> BY FAR, THE BEST EYE PRODUCT THAT EXISTS!!  I have tried so many, StriVectin, Skinceuticals, Derma e, Estee Lauder, Reviva, Artistry, (just to name a few). take it from a 54 year old that takes care of herself and skin, and yes has some skin damage. This product rewinds time a bit. Lines are less, and gone is a lot of that crepey look under the eye. The product moisturizes and goes a very long way. I kept emailing to push my next shipment out further, because the product lasts so long. right now I have it shipped every 3rd month, and that&#x27;s using it twice daily. I ran out for a couple of weeks after a credit card snaffu , had to resort to using other &#x27;sub-par&#x27; products, and my eyes showed it! I will never use another product! I am now going to shop for their other skin products to see what they offer. oh, and by the way, excellent customer service. they reply within 24 hours to any of my emails.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for under eye puffiness. I would give it more stars if it weren&#x27;t for all the other claims. I still have dark circles, and my lines haven&#x27;t lessened, and I&#x27;m well into my second tube. I didn&#x27;t really expect any miracles in those areas anyway, so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I did try using another pricey eye product for awhile, and my puffiness came back. So I&#x27;m back to this one.  Update: I&#x27;ve now been using this product for over ten months. Still no miracles in any of the other claimed areas, but I&#x27;m continuing to use it for under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> After only 10 days, the texture of the skin around the eyes has softened and the fine lines are slowly going away. It&#x27;s good to see a product that finally works especially after spending so much on products that made my skin red and flaky. The only con for me is the price of the serum and being that I use it twice a day will mean I have to buy again in a week or so or reduce usage. That said, it is a wonderful product and if you want results, ASAP, purchase this serum!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pacing myself from writing a review until I&#x27;ve responsibly used this for about three months, a solid time frame to assess any notable changes while using a skin product.  But at seven weeks in, I&#x27;m so excited about what this serum has done for my skin that I&#x27;m ready to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have no wrinkles, I do have thin skin, fine lines and rather pronounced dark circles around my eyes. As a product junkie, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried em all--particularly most Retin-A bearing products. The most change I&#x27;ve seen was a mild softening around the corners of my eyes with Neutrogena.  I learned about Elite RX in a skincare forum and decided--what the hell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is a very light, almost creamy texture and a little goes a long way. I immediately loved the way it made the sensitive skin around my eyes feel soft and moisturized.  A month or so in, my sister noticed that I look \\&quot;fresher\\&quot;. But the turning point for me was a couple of weeks ago, when on my way to the gym I reached for my trusty under eye concealer and realized--I don&#x27;t need it!  The skin around my eyes looked supple, smooth and noticeably brighter.  I looked...rested and fresh-faced! As someone who wouldn&#x27;t leave home without a concealer, I proudly marched myself to the gym, sans makeup!  I did not expect such a drastic change from a topical product.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m ecstatic and have nothing but praise for this little syringe.</li>
            <li> Either I have the world&#x27;s most stubborn, product-resistant eyes in the world or I was just born to bear the burden of bags and unsightly circles. That was my debate with mother nature every morning during my skin care regimen. After trying just about every serum, cream, mask, cold pack, and cucumber variety known to humankind, I had finally decided that enough was enough and that more extreme, drastic measures were in order. Days before scheduling an consultation to go under the knife, I discovered Elite Serum RX- Extra Strength!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the first week, my puffy, droopy, tired-looking dilemmas seemed to magically disappear. I looked more awake and refreshed than I had in long time! Beyond the unbelievable results, what I love most about the Elite Serum is how light it feels. I detest heavy, oily creams, but I want substance, too. This product is simultaneously rich and weightless! I&#x27;m no chemist, but whatever is in this serum is certain give plastic surgeons a run for their money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ridiculous amount of high-end, expensive ($100+) products that promise to help with numerous skin issues but never saw results. I&#x27;m still young, but have always suffered from dark circles and can see fine lines beginning to develop around my eye area. I&#x27;d pretty much given up when I finally tried Elite Serum Rx. It doesn’t come cheap, but I can honestly say it’s worth every penny that I spent. After using for a little over month, my fine lines are nearly gone and my dark circles have diminished more than any other product I’ve used. I’m very pleased with this product and will definitely be keeping it in my regular skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Have tried many eye serums and thought this might be different.  It&#x27;s expensive and only ok and definitely not exceptional.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is absolutely hands down the best I have ever used!  I had saggy lids before using.  Not anymore.  I cannot believe it.  Try it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I work in the entertainment industry, which often times means extremely long nights, which I’m sure, have contributed to the dark, puffy circles under my eyes. A couple of months ago my esthetician, whom I see regularly, suggested that I check out the Elite Serum Rx, so I ended up purchasing the cream-filled syringe. I have to admit, at first I was taken aback by the price for what seem like a small amount, but I am just now reaching the end, and like I said, I purchased it almost two months ago. I used it once in the morning and again at night. I’ve notice big improvements under my eyes. The dark circles aren’t completely gone, but they have noticeably lightened up and no more puffiness. I also like the fact that it’s 100% oil-free as my face tends to get a bit oily naturally. Living in Los Angeles, you can imagine the many skin care products constantly thrown in your face, but I’d have to say that so far, both my esthetician and I agree that this has been the most effective treatment by far. I definitely recommend this product to anyone experiencing issues under their eyes.</li>
            <li> FINALLY AN EYE PRODUCT WITH COLLAGEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS “MAGIC PEN” MY Elite Serum, IS THE ANTI-AGING SOLUTIONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO TIRED DARK CIRCLES AND THE COLLAGEN VISIBLY REDUCES THE FINES WRINKLES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IS EASY TO APPLY AND I CAN CARRY IN MY HANDBAG ON WEEKEND GET AWAY.</li>
            <li> I started looking for another product for my eyes after my drugstore cream was running out, and frankly, not working very well. After using this for a few days I began to see my crows feet smoothing out, which is something my other cream failed to do, and my eyes looked more awake and lifted. Even my co-workers commented that I looked more awake and rested than usual when I had barely any sleep the previous night with two small children refusing to go to bed. I also started to notice that the dark shadows I had always had under my eyes started to lighten and my face really started to pop with a nice glow because my eyes finally looked bright and well rested! I love the applicator since it allows me to take only the amount I need instead of dealing with excess cream that used to come out of my other bottle. I think this cream really goes deep down within your skin to rejuvenate it from the core because it has extra peptides in it which is very good for your skin. I began to feel it working the moment I put it on, and I began to notice that it did begin lifting the skin very quickly, although I think it takes a little longer to see the complete long-term effects. It really made my face look less tired and stressed because my worn-out eyes were slowly vanishing. I&#x27;m very glad I decided to try this, and I already ordered two more applicators, one for my sister and one for my mother so we can monitor each others results together.</li>
            <li> I buy it because it seems to work for me, I have bought it before and i would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 1 month and just love it.  I am 65 yrs old and it isn&#x27;t easy finding an eye cream that really works!  I don&#x27;t need to look any more!  Carole</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 7 months now and have seen dramatic results. I am 47 years old with some sagging under eyes and creepiness above the eyes due to weight loss and of course age. This serum has tightened these areas and the tube lasts a long time. I can feel the difference when I put it on then I see the difference after a few minutes. My husband noticed the difference so I suggested for him to try it. He was severely burned on his face in 1992 and has just now started seeing effects of sagging skin. It helped his bags so much under his eyes he wanted his own tube. We both are very satisfied with this product!! Thank you Elite Serum!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how simple and easy to use this product was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went on clear and dried in a matter of minutes. There was no unpleasant aroma or stickiness that accompanied the product. Out of everything I tried, this is the only one to actually make a difference in how I look and feel. The puffiness has gone down and the dark circles are lighter than what they were when I started using the product. I&#x27;ve gone through one syringe so far and have noticed an improvement, although not huge, but I&#x27;ve ordered a second and hope to see a bigger difference after this one is complete.</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations. It did not have any affect on my skin or the bags under my eyes. I used it exactly as recomended (every day and every night.) I am 29 years old. I started noticing puffiness under my eyes a year ago. In the explination of this product the seller states &amp;#34;eliminates puffiness&amp;#34; that unfortunitally was not true for me. I hope to receive a full refund</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx is a little sticky, not horrific, but it does have a slight stickiness to it.  I don&#x27;t even know that I would call it sticky, it&#x27;s just thicker than your typical serum.  I believe that&#x27;s because with the new version they tried to make it thicker like an eye cream.  It doesn&#x27;t have an adverse effect on it&#x27;s absorbency though and I had no issues with it absorbing.  If someone is having absorbency issues I think it may be because they are using too much.  So far I like it, no complaints.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve had really terrible dry skin, especially during the winter, and I&#x27;ve tried to overcompensate with rich creams and moisturizers but nothing has ever really caused my skin to actually feel healthier itself, it&#x27;s only ever been a quick fix for the most part. I also find that with other rich night creams that I end up with acne or blemishes in the morning from being too oily, but since using Elite I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin, I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup because the tone has evened out, and laugh lines and creases are slowly disappearing. I also noticed that the bags under my eyes are starting to dissipate, which I am so happy about because I&#x27;ve looked half awake for the past few years. I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to get a long lasting fix, instead of just spending a bunch of money on creams that barely work.</li>
            <li> As a nurse, I bounce between day and night shifts along with the occasional 12 hour shifts.  The bouncing back and forth is torture on my body and my skin.  In one week I might pull a 12 hour day shift and then 2 days later a night shift, so my under eyes are always puffy and now I am noticing bags and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a few products off Amazon before, none of which were anything to write home about or even write a review about so when I came across this one I decided to take a proactive approach before purchasing.  I actually took the ingredient list to my dermatologist and she approved.  With her approval, I purchased with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 10 days of using the product, I started to notice a difference, nothing huge, I just felt &amp;#34;more awake&amp;#34; like my eyes looked less tired.  Now that I’ve been using it for 3 months, I went from having bags under my eyes to only having slight imperfections that only I notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that you have to keep using it but I think it is well worth it.  It&#x27;s worth mentioning that with any product that you use, you will have to maintain so that&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; per se.</li>
            <li> After researching methods to reduce eye puffiness, I found the website for this serum and was impressed with the innovative ingredients. The active ingredient-Argireline, has recently been developed and tested, to reduce wrinkles and signs of aging around the eyes. Unlike Botox, this Serum does not require painful injections, which I have always been apprehensive about.  Another bonus,  is that the ingredients are non-comedogenic, which means that it is safe for sensitive skin. The fact that it is Oil-Free, ensures that it will not clog pores and exacerbate irritated or acne prone skin. Being an avid Amazon Bargain Hunter, I was very pleased to find this product on here. In contrast to similar anti-aging skin creams, this serum seems to be on the expensive side. But after doing an ingredient comparison, the obvious difference between this serum and generic eye creams, is the quality and potency. You do not need to use a generous amount of cream to achieve outstanding results. Specifically, I started off with using a pea-sized amount under my eyes, where I experience frequent puffiness, at night. After repeating this routine for a few nights, every morning I could visibly see a gradual difference, as far as an improvement in the appearance of my under-eye bags. Truthfully, the results are not overnight or drastic, as many similar gimmick anti-aging products make false claims about. As with anything, to reap the full benefits, I have added this serum to my nightly skin care regimen and will continue using on a daily basis. So far, I have not experienced any side effects or skin irritation from this product, which makes it all the more worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Elite Serum Rx eye cream really makes a difference for me. I am a 50+ year-old male, and I am, unfortunately, single. Because of that, and the fact that I have a lot of face-to-face business meetings, it is important that I look my best. Plus, looking good makes me feel good. Using Elite Serum Rx not only helped reduce my eye wrinkles, it made the skin around my eyes softer and took away the dark circles around my eyes that sometimes made me look like a scary raccoon. The reduced wrinkles gave me added confidence to look clients directly in the eye, knowing that they would see my eyes and not my wrinkles and dark circles. I can honestly say no other products I have tried makes my skin look and feel so healthy and natural. Lastly, because of Elite Serum Rx’s great packaging and easy spread-ability a little bit goes a long way.  The only reason I gave this a 4 star, instead of a 5 star rating, is the price.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product and I must say I was really impressed. It is very easy to use with the syringe applicator and the texture is very smooth without feeling oily. I saw results right away. My wrinkles and dark circles seemed to vanish leaving my eyes looking better than ever. Using this product really boosted my confidence. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs help with puffiness, dark circles, or wrinkles around their eyes.</li>
            <li> I recently celebrated another Happy Birthday, yay! The years have surely been good to me, but my eyes appear to have aged a hefty ten years, instead of one. Suffering from insomnia surely doesn&#x27;t help, either. With dark circles and crow&#x27;s feet invading my already puffy eyes, I set-out on a search to find more than just some remedial \\&quot;rat-tested\\&quot; remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frantically, I phoned all my family and friends with the same inherited eye problems to tell them about this cosmetic treasure I had found and how it would make a wonderful birthday gift. Surprise! Most of them were already using the Elite Serum RX - Extra Strength for months-and I was literally-the only one in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I was unsure of Elite Serum RX&#x27;s long-lasting results, I admit being a tad-bit skeptical of the price, yet, that didn&#x27;t deter me from adding it to my Amazon wish list. After receiving, unwrapping, and setting my aging eyes on Elite Serum RX, I swiftly fell in love with the unique syringe-like applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I applied a squirt to the back of my hand to avoid waisting serum and it shooting into my eyes. Then, with a touch of serum at my finger tip, I dabbed it smoothly around the bottom of each eye, working my way to the top. I was ecstatic to see tremendous results, after only using Elite Serum RX daily for less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a phobia for needles, so this is the safest alternative for me to Botox. Besides, Elite Serum RX - Extra Strength isn&#x27;t painfully injected, my face isn&#x27;t stiff, my saggy eye lids are firmer, my sensitive sense of smell adores the odorless scent, my crow&#x27;s feet have taken flight, my bags are folded and flat, and my raccoon eyes are extinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Wink~Wink~Wink!!*</li>
            <li> In my opinion Skin Pro lives up to its claims. The company also hires professional and polite personnel. I had a problem with a purchase and spoke...on Sunday...of all times with a representative by the name of Corey. He was extremely helpful and actually procured a product I had been looking for. I&#x27;m really excited about the Bellapulse System he was able to award me as I am a satisfied and long time uses of the Elite Serum. He seemed extremely knowledgeable about all Skin Pro&#x27;s products and was helpful in setting up a shipping schedule that will work for me. Thank you Skin Pro for your great products...I love them...and thank you also for friendly helpful personnel. I will definitely keep using these products. Great for all the problem areas. I&#x27;m 65 and want to keep my friends guessing that I&#x27;m still in my mid fifties. With use as directed, you see the difference.</li>
            <li> There are so many products to choose from that make all sorts of claims about reducing wrinkles around the eyes and mouth and puffiness under the eyes. I’ve learned not to trust any product that claims it will drastically change my facial appearance in a very short amount of time. Elite Serum RX Extra Strength is the latest and strongest  version of  a series of eye serums made by SkinPro.  I decided to give Elite Serum RX Extra Strength a try because other people who had used it were writing very positive reviews, emphasizing a steady, gradual improvement. I wanted to decrease the puffiness under my eyes as well as dark circles that I’ve had for more than ten years, which gives me the appearance of not having gotten enough sleep. In fact, I’ve become so fed up with comments from friends and co-workers who tell me that I “look tired” that I decided once and for all to do something about it. After doing my research and deciding on trying Elite Serum Extra Strength, I figured that I would see at least a minor difference after maybe 3-4 weeks. But after just two weeks, I noticed a marked improvement in my appearance. The puffiness was significantly reduced, and so were the dark circles. Also, the crow’s feet and lines around my eyes were greatly diminished. It has now been a little over a month since I started using Elite Serum RX Extra Strength and the puffiness under my eyes is almost gone while the dark circles continue to fade. Elite Serum RX Extra Strength certainly isn’t the least expensive product on the market, but after having tried cheaper options with very little improvement, I feel very strongly that Elite Serum RX Extra Strength is worth the money.</li>
            <li> No miracle--just helpful.</li>
            <li> I’ve used lotion on my skin for years. As a child my mother insisted on it. “Put the lotion your hands and face, then up your arms to your elbows.” I’m 50 and I have to thank my mom for my soft skin. But, I’ve got crows-feet and dark circles under my eyes. And, of course, puffiness. I considered Botox until my friend told me about Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength. She said it helped her get rid of puffiness around her eyes without needles. I’m not a fan of needles. She said she never go back to Botox after trying Elite Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but bought it anyway. After a week I noticed a difference. The lines around my eyes were less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, every night before I go to bed and in the morning before I put on my makeup, I put the serum around my eyes and even a little around the cracks above my lips. Instead of tired looking eyes, I look about 10 years younger! No needles or strange procedures. I was thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend Elite Serum to anyone who feels they need a little refreshing. As an extra bonus, it’s given me a boost in my self-confidence.</li>
            <li> The pump breaks easily, it&#x27;s my second one and it no longer pumps. I like the product and would continue to use but the pump is defective.</li>
            <li> I have tried several eye products over the last couple of years, but none of them worked as good as the Elite Serum Rx (Extra Strength) did. I had some deep wrinkles around my eyes which, along with some puffiness, increased my age by about  5 years. After some weeks using this product, the wrinkles and the puffiness are much more disguised.. Also, it is really easy to use.  Just be careful not to apply too close to your eyelid.  I did the first time I used it and got a little in my eye and it stung a little.</li>
            <li> I wanted to look good for my sister’s wedding last month, but my skin was not cooperating. A summer spent on the beach, lax sunscreen application, too many “beverages” and sunburns all contributed to a splotchy patchwork on my face that included under-eye circles, fine lines around my eyes, and flaky skin on my cheeks.  I got a lot of suggestions from my flawless skinned friends, but one product intrigued me more than the rest....Elite Serum Rx.  I’d never used a serum before, I&#x27;ve always used eye creams but I liked the idea of a serum.  The Elite Serum Rx is supposed to act like a serum but has the properties of a cream.  It took a few weeks and there were periods of frustration (I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement the first month) but within the second month, my skin looked better than it had in a long time.! The under-eye situation was seriously improved.  I didn’t need half am much concealer as I’d been using--sorry MAC!-- the fine lines turned into the fine line.  I still have a bit of flaky skin on my cheek, this product isn&#x27;t for that anyway.  Although I’d recommend this, be warned--don’t expect changes overnight.  Be patient.  My first tube lasted me about a month and a half and I&#x27;m on my second tube now.  It was with the 2nd tube that I noticed the changes.</li>
            <li> Recently I began noticing that the eye cream I’d been using (Chanel Ultra Correction Total Eye Lift) wasn’t doing much to fight the newer lines and puffiness around my eyes.  I thought maybe it was because I had used it for so long my skin became immune to it.  I started looking for a new eye cream and decided to try Elite Serum Rx because it contains Argireline and specific peptides to treat puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about it being too heavy as it&#x27;s described as being like a &#x27;rich eye cream&#x27; and my skin usually can&#x27;t handle very heavy products, but this absorbed very nicely and didn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable at all. While I do have to say that the results aren&#x27;t instant, after using the serum for a few weeks I have noticed a pretty dramatic improvement in the thinness of my eye skin and fine lines in particular. I&#x27;ve tried products like Olay Regenerist and Shiseido Regenerating Cream and while they were okay, I never got the &amp;#34;deep down&amp;#34; intensive change that I was looking for. I feel like the Elite Serum comes closer to what I would expect from a surgical injection or medical treatment. I can see the difference between this product and other cheaper ‘quick fix’ solutions. I definitely plan on repurchasing and would recommend this serum to anyone who wants a reliable and effective eye treatment.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not doing any justice to saying how good SkinPro has been for me. First off, everyone has been raving about their leading product that has redefined beauty; called Elite Serum. This is the safest way in my opinion to get a cosmetic injection. And the reason why is because it is 100% needle free! Not to mention that&#x27;s it became so popular that it hit #1 on Amazon&#x27;s bestselling list. I just had to see what the fuss was all about, and I was very happy when I saw it for myself. And its great to know that they even have their own full product line to enhance and improve every area of beauty. Don&#x27;t take my word for it though...see for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company ships their products super fast.  I ordered on a Monday around noon EST and I had the product on Thursday.  I didn&#x27;t pay for expedited shipping.  My package came with a care card that explained the directions.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> First things first, SkinPro offers a guarantee.  You have nothing to lose but everything to gain! A friend recommended Elite Serum Rx and I wasnt so psyched about spending the $80. However,  it&#x27;s the best money I have ever spent on a beauty product.  I was sick of baggy eyes and crows feet. So I bought it. Now,  people tell me I look younger and a few very close friends have asked if I had surgery! This eye serum was developed by scientists and the packaging and product reflect the quality this company is known for.  Try it!</li>
            <li> No difference- I loved youthology 90 second serum, but they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  Very disappointed, especially for the money!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a better eye treatment - one that worked - and I thought I would try this one. I cannot express how much I love this product. Simply extravagant. It leaves a great feeling around your eyes and has a very soft and light feeling when applying. The best part - it works. Took care of my tired eyes and minimal dark circles. Also, it helped calm down the tiny visible (to me anyway) lines around the eye are. I am super excited about settling on this serum and not have to go looking for others.</li>
            <li> I’ve always been self-conscious about the unsightly dark circles that were beneath my eyes. Even when I was well rested they did not disappear. The concealer I used was not enough to reduce my tired, puffy eyes and dark circles. I’ve personally tried a lot of eye creams that irritated my skin and failed to live up to their claims. I was frustrated from wasting money and was reluctant to try another brand. When I learned about Elite Serum Rx, I was very skeptical and thought it was another dud product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say that I was wrong. After using the serum for a few weeks, I began to notice subtle changes in the puffiness and dark circles underneath my eyes. I was very surprised by these results. Additionally, another benefit that I love about Elite Serum Rx is that it is not irritating or greasy. This serum is pricey, but it is definitely worth the investment when you look younger and feel more confident about your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that is effectively formulated to decrease dark circles, puffiness, and fine lines.</li>
            <li> After years of trying an infinite number of well-known beauty products to disappear the dark puffy circles under my eyes - with little to no results at all, I was hesitant about purchasing this one, but after reading the reviews it got I decided to give it a chance. I&#x27;ve been using the Elite Serum RX for a little bit over a month now and I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  As far as results,, my dark, puffy circles are greatly improved and the skin around my eyes looks healthier. Before using this product I would use two concealers.  One that had anti-aging properties and then I would put a second concealer over it.  Now I just use my regular foundation and they don&#x27;t show through.</li>
            <li> Elite serum RX is a miracle worker if you have bags and puffiness under your eyes!  I have not only seen incredible results myself, but I have also recommended it to friends and family, who have also been very happy with their results!  It works great on wrinkles too.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The verdict is still out on this product.  I don&#x27;t really have anything bad to say.  The product itself is nice.  Clear, odorless, non tacky, non oily, everything one would look for in a product.  I have never had an issue with the syringe jamming like others have reported.  I just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s doing the trick yet.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while now, although I haven&#x27;t finished an entire syringe yet.  For that, I give it a 4 stars and once I have finished the product completely, I&#x27;ll come back and update as to whether or not I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am a 60+ woman who was concerned about loose, baggy looking skin above and below my eyes. After using the Elite Serum for the past year I have noticed a significant difference in my appearance.  I am also pleased that it does not irritate my eyes, as other creams have done.</li>
            <li> I think 8 hours of sleep is the best eye serum but this stuff helps a bit</li>
            <li> From the very first time I used this product I knew it was going to be my favorite. The dispenser to the fragrance free, clear product, I was hooked.  And after using it for four weeks I had the actual proof that it works. It had diminished dark areas, and gave me an all over glow around my eyes. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in the fine lines I have yet, but I will give it more time.</li>
            <li> I like this serum. After a month and a half the red areas next to my nose have just about disappeared and the texture of my skin has improved. Underneath my eyes used to be bumpy and dry and that has cleared up.  I also use this serum around my mouth to target my laugh lines and I can say those are softer too. I particularly like the way the serum absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t made my T-zone oily (I use it on the lines on my forehead too!)  The only thing is that it&#x27;s expensive and since I use it on other areas of my face I go through it a lot more quickly.  I&#x27;m going to look for a diff product by SkinPro that targets the laugh lines, lines around the nose and forehead lines.</li>
            <li> This serum is good for my eye area because I have started to see my fine lines disappear in a two month period. My dark circles have also lightened up and I knew it was working when two people asked me what I was using. I have genetic dark circles and advancing age and health problems have only made them worse. This is the first product to make a noticeable improvement in my eye area and I am amazed. Perfect for anyone self-conscious about under-eye circles. I plan on using it and I will provide an update on the results after 4 months. It is high priced though so I use it once a day (at night) to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> An exceptional product with some serious research behind it. Try it - it really works!</li>
            <li> You always wonder if you spend this amount of money for an eye product, whether it will pay off. This is worth every hard earned dime!! In about 10 days, I noticed a difference in how I looked around the eyes. Dark circles had faded but not completely diminished and fine lines are also starting to disappear. This is a must have in your skin product line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye product to basically help with brightening my eyes, puffiness, the dark dark circles that I hate. I was just doing trial and error basically. I stuck with things for 2 weeks and nothing, so I&#x27;d switch to the next product. No more switching for me a month going strong and I&#x27;ve received everything I&#x27;m looking for in the eye product.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, I have tried more facial products to help improve my skin.  For me, the biggest concern is how to get smooth soft skin, along with tackling the problem of eye puffiness.. So I really just wanted to find a product that would make my skin smoother and softer to the touch. There are so many products on the market with incredible promises.  They are correct, as my crow’s feet are much improved, but I also wanted my skin to feel softer and look smoother. To my surprise, Elite Serum RX Extra Strength , almost as if reading my mind, added a new ingredient to the serum called Syn®-TC from Pentapharm which increases the formation of collagen that helps smooth and soften the eye area. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin, so it&#x27;s difficult for me to find a good fit, even though I try to use expensive, high quality creams and serums to avoid irritation. The only one that I have used regularly was too heavy, and didn&#x27;t do much for the dark circles under my eyes beyond moisturizing them. But after a recommendation from a friend and reading some good reviews, I decided to take a chance on Elite Serum Rx, and I was truly impressed with the quality and, after some time, the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this serum about four months ago, and I decided to exclusively stick with it for a while simply because it &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; like it was working. It spreads lightly, absorbs nicely, and you feel a refreshing, hydrating sensation after applying it. After about a month of regular usage, I noticed that it started having the desired effect on the puffiness, which gave me confidence to keep pursuing the promised effects - and guess what? After a few more weeks, the area under my eyes began to get (considerably!) lighter. The good results extended to minor wrinkles and the general look/feel of my skin, and the changes recently became more permanent and visible to the untrained eye. It&#x27;s only a matter of patience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m relieved to have found something that exceeds my jaded expectations, and I have no reservations about recommending this product to my friends and family members.</li>
            <li> My mom suffers from dark under eye shadows.  I think it&#x27;s genetic. (great!) Based on other&#x27;s reviews, I bought this product for Mother&#x27;s Day for her to try out, because she&#x27;s my mom and I want her to feel good about herself.  Other products hadn&#x27;t worked, fillers and the like are not an option, and under eye concealer is just so obvious. No matter how many YouTube videos I watch, my concealer does not look flawless like the girls in the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see my mom all the time so when I did see her next I was surprised at how well rested she looked after having used the product for about 6 weeks. She said it goes on smooth, not greasy, and is easy to use.  I&#x27;m not stranger to serums, I know collagen is our friend, and I have learned that you need to spend a bit more to get products that produce results.</li>
            <li> I had previously wrote a not so good review on this item. ..I am now back tracking...The owner of this company did make good on it ...I am grateful that this now has worked out smoothly. I am very happy at the quick reply from this Company to replace broken product/item. Now I can give them 5 stars for service rendered!! Thank you so very much for your quick reply to my problem...that is now  resolved!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a life saver, I really had bad puffy eyes with dark circles under them and some fine lines around the outer edge of my eyes.  This product helped with all of those issues, which is something I hadn&#x27;t found before, an all in one product.  Easy to use and amazing results. Definitely five stars from me.  Even better is that its fragrance free so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I Like This Eye Serum. Seems To Absorb Fairly Well. So Far One Of The Better Eye Serums.</li>
            <li> A big disappointment after reading positive reviews.  It probably would show you some improvement in your eyes if you had never used any product before.  But it has done nothing for dark circles, puffiness or softening wrinkles.  I also use it around my mouth and neck wrinkles--no improvement whatsoever.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  Definitely NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago I noticed dark circles and puffiness around my eyes. I looked in the mirror one day and was unsatisfied with what was staring back at me. Not only did I notice this change myself, but my close friends and family had as well when I asked them about it. They were open and honest with me about how my face was rapidly changing over the years. Things like dark spots, bags, and wrinkles took over causing me to appear way older than I actually was. I knew that I had to do something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From that moment on I’ve been on the search for a product that would reverse signs of aging and rid my eye and forehead area of dark spots, wrinkles, and bags. The first product I came across was a type of anti-aging lotion. I used it for about a month and a half and didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in my appearance. In fact, it made my skin worse in a way as it was becoming much darker than when I had started. I stopped using the product once it ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that failed attempt at my ultimate goal, I almost lost hope. I was questioning if it was even possible to get rid of bags and wrinkles. I did things like cover it with make-up and use concealer, however those things aren’t permanent. I was really in a bad place with my self-confidence, not wanting to go out some days and even bailing on plans with friends and family because of the way I looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all changed when I came across the Elite Serum Rx, however. The product promotes all of the things I was seeking so I knew that I had to give it a try. Still a little weary, though I checked some of the testimonies and reviews from customers who have previously used the product and they reported significant, almost life-changing results. So I ordered me a bottle (or syringe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product first came I was initially surprised with the packaging. I loved how the product looked and was wrapped and I was also surprised by how big the bottle actually was. The firsttime I used it, I noticed immediate results! While it didn’t instantly fix all of my problems, I noticed an immediate look of rejuvenation and that “awake” feeling to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old and most days I look at least 40. I have tried plenty of drugstore methods to deal with the bags and dark circles under my eyes, but it all either didn&#x27;t work at all or stopped working after a few weeks. It was like i became immune to it or my body just decided it just wasn&#x27;t going to cooperate anymore. But then I discovered this stuff! Elite Serum Rx works so well. Where other products would fail after a few weeks, this stuff made a major difference in just over a month. It might seem to be a bit pricey, but it is so worth it. I would pay twice this for results like this product gives!</li>
            <li> I received this to review on my blog.  I’m actually pretty selective which skincare review offers I decide to review because some skincare companies tend to be a lot of bells and whistles without much result .  Elite Serum Rx sparked my curiosity because it contains Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 (brand name: Argireline®) which many experts, including Dr. Oz, say is the best alternative to cosmetic injections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are aging around the eyes (or are interested in premature aging methods) here are the benefits Elite Serum Rx claims to help:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Lifts and Firms the Skin&lt;br /&gt;  Fills Expression Wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;  Smooths out Fine Lines&lt;br /&gt;  Minimizes Eye Puffiness&lt;br /&gt;  Lightens Dark Circles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use Elite Serum Rx, you gently squeeze out just a drop and apply it to your clean eye area twice a day, preferably in the morning and in the evening.  I requested at least 60 days to review this product because a week or two is not nearly enough time to see if skincare is showing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to tell you, though… I’ve never taken before and after shots of anything before.  This is my first time!  And I discovered that photographing your own eye isn’t easy at ALL, so please forgive the disaster of the attached photo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my amateur photography, it’s hard to notice a huge result, but you can probably see that it appears there is a slight improvement. Again, I only used the serum for 6 weeks, which is still a really short amount of time to expect results from skincare. The site recommends using for about 6 months before seeing significant improvements.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a long time. Love how you an feel tightened your skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. Really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with wrinkles around my eyes. Squinting in front of a computer screen all day (at least 12 hours) has wreaked havoc on the skin around my eyes. Within a month of my starting to use the serum, I began to see change in the skin around my eyes. The wrinkles had been reduced. I was still skeptical and continued using it for another month. During that second month, not only did the wrinkles diminish until they were barely noticeable, the skin that I had applied it on actually looked (and felt) younger:  This is now my go to beauty product that I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Five years as a freelancer really began to take a toll on my skin, especially my face. Looking in the mirror, my eyes began to seem sadder and darker than they ever had before. Then, the wrinkles began!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize you could get such serious eye wrinkles in your thirties. Elite Serum Rx, combined with a definite healthy shift in lifestyle choices, really helped me reset the clock. The wrinkles began to fade in just about a month. The skin under my eyes was lightening and looking truly healthy for the first time in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit costly -- and that&#x27;s definitely a concern -- but I just do a small drop when I wake up and in the evening before bed. My first tube is just running out at around 11 weeks of steady applications. If you compare this price to other high end creams, its really not that expensive.</li>
            <li> I love skinpro in general, I&#x27;m open to trying any products by them, because most of them have proven to work for me. Anyways I&#x27;m anemic, which is an iron deficiency, so when I&#x27;m not up on my iron intake my eyes are dark and puffy. But let me say when I use this, it conceals my puffy dark eyes the minute I put it on. It&#x27;s a life saver in a skinny skinny tube. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product! I was skeptical at first but gave it a try. Now I&#x60;m a customer for life! It got rid of my puffiness in just over a week.</li>
