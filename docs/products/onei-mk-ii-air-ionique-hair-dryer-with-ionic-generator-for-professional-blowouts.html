            <li>Have owned for 1.5 years and this hair dryer has made me a happy man.  </li>
            <li>After I had returned the DOA hair dryer, Onei Beauty contacted me wanting me to be happy with my purchase and offered to replace the unit.</li>
            <li>This is great hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>The air speed isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m happy with it and the way it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I was mostly happy with this dryer.</li>
            <li>The blow dryer works great</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is great.  </li>

            <li>Great size and color.</li>
            <li>Great blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>There are a couple of features that would benefit greatly if it came with a manual to explain it.</li>
            <li>I chose the Onei based upon the great reviews, the 4-year warranty, and the price.</li>
            <li>I think this hairdryer is great.</li>
            <li>Was a great gift.</li>
            <li>when visiting friends I used an Ionic hairdryer she had and my hair looked great during our trip.  </li>
            <li>Great investment.  </li>
            <li>It is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Your company is great to deal with.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer -- I purchased it based on the customer reviews -- it was everything everyone said it was.  </li>
            <li>so I was happy to buy the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love Amazon!!    </li>
            <li>Because after all I REALLY LOVE THIS DRYER!!</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is amazing!</li>
            <li>But this one is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>Get your own!</li>
            <li>Nice product!  </li>
            <li>I thought this dryer would be better than those, given the price and excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>one is remarkably quieter - still a noisy gadget, but what a difference.  </li>
            <li>Great optionsl  Feels good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li>The price is excellent for a professional-quality dryer and it&#x27;s strongly constructed.  </li>
            <li>Not the best dryer for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfectly good dryer.</li>
            <li>It works about as good as my $20 dryer that lasted me 7 years.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is as good as all the reviews say it is.</li>
            <li>I did give a good review after a couple weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>Good follow-up from this company</li>
            <li>I figured if it wasn&#x27;t that good</li>
            <li>The Onei-II Ionique Hair Dryer does a really good job drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>I loved it until this morning.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews AND asking my stylist, I decided it would be a good investment.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell you how much loved this dryer...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>If you have a good sniffer, like I do, you probably want to avoid this product.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s good, but not stupendous.</li>
            <li>It also has a good range of settings.</li>
            <li>I have loved doing business with you&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely</li>
            <li>cool air wonderful, medium heat is all required...</li>
            <li>Love love love!!!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Awesome blow dryer and completely worth the money-</li>
            <li>Seems like a great top of the line hair dryer, well built.</li>
            <li>am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Then you can set it on warm and its good.</li>
            <li>All I can say is I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>This one is the most lightweight dryer I&#x27;ve ever held!</li>
            <li>And I love the diffuser that comes with it!</li>
            <li>I am glad I decided to purchase this product!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this dryer!</li>
            <li>She enjoys the performance, the many choices of heat and power plus the outcome!  </li>
            <li>Love the dryer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to know if there is some trick that I haven&#x27;t discovered!</li>
            <li>The Onei blew hot air but wasn&#x27;t like a wind tunnel - it works flawlessly for me.</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love the price!</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>But otherwise I think it a very good dryer and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, I purchased this hair dryer and well - I have gotten a phone call, every day for two weeks, telling me what an amazing hair dryer this is.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing styling tool, and if I had to buy one again</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is light, sleek, and functions great.</li>
            <li>Amazing blow dryer.</li>
            <li>but my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping service was amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is also a nice size and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>It feels so nice</li>
            <li>Another good quality is that for a full-size hair dryer, it is lighter than most.</li>
            <li>Comes with a nice 4 year warranty.</li>
            <li>I liked that this one featured an &amp;#34;on demand&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>a 9&#x27; cord make the hair dryer an excellent choice and should be very reliable.  </li>
            <li>, I felt like it was an extension of my own arm.</li>
            <li>this is a nice dryer</li>
            <li>I never realized how much difference a good hair dryer makes on your hair!!</li>
            <li>The performance of both are good, but the Onei has more adjustment options, so I have to rate it higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am very, very happy with this hair dryer and would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is a good hairdryer and quieter than most.</li>
            <li>Loving.</li>
            <li>I splurged for a really nice blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>We are very picky about hair dryers and this is the best hair dryer we have ever had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blow dryer works nice over all, but set aside</li>
            <li>Nice weight for anyone that has issues with arthritis or tendonitis</li>
            <li>I get nice, voluminous curly hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Onei MK-II Air Ionique Hair Dryer for my wife just over a week ago and she is thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>excellent reviews and decent price.</li>
            <li>Having the ability to just switch it to cool is great.  </li>
            <li>This one works great for my fine hair, and a plus is that I have not had static during the drying process like with the cheaper hairdryers.</li>
            <li>You certainly could pay a lot more for a hair dryer but the Onei is perfect!!</li>
            <li>The cool button is also very nice for finishing touches.</li>
            <li>The cord twists and tangles very, very easily.  </li>
            <li>Love it love it!</li>
            <li>Very good airflow, according to my 43 year old wife with lot&#x27;s of hair!!!  </li>
            <li>There is a good quality, plastic to plastic friction fit.  </li>
            <li>As a person who was in the Hair Care business for more than a decade I can  honestly say that I wish they made products of this quality when I was in the business.  </li>
            <li>Light weight, but seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li>The price on the MK-II was about $30 more than the TT3000 (which she liked)</li>
            <li>Wow - this is the best blow dryer I have ever used (or had used on me at a salon).  </li>
            <li>My hair looks &amp; feels amazing, plus love how quite it is.</li>
            <li>By far the best hair dryer I have owned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer Service: The seller sent me a nice email to make sure I was satisfied with the quality and shipping speed.</li>
            <li>I think that is pretty great customer service.  </li>
            <li>The motor died after a year of very light use.</li>
            <li>Customer service is very important to me and the service they have provided me since they we have been in touch is exemplary.</li>
            <li>It is very light.  </li>
            <li>very smooth...  </li>
            <li>I am sure it works great if someone else is drying your hair ; - )</li>
            <li>As my first dryer, I find it very nice and efficient.</li>
            <li>I read through tons of reviews for this Onei hair dryer and was happy with the positive reviews and the price.</li>
            <li>Though has standard features, the best thing about this hair dryer is practically weightless, almost as light as a feather, love it!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have found everyting to be as advertised or better.</li>
            <li>Really love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Kudos to both :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my stylist told me about it --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments of friends and family who&#x27;ve used it-</li>
            <li>I assume it&#x27;s based on the barrel shape of the Onei dryer vs a more cylindrical barrel like some dryers.</li>
            <li>The quality of the Onei feels/looks better than the sedu I purchased months ago.</li>
            <li>Could&#x27;t ask for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I Love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Using this dryer my looks healthy and shiney and does not get frizzy at all.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Five stars for sure.</li>
            <li>her feedback-in-a-nutshell to me was &amp;#34;I Love It!!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This one is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>Slide the diffuser in along the grooves and twist it 5 degrees or more and it locks into place.whereby a tab on the difuser</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to using this as the reviews from others was outstanding.</li>
            <li>and I researched many different types so that I can make the best decision.</li>
            <li>The dryer has a 4-year warranty, which is mostly unheard of at this price point.</li>
            <li>I bought this hairdryer on the recommendation of so many others&#x27; reviews.  </li>
            <li>but I returned it and purchased another after being impressed with it after only one use.  </li>
            <li>and she thought her hair looked better too.</li>
            <li>I have had it 4 weeks now, and every time I use it I still marvel at how much I love it.</li>
            <li>also love the Ionic technology.</li>
            <li>I am confident if that doesn&#x27;t solve the problem they will continue to assist me.</li>
            <li>I love that about it.</li>
            <li>This arrived fast and in great shape.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks amazing too, shiny ans smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>In fact, we&#x27;ve noticed that her hair has more shine to it since using the MK-II Air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was more than we wanted to pay</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t have chosen a better product myself.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I like this brush, don&#x27;t love it..........</li>

            <li>concentrator is great, it really focuses the air where you want it to go.</li>
            <li>Love the hairdryer</li>
            <li>This was one of the better ones I found.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been weeks now and while the smell is getting better, I still smell it.  </li>
            <li>What more could anyone ask for in a hair dryer?  </li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer but it did break almost a year after I got it.  </li>
            <li>I love the option of switching the ionizer on and off.  </li>
            <li>My wife love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s as satisfied with the quality as I</li>
            <li>I paid over $200 for a T3 and the Onei feels, looks, and sounds like a better product.</li>
            <li>I know she will love it :-)</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best dryers we have ever owned.</li>
            <li>and I love all the options it has with heat/cool, fan speed, etc.</li>
            <li>I was also really impressed with how quiet this dryer is.</li>
            <li>Love that</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love</li>
            <li>No, the neutral Ion setting didn&#x27;t give her any more body/volume than the TT3000 did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe a $180 unit with neutral Ion&#x27;s would give her more volume</li>
            <li>Sure wished someone would have posted a comment like this one</li>
            <li>Love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s practically able to strip paint.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it knowing what I know now.</li>
            <li>Spending more money on a product is sometimes not the better product for my needs.  </li>
            <li>Love the variety of settings.</li>
            <li>I actually took it with her when she had her roots touched-up and the stylist (a friend for years who would tell me what she &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; thought) was impressed as well.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this Onei Mk-l Air Ionque Hair Dryer and it&#x27;s the best ever!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t plugged into the wall.  </li>
            <li>So glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has a longer cord than most.</li>
            <li>Well I had bought the Onei straightener and was in love with</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I paid more for it than one from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I keep it on neutral ions for the most part.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>From Amazon&#x27;s description:  &amp;#34;Guaranteed authentic.</li>
            <li>I really love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It was better than my ancient hair dryer from the 80s/90s</li>
            <li>so I would give it t a 5 star as I love this hairdryer but..</li>
            <li>I love love love it.</li>
            <li>I got it for two weeks now so far so good!</li>
            <li>but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>I have an Onei flat iron that I&#x27;m very happy with</li>
            <li>Hot setting is just right; warm setting works great.</li>
            <li>When my good hair dryer finally stopped working, I decided to purchase the Onei MK-II Air Ionic Hair Dryer, impressed with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I loved it the first time  </li>
            <li>I really could not afford to spend that kind of money again, but I have curly hair so having a good blower to straighten out my hair is important.  </li>
            <li>It is not terribly loud and does an excellent job at drying you hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and shiny and requires no flat ironing, it&#x27;s just perfect.  </li>
            <li>I personally own a supersolano 232b hair dryer, which I am very happy with, but she was not very impressed with it when she visited, so I looked for something with more settings and better for curly hair (my own hair is wavy).</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I was definitely not disappointed!</li>
            <li>hair was so smooth and VERY shiny in the end, I was so happy with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; part does anything at all, and the diffuser dryer doesn&#x27;t seem super effective.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, but it&#x27;s great that you can use the cool shot feature to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; you style when done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It broke just before a job interview, which is very special.</li>
            <li>The diffuser works perfectly fine, and I suspect that most users complaining about it, may not have taken the time to notice that there are 2 grooves along the edge of the cone.</li>
            <li>I am more then happy to blow dry my own hair with the Onei Hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Much lower decibels and a more pleasant, lower frequency sound as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked beautifully in calming the frizzes and finally being able to style my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great - not scorched like with my old dryer.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with my experience so far and have the reviewers to thank.</li>
            <li>You will not regret this investment for healthy, shiny, smooth looking hair.</li>
            <li>The whole transaction was a good experience.</li>
            <li>The dryer arrived faster than anticipated and I was in love the first time I used it!!  </li>
            <li>Cool, medium, high settings great...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to style my hair now.</li>
            <li>I like that the controls are easy to work and do not get accidentally switched when I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
            <li>With the Ionic generator turned OFF my hair does gain volume but it also tangles really easily.</li>
            <li>Makes you hair shiny and fires very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a good hair dryer at a reasonable (not dirt cheap) price, this might be it.</li>
            <li>Drys my hair super fast and leaves it nice and shiny!</li>
            <li>She claims that it is light, easy to handle, dries her hair quicker and over all, does a much better job than her old one.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was prompt and product was in good condition.  </li>
            <li>The price was on target and the shipping was ultra fast -- very pleased with the seller as well.</li>
            <li>She liked it so much that she decided to keep it for herself and made me order another one!</li>
            <li>Love the cool setting.</li>
            <li>a very good product, hope it works for a very long time.....</li>
            <li>After exhaustive research on my part to find the best hair dryer at a given price point, I settled on the Onei MK-II based purely on the Amazon reviews and it apparently paid off.  </li>
            <li>It is light and easy to handle with all the push buttons at your finger tips.  </li>
            <li>dryer is very quiet and I am impressed by how hot it can get.</li>
            <li>It is light, balanced, and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>That being said, my daughter&#x27;s unit which we purchased over 3 years ago is still working fine.</li>
            <li>The dryer is light and easy to control the switches with the hand that is holding the drier.  </li>
            <li>She has fine hair that lacks body.  </li>
            <li>I have fine shoulder length hair with a tendency towards frizz..</li>
            <li>quickly!</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it out of the box and use it!</li>
            <li>It is lightweight,  quieter than most dryers and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Very light and powerful.</li>
            <li>This is a huge plus for us.  </li>
            <li>I made a huge mistake by not returning this hair dryer immediately.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is also light weight.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend who also uses it, even commented on how much he likes it, and he is one picky kind of guy.</li>
            <li>Light weight...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t thank you enough, Onei, for making me so happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using cheap hair dryers from the drug store for years.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is light weight.</li>
            <li>It came with a concentrator nozzle and a diffuser, which is nice if you like to switch up your style from straight to curly.</li>
            <li>Do not be fooled by all of the fabulous reviews for this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight which is a must with my carpel tunnel syndrome.</li>
            <li>Works great and feels like it should last...</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important that a dryer is lightweight.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is fabulous.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The sound is a medium hum, like a space heater but a bit louder.</li>
            <li>I looked all over the internet, but it was discontinued so it wasn&#x27;t available anywhere.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy to say that I have finally found it.</li>
            <li>It truly leaves my hair looking silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This has been a fantastic hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>The dryer itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold and use</li>
            <li>Everyone has commented on how light this dryer is.  </li>
            <li>It is made out of a light plastic, and feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord itself is also flimsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li>The buttons on the side light up, but the motor is done.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and powerfull.</li>
            <li>This is a great hairdryer and it is very quiet compared to others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>great quality and really quiet!</li>
            <li>So far loving it better than the Sedu &amp; Chi.</li>
            <li>I hope it gives me many good hair days in the future!</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, quiet, produces good heat, dries her hair more quickly, and seems to have made a noticeable difference in the appearance of her hair.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for the perfect hair dryer</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Also, the reviews seemed a bit too good to be true, but so far I am finding that they were not misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love my hair with this new dryer!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably light weight, powerful and easy to grip for self-done blow-outs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked and looked, and finally found an amazing hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I originally came onto Amazon to search for  a dryer that I had found in a store that was out of stock.  </li>
            <li>I have had this dryer for about a month and so far I have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottomline: quietest dryer I&#x27;ve ever used and totally worth the money too!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have used some excellent ionic hair dryers in the past and kept waiting for this one to work as well.  </li>
            <li>and so far am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Of course the wife got to it first :)</li>
            <li>This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned...lightweight, and I have NO STATIC ELECTRICITY in my hair after use...</li>
            <li>I also love that there is both a cool shot (if you just need a quick blast of cool air) and a cool temperature setting (for when you want cool air for an extended period of time).</li>
            <li>She says it drys her hair quick and is really light.  </li>
            <li>So far love this dryer!</li>
            <li>Controls are easy to use and in just the right place.  </li>
            <li>so I needed a special dryer and the Onei MK</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s making me want to wash my hair right now!</li>
            <li>I decided that my hair deserves better, this time around, so the old Conair hit the trash can bottom with a satisfying &amp;#34;thud&amp;#34; after I used this dryer for the first time!</li>
            <li>This hairdryer was good while it lasted until it just sputtered out after owning it for less than two years and with very light use.</li>
            <li>My daughter had gotten an ionic hair dryer and told me how much she enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Wife loved it but the electrical cord had a short and it stopped working 3 days ago.  </li>
            <li>I can set the dryer on cool and turn the fan on full blast.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and fairly fast-drying for an 1800 watt dryer.</li>
            <li>So far, my hair has not looked as shiny or smooth as when I used my Jibere, but to be fair, it has been really humid here.</li>
            <li>I believe the manufacture claims the lowest setting is a cool 62°F and the hottest</li>
            <li>Overall I feel like it is a good dryer</li>
            <li>Edit #2: Again, the Cool Shot button is stuck in the on position.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had my replacement one for 5 weeks and now the cool button is stuck.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer, compared it with the SEdu 4000 and ended up returning the Sedu because it was much heavier and louder.  </li>
            <li>and  I like that there is a cool air button</li>
            <li>I liked that, and so far I would recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>cannot say enough good things about this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>cannot say enough good things about this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Still searching for a good dryer that can last.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using this hair dryer I have gotten 4 compliments on how good I look (the only change was the hair dryer).  </li>
            <li>When I told her of all the good reviews I had read about it, she totally agreed with me!!</li>
            <li>I expect the full 4 years.</li>
            <li>I love the weight of this dryer, just the right amount of heat, great cool setting, but after a couple of months the writing around the buttons came off (not a huge deal), then the silver paint on the handle came off, and now it seems the hair dryer is disintegrating.</li>
            <li>It is much quieter than most dryers and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It is long, but it gets kinked very easily and adds weight to the blow drier, which in itself is very light.  </li>
            <li>Our cats get the joy of this Hair Dryer as we give them a Bath every other week.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great blow dryer</li>
            <li>I just love my new hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>When my latest hair dryer started shooting sparks, I knew it was time to get a new one!</li>
            <li>In love with my new hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I love my new hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, light, easy to handle, provides perfect heat and blower settings and dries my hair in half the time without leaving it frizzy.</li>
            <li>delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>It is super lightweight and sleek.  </li>
            <li>When the most recent Conair died, I thought I&#x27;d look around for a better hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Shiny hair in quick time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this dryer was dropped to the tile floor more than once in 2 years, so it&#x27;s possible we damaged it.</li>
            <li>I like how quickly this dryer dries my hair.  </li>
            <li>It works without the heat burning your scalp and it is more quiet than most hair dryers.</li>
            <li>It could just be me, I do move quickly from client to client.</li>
            <li>It has an adequate blowing system and heating for my medium texture of hair.</li>
            <li>Helps reduce frizz, dries hair quickly</li>
            <li>Also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It just blew out; the power switch switched off on it&#x27;s own 2 times and the 3rd time, there was a huge spark and smoke</li>
            <li>Lightweight and quick drying hair dryer</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and as promised.  </li>
            <li>But with Prime you&#x27;ll get it pretty quick!</li>
            <li>I received the MK-II hair dryer fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>This dryer arrived quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>Itdries your hair quickly too.  </li>
            <li>My original one stopped working after about 1 1/2 year, they sent me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>RATING WAS HIGH MY GIRL FRIEND LOVE</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for better customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Highly recommended, both dyer and seller.</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference after using it the first time.</li>
            <li>and they get very hot.</li>
            <li>I normally pay more for a dryer, but I&#x27;m hooked on MK-II.</li>
            <li>And it blows very hot which speeds up my drying time.</li>
            <li>This dryer was fantastic for the first 6 months.</li>
            <li>More than I would normally spend</li>
            <li>Light weight and dries hair fast!  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is very light, super quiet, and dries hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m holding out that this dryer will last a long time despite the whining noise because I&#x27;m really impressed with its performance (hence, the 4 star review.)  </li>
            <li>The dryer&#x27;s best feature is how quiet it is compared to the many that I have owned over the past</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally shop on line much, but did this season, and have been impressed with this personal touch.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered the Onei I accidentally had it shipped to my mom!</li>
            <li>Love the different settings, easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer - very professional results, several heat and speed settings.  </li>
            <li>It makes my fine straight hair shiny and silky but still gives it volumn.</li>
            <li>I am using it now for a few months, and it is really a great dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great tool for everyday drying and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>If you own hair salon, perhaps you&#x27;ll have a different opinion, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>I should add that I rarely ever write reviews.  </li>
            <li>However, I like this product so much, and did so much research, that I felt compelled to do so in hope of saving many of you the aggravation of 4 hours of research.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recomment this product to others who want a nice hair dryer without spending over $100.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>but we both agree that it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is lightweight and powerful.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I use it on warm only as hot can get too hot really fast.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>When you turn on the dryer, you can hear it speed and warm up - there isn&#x27;t that sudden blast of metal smelling heat like the cheaper dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>It does what is says it does, and it is worth the $$.  </li>
            <li>and then I bought my own when she went back.</li>
            <li>When it works, it a lightweight and powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and quiet, great heat, not as much wind</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time reading reviews and trying to find the best hair dryer out there for the money, and this is the one I finally decided on.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money and the time to wait for it to arrive.  </li>
            <li>I love the different settings and it&#x27;s light weight in your hand.</li>
            <li>loved this products and definitely will like to recommend this blowdryer to all of you and absolutely  will keep buying Onei hair products.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth about $30.  </li>
            <li>but if it lasts as expected, it will prove to be a good buy.</li>
            <li>I also think that it leaves my hair soft :)</li>
            <li>I had used my sister in law&#x27;s Paul Mitchel hair dryer(VERY nice hair dryer) which you can find on here for about the same price as this one.</li>
            <li>I can see where it would be useful to a lot of people though.</li>
            <li>When you turn on the dryer, you can hear it speed and warm up - there isn&#x27;t that sudden blast of metal smelling heat like the cheaper dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>THE WAY IT GET HOT FAST AND EASY TO USE ATTACHMENTS</li>
            <li>Very nice  color and design.especially with very very low noises,so that you can use it in the early morning.will recommend friends to have it.</li>
            <li>It seems to me the diffuser makes a pretty good, fairly tight friction fit.  </li>
            <li>hair is kind of wavy &amp; frizzy, but can be styled into a smoother straighter look with the right hair dryer, brush, and flat iron.</li>
            <li>I dropped it and unplugged it right away.  </li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank, and this price tag was right in line with what I wanted to spend.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is very light weight, very quiet, and blow drys my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>But my favorite thing is that the cool shot button actually works!</li>
            <li>Gets my hair nice and smooth if I blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, very powerful and super quiet.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new hair dryer and wanted one that was of good quality and quieter than my last dryer.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quiet, lightweight, easy to use and leaves my hair smooth and shiny without frizz.  </li>
            <li>I want to thank you for a quick delivery, I love this hair dryer, its quiet</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, it has alot of heat settings, the buttons are positioned well, and it works better than my old blow dryer as far as straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was finally ready to replace my 8-year old travel hairdryer  with something more powerful and quite, and yet just as light-weight.</li>
            <li>The hot is really hot - but good when your hair is really wet.  </li>
            <li>The cord is nice and long.</li>
            <li>(BTW, she has very fine, blonde hair).</li>
            <li>I certainly did!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve own it several weeks now and the plastic components still really smell.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer works for both, and dries quickly whether for curly or for straight hair.</li>
            <li>Was a gift for my daughter and she loved it..said it was low in noise and did a great job with her long hair..might have to get the other daughter one..</li>
            <li>Based on her excellent feedback, I would definitely consider purchasing one of these myself - although I love my current hair dryer and won&#x27;t need a new one for a long time yet.</li>
            <li>With the Ionic Generator turned ON the tangles disappear and my hair gets really smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>although I think my personal hair dryer is pretty great too, if it was to break tomorrow, I&#x27;d definitely go for one of these.</li>
            <li>price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and quiet</li>
            <li>The hair dryer has performed very, very well.</li>
            <li>and I hope the cool shot button doesn&#x27;t give me trouble because I really love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it enough to say \\&quot;I love it\\&quot;, but I do like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Melted in my hands the first time I plugged it in.  </li>
            <li>(Maybe I gripped it funny, but it did annoy me every time I used it)</li>
            <li>The power cord broke in the first 60 days.</li>
            <li>I love my Onei MK-II and will never give it back!</li>
            <li>This guarantee was one of the reasons we decided to buy the product in the first place.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THE CONTROLS!  </li>
            <li>The lights came on and the unit got hot but the air didn&#x27;t blow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty descent.</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased had defective testing buttons on its plug</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s possible to have a love affair with a hair dryer, this would be the one.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>For some time now I&#x27;ve been searching for a more quiet hair dryer</li>
            <li>I really love the Onei MK-II dryer &amp; definitely rate this a 5 star  </li>
            <li>should it happen again within a reasonable time frame!</li>
            <li>/&gt;  - 3 settings where many only have 2&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dryer is way too hot.  </li>
            <li>It actually makes my hair look better --</li>
            <li>gives my short hair more body.  </li>
            <li>Love the quiet .  </li>
            <li>Bought it for work as a professional stylist and really love how quiet and light it is.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>So glad I found it on Amazon after a very extensive search.</li>
            <li>Would not do this again because it is too much of a hassle!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s quiet on top of it all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know there was a difference between cheap dryers and a professional dryer.</li>
            <li>Love how it is so quiet as well.</li>
            <li>My life is so funny like that.</li>
            <li>I set mine on negative ion, which helps my hair look great before work and after the gym.</li>
            <li>after too many drops it finally stop working.</li>
            <li>well, Love the different settings.</li>
            <li>I also love how it has an actual cool setting as well as the normal button.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t convinced that it would be worth it to spend that much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many times to untwist the cord, but it coils back on itself again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is 2.5 ounces lighter than the TT3000 (according to our digital postage scale) and she&#x27;s OK with it&#x27;s performance</li>
            <li>The cheap one she had before was soooooo loud in the mornings would wake me up.</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>I was more concerned with having multiple speeds and heat settings which this has.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up and ship it back after my first use (as I was tempted to do)</li>
            <li>One last thing--I already knocked this hair dryer off my counter top, and it survived, seemingly without any problems.</li>
            <li>The first time she used the dryer</li>
            <li>It is quiet, quick dry and even looks good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviewers commented on how great the Onei dryer was, citing it&#x27;s speed in drying, it&#x27;s ionic component that left hair smooth, and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was.  </li>
            <li>For the first few months I was greatly impressed with how quiet and strong the motor is; I have really long hair</li>
            <li>I really liked it until it abruptly died in December 2014.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part is the soft sound and the long cord.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a top-performing dryer, I would highly recommend trying this dryer first!</li>
            <li>Long cord is a plus and very light weight.</li>
            <li>The dryer is very light weight and comes with a long cord allowing for plenty of movement.</li>
            <li>They responded quickly and are sending me a new diffuser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, light and dries hair super fast.</li>
            <li>The trick to making the best use of this hair dryer is using the regular ion setting when drying and then switching to the negative ion to give your hair that sleek, shiny look.</li>
            <li>I love how quiet and so fast it works.</li>
            <li>Has a great long lead to move around as you dry your hair.</li>
            <li>I love the low volume of the hair dryer, love the ionic switch, and it really does dry well.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that tends to be frizzy, and it really helps to keep it sleek in the hot, humid summer months.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s possible the blower fan stopped due to it being dropped and it is otherwise a great dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love the long cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly and with more volume than my previous dryer.</li>
            <li>I must admit my expectations were fairly high, as I decided to buy the dryer initially from outstanding reviews.</li>
            <li>It is an incredible hair dryer - quiet and really powerful and it cost less than $100!!!  </li>
            <li>I needed to replace my dryer quickly as the dog chewed the plug off of the cord of the old one.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, quiet and easy to operate .</li>
            <li>It also gets really hot which helps drying time and it&#x27;s extremely quiet which is also important when trying to hear your client while blow drying.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is very quite, light weight, dry quick and well made.</li>
            <li>Despite the blower strength, the hair dryer is pretty quiet and fairly light.</li>
            <li>Also love that it came with a diffuser for when I want to dry my hair curly.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this dryer.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer is VERY lightweight, amke my hair dry VERY quickly and makes my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After years with my old hairdryer, I found that the new, cheaper ones were just that, cheap.  </li>
            <li>Also, it dries my hair very quickly and is not heavy like my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>My favorite features are its very long cord, light weight, and quiet motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Although I do not need the long cord now, it would have been great in other bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>I have RA and have a hard time gripping and the weight is so light I can dry my hair more.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, not the thick curly that drives most shoppers toward a certain brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite, has a super long cord, and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>As I researched dryers I read that people with fine hair will get better volume &amp; body if they don&#x27;t use NEGATIVE Ion dryers but instead use NEUTRAL Ion dryers.  </li>
            <li>The high heat is extremely hot and damaging to hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and quiet, dries hair fast and evenly.  </li>
            <li>Well, my pet peeve is loud hair dryers, as I value my hearing, and this is the quietest hair dryer I&#x27;ve had that is still powerful and dries my hair fast.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, which is a huge plus because my husband already contributes some hearing loss to my blow dryers over the years.</li>
            <li>but I havent recently because this dryer makes a huge difference in my hair texture.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>hairblower is VERY QUIET and light to hold.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend product and seller!</li>
            <li>So, though my hair is much shorter than hers, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Since we just bought it, I can&#x27;t say much about</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>This dryer dries fast and makes my hair looks voluminous.  </li>
            <li>I agree the manual does not provide enough information about the blue/green light.  </li>
            <li>but the key is that it is LIGHT weight.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much insight for the hair dryer&#x27;s performance as it was a Xmas gift for my wife but</li>
            <li>I went from having to wear air-plugs when my wife blow-dried her hair (in the bathroom with door closed) to not being able to hear the blow-dryer.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s quiet AND light.  </li>
            <li>It is also very ridged and when it gets kinked it often moves around on the counter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter, but if I were to buy another one, I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on it.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer makes my hair much smoother while protecting the ends.</li>
            <li>If it reached farther into the kitchen it would have been a real hit.</li>
            <li>Whatever voodoo they are using, I approve whole heartedly.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a dryer that was quiet and light.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a dryer that was quiet and light.</li>
            <li>Quiet, light weight, and has lots of heat and air options.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>She says that it dries her hair fast without leaving it frizzy.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve never paid so much for a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li>She loves how it dries without drying out hair, and how the flexibility in settings makes it much, much easier for dealing with brittle, curly hair.</li>
            <li>so she can really see what this hair dryer can do.    </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have to really work at it to get it to stay on.  </li>
            <li>THis dryer is quiet, light, and I don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair after.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate it and have changed my review to reflect this.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t write much about the features, but I do know that she loves it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much much cheaper hair dryers go for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I had a fantastic hair day, and got several complements.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cheap hair dryers last for years!</li>
            <li>And to boot it&#x27;s a fabulous Christmas present!!</li>
            <li>as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t rate this five stars because I expected more blowing power.</li>
            <li>My birthday gift to my wife was received very well and she loves the quality of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>would reccomend this dryer to anyone that wants a quality dryer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have buyer&#x27;s remorse very often.  </li>
            <li>Very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to replace this dryer, and I&#x27;m much, much happier with the Bayblis Pro.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely agree.  </li>
            <li>It also did the job much faster.</li>
            <li>It arrived so fast to my door</li>
            <li>and I use it on my shampooed  hair and it dries fast</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I got this home and immediately plugged it in to find it has a lower pitched noise that is absolute music to my ears.  </li>
            <li>, I really didn&#x27;t realize that a dryer could make that much difference</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This is a sleek modern piece that lives up to its on-line product description and specifications.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate it D.R.G. Trading.  </li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>It is indeed speedy, and light, and quiet.  </li>
            <li>I chose the product because the ad stated it was quiet, light powerful, professional quality.</li>
            <li>Nice to know I wasted 90.00.</li>
            <li>So far I love it , very quiet!</li>
            <li>Definitely her favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS DRYER, BECAUSE HAS SEVERAL DRYING SETTING, COOL, WARM, OR HOT, HIGH , LOW, NEGATIVE ION, NETURAL ION,  </li>
            <li>My hair always looks exactly like I had imagined or better in less time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, and it is very quiet compared to other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>I have long curly hair that need a strong blowout.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quiet and doesn&#x27;t get too hot on the Medium setting as with many other hair dryers.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my new dryer and my hair seems healthier and not as dry.  </li>
            <li>My old dryer died and I needed to get a new one quickly.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the fact that my hair does feel healthier but dry time which was supposed to be cut in half was not so.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>This is why I needed a more expensive dryer, and was willing to pay more for it.</li>
            <li>will note that I a bit concerned about making this purchase because I had never heard of Onei before and because you can&#x27;t find much about them online (the company does have a decent website).</li>
            <li>The dryer is plenty hot, but soooo much quieter than my old Revlon one.  </li>
            <li>The extra long cord is also nice.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it was that it does cut down on drying times.</li>
            <li>As mentioned in many other reviews, I love that it emit much less noise than many other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>I can talk to people and even listen to music with the hairdryer on high because it has a low hum rather than a high pitched sound and does not hurt your ear drums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple months the motor has started to make a whining noise when set to high; since I paid $80 for this dryer, I have treated it really well and am worried that it might be breaking already.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how long this product will last, but feel confident that the company will take good care of me</li>
            <li>What I love about this dryer is that I no longer have to go clear across to another part of our home to dry my hair in the morning when my family is still asleep.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised at how gentle the air flow comes out &amp; how fast my hair dries.  </li>
            <li>It worked fantastically for the first couple of months, but in October, the hair dryer unexpectedly stopped working.</li>
            <li>- Light weight, especially for such a powerful unit</li>
            <li>I pressed the Cool Shot button to set my curl and the button would not pop back up.</li>
            <li>At first, when it didn&#x27;t roar like my old one</li>
            <li>It is not really powerful, but it is okay with me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why I never realized that a good hair dryer could make such a difference, but I really wish I had figured it out sooner!</li>
            <li>So far, I am enjoying this hair dryer especially the quick dry time.</li>
            <li>I had the new one in 2 days!</li>
            <li>I believe the &amp;#34;neutral ion&amp;#34; setting is for more texturized/curly styles, so I don&#x27;t typically use that one.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how smooth my hair got just from blowing it dry.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a decent hair dryer that would not cost an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a hassle than anything, especially with our humid summer starting and</li>
            <li>The main characteristic I searched for was the sound volume and pitch.</li>
            <li>She really likes it, and it&#x27;s much quieter than her old hair dryer, so</li>
            <li>Other hair dryers I used usually last more than 2.5 years!</li>
            <li>That was one of the main reasons I selected this dryer.  </li>
            <li>mainly use the &amp;#34;negative ion&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Even though I use the same products as my hair stylist, my hair always looked better after I left the salon than anything I could do my self.  </li>
            <li>There is a wide range of  blower strength and heat available for this hairdryer, and for blowdrying straight, I need to use one notch below the maximum for both.</li>
            <li>I  never thought a particular type of hair dryer could made a difference</li>
            <li>It had by far the largest percent of positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is actually true - the pitch is not really a pitch, but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about ordering this since no one who had reviewed it yet mentioned how it performed on curly hair, other than to say it straightens great.</li>
            <li>I really believe that, once I get used to blowing my hair out again, I will be able to dry and style my hair with no flat iron</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>The high setting is like a kitchen fan.</li>
            <li>It is much quieter than my previous dryer, and it dries my hair quickly on the warm setting which I feel is less damaging.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I was somewhat skeptical of spending even $80 on a dryer as my last adventure had not been very successful.  </li>
            <li>Quiet, very light and long cord, work as promised,</li>
            <li>This hair drier cuts down on my time significantly and my hair looks healthier than it has every been!  </li>
            <li>far my wife really likes it.</li>
            <li>I am very please with how soft and shining my heair looks by using this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a couple of weeks, and so far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really notice quicker drying times than my old CHI dryer which I loved.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But from my observation, this hair dryer was much quieter than her old one.</li>
            <li>(Been using the dryer everyday for more than a month.)  </li>
            <li>Very quiet, yet powerful and leaves hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Just the customer service was golden to me until I realized their product was equally as golden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a quiet, powerful &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have been using this dryer for a few months now and love it.</li>
            <li>Well worth spending the extra money!  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, but powerful.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money if it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Very quiet but powerful.  </li>
            <li>it was worth it, especially since it had a Negative/Neutral Ion switch.  </li>
            <li>I have long, full hair that is wavy/frizzy.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I often didn&#x27;t dry all the way because it took too long, but now my hair looks great everyday because it works so effectively by drying so fast.  </li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s running the thing for minutes a day right next to her ears :</li>
            <li>Will definitely not pay what it&#x27;s going for right now.</li>
            <li>Super long cord makes it #1</li>
            <li>I dry it part way on the medium setting and finish with the cool.</li>
            <li>I kinda figured there would be a little more information regarding the settings in the manual, but it&#x27;s a pretty basic phamplet.  </li>
            <li>After I dry my hair, I use the cool setting on high and gently cool down my whole hair.  </li>
            <li>I love that this dryer is so quiet I can blow dry my hair even after everyone has gone to sleep!</li>
            <li>I do get some flyaway &amp; static, but my hair isn&#x27;t totally dried out &amp; is easy to comb through, even with a tight perm.</li>
            <li>Every other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned has one, and they&#x27;re important to help keep hair and lint out of the dryer itself.  </li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t hear it running from bed when my wife is using it behind a closed bathroom door) and has very good airflow, I will replace it with the new model.  </li>
            <li>I went thru chemo and my new hair is frizzy</li>
            <li>No problem with my new hair dryer; I can add volume, softness and shine.  </li>
            <li>I had bought this for my daughter who needed a new hair dryer, so I read a lot of reviews and decided on this one.</li>
            <li>I want you to send me a new one.  </li>
            <li>Please contact me to send me a new one.</li>
            <li>I sent it to them Thursday and they sent me tracking and my new one should arrive today (Tuesday).  </li>
            <li>I needed a new hair dryer</li>
            <li>My hair stylist mentioned getting a new Ionic hair dryer</li>
            <li>Im hopeful that this is a just an anomaly  and that the company will send me a new one....</li>
            <li>The sound from this dryer is very soft and soothing unlike all the other hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>, it dries my very long hair quickly.</li>
            <li>For what I spent on this hair dryer, I&#x27;ll go with a brand that works for more than two years and a company that actually honors their warranty.</li>
            <li>A powerful hair dryer that is not heavy and is quiet!</li>
            <li>In with the new, out with the old!</li>
            <li>I use the ion feature at the end and it made my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Compared to my supersolano, it is slower, but has many advantages: it weighs less, the cord doesn&#x27;t seem as ridiculously prone to becoming a tangly overly-long mess, and the settings allow for more flexibility in drying your hair.</li>
            <li>It does get hot &amp; I love that you can turn the heat setting down, without sacrificing the force of air &amp; still get your hair dry in no time!  </li>
            <li>Why buy another if the first one broke after only 1 1/2 years?  </li>
            <li>If you can get past that then you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer has far exceeded my expectations on both!  </li>
            <li>This is the first hair dryer that is so low noise.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer but why is it more expensive 5 months later?</li>
            <li>It seems like the middle is already too hot for me.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my husband commented on how quiet that hair dryer was.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, quiet and drys my hair fast without leaving it frizzy!</li>
            <li>But because I use it almost every day and enjoy its performance and its looks, it is worth a few extra dollars.</li>
            <li>I was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking</li>
            <li>The lightweight of the dryer makes blow outs of my long hair SO much easier - less stress and sweating before I go out :).  </li>
            <li>Normally, I spend a good half hour to 45 mins just getting my hair dry--not blowing it out, not using any brushes or styling tools/techniques, just getting it dry so that I can use my flat iron.</li>
            <li>As for me, I&#x27;m going back to BayBliss for a new hair dryer (costs less, better</li>
            <li>As for me, I&#x27;m going back to BayBliss for a new hair dryer (costs less, better</li>
            <li>Not sure I really noticed a huge difference between the settings, but maybe time will tell.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length, not thick but not thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a new hair dryer, my 8 year old Conair dried my hair just fine, or so I thought.  </li>
            <li>As good as my much more expensive hair dryer, if not better.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I would buy any $15 hair dryer but over the past few years the noise level in most hairdryers bothers me; therefore, I sought out a hairdryer that would be of good quality, last for several years, and was also quiet.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, it comes with a limited warranty; if the product does break, I&#x27;ll have to take it up with the manufacturer and report back.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is that it doesn&#x27;t produce a ton of noise like the T3 I previously had, and if you have a sleeping baby in the next room you&#x27;ll really appreciate the low noise it makes.</li>
            <li>It was pretty quiet and did the job every other day - pretty normal usage.  </li>
            <li>Even though it produces a great deal of energy, it only has a faint hum when in use.</li>
            <li>This by far has surpassed my expectations &amp; my experience with the Chi &amp; Sedu.</li>
            <li>The packaging of the dryer far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>Is it too early to give 5 stars since I have had the product for one week?</li>
            <li>B00APV7OWG Onei MK-II Air Ionique Hair Dryer with Ionic Generator for Professional Blowouts]]</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a professional style blow dryer.</li>
            <li>My old blow dryer didn&#x27;t give volume to my hair as this dryer does.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a solid purchase, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I purchased it based on the 5-star reviews it had received from the few reviewers available at the time.</li>
            <li>If anyone has had such an experience and can help us out, we would be really thankful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For 10 years I&#x27;ve been loosing my mind having to listen to my wife&#x27;s ridiculously loud hear dryer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how shiny and soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny and soft when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I like it that my hair feels soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the Onei to anyone who wants a quality dryer.</li>
            <li>My old ionic dryer was dying-</li>
            <li>I like that you can switch the ion on/off, and that heat/air settings are completely adjustable.  </li>
            <li>Mine lasted 4 months and completely died.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast at drying and quiet.</li>
            <li>My husband mention how quiet  this blow dryer is to use and how fast it dries the hair.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by my findings.</li>
            <li>Professional 4 year warranty and</li>
            <li>And it does come with a diffuser, but since I have straight asian hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nine months old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now ecstatic that I didn&#x27;t find the same model I had before, because this is SO much</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, is shiny and dries evenly.  </li>
            <li>so I could gauge it&#x27;s performance over a long period of time instead of just writing a first impression.  </li>
            <li>My hair dries so fast I have extra time in the mornings..</li>
            <li>Think of those old corded phone cords.  </li>
            <li>saw no difference in the green light/blue light settings for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Well today it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>So far, this one seems well made</li>
            <li>The only reason I can&#x27;t give it five stars was that the documentation was very sparse.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and quiet.  </li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for changing my life through exposure to products that actually work!</li>
            <li>This one is quiet and efficient (fast).</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it not heavy.</li>
            <li>then my old $40 Revlon from Walmart.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the Onei to anyone who wants a quality dryer.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy curly hair and this dryer definitely does its job.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft with this dryer and it doesnt frizz out.  </li>
            <li>Really worth the amount spent.  </li>
            <li>I like, and if it only lasts another couple of years, it&#x27;s still worth the extra $30 or so, but I am dropping a star for the longevity.</li>
            <li>My main complaint about this product is its strong plastic odor.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product and hope it lasts as long as other reviewers said it did!</li>
            <li>It manages to dry your hair with high heat in a gentle way.  </li>
            <li>No frizzy hair or dry ends, and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li>and really can get hot so less drying time.  </li>
            <li>The cool setting actually gets very cold, which is also  a great bonus for locking in curl and reducing frizz.</li>
            <li>I can simply close my bedroom door and people in the other bedrooms aren&#x27;t disturbed by the sound of my dryer.  </li>
            <li>I like the medium setting, since the high is a little too powerful for my liking, it just splatters water all over my mirror.</li>
            <li>I am able to dry my hair in about half the time w/o a lot of frizz.  </li>
            <li>, it dries my hair fast, I have very little frizz, I purchased the flat iron by the same brand name and love it just as well.</li>
            <li>There are two settings for ionic, and I don&#x27;t know what the other setting is supposed to do, but the other setting does introduce static, so I use one ionic setting at all times.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I have purchased as after using the first, I decided to throw away the one at our second home and replace it with one of these..</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer because it works well and is very quiet compared to the ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
            <li>Drys my hair quickly with less frizzy/dried out hair.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Blowout&amp;#34; styling results were not as good as I get with my drugstore cheapie; hairs would get chomped and tangled in the dryer; poor button placement so the controls were frequently switched on/off, high/low by the palm of my hand while I was trying to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Initially I liked it because it was a little lighter than typical</li>
            <li>It has a long cord and lots of settings that actually differ which makes it easy to dry hair for kids as well as adults.</li>
            <li>so I could really care less how much noise it makes.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized how much time the old dryer was taking to dry and style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Claire</li>
            <li>Love the controls for fan speed and temperature because they are easy to push, unlike my other which slid and were difficult to use.  </li>
            <li>So far very surprised &amp; looking to see if this will outlast my last dryer a wigo(5yrs).  </li>
            <li>The other advantages are the multiple heat/cool settings, length of the power cord and the cool shot button.  </li>
            <li>I was crushed when her first comments were:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>Yep, that&#x27;s right; I paid nearly $100 for a fancy hair dryer that lasted less than 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair, and this dryer makes my hair look as if I just stepped out of the salon.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient because I&#x27;m bending over a lot, plus having to maneuver around other people and big counters when getting ready at the gym.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient because I&#x27;m bending over a lot, plus having to maneuver around other people and big counters when getting ready at the gym.</li>
            <li>I asked about the warranty and was told they would give me a discount to allow me to purchase a new one for only $60.  </li>
            <li>Only issue I have is the concentrator does not fit the nozzle accurately.  </li>
            <li>It is fast, efficient, and doesn&#x27;t dry outta hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very prone to dry and brittle ends.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast I could blow dry my hair</li>
            <li>Instead of blowing my hair to dry it out, it gently blows heat at target area and dries hair faster, without wildness and frizz.</li>
            <li>It drys quickly, the condition of my hair feels like my hairdresser dried my hair.</li>
            <li>but I barely had to use my straightener to finish the job!</li>
            <li>Like it a lot, wish it had a little more power, but I like how quiet it is since I have to blow dry my hair in the morning while my husband is still asleep.</li>
            <li>, my hair doesn&#x27;t require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it&#x27;s actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s because on high fan the air volume was equal to the low fan speed of the TT3000.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Read the other positive reviews and decided to purchase this model.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s quiet and with the long cord it makes it very useable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional but have naturally wavy hair which is prone to frizz and fly-away action.  </li>
            <li>The difference in quality was instantly apparent.</li>
            <li>It is definitely faster and quieter than my old dryer -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to adapt to the controls being on the outside of the handle.(my old one</li>
            <li>My old ionic dryer left my hair in shiny, silky condition.  </li>
            <li>My old ionic dryer left my hair in shiny, silky condition.  </li>
            <li>I replaced my old dryer that was similar to this one</li>
            <li>So disappointing because I really loved this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I really think if anything went wrong within a reasonable time period that they would do what they could to make it right.</li>
            <li>new review is LONG overdue.&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li>There is a slight smell when you first use the dryer</li>
            <li>This is an appliance that I use at least once every day, it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It is replacing an old Brookstone that was very quiet but also pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers)</li>
            <li>I stumbled across the positive reviews for the Onei MKII while researching several other hairdryers (T3 featherweight, Elchim 2001 and BaBlyiss 2800).</li>
            <li>Only thing I would change are the lack of detail in the \\&quot;instruction\\&quot; manual, but thanks to this review section it&#x27;s not really needed.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer to replace a Chi dryer, one almost twice as expensive as this one, that was none-too impressive and had broken on me twice in a year.  </li>
            <li>I will not be trying to run this company down again as the first time was hassle enough.  </li>
            <li>The first one I bought burnt out on me in less than a week..shipped it back and gave it another try.</li>
            <li>After a year and a half the cool button jammed and I had to pry it out.  </li>
            <li>exactly as I want - in half the time!</li>
            <li>I have super thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair and have been using a cheap drugstore dryer for the past several years.</li>
            <li>I am surprised it took so long!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to explain, but I&#x27;ve had other hair appliances that I paid much less for, and the cords all felt superior (thick, more substantial weight) to the one on this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I did end up using my flat iron on a few spots, but I think that was entirely user error and expect it to get better with a little practice.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry in half the time and it&#x27;s much quieter than my old 2500 watt con air.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t time it, but I would guess maybe 3 minutes to be completely dry, &amp; it had been taking about 15 minutes with my old one that fried my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant on spending this much, since my previous $30 Revlon lasted me 13 years.</li>
            <li>I made the blow dryer purchase based on previous reviews and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, it actually made me a little nervous because it was so quiet</li>
            <li>A little difficult to work the buttons one handed at first, but I&#x27;m sure that I just have to get used to it  --</li>
            <li>The Warranty has only a few months left and after promising to send a replacement, they have not honored their warranty!</li>
            <li>It is very quite, dries my hair in half the time, and feels like it will last.</li>
            <li>I have taken to wearing a pony tail far too often because it is such a pain to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this dryer  based on all the good reviews but also a little apprehensive because of of the few negative reviews, but because of the price, I decided to try it.</li>

            <li> Have owned for 1.5 years and this hair dryer has made me a happy man.  </li>
            <li> After I had returned the DOA hair dryer, Onei Beauty contacted me wanting me to be happy with my purchase and offered to replace the unit.</li>
            <li> This is great hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> The air speed isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m happy with it and the way it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I was mostly happy with this dryer.</li>
            <li> The blow dryer works great</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great medium priced product.  </li>
            <li> It does everything it claims and I am extremely happy that I went ahead and made the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Great size and color.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> There are a couple of features that would benefit greatly if it came with a manual to explain it.</li>
            <li> I chose the Onei based upon the great reviews, the 4-year warranty, and the price.</li>
            <li> I think this hairdryer is great.</li>
            <li> Was a great gift.</li>
            <li> when visiting friends I used an Ionic hairdryer she had and my hair looked great during our trip.  </li>
            <li> Great investment.  </li>
            <li> It is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Your company is great to deal with.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer -- I purchased it based on the customer reviews -- it was everything everyone said it was.  </li>
            <li> so I was happy to buy the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love Amazon!!    </li>
            <li> Because after all I REALLY LOVE THIS DRYER!!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is amazing!</li>
            <li> But this one is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> Get your own!</li>
            <li> Nice product!  </li>
            <li> I thought this dryer would be better than those, given the price and excellent reviews.</li>
            <li> one is remarkably quieter - still a noisy gadget, but what a difference.  </li>
            <li> Great optionsl  Feels good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li> The price is excellent for a professional-quality dryer and it&#x27;s strongly constructed.  </li>
            <li> Not the best dryer for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfectly good dryer.</li>
            <li> It works about as good as my $20 dryer that lasted me 7 years.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is as good as all the reviews say it is.</li>
            <li> I did give a good review after a couple weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Good follow-up from this company</li>
            <li> I figured if it wasn&#x27;t that good</li>
            <li> The Onei-II Ionique Hair Dryer does a really good job drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> I loved it until this morning.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews AND asking my stylist, I decided it would be a good investment.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell you how much loved this dryer...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> If you have a good sniffer, like I do, you probably want to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s good, but not stupendous.</li>
            <li> It also has a good range of settings.</li>
            <li> I have loved doing business with you&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely</li>
            <li> cool air wonderful, medium heat is all required...</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Awesome blow dryer and completely worth the money-</li>
            <li> Seems like a great top of the line hair dryer, well built.</li>
            <li> am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Then you can set it on warm and its good.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> This one is the most lightweight dryer I&#x27;ve ever held!</li>
            <li> And I love the diffuser that comes with it!</li>
            <li> I am glad I decided to purchase this product!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this dryer!</li>
            <li> She enjoys the performance, the many choices of heat and power plus the outcome!  </li>
            <li> Love the dryer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to know if there is some trick that I haven&#x27;t discovered!</li>
            <li> The Onei blew hot air but wasn&#x27;t like a wind tunnel - it works flawlessly for me.</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love the price!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> But otherwise I think it a very good dryer and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I purchased this hair dryer and well - I have gotten a phone call, every day for two weeks, telling me what an amazing hair dryer this is.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing styling tool, and if I had to buy one again</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is light, sleek, and functions great.</li>
            <li> Amazing blow dryer.</li>
            <li> but my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Also, the shipping service was amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is also a nice size and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> It feels so nice</li>
            <li> Another good quality is that for a full-size hair dryer, it is lighter than most.</li>
            <li> Comes with a nice 4 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I liked that this one featured an &amp;#34;on demand&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> a 9&#x27; cord make the hair dryer an excellent choice and should be very reliable.  </li>
            <li> , I felt like it was an extension of my own arm.</li>
            <li> this is a nice dryer</li>
            <li> I never realized how much difference a good hair dryer makes on your hair!!</li>
            <li> The performance of both are good, but the Onei has more adjustment options, so I have to rate it higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am very, very happy with this hair dryer and would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a good hairdryer and quieter than most.</li>
            <li> Loving.</li>
            <li> I splurged for a really nice blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> We are very picky about hair dryers and this is the best hair dryer we have ever had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blow dryer works nice over all, but set aside</li>
            <li> Nice weight for anyone that has issues with arthritis or tendonitis</li>
            <li> I get nice, voluminous curly hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Onei MK-II Air Ionique Hair Dryer for my wife just over a week ago and she is thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> excellent reviews and decent price.</li>
            <li> Having the ability to just switch it to cool is great.  </li>
            <li> This one works great for my fine hair, and a plus is that I have not had static during the drying process like with the cheaper hairdryers.</li>
            <li> You certainly could pay a lot more for a hair dryer but the Onei is perfect!!</li>
            <li> The cool button is also very nice for finishing touches.</li>
            <li> The cord twists and tangles very, very easily.  </li>
            <li> Love it love it!</li>
            <li> Very good airflow, according to my 43 year old wife with lot&#x27;s of hair!!!  </li>
            <li> There is a good quality, plastic to plastic friction fit.  </li>
            <li> As a person who was in the Hair Care business for more than a decade I can  honestly say that I wish they made products of this quality when I was in the business.  </li>
            <li> Light weight, but seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> The price on the MK-II was about $30 more than the TT3000 (which she liked)</li>
            <li> Wow - this is the best blow dryer I have ever used (or had used on me at a salon).  </li>
            <li> My hair looks &amp; feels amazing, plus love how quite it is.</li>
            <li> By far the best hair dryer I have owned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer Service: The seller sent me a nice email to make sure I was satisfied with the quality and shipping speed.</li>
            <li> I think that is pretty great customer service.  </li>
            <li> The motor died after a year of very light use.</li>
            <li> Customer service is very important to me and the service they have provided me since they we have been in touch is exemplary.</li>
            <li> It is very light.  </li>
            <li> very smooth...  </li>
            <li> I am sure it works great if someone else is drying your hair ; - )</li>
            <li> As my first dryer, I find it very nice and efficient.</li>
            <li> I read through tons of reviews for this Onei hair dryer and was happy with the positive reviews and the price.</li>
            <li> Though has standard features, the best thing about this hair dryer is practically weightless, almost as light as a feather, love it!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have found everyting to be as advertised or better.</li>
            <li> Really love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to both :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my stylist told me about it --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments of friends and family who&#x27;ve used it-</li>
            <li> I assume it&#x27;s based on the barrel shape of the Onei dryer vs a more cylindrical barrel like some dryers.</li>
            <li> The quality of the Onei feels/looks better than the sedu I purchased months ago.</li>
            <li> Could&#x27;t ask for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I Love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Using this dryer my looks healthy and shiney and does not get frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Five stars for sure.</li>
            <li> her feedback-in-a-nutshell to me was &amp;#34;I Love It!!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This one is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> Slide the diffuser in along the grooves and twist it 5 degrees or more and it locks into place.whereby a tab on the difuser</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this as the reviews from others was outstanding.</li>
            <li> and I researched many different types so that I can make the best decision.</li>
            <li> The dryer has a 4-year warranty, which is mostly unheard of at this price point.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer on the recommendation of so many others&#x27; reviews.  </li>
            <li> but I returned it and purchased another after being impressed with it after only one use.  </li>
            <li> and she thought her hair looked better too.</li>
            <li> I have had it 4 weeks now, and every time I use it I still marvel at how much I love it.</li>
            <li> also love the Ionic technology.</li>
            <li> I am confident if that doesn&#x27;t solve the problem they will continue to assist me.</li>
            <li> I love that about it.</li>
            <li> This arrived fast and in great shape.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks amazing too, shiny ans smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> In fact, we&#x27;ve noticed that her hair has more shine to it since using the MK-II Air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was more than we wanted to pay</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t have chosen a better product myself.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> This is better than a T3 and it comes with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, don&#x27;t love it..........</li>
            <li> Every time I use this dryer i feel like I am at a salon because the blow dryer is top of the line.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how great this hairdryer really is.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to keep your finger on it like most dryers.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.</li>
            <li> favorite part is the quietness of this dryer.</li>
            <li> concentrator is great, it really focuses the air where you want it to go.</li>
            <li> Love the hairdryer</li>
            <li> This was one of the better ones I found.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been weeks now and while the smell is getting better, I still smell it.  </li>
            <li> What more could anyone ask for in a hair dryer?  </li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer but it did break almost a year after I got it.  </li>
            <li> I love the option of switching the ionizer on and off.  </li>
            <li> My wife love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s as satisfied with the quality as I</li>
            <li> I paid over $200 for a T3 and the Onei feels, looks, and sounds like a better product.</li>
            <li> I know she will love it :-)</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best dryers we have ever owned.</li>
            <li> and I love all the options it has with heat/cool, fan speed, etc.</li>
            <li> I was also really impressed with how quiet this dryer is.</li>
            <li> Love that</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love</li>
            <li> No, the neutral Ion setting didn&#x27;t give her any more body/volume than the TT3000 did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe a $180 unit with neutral Ion&#x27;s would give her more volume</li>
            <li> Sure wished someone would have posted a comment like this one</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically able to strip paint.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it knowing what I know now.</li>
            <li> Spending more money on a product is sometimes not the better product for my needs.  </li>
            <li> Love the variety of settings.</li>
            <li> I actually took it with her when she had her roots touched-up and the stylist (a friend for years who would tell me what she &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; thought) was impressed as well.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this Onei Mk-l Air Ionque Hair Dryer and it&#x27;s the best ever!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t plugged into the wall.  </li>
            <li> So glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has a longer cord than most.</li>
            <li> Well I had bought the Onei straightener and was in love with</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I paid more for it than one from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I keep it on neutral ions for the most part.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> From Amazon&#x27;s description:  &amp;#34;Guaranteed authentic.</li>
            <li> I really love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It was better than my ancient hair dryer from the 80s/90s</li>
            <li> so I would give it t a 5 star as I love this hairdryer but..</li>
            <li> I love love love it.</li>
            <li> I got it for two weeks now so far so good!</li>
            <li> but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> I have an Onei flat iron that I&#x27;m very happy with</li>
            <li> Hot setting is just right; warm setting works great.</li>
            <li> When my good hair dryer finally stopped working, I decided to purchase the Onei MK-II Air Ionic Hair Dryer, impressed with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I loved it the first time  </li>
            <li> I really could not afford to spend that kind of money again, but I have curly hair so having a good blower to straighten out my hair is important.  </li>
            <li> It is not terribly loud and does an excellent job at drying you hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and shiny and requires no flat ironing, it&#x27;s just perfect.  </li>
            <li> I personally own a supersolano 232b hair dryer, which I am very happy with, but she was not very impressed with it when she visited, so I looked for something with more settings and better for curly hair (my own hair is wavy).</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was definitely not disappointed!</li>
            <li> hair was so smooth and VERY shiny in the end, I was so happy with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; part does anything at all, and the diffuser dryer doesn&#x27;t seem super effective.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot, but it&#x27;s great that you can use the cool shot feature to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; you style when done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It broke just before a job interview, which is very special.</li>
            <li> The diffuser works perfectly fine, and I suspect that most users complaining about it, may not have taken the time to notice that there are 2 grooves along the edge of the cone.</li>
            <li> I am more then happy to blow dry my own hair with the Onei Hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Much lower decibels and a more pleasant, lower frequency sound as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully in calming the frizzes and finally being able to style my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair feels great - not scorched like with my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my experience so far and have the reviewers to thank.</li>
            <li> You will not regret this investment for healthy, shiny, smooth looking hair.</li>
            <li> The whole transaction was a good experience.</li>
            <li> The dryer arrived faster than anticipated and I was in love the first time I used it!!  </li>
            <li> Cool, medium, high settings great...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to style my hair now.</li>
            <li> I like that the controls are easy to work and do not get accidentally switched when I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
            <li> With the Ionic generator turned OFF my hair does gain volume but it also tangles really easily.</li>
            <li> Makes you hair shiny and fires very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a good hair dryer at a reasonable (not dirt cheap) price, this might be it.</li>
            <li> Drys my hair super fast and leaves it nice and shiny!</li>
            <li> She claims that it is light, easy to handle, dries her hair quicker and over all, does a much better job than her old one.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was prompt and product was in good condition.  </li>
            <li> The price was on target and the shipping was ultra fast -- very pleased with the seller as well.</li>
            <li> She liked it so much that she decided to keep it for herself and made me order another one!</li>
            <li> Love the cool setting.</li>
            <li> a very good product, hope it works for a very long time.....</li>
            <li> After exhaustive research on my part to find the best hair dryer at a given price point, I settled on the Onei MK-II based purely on the Amazon reviews and it apparently paid off.  </li>
            <li> It is light and easy to handle with all the push buttons at your finger tips.  </li>
            <li> dryer is very quiet and I am impressed by how hot it can get.</li>
            <li> It is light, balanced, and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> That being said, my daughter&#x27;s unit which we purchased over 3 years ago is still working fine.</li>
            <li> The dryer is light and easy to control the switches with the hand that is holding the drier.  </li>
            <li> She has fine hair that lacks body.  </li>
            <li> I have fine shoulder length hair with a tendency towards frizz..</li>
            <li> quickly!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it out of the box and use it!</li>
            <li> It is lightweight,  quieter than most dryers and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Very light and powerful.</li>
            <li> This is a huge plus for us.  </li>
            <li> I made a huge mistake by not returning this hair dryer immediately.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is also light weight.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend who also uses it, even commented on how much he likes it, and he is one picky kind of guy.</li>
            <li> Light weight...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t thank you enough, Onei, for making me so happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap hair dryers from the drug store for years.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is light weight.</li>
            <li> It came with a concentrator nozzle and a diffuser, which is nice if you like to switch up your style from straight to curly.</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled by all of the fabulous reviews for this dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight which is a must with my carpel tunnel syndrome.</li>
            <li> Works great and feels like it should last...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important that a dryer is lightweight.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is fabulous.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The sound is a medium hum, like a space heater but a bit louder.</li>
            <li> I looked all over the internet, but it was discontinued so it wasn&#x27;t available anywhere.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy to say that I have finally found it.</li>
            <li> It truly leaves my hair looking silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This has been a fantastic hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The dryer itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold and use</li>
            <li> Everyone has commented on how light this dryer is.  </li>
            <li> It is made out of a light plastic, and feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord itself is also flimsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li> The buttons on the side light up, but the motor is done.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and powerfull.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer and it is very quiet compared to others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> great quality and really quiet!</li>
            <li> So far loving it better than the Sedu &amp; Chi.</li>
            <li> I hope it gives me many good hair days in the future!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, quiet, produces good heat, dries her hair more quickly, and seems to have made a noticeable difference in the appearance of her hair.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for the perfect hair dryer</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> Also, the reviews seemed a bit too good to be true, but so far I am finding that they were not misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love my hair with this new dryer!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably light weight, powerful and easy to grip for self-done blow-outs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked and looked, and finally found an amazing hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I originally came onto Amazon to search for  a dryer that I had found in a store that was out of stock.  </li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for about a month and so far I have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottomline: quietest dryer I&#x27;ve ever used and totally worth the money too!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have used some excellent ionic hair dryers in the past and kept waiting for this one to work as well.  </li>
            <li> and so far am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Of course the wife got to it first :)</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned...lightweight, and I have NO STATIC ELECTRICITY in my hair after use...</li>
            <li> I also love that there is both a cool shot (if you just need a quick blast of cool air) and a cool temperature setting (for when you want cool air for an extended period of time).</li>
            <li> She says it drys her hair quick and is really light.  </li>
            <li> So far love this dryer!</li>
            <li> Controls are easy to use and in just the right place.  </li>
            <li> so I needed a special dryer and the Onei MK</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s making me want to wash my hair right now!</li>
            <li> I decided that my hair deserves better, this time around, so the old Conair hit the trash can bottom with a satisfying &amp;#34;thud&amp;#34; after I used this dryer for the first time!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer was good while it lasted until it just sputtered out after owning it for less than two years and with very light use.</li>
            <li> My daughter had gotten an ionic hair dryer and told me how much she enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it but the electrical cord had a short and it stopped working 3 days ago.  </li>
            <li> I can set the dryer on cool and turn the fan on full blast.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and fairly fast-drying for an 1800 watt dryer.</li>
            <li> So far, my hair has not looked as shiny or smooth as when I used my Jibere, but to be fair, it has been really humid here.</li>
            <li> I believe the manufacture claims the lowest setting is a cool 62°F and the hottest</li>
            <li> Overall I feel like it is a good dryer</li>
            <li> Edit #2: Again, the Cool Shot button is stuck in the on position.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had my replacement one for 5 weeks and now the cool button is stuck.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer, compared it with the SEdu 4000 and ended up returning the Sedu because it was much heavier and louder.  </li>
            <li> and  I like that there is a cool air button</li>
            <li> I liked that, and so far I would recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> cannot say enough good things about this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> cannot say enough good things about this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Still searching for a good dryer that can last.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this hair dryer I have gotten 4 compliments on how good I look (the only change was the hair dryer).  </li>
            <li> When I told her of all the good reviews I had read about it, she totally agreed with me!!</li>
            <li> I expect the full 4 years.</li>
            <li> I love the weight of this dryer, just the right amount of heat, great cool setting, but after a couple of months the writing around the buttons came off (not a huge deal), then the silver paint on the handle came off, and now it seems the hair dryer is disintegrating.</li>
            <li> It is much quieter than most dryers and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It is long, but it gets kinked very easily and adds weight to the blow drier, which in itself is very light.  </li>
            <li> Our cats get the joy of this Hair Dryer as we give them a Bath every other week.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great blow dryer</li>
            <li> I just love my new hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> When my latest hair dryer started shooting sparks, I knew it was time to get a new one!</li>
            <li> In love with my new hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, light, easy to handle, provides perfect heat and blower settings and dries my hair in half the time without leaving it frizzy.</li>
            <li> delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> It is super lightweight and sleek.  </li>
            <li> When the most recent Conair died, I thought I&#x27;d look around for a better hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Shiny hair in quick time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this dryer was dropped to the tile floor more than once in 2 years, so it&#x27;s possible we damaged it.</li>
            <li> I like how quickly this dryer dries my hair.  </li>
            <li> It works without the heat burning your scalp and it is more quiet than most hair dryers.</li>
            <li> It could just be me, I do move quickly from client to client.</li>
            <li> It has an adequate blowing system and heating for my medium texture of hair.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce frizz, dries hair quickly</li>
            <li> Also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It just blew out; the power switch switched off on it&#x27;s own 2 times and the 3rd time, there was a huge spark and smoke</li>
            <li> Lightweight and quick drying hair dryer</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and as promised.  </li>
            <li> But with Prime you&#x27;ll get it pretty quick!</li>
            <li> I received the MK-II hair dryer fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This dryer arrived quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li> Itdries your hair quickly too.  </li>
            <li> My original one stopped working after about 1 1/2 year, they sent me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> RATING WAS HIGH MY GIRL FRIEND LOVE</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for better customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Highly recommended, both dyer and seller.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference after using it the first time.</li>
            <li> and they get very hot.</li>
            <li> I normally pay more for a dryer, but I&#x27;m hooked on MK-II.</li>
            <li> And it blows very hot which speeds up my drying time.</li>
            <li> This dryer was fantastic for the first 6 months.</li>
            <li> More than I would normally spend</li>
            <li> Light weight and dries hair fast!  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very light, super quiet, and dries hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m holding out that this dryer will last a long time despite the whining noise because I&#x27;m really impressed with its performance (hence, the 4 star review.)  </li>
            <li> The dryer&#x27;s best feature is how quiet it is compared to the many that I have owned over the past</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally shop on line much, but did this season, and have been impressed with this personal touch.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered the Onei I accidentally had it shipped to my mom!</li>
            <li> Love the different settings, easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer - very professional results, several heat and speed settings.  </li>
            <li> It makes my fine straight hair shiny and silky but still gives it volumn.</li>
            <li> I am using it now for a few months, and it is really a great dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tool for everyday drying and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you own hair salon, perhaps you&#x27;ll have a different opinion, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> I should add that I rarely ever write reviews.  </li>
            <li> However, I like this product so much, and did so much research, that I felt compelled to do so in hope of saving many of you the aggravation of 4 hours of research.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recomment this product to others who want a nice hair dryer without spending over $100.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> but we both agree that it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is lightweight and powerful.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I use it on warm only as hot can get too hot really fast.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> When you turn on the dryer, you can hear it speed and warm up - there isn&#x27;t that sudden blast of metal smelling heat like the cheaper dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It does what is says it does, and it is worth the $$.  </li>
            <li> and then I bought my own when she went back.</li>
            <li> When it works, it a lightweight and powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and quiet, great heat, not as much wind</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time reading reviews and trying to find the best hair dryer out there for the money, and this is the one I finally decided on.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money and the time to wait for it to arrive.  </li>
            <li> I love the different settings and it&#x27;s light weight in your hand.</li>
            <li> loved this products and definitely will like to recommend this blowdryer to all of you and absolutely  will keep buying Onei hair products.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth about $30.  </li>
            <li> but if it lasts as expected, it will prove to be a good buy.</li>
            <li> I also think that it leaves my hair soft :)</li>
            <li> I had used my sister in law&#x27;s Paul Mitchel hair dryer(VERY nice hair dryer) which you can find on here for about the same price as this one.</li>
            <li> I can see where it would be useful to a lot of people though.</li>
            <li> When you turn on the dryer, you can hear it speed and warm up - there isn&#x27;t that sudden blast of metal smelling heat like the cheaper dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>

            <li> Very nice  color and design.especially with very very low noises,so that you can use it in the early morning.will recommend friends to have it.</li>
            <li> It seems to me the diffuser makes a pretty good, fairly tight friction fit.  </li>
            <li> hair is kind of wavy &amp; frizzy, but can be styled into a smoother straighter look with the right hair dryer, brush, and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I dropped it and unplugged it right away.  </li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank, and this price tag was right in line with what I wanted to spend.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is very light weight, very quiet, and blow drys my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> But my favorite thing is that the cool shot button actually works!</li>
            <li> Gets my hair nice and smooth if I blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, very powerful and super quiet.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new hair dryer and wanted one that was of good quality and quieter than my last dryer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quiet, lightweight, easy to use and leaves my hair smooth and shiny without frizz.  </li>
            <li> I want to thank you for a quick delivery, I love this hair dryer, its quiet</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light, it has alot of heat settings, the buttons are positioned well, and it works better than my old blow dryer as far as straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was finally ready to replace my 8-year old travel hairdryer  with something more powerful and quite, and yet just as light-weight.</li>
            <li> The hot is really hot - but good when your hair is really wet.  </li>
            <li> The cord is nice and long.</li>
            <li> (BTW, she has very fine, blonde hair).</li>
            <li> I certainly did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve own it several weeks now and the plastic components still really smell.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works for both, and dries quickly whether for curly or for straight hair.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my daughter and she loved it..said it was low in noise and did a great job with her long hair..might have to get the other daughter one..</li>
            <li> Based on her excellent feedback, I would definitely consider purchasing one of these myself - although I love my current hair dryer and won&#x27;t need a new one for a long time yet.</li>
            <li> With the Ionic Generator turned ON the tangles disappear and my hair gets really smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> although I think my personal hair dryer is pretty great too, if it was to break tomorrow, I&#x27;d definitely go for one of these.</li>
            <li> price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and quiet</li>
            <li> The hair dryer has performed very, very well.</li>
            <li> and I hope the cool shot button doesn&#x27;t give me trouble because I really love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough to say \\&quot;I love it\\&quot;, but I do like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Melted in my hands the first time I plugged it in.  </li>
            <li> (Maybe I gripped it funny, but it did annoy me every time I used it)</li>
            <li> The power cord broke in the first 60 days.</li>
            <li> I love my Onei MK-II and will never give it back!</li>
            <li> This guarantee was one of the reasons we decided to buy the product in the first place.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THE CONTROLS!  </li>
            <li> The lights came on and the unit got hot but the air didn&#x27;t blow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty descent.</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased had defective testing buttons on its plug</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s possible to have a love affair with a hair dryer, this would be the one.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> For some time now I&#x27;ve been searching for a more quiet hair dryer</li>
            <li> I really love the Onei MK-II dryer &amp; definitely rate this a 5 star  </li>
            <li> should it happen again within a reasonable time frame!</li>
            <li> /&gt;  - 3 settings where many only have 2&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dryer is way too hot.  </li>
            <li> It actually makes my hair look better --</li>
            <li> gives my short hair more body.  </li>
            <li> Love the quiet .  </li>
            <li> Bought it for work as a professional stylist and really love how quiet and light it is.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> So glad I found it on Amazon after a very extensive search.</li>
            <li> Would not do this again because it is too much of a hassle!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s quiet on top of it all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know there was a difference between cheap dryers and a professional dryer.</li>
            <li> Love how it is so quiet as well.</li>
            <li> My life is so funny like that.</li>
            <li> I set mine on negative ion, which helps my hair look great before work and after the gym.</li>
            <li> after too many drops it finally stop working.</li>
            <li> well, Love the different settings.</li>
            <li> I also love how it has an actual cool setting as well as the normal button.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t convinced that it would be worth it to spend that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many times to untwist the cord, but it coils back on itself again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is 2.5 ounces lighter than the TT3000 (according to our digital postage scale) and she&#x27;s OK with it&#x27;s performance</li>
            <li> The cheap one she had before was soooooo loud in the mornings would wake me up.</li>
            <li> It works very well!</li>
            <li> I was more concerned with having multiple speeds and heat settings which this has.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up and ship it back after my first use (as I was tempted to do)</li>
            <li> One last thing--I already knocked this hair dryer off my counter top, and it survived, seemingly without any problems.</li>
            <li> The first time she used the dryer</li>
            <li> It is quiet, quick dry and even looks good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers commented on how great the Onei dryer was, citing it&#x27;s speed in drying, it&#x27;s ionic component that left hair smooth, and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was.  </li>
            <li> For the first few months I was greatly impressed with how quiet and strong the motor is; I have really long hair</li>
            <li> I really liked it until it abruptly died in December 2014.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part is the soft sound and the long cord.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a top-performing dryer, I would highly recommend trying this dryer first!</li>
            <li> Long cord is a plus and very light weight.</li>
            <li> The dryer is very light weight and comes with a long cord allowing for plenty of movement.</li>
            <li> They responded quickly and are sending me a new diffuser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, light and dries hair super fast.</li>
            <li> The trick to making the best use of this hair dryer is using the regular ion setting when drying and then switching to the negative ion to give your hair that sleek, shiny look.</li>
            <li> I love how quiet and so fast it works.</li>
            <li> Has a great long lead to move around as you dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I love the low volume of the hair dryer, love the ionic switch, and it really does dry well.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that tends to be frizzy, and it really helps to keep it sleek in the hot, humid summer months.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s possible the blower fan stopped due to it being dropped and it is otherwise a great dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love the long cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled</li>
            <li> My hair dries quickly and with more volume than my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> I must admit my expectations were fairly high, as I decided to buy the dryer initially from outstanding reviews.</li>
            <li> It is an incredible hair dryer - quiet and really powerful and it cost less than $100!!!  </li>
            <li> I needed to replace my dryer quickly as the dog chewed the plug off of the cord of the old one.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight, quiet and easy to operate .</li>
            <li> It also gets really hot which helps drying time and it&#x27;s extremely quiet which is also important when trying to hear your client while blow drying.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very quite, light weight, dry quick and well made.</li>
            <li> Despite the blower strength, the hair dryer is pretty quiet and fairly light.</li>
            <li> Also love that it came with a diffuser for when I want to dry my hair curly.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this dryer.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer is VERY lightweight, amke my hair dry VERY quickly and makes my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After years with my old hairdryer, I found that the new, cheaper ones were just that, cheap.  </li>
            <li> Also, it dries my hair very quickly and is not heavy like my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> My favorite features are its very long cord, light weight, and quiet motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Although I do not need the long cord now, it would have been great in other bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> I have RA and have a hard time gripping and the weight is so light I can dry my hair more.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, not the thick curly that drives most shoppers toward a certain brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite, has a super long cord, and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> As I researched dryers I read that people with fine hair will get better volume &amp; body if they don&#x27;t use NEGATIVE Ion dryers but instead use NEUTRAL Ion dryers.  </li>
            <li> The high heat is extremely hot and damaging to hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and quiet, dries hair fast and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Well, my pet peeve is loud hair dryers, as I value my hearing, and this is the quietest hair dryer I&#x27;ve had that is still powerful and dries my hair fast.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, which is a huge plus because my husband already contributes some hearing loss to my blow dryers over the years.</li>
            <li> but I havent recently because this dryer makes a huge difference in my hair texture.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> hairblower is VERY QUIET and light to hold.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend product and seller!</li>
            <li> So, though my hair is much shorter than hers, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Since we just bought it, I can&#x27;t say much about</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> This dryer dries fast and makes my hair looks voluminous.  </li>
            <li> I agree the manual does not provide enough information about the blue/green light.  </li>
            <li> but the key is that it is LIGHT weight.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much insight for the hair dryer&#x27;s performance as it was a Xmas gift for my wife but</li>
            <li> I went from having to wear air-plugs when my wife blow-dried her hair (in the bathroom with door closed) to not being able to hear the blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s quiet AND light.  </li>
            <li> It is also very ridged and when it gets kinked it often moves around on the counter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter, but if I were to buy another one, I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer makes my hair much smoother while protecting the ends.</li>
            <li> If it reached farther into the kitchen it would have been a real hit.</li>
            <li> Whatever voodoo they are using, I approve whole heartedly.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a dryer that was quiet and light.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dryer that was quiet and light.</li>
            <li> Quiet, light weight, and has lots of heat and air options.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> She says that it dries her hair fast without leaving it frizzy.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve never paid so much for a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> She loves how it dries without drying out hair, and how the flexibility in settings makes it much, much easier for dealing with brittle, curly hair.</li>
            <li> so she can really see what this hair dryer can do.    </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I have to really work at it to get it to stay on.  </li>
            <li> THis dryer is quiet, light, and I don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair after.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate it and have changed my review to reflect this.</li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t write much about the features, but I do know that she loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much much cheaper hair dryers go for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had a fantastic hair day, and got several complements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cheap hair dryers last for years!</li>
            <li> And to boot it&#x27;s a fabulous Christmas present!!</li>
            <li> as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t rate this five stars because I expected more blowing power.</li>
            <li> My birthday gift to my wife was received very well and she loves the quality of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> would reccomend this dryer to anyone that wants a quality dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have buyer&#x27;s remorse very often.  </li>
            <li> Very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to replace this dryer, and I&#x27;m much, much happier with the Bayblis Pro.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely agree.  </li>
            <li> It also did the job much faster.</li>
            <li> It arrived so fast to my door</li>
            <li> and I use it on my shampooed  hair and it dries fast</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this home and immediately plugged it in to find it has a lower pitched noise that is absolute music to my ears.  </li>
            <li> , I really didn&#x27;t realize that a dryer could make that much difference</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a sleek modern piece that lives up to its on-line product description and specifications.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate it D.R.G. Trading.  </li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> It is indeed speedy, and light, and quiet.  </li>
            <li> I chose the product because the ad stated it was quiet, light powerful, professional quality.</li>
            <li> Nice to know I wasted 90.00.</li>
            <li> So far I love it , very quiet!</li>
            <li> Definitely her favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DRYER, BECAUSE HAS SEVERAL DRYING SETTING, COOL, WARM, OR HOT, HIGH , LOW, NEGATIVE ION, NETURAL ION,  </li>
            <li> My hair always looks exactly like I had imagined or better in less time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, and it is very quiet compared to other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that need a strong blowout.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quiet and doesn&#x27;t get too hot on the Medium setting as with many other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my new dryer and my hair seems healthier and not as dry.  </li>
            <li> My old dryer died and I needed to get a new one quickly.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the fact that my hair does feel healthier but dry time which was supposed to be cut in half was not so.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> This is why I needed a more expensive dryer, and was willing to pay more for it.</li>
            <li> will note that I a bit concerned about making this purchase because I had never heard of Onei before and because you can&#x27;t find much about them online (the company does have a decent website).</li>
            <li> The dryer is plenty hot, but soooo much quieter than my old Revlon one.  </li>
            <li> The extra long cord is also nice.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about it was that it does cut down on drying times.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in many other reviews, I love that it emit much less noise than many other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> I can talk to people and even listen to music with the hairdryer on high because it has a low hum rather than a high pitched sound and does not hurt your ear drums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple months the motor has started to make a whining noise when set to high; since I paid $80 for this dryer, I have treated it really well and am worried that it might be breaking already.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long this product will last, but feel confident that the company will take good care of me</li>
            <li> What I love about this dryer is that I no longer have to go clear across to another part of our home to dry my hair in the morning when my family is still asleep.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised at how gentle the air flow comes out &amp; how fast my hair dries.  </li>
            <li> It worked fantastically for the first couple of months, but in October, the hair dryer unexpectedly stopped working.</li>
            <li> - Light weight, especially for such a powerful unit</li>
            <li> I pressed the Cool Shot button to set my curl and the button would not pop back up.</li>
            <li> At first, when it didn&#x27;t roar like my old one</li>
            <li> It is not really powerful, but it is okay with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I never realized that a good hair dryer could make such a difference, but I really wish I had figured it out sooner!</li>
            <li> So far, I am enjoying this hair dryer especially the quick dry time.</li>
            <li> I had the new one in 2 days!</li>
            <li> I believe the &amp;#34;neutral ion&amp;#34; setting is for more texturized/curly styles, so I don&#x27;t typically use that one.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how smooth my hair got just from blowing it dry.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a decent hair dryer that would not cost an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a hassle than anything, especially with our humid summer starting and</li>
            <li> The main characteristic I searched for was the sound volume and pitch.</li>
            <li> She really likes it, and it&#x27;s much quieter than her old hair dryer, so</li>
            <li> Other hair dryers I used usually last more than 2.5 years!</li>
            <li> That was one of the main reasons I selected this dryer.  </li>
            <li> mainly use the &amp;#34;negative ion&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Even though I use the same products as my hair stylist, my hair always looked better after I left the salon than anything I could do my self.  </li>
            <li> There is a wide range of  blower strength and heat available for this hairdryer, and for blowdrying straight, I need to use one notch below the maximum for both.</li>
            <li> I  never thought a particular type of hair dryer could made a difference</li>
            <li> It had by far the largest percent of positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is actually true - the pitch is not really a pitch, but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about ordering this since no one who had reviewed it yet mentioned how it performed on curly hair, other than to say it straightens great.</li>
            <li> I really believe that, once I get used to blowing my hair out again, I will be able to dry and style my hair with no flat iron</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> The high setting is like a kitchen fan.</li>
            <li> It is much quieter than my previous dryer, and it dries my hair quickly on the warm setting which I feel is less damaging.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical of spending even $80 on a dryer as my last adventure had not been very successful.  </li>
            <li> Quiet, very light and long cord, work as promised,</li>
            <li> This hair drier cuts down on my time significantly and my hair looks healthier than it has every been!  </li>
            <li> far my wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> I am very please with how soft and shining my heair looks by using this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a couple of weeks, and so far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really notice quicker drying times than my old CHI dryer which I loved.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But from my observation, this hair dryer was much quieter than her old one.</li>
            <li> (Been using the dryer everyday for more than a month.)  </li>
            <li> Very quiet, yet powerful and leaves hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Just the customer service was golden to me until I realized their product was equally as golden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a quiet, powerful &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using this dryer for a few months now and love it.</li>
            <li> Well worth spending the extra money!  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, but powerful.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money if it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Very quiet but powerful.  </li>
            <li> it was worth it, especially since it had a Negative/Neutral Ion switch.  </li>
            <li> I have long, full hair that is wavy/frizzy.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I often didn&#x27;t dry all the way because it took too long, but now my hair looks great everyday because it works so effectively by drying so fast.  </li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s running the thing for minutes a day right next to her ears :</li>
            <li> Will definitely not pay what it&#x27;s going for right now.</li>
            <li> Super long cord makes it #1</li>
            <li> I dry it part way on the medium setting and finish with the cool.</li>
            <li> I kinda figured there would be a little more information regarding the settings in the manual, but it&#x27;s a pretty basic phamplet.  </li>
            <li> After I dry my hair, I use the cool setting on high and gently cool down my whole hair.  </li>
            <li> I love that this dryer is so quiet I can blow dry my hair even after everyone has gone to sleep!</li>
            <li> I do get some flyaway &amp; static, but my hair isn&#x27;t totally dried out &amp; is easy to comb through, even with a tight perm.</li>
            <li> Every other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned has one, and they&#x27;re important to help keep hair and lint out of the dryer itself.  </li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t hear it running from bed when my wife is using it behind a closed bathroom door) and has very good airflow, I will replace it with the new model.  </li>
            <li> I went thru chemo and my new hair is frizzy</li>
            <li> No problem with my new hair dryer; I can add volume, softness and shine.  </li>
            <li> I had bought this for my daughter who needed a new hair dryer, so I read a lot of reviews and decided on this one.</li>
            <li> I want you to send me a new one.  </li>
            <li> Please contact me to send me a new one.</li>
            <li> I sent it to them Thursday and they sent me tracking and my new one should arrive today (Tuesday).  </li>
            <li> I needed a new hair dryer</li>
            <li> My hair stylist mentioned getting a new Ionic hair dryer</li>
            <li> Im hopeful that this is a just an anomaly  and that the company will send me a new one....</li>
            <li> The sound from this dryer is very soft and soothing unlike all the other hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> , it dries my very long hair quickly.</li>
            <li> For what I spent on this hair dryer, I&#x27;ll go with a brand that works for more than two years and a company that actually honors their warranty.</li>
            <li> A powerful hair dryer that is not heavy and is quiet!</li>
            <li> In with the new, out with the old!</li>
            <li> I use the ion feature at the end and it made my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Compared to my supersolano, it is slower, but has many advantages: it weighs less, the cord doesn&#x27;t seem as ridiculously prone to becoming a tangly overly-long mess, and the settings allow for more flexibility in drying your hair.</li>
            <li> It does get hot &amp; I love that you can turn the heat setting down, without sacrificing the force of air &amp; still get your hair dry in no time!  </li>
            <li> Why buy another if the first one broke after only 1 1/2 years?  </li>
            <li> If you can get past that then you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has far exceeded my expectations on both!  </li>
            <li> This is the first hair dryer that is so low noise.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer but why is it more expensive 5 months later?</li>
            <li> It seems like the middle is already too hot for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my husband commented on how quiet that hair dryer was.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, quiet and drys my hair fast without leaving it frizzy!</li>
            <li> But because I use it almost every day and enjoy its performance and its looks, it is worth a few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking</li>
            <li> The lightweight of the dryer makes blow outs of my long hair SO much easier - less stress and sweating before I go out :).  </li>
            <li> Normally, I spend a good half hour to 45 mins just getting my hair dry--not blowing it out, not using any brushes or styling tools/techniques, just getting it dry so that I can use my flat iron.</li>
            <li> As for me, I&#x27;m going back to BayBliss for a new hair dryer (costs less, better</li>
            <li> As for me, I&#x27;m going back to BayBliss for a new hair dryer (costs less, better</li>
            <li> Not sure I really noticed a huge difference between the settings, but maybe time will tell.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length, not thick but not thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a new hair dryer, my 8 year old Conair dried my hair just fine, or so I thought.  </li>
            <li> As good as my much more expensive hair dryer, if not better.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I would buy any $15 hair dryer but over the past few years the noise level in most hairdryers bothers me; therefore, I sought out a hairdryer that would be of good quality, last for several years, and was also quiet.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, it comes with a limited warranty; if the product does break, I&#x27;ll have to take it up with the manufacturer and report back.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is that it doesn&#x27;t produce a ton of noise like the T3 I previously had, and if you have a sleeping baby in the next room you&#x27;ll really appreciate the low noise it makes.</li>
            <li> It was pretty quiet and did the job every other day - pretty normal usage.  </li>
            <li> Even though it produces a great deal of energy, it only has a faint hum when in use.</li>
            <li> This by far has surpassed my expectations &amp; my experience with the Chi &amp; Sedu.</li>
            <li> The packaging of the dryer far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> Is it too early to give 5 stars since I have had the product for one week?</li>
            <li> B00APV7OWG Onei MK-II Air Ionique Hair Dryer with Ionic Generator for Professional Blowouts]]</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a professional style blow dryer.</li>
            <li> My old blow dryer didn&#x27;t give volume to my hair as this dryer does.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a solid purchase, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased it based on the 5-star reviews it had received from the few reviewers available at the time.</li>
            <li> If anyone has had such an experience and can help us out, we would be really thankful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For 10 years I&#x27;ve been loosing my mind having to listen to my wife&#x27;s ridiculously loud hear dryer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how shiny and soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and soft when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I like it that my hair feels soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend the Onei to anyone who wants a quality dryer.</li>
            <li> My old ionic dryer was dying-</li>
            <li> I like that you can switch the ion on/off, and that heat/air settings are completely adjustable.  </li>
            <li> Mine lasted 4 months and completely died.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast at drying and quiet.</li>
            <li> My husband mention how quiet  this blow dryer is to use and how fast it dries the hair.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by my findings.</li>
            <li> Professional 4 year warranty and</li>
            <li> And it does come with a diffuser, but since I have straight asian hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nine months old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now ecstatic that I didn&#x27;t find the same model I had before, because this is SO much</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, is shiny and dries evenly.  </li>
            <li> so I could gauge it&#x27;s performance over a long period of time instead of just writing a first impression.  </li>
            <li> My hair dries so fast I have extra time in the mornings..</li>
            <li> Think of those old corded phone cords.  </li>
            <li> saw no difference in the green light/blue light settings for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Well today it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> So far, this one seems well made</li>
            <li> The only reason I can&#x27;t give it five stars was that the documentation was very sparse.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and quiet.  </li>
            <li> Thanks amazon for changing my life through exposure to products that actually work!</li>
            <li> This one is quiet and efficient (fast).</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it not heavy.</li>
            <li> then my old $40 Revlon from Walmart.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend the Onei to anyone who wants a quality dryer.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy curly hair and this dryer definitely does its job.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft with this dryer and it doesnt frizz out.  </li>
            <li> Really worth the amount spent.  </li>
            <li> I like, and if it only lasts another couple of years, it&#x27;s still worth the extra $30 or so, but I am dropping a star for the longevity.</li>
            <li> My main complaint about this product is its strong plastic odor.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product and hope it lasts as long as other reviewers said it did!</li>
            <li> It manages to dry your hair with high heat in a gentle way.  </li>
            <li> No frizzy hair or dry ends, and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li> and really can get hot so less drying time.  </li>
            <li> The cool setting actually gets very cold, which is also  a great bonus for locking in curl and reducing frizz.</li>
            <li> I can simply close my bedroom door and people in the other bedrooms aren&#x27;t disturbed by the sound of my dryer.  </li>
            <li> I like the medium setting, since the high is a little too powerful for my liking, it just splatters water all over my mirror.</li>
            <li> I am able to dry my hair in about half the time w/o a lot of frizz.  </li>
            <li> , it dries my hair fast, I have very little frizz, I purchased the flat iron by the same brand name and love it just as well.</li>
            <li> There are two settings for ionic, and I don&#x27;t know what the other setting is supposed to do, but the other setting does introduce static, so I use one ionic setting at all times.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased as after using the first, I decided to throw away the one at our second home and replace it with one of these..</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer because it works well and is very quiet compared to the ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
            <li> Drys my hair quickly with less frizzy/dried out hair.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Blowout&amp;#34; styling results were not as good as I get with my drugstore cheapie; hairs would get chomped and tangled in the dryer; poor button placement so the controls were frequently switched on/off, high/low by the palm of my hand while I was trying to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Initially I liked it because it was a little lighter than typical</li>
            <li> It has a long cord and lots of settings that actually differ which makes it easy to dry hair for kids as well as adults.</li>
            <li> so I could really care less how much noise it makes.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how much time the old dryer was taking to dry and style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Claire</li>
            <li> Love the controls for fan speed and temperature because they are easy to push, unlike my other which slid and were difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> So far very surprised &amp; looking to see if this will outlast my last dryer a wigo(5yrs).  </li>
            <li> The other advantages are the multiple heat/cool settings, length of the power cord and the cool shot button.  </li>
            <li> I was crushed when her first comments were:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Yep, that&#x27;s right; I paid nearly $100 for a fancy hair dryer that lasted less than 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, and this dryer makes my hair look as if I just stepped out of the salon.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient because I&#x27;m bending over a lot, plus having to maneuver around other people and big counters when getting ready at the gym.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient because I&#x27;m bending over a lot, plus having to maneuver around other people and big counters when getting ready at the gym.</li>
            <li> I asked about the warranty and was told they would give me a discount to allow me to purchase a new one for only $60.  </li>
            <li> Only issue I have is the concentrator does not fit the nozzle accurately.  </li>
            <li> It is fast, efficient, and doesn&#x27;t dry outta hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very prone to dry and brittle ends.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast I could blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> Instead of blowing my hair to dry it out, it gently blows heat at target area and dries hair faster, without wildness and frizz.</li>
            <li> It drys quickly, the condition of my hair feels like my hairdresser dried my hair.</li>
            <li> but I barely had to use my straightener to finish the job!</li>
            <li> Like it a lot, wish it had a little more power, but I like how quiet it is since I have to blow dry my hair in the morning while my husband is still asleep.</li>
            <li> , my hair doesn&#x27;t require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it&#x27;s actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because on high fan the air volume was equal to the low fan speed of the TT3000.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Read the other positive reviews and decided to purchase this model.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet and with the long cord it makes it very useable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional but have naturally wavy hair which is prone to frizz and fly-away action.  </li>
            <li> The difference in quality was instantly apparent.</li>
            <li> It is definitely faster and quieter than my old dryer -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to adapt to the controls being on the outside of the handle.(my old one</li>
            <li> My old ionic dryer left my hair in shiny, silky condition.  </li>
            <li> My old ionic dryer left my hair in shiny, silky condition.  </li>
            <li> I replaced my old dryer that was similar to this one</li>
            <li> So disappointing because I really loved this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I really think if anything went wrong within a reasonable time period that they would do what they could to make it right.</li>
            <li> new review is LONG overdue.&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell when you first use the dryer</li>
            <li> This is an appliance that I use at least once every day, it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It is replacing an old Brookstone that was very quiet but also pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers)</li>
            <li> I stumbled across the positive reviews for the Onei MKII while researching several other hairdryers (T3 featherweight, Elchim 2001 and BaBlyiss 2800).</li>
            <li> Only thing I would change are the lack of detail in the \\&quot;instruction\\&quot; manual, but thanks to this review section it&#x27;s not really needed.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace a Chi dryer, one almost twice as expensive as this one, that was none-too impressive and had broken on me twice in a year.  </li>
            <li> I will not be trying to run this company down again as the first time was hassle enough.  </li>
            <li> The first one I bought burnt out on me in less than a week..shipped it back and gave it another try.</li>
            <li> After a year and a half the cool button jammed and I had to pry it out.  </li>
            <li> exactly as I want - in half the time!</li>
            <li> I have super thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair and have been using a cheap drugstore dryer for the past several years.</li>
            <li> I am surprised it took so long!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to explain, but I&#x27;ve had other hair appliances that I paid much less for, and the cords all felt superior (thick, more substantial weight) to the one on this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I did end up using my flat iron on a few spots, but I think that was entirely user error and expect it to get better with a little practice.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry in half the time and it&#x27;s much quieter than my old 2500 watt con air.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t time it, but I would guess maybe 3 minutes to be completely dry, &amp; it had been taking about 15 minutes with my old one that fried my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant on spending this much, since my previous $30 Revlon lasted me 13 years.</li>
            <li> I made the blow dryer purchase based on previous reviews and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, it actually made me a little nervous because it was so quiet</li>
            <li> A little difficult to work the buttons one handed at first, but I&#x27;m sure that I just have to get used to it  --</li>
            <li> The Warranty has only a few months left and after promising to send a replacement, they have not honored their warranty!</li>
            <li> It is very quite, dries my hair in half the time, and feels like it will last.</li>
            <li> I have taken to wearing a pony tail far too often because it is such a pain to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer  based on all the good reviews but also a little apprehensive because of of the few negative reviews, but because of the price, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> My hair is short, straight and not easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very very light, so my arms do not get tired when I&#x27;m spending a lot of time styling the back of my head, when my arms are at odd angles.</li>
            <li> and my hair is not dried out like my other hair dryer..  </li>
            <li> I used this dryer and I am literally amazed I have no frizz at all, I have really big curly hair and now combined with Onei flat iron</li>
            <li> It is extremely light weight and my thick hair is blow dried very quickly without my arm getting tired and sore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried better or comparable professional hair dryers that are about $20 less expensive.</li>
            <li> It is so much more quieter than your usual hair dryer and the options foe dryinf sixh as negative ion or neutral switch</li>
            <li> Four stars only because for me the extra long cord is way longer than I need.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blow hard, but boy does it blow hot.</li>
            <li> various heat settings... positive and negative ion adjustments...</li>
            <li> I was not sure there would be much difference.  </li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat curly and I usually blow it straight, although sometimes I diffuse it curly.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t blowing hot enough, or forceful enough, but I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> As for lasting ability, it is a quality hairdryer, and I have been using this for about 6 months and it looks as though it will hold up for the long haul.</li>
            <li> The cord is extra long, so gives you plenty of freedom to move around while styling your hair.</li>
            <li> The result (before flat ironing) is what I like to call my &amp;#34;white girl</li>
            <li> Disappointed and now have to start over in search of a good dryer for my hair type.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t last very long without that burning smell</li>
            <li> Mine stopped working completely after less than six months.  </li>
            <li> Busy mom has drying time cut in half, plus shinier hair.</li>
            <li> My husband can actually sleep when I blow dry, where he could not before.</li>
            <li> One must keep switching the heat settings constantly while trying to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, it isnt as loud as my previous cheaper dryer.</li>
            <li> I wanted one that was quiet and dry</li>
            <li> It was such a pity to receive this and plug it in only to find that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, her hair is soft and staying styled rather than going back to messy curls from the slightest exposure to humidity.</li>
            <li> It will blow you HOT and HARD and leave you DRY.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know what the negative vs. positive ion charge is for?</li>
            <li> Sorry it took so long to tell you how much you are appreciated.</li>
            <li> - an old conair - has recently started just plain burning hair.</li>
            <li> Dries my color treated fine shoulder length hair with little or no frizz and have actually cut back by at least half, the use of anti-frizz and shine boosting products so think of the $ savings there.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people think I&#x27;m crazy for spending $80 on a hair dryer, but my hair style is very important to me.</li>
            <li> to replace this dryer, and I&#x27;m much, much happier with the Bayblis Pro.on blue setting, and half on green, there was NO DIFFERENCE in shine or volume.  </li>
            <li> I had to sit there with half straight and half curly hair.</li>
            <li> I really like how you can select either negative or neutral ion drying.</li>
            <li> as is the long cord.  </li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to buy a product that works?</li>
            <li> Remains to be seen how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> It is also lightweight and has a long cord.  </li>
            <li> If you have the money to spend on this hair dryer, you will not regret it.extra long, so gives you plenty of freedom to move around while styling your hair.</li>
            <li> I never noiticed how heavy my old blow dryer was until I got this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need it on the highest setting for too long.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the product works as expected and does have an extra long cord.</li>
            <li> the 2 attachments that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;came earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very quiet and does not disturb our cats as much as other hair dryers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ion option, and other reviewers vouched for its quiet.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has, without exception, left my hair extremely unruly.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer a lighter-weight dryer and cord, which is VERY long.  </li>
            <li> That would explain the very long cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so worth the price, which really isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> If you assume that I perhaps dry my hair 5 times a day, you&#x27;d be mistaken.  </li>
            <li> I need a hairdryer to meet my needs: dry without loss of volume &amp; decrease amount/use of root/shine styling products.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t even dry my hair now.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I am in a salon every time I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and because of the dryers power, my blow dry time has been shortened.</li>
            <li> but I saw NO change in the time it took to dry or the way my hair felt and looked after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it often gets frizzy after I blow dry it</li>
            <li> ha e both worked wonders on my dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It takes about 40 mins to thoroughly dry my hair (which holds ALOT of water) with rollers in.</li>
            <li> Even if I barely touched the Cool Shot button with my finger, it would blow cold</li>
            <li> It works well, it&#x27;s really quiet, but I expected it to blow harder.</li>
            <li> This is after moderate use of about 3 times/week over the last year plus a few months.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be very powerful, but that is definitely not the case--plenty of power without all the noise.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, so others may need a little longer time, but it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> Not only did they send me a free replacement but also a little gift to say sorry.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps, if you are a hair salonist, constantly sliding the diffuser on and off, it might eventually weaken the plastic tab on the diffuser, but for the average user I doubt this will ever be an issue.</li>
            <li> After using the Onei flat iron I decided to see what other Onei products I could purchase.</li>
            <li> No more frizzes, just SOFT shining</li>
            <li> In fact, while I&#x27;m trying to decide if I take a chance on another expensive hair dryer, I went back to using my trusty old (as in 5 years old)</li>
            <li> I would possibly understand if I had very long hair &amp; spend a half hour blowing it out each day</li>
            <li> As a blow out stylist, it is hard to transition to a new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Takes less time to dry and is quiet.</li>
            <li> Also, it is quiet which is soothing to me and less intimidating to my littles on the occasion I dry their hair.</li>
            <li> all of a sudden the power went down to a 1/3 of what it was.  </li>
            <li> Found that strange!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that if this dryer fell off the counter, it would easily break.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in August of 2013 and it began making odd noises several weeks ago</li>
            <li> and I wanted to find a similar dryer for less.  </li>
            <li> My previous hair dryer had died on me after almost 10 years (Baybliss Pro), and I figured I would spend some extra money to &#x27;upgrade&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer a year and a half ago as a Christmas present to myself.</li>
            <li> My days of buying $20 or less hair dryers from the big box stores are OVER.  </li>
            <li> and I barely had to use any product to tame my lions mane.</li>
            <li> I expected my medium fine hair to glide through the bristles but it can be a little difficult if you have product in your hair and are trying to blow dry it yourself.</li>
            <li> I have spent the past few months researching several different hair dryers and finally decided on this one.</li>
            <li> I decided to spend a little extra, and settled on this product.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer died and would only sputter a little air.  </li>
            <li> I did struggle a bit to get used to the cold blast button being on the inside of the handle, but it is comfortable now.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when it worked the exact same a my old $15 dollar hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I was nearly done blow drying my hair because I could only blow cold air unless I physically pried the button back up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve accidentally had the switch set to that, though, and it still dried my hair quicker than my last hair dryer (and WAY quicker than my travel hair dryer, the hair driers at the gym, the hotel hair dryers, i.e. the inexpensive ones you can buy at Target/Walmart etc).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from an $80 hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair, and left it in a mass of tangles.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to loud noises and really hate high pitched wails.  </li>
            <li> I paid $80 for hers and $105 for mine, but I&#x27;m certainly not buying another.</li>
            <li> The cord seems twice as long as all previous models.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair with some natural wave that usually takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> Especially on these hot, muggy, summer days in Georgia.</li>
            <li> It literally takes me 5 minutes or less to dry my hair now.</li>
            <li> I expect this one to last at least that long, if not longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first replaced it with an Ion brand dryer, but promptly returned that model due to poor switch control placement and heavy weight.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets it dry in about half the time of other dryers I&#x27;ve used, and dries it straighter.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron nearly as much to tame the poof.  </li>
            <li> My hair retains water and usually takes a long time to dry</li>
            <li> It dried my hair in half the time and is very quiet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything the other 4-5 star reviewers said.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I notice a big difference with the ion button.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It is now September 2014 and the plug is completely broken through normal use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this hair dryer - I have short hair and it can be difficult to style sometimes, especially as it grows out.</li>
            <li> What happened to the other 3 years?  </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to dry</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews commenting on how quiet it is, but I was disappointed to see that it also meant it was lacking power to dry hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I have hated most driers simply because I felt like I was going deaf every time I turned one on.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair, but even doing half my hair on blue setting, and half on green, there was NO DIFFERENCE in shine or volume.  </li>
            <li> Loved the dryer, but very disappointed it didn&#x27;t even make it up</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hard of hearing when there&#x27;s any background noise, but this hair dryer is so quiet that I can carry on a conversation while it&#x27;s on the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; velocity setting.</li>
            <li> The biggest difference is really the negative ion setting: after drying with neutral ion, my hair is a little frizzy, but going over the slightly-moist hair with negative ion makes it looks silky and shiny with zero frizz.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have involves the power cord.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the length of the cord.</li>
            <li> , the second one always got too hot and stunk up my bathroom, even on the lowest hear setting (grrrr...)</li>
            <li> Not worth the $$$</li>
            <li> , the second one always got too hot and stunk up my bathroom, even on the lowest hear setting (grrrr...)</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that I blow our daily, and I have had A LOT of blow dryers over the years.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and curly and is incredibly difficult to get it dry in a reasonable amount of time, especially with outit frizzing.</li>
            <li> and it broke down 3 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> It also cut down my drying time about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone, beats the department store models hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> T3 has a few different dryers, all with positive ratings, and all VERY expensive.</li>
            <li> No more blow dry bars for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because I became convinced she was going to go deaf eventually from her previous hairdryer, I found it deafening from down the hallway</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer as a gift a year and a half ago, and it stopped working one day.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it died within a year and a half, although that may have been my fault.</li>
            <li> I spend half a day researching hair dryers.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair so well and in half the time.</li>
            <li> I checked with Amazon and the Onei MK-II hair dryer was featured for less than half that price.  </li>
            <li> She has curly hair and her previous hair dryer</li>
            <li> I previously owned a T3 that gave out</li>
            <li> I thought I had bought a dud, but then it worked faster, with less heat, and less air.</li>
            <li> She says it makes her hair less &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; and the handle fits her hand well.</li>
            <li> One of them broke after a short fall from my hand to the bathroom counter (seriously??)</li>
            <li> This one drys her hair in half the time and is about 20 times quieter.</li>
            <li> short - THIS THING SERIOUSLY BLOWS.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in the half the time of any dryer I have used.</li>
            <li> One of them broke after a short fall from my hand to the bathroom counter (seriously??)</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair which usually takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and usually find it a chore to dry my hair even though I had been using an expensive professional dryer.</li>
            <li> It was always difficult for me to hold the button down to set the style as either my fingers would slip off or my hand would cramp trying to hold it long enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little upset that it died so soon for the price.</li>
            <li> I was little skepital for spending $70 for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Dead in 15 months.  </li>
            <li> My hair was growing back thin after cancer.</li>
            <li> but it disappears after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> In the photo the cord looks round, which was one of my criteria</li>
            <li> (round truly doesn&#x27;t kink)</li>
            <li> It is definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> , it is fluffy and it is crazy!&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I believe that the switch is simply a gimmicky way to sell the dryer.  </li>
            <li> waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> I believe that the switch is simply a gimmicky way to sell the dryer.  </li>
            <li> waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t waste my money.  </li>
            <li> I bought this drying thinking it would be stronger than the Babyliss I bought for myself a few months ago...</li>
            <li> the only reason I did not give it a 5 is that I purchased 4 months ago and it is already broken..</li>
            <li> And it was half the price of the Sedu!</li>
            <li> no blow dryer to tame this frizz ball.</li>
            <li> There is no easy way to wrap the cord without it twisting on itself.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I do use a little bit of gel, but I was not able to get the results with the dryers I had used before.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews of hair dryers costing half as much, and found no shortage of bad reviews on all of them.  </li>
            <li> A dryer this expensive should last a few years.</li>
            <li> I had my previous hair dryer for at least 10 years when it died and I was beside myself because I was so used to it</li>
            <li> It smells a little like asparagus pee!  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair appear very dry and unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> just a little damp - and redrying with the negative ion setting.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had to catch it a few times before it fell off or it has fallen into the sink!  </li>
            <li> My arm usually gets fatigued when I&#x27;m blowing my hair</li>
            <li> I was unable to send it back to Amazon for an exchange</li>
            <li> So now I am stuck with an expensive 6 month old dryer that will only blow cold.</li>
            <li> &#x27;ve been through three hair dryers in the past year.</li>
            <li> Now I have to figure out how to return it, because it says I am past my return period on Amazon and can&#x27;t return it here.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it, and you will not be sorry you bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> reading some reviews and Q&amp;As, I switched on the negative ion button, got my round brush and went to town.</li>
            <li> Her address is saved in my account from presents I have bought her through amazon in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through three hair dryers in the past year.</li>
            <li> Maybe, but I have nothing negative to write about.  </li>
            <li> My only disappointment is the price.</li>
            <li> The downside: there are no instructions regarding the ion switch, and I can&#x27;t say I notice any difference between neutral and negative ion settings.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the difference is between Negative ions or neutral ions.</li>
            <li> I like the negative ion feature, which seems to leave my hair glossier.</li>
            <li> 8 months after purchasing this dryer, I pressed the cold shot button and it would not pop back out!</li>
            <li> There is a negative and neutral ion switch which I had to look up online as to how to use the feature because the instruction booklet didn&#x27;t include any information.  </li>
            <li> Totally confusing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative ion feature but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> The cold button stuck on the 2nd use.  </li>
            <li> and I have not figured out the neutral and negative ion setting.  </li>
            <li> ; button is depressed permanently so it only dries using cold air.</li>
            <li> Took apart to try and fix it, couldn&#x27;t find any broken wires, but managed to shock myself a few  times on the coils.  </li>
            <li> In August, I am paying her a visit, and will try to remember to update this post to reflect how this hair dryer performs with thick, wavy hair.    </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, wavy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> No better than less expensive hair dryers I have owned.  </li>
            <li> I hate blow-drying my hair because it makes my arms tired, but this one is so light it doesn&#x27;t get tired at all!  </li>
            <li> That comes out to over $2.80 per use which seems a bit ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, I will miss it.</li>
            <li> It is a shame, because the hair dryer had worked well so far, but it is very disappointing to see them not fulfill the guarantee they advertise.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy because it was a little on the expensive side</li>
            <li> I color my hair and it is on the thin side and this dryer tames the frizzies and adds body and</li>
            <li> All of the dryers produced by the well known brands have a reason for complaint or are way too expensive.</li>
            <li> is approximately 223°F.</li>
            <li> I finally tired of the inexpensive blow dryers, and decided to splurge on this after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Poor quality for the price.</li>
            <li> and so my family members don&#x27;t get annoyed by the noise.</li>
            <li> I contacted D.R.G. Trading about my broken hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have never purchased a hairdryer that was this expensive</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t mistakenly flip the wrong switch while using.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a humming useless object.  </li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I were a bit skeptical about this feature, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about purchasing an expensive hairdryer....</li>
            <li> However, it started to make weird noises and squeaky sounds after 1 year and three months.</li>
            <li> My technique was sadly out of practice</li>
            <li> You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> It was a very poor value for the $80 I paid in Sept</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cold and in between</li>
            <li> Having crazy curly hair I am no stranger to losing the battle against frizz when trying to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Several readers have mentioned about the controls being in an awkward place</li>
            <li> After 8 months, the cold button froze in position and no longer works.</li>
            <li> The handle is wobbly and seems like it is about to detach from the rest of the dryer making me afraid to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Disappointing...</li>
            <li> but I received a bad unit.  </li>
            <li> For the longest time I was trying to figure out what the bad smell was in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick to think that I dropped eighty bucks on it.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Great hair dryer, salon-quality. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this dryer.  I did not know how a dryer could change your hair!</li>
            <li> I was so tired of cheap hair dryers breaking and decided to purchase this dryer. I am very pleased with this hair dryer. It is much quieter than most dryers and dries hair quickly. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> my wife is very happy with this purchase. I chose the product because the ad stated it was quiet, light powerful, professional quality. I have found everyting to be as advertised or better. hairblower is VERY QUIET and light to hold. these were impotant factors in choosing this prduct. price was very reasonable. delivery was quick. product was received in pristine condition. I highly recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li> Really love this hair dryer.  It is super lightweight and sleek.  Dries hair quickly and easily.  The price was on target and the shipping was ultra fast -- very pleased with the seller as well. Highly recommend product and seller! Kudos to both :)</li>
            <li> I originally came onto Amazon to search for  a dryer that I had found in a store that was out of stock.  Once logging on, I decided to peruse the selection of hair dryers in the same price range.  This dryer had the largest number of reviews and the highest rating.  I was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers commented on how great the Onei dryer was, citing it&#x27;s speed in drying, it&#x27;s ionic component that left hair smooth, and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was.  The dryer arrived faster than anticipated and I was in love the first time I used it!!  It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers), my hair doesn&#x27;t require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it&#x27;s actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).  While I don&#x27;t have to worry about waking anyone up, it&#x27;s quiet enough not to drown out the phone ringing or my music playing while I get ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are great...as is the long cord.  I really love this product and hope it lasts as long as other reviewers said it did!</li>
            <li> As good as my much more expensive hair dryer, if not better.  I&#x27;m so glad my stylist told me about it -- Great find!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer - very professional results, several heat and speed settings.  Really worth the amount spent.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Melted in my hands the first time I plugged it in.  I sent it back.</li>
            <li> The motor died after a year of very light use. (2-3x/month). It was a very poor value for the $80 I paid in Sept 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t very impressed even while it was functioning. &amp;#34;Blowout&amp;#34; styling results were not as good as I get with my drugstore cheapie; hairs would get chomped and tangled in the dryer; poor button placement so the controls were frequently switched on/off, high/low by the palm of my hand while I was trying to dry my hair. (Maybe I gripped it funny, but it did annoy me every time I used it)</li>
            <li> My daughter had gotten an ionic hair dryer and told me how much she enjoyed it. So, though my hair is much shorter than hers, I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the Onei MK_ll, a different brand than my daughters.  I loved it the first time  I used it.  I color my hair and it is on the thin side and this dryer tames the frizzies and adds body and shine.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter tried it when she came to visit and, of course, loved it!! So--I bought her one, too.  She claims that it is light, easy to handle, dries her hair quicker and over all, does a much better job than her old one.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was prompt and product was in good condition.  No problems.</li>
            <li> The power cord broke in the first 60 days. I haven&#x27;t tried to return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer in June 2014.  I really liked it until it abruptly died in December 2014.  Yep, that&#x27;s right; I paid nearly $100 for a fancy hair dryer that lasted less than 6 months.  If you assume that I perhaps dry my hair 5 times a day, you&#x27;d be mistaken.  I MAYBE used the hair dryer a max of 2x per week.  That comes out to over $2.80 per use which seems a bit ridiculous.  I would never ever ever buy this hair dryer again.  In fact, while I&#x27;m trying to decide if I take a chance on another expensive hair dryer, I went back to using my trusty old (as in 5 years old) Revlon hair dryer that won&#x27;t quit running.  I suggest no one buys this hair dryer ever ever again.</li>
            <li> Awesome blow dryer and completely worth the money- I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments of friends and family who&#x27;ve used it- they don&#x27;t want to spend the money to but their own, but yes you should get this!!</li>
            <li> My wife had a Conair hair dryer, her 3rd one in 3 years I think. When the most recent Conair died, I thought I&#x27;d look around for a better hair dryer. All of the dryers produced by the well known brands have a reason for complaint or are way too expensive. This one seemed to find the Goldilocks zone: excellent reviews and decent price. So we decided to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far my wife really likes it. It&#x27;s light, quiet, produces good heat, dries her hair more quickly, and seems to have made a noticeable difference in the appearance of her hair. Since we just bought it, I can&#x27;t say much about it&#x27;s longevity, but it comes with a 4-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that I a bit concerned about making this purchase because I had never heard of Onei before and because you can&#x27;t find much about them online (the company does have a decent website). Also, the reviews seemed a bit too good to be true, but so far I am finding that they were not misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good hair dryer at a reasonable (not dirt cheap) price, this might be it.</li>
            <li> Purchased the Onei MK-II to replace my wigo. After purchasing a Chi &amp; Sedu I was hesitant to purchase the Onei. This by far has surpassed my expectations &amp; my experience with the Chi &amp; Sedu. I need a hairdryer to meet my needs: dry without loss of volume &amp; decrease amount/use of root/shine styling products. Very surprised at how gentle the air flow comes out &amp; how fast my hair dries.  I assume it&#x27;s based on the barrel shape of the Onei dryer vs a more cylindrical barrel like some dryers. The packaging of the dryer far exceeded my expectations. The quality of the Onei feels/looks better than the sedu I purchased months ago. So far very surprised &amp; looking to see if this will outlast my last dryer a wigo(5yrs).  I have had this dryer for only a month &amp; have not heard of this brand before. That&#x27;s why I only gave it a 4. So far loving it better than the Sedu &amp; Chi.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works great!  My hair is dry in half the time and it&#x27;s much quieter than my old 2500 watt con air.</li>
            <li> I needed a new hair dryer and wanted one that was of good quality and quieter than my last dryer.  This dryer fits the bill.  The dryer is also light weight.</li>
            <li> Dead in 15 months.  I bought this in August of 2013 and it began making odd noises several weeks ago, it&#x27;s obvious now the motor bearings are shot.  This is junk.. Sad too, because I thought I was buying a better dryer for the $69 at the time.  Initially I liked it because it was a little lighter than typical but the wife was indifferent.  I can&#x27;t believe people are buying this for $120 now.</li>
            <li> Though has standard features, the best thing about this hair dryer is practically weightless, almost as light as a feather, love it!</li>
            <li> My $160 blow dryer burned out on vacation.  I really could not afford to spend that kind of money again, but I have curly hair so having a good blower to straighten out my hair is important.  This one was cheaper, but I had never heard of the brand before so I was hesitant, but after researching and reading the reviews, I figured I would go for it.  All I can say is I love it!  It&#x27;s quiet, it&#x27;s light, it has alot of heat settings, the buttons are positioned well, and it works better than my old blow dryer as far as straightening my hair.  My boyfriend who also uses it, even commented on how much he likes it, and he is one picky kind of guy.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it but the electrical cord had a short and it stopped working 3 days ago.  just 2 days after the return policy ran out (bought it Nov 31st 2014).  Terrible return policy given the very expensive price tag on this.  Don&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I went thru chemo and my new hair is frizzy so I needed a special dryer and the Onei MK is it. It worked beautifully in calming the frizzes and finally being able to style my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and quiet, dries hair fast and evenly.  Could&#x27;t ask for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My main complaint about this product is its strong plastic odor.  I&#x27;ve let it air out for days and it still smells..  It&#x27;s a good product, and it is very quiet compared to other hair dryers.  I&#x27;ve own it several weeks now and the plastic components still really smell.</li>
            <li> I Love this hairdryer. I have naturally wavy hair and it would always get frizzy when I would blowdry it. Using this dryer my looks healthy and shiney and does not get frizzy at all. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using hair dryers that range from $20-30 and they don&#x27;t last very long without that burning smell and they get very hot. I decided that my hair deserves better, this time around, so the old Conair hit the trash can bottom with a satisfying &amp;#34;thud&amp;#34; after I used this dryer for the first time! The heat/cool adjustments and the fan speed adjustments are perfect! Especially on these hot, muggy, summer days in Georgia. I can set the dryer on cool and turn the fan on full blast. It&#x27;s awesome! My hair looks shinier and my frizzies are disappearing. I love my Onei MK-II and will never give it back! Get your own!</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my dryer quickly as the dog chewed the plug off of the cord of the old one.  Based on reviews, I ordered the Onei dryer.  It is lightweight, quiet (!) and really can get hot so less drying time.  I am quite pleased with it.  And the seller even sent a follow up email to ensure my satisfaction with the product.  I call that excellent customer satisfaction!!</li>
            <li> No better than less expensive hair dryers I have owned.  Died after about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I just love my new hair dryer!  My husband got me this after I learned that I have some hearing lost.  (Been using the dryer everyday for more than a month.)  The sound from this dryer is very soft and soothing unlike all the other hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned.  What I love about this dryer is that I no longer have to go clear across to another part of our home to dry my hair in the morning when my family is still asleep.  I can simply close my bedroom door and people in the other bedrooms aren&#x27;t disturbed by the sound of my dryer.  This is a huge plus for us.  This dryer dries fast and makes my hair looks voluminous.  This is an appliance that I use at least once every day, it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my daughter and she loved it..said it was low in noise and did a great job with her long hair..might have to get the other daughter one..</li>
            <li> Is it too early to give 5 stars since I have had the product for one week? Maybe, but I have nothing negative to write about.  It is light and easy to handle with all the push buttons at your finger tips.  My hair is short, straight and not easy to manage.  No problem with my new hair dryer; I can add volume, softness and shine.  Yes, I do use a little bit of gel, but I was not able to get the results with the dryers I had used before. I agree the manual does not provide enough information about the blue/green light.  I found all the answers I needed from Questions and Answers. Nice product!  [[ASIN:B00APV7OWG Onei MK-II Air Ionique Hair Dryer with Ionic Generator for Professional Blowouts]]</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a professional style blow dryer. My hair was growing back thin after cancer. My old blow dryer didn&#x27;t give volume to my hair as this dryer does. Wish I had it sooner.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever used. Very quiet, yet powerful and leaves hair very shiny and soft. Definetly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer as a gift a year and a half ago, and it stopped working one day.  So I bought a second one.  Why buy another if the first one broke after only 1 1/2 years?  Well, my pet peeve is loud hair dryers, as I value my hearing, and this is the quietest hair dryer I&#x27;ve had that is still powerful and dries my hair fast.  I read lots of reviews of hair dryers costing half as much, and found no shortage of bad reviews on all of them.  So I&#x27;m going with what I know I like, and if it only lasts another couple of years, it&#x27;s still worth the extra $30 or so, but I am dropping a star for the longevity.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace a Chi dryer, one almost twice as expensive as this one, that was none-too impressive and had broken on me twice in a year.  I was somewhat skeptical of spending even $80 on a dryer as my last adventure had not been very successful.  However, this dryer does not disappoint!  It&#x27;s reasonably light weight, powerful and easy to grip for self-done blow-outs.  I will say, it&#x27;s not particularly quiet, but I am a consumer level user so I could really care less how much noise it makes.  All in all, it&#x27;s a solid purchase, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works well. I purchased it based on the 5-star reviews it had received from the few reviewers available at the time. Light weight... various heat settings... positive and negative ion adjustments... etc. My only disappointment is the price. I&#x27;ve tried better or comparable professional hair dryers that are about $20 less expensive. I thought this dryer would be better than those, given the price and excellent reviews. It isn&#x27;t. Oh well! Still keeping it. Rationalization: It&#x27;s a perfectly good dryer.</li>
            <li> I am very please with how soft and shining my heair looks by using this dryer.  I normally pay more for a dryer, but I&#x27;m hooked on MK-II.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  Cool, medium, high settings great...but the key is that it is LIGHT weight.  An ionic dryer without being my work-out also!  Shiny hair in quick time.  Why did I wait so long to buy a product that works?</li>
            <li> Five stars for sure. It&#x27;s quiet, light and dries hair super fast. I have wavy hair that tends to be frizzy, and it really helps to keep it sleek in the hot, humid summer months. I will say that it died within a year and a half, although that may have been my fault. However, I sent them an email which they immediately replied to and they replaced it within two days of me shipping it back. Amazing customer service and great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Our family purchased this hair dryer in May 2013. It worked fantastically for the first couple of months, but in October, the hair dryer unexpectedly stopped working. We rapidly contacted the company and they immediately said they would send a replacement. However, after that, we have not heard from them again, and we have yet to receive the replacement they said they would send. It is a shame, because the hair dryer had worked well so far, but it is very disappointing to see them not fulfill the guarantee they advertise. This guarantee was one of the reasons we decided to buy the product in the first place. Amazon also said they can&#x27;t do anything about it, because the time had expired to make complaints. If anyone has had such an experience and can help us out, we would be really thankful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It has been two months, and we still have not heard back from these people regarding their \\&quot;Warranty\\&quot;. They replied below, but did not provide any contact information. The Warranty has only a few months left and after promising to send a replacement, they have not honored their warranty! Beware!! Do not buy their hair dryers!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much insight for the hair dryer&#x27;s performance as it was a Xmas gift for my wife but her feedback-in-a-nutshell to me was &amp;#34;I Love It!!&amp;#34;.  After exhaustive research on my part to find the best hair dryer at a given price point, I settled on the Onei MK-II based purely on the Amazon reviews and it apparently paid off.  (BTW, she has very fine, blonde hair).</li>
            <li> Update after owning for 2 years (I had paid 79.99 for this hair dryer in 2014) I will buy this product again, despite the fan having stopped working at 2 years. If you smack it against your hand and immediately put your hand over suction side, the blower fan runs until you removed your hand.  I suppose there is a short and the suction was causing the wires to come back together and connect.  Took apart to try and fix it, couldn&#x27;t find any broken wires, but managed to shock myself a few  times on the coils.  The heater still works. I&#x27;m sure this dryer was dropped to the tile floor more than once in 2 years, so it&#x27;s possible we damaged it. With that in mind and because it is so QUIET.  (I can&#x27;t hear it running from bed when my wife is using it behind a closed bathroom door) and has very good airflow, I will replace it with the new model.  The last brand she had, I could still hear it running with a damn pillow over my head.  Cheers and hope this helps you.  I was going to give 4 stars but it&#x27;s possible the blower fan stopped due to it being dropped and it is otherwise a great dryer.  ............................................  Exceptionally QUIET!!!  Very good airflow, according to my 43 year old wife with lot&#x27;s of hair!!!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Have owned for 1.5 years and this hair dryer has made me a happy man.  I went from having to wear air-plugs when my wife blow-dried her hair (in the bathroom with door closed) to not being able to hear the blow-dryer. For 10 years I&#x27;ve been loosing my mind having to listen to my wife&#x27;s ridiculously loud hear dryer. One day I decided enough is enough!!!!  I spend half a day researching hair dryers. This one is phenomenal.  If you own hair salon, perhaps you&#x27;ll have a different opinion, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The diffuser works perfectly fine, and I suspect that most users complaining about it, may not have taken the time to notice that there are 2 grooves along the edge of the cone. Slide the diffuser in along the grooves and twist it 5 degrees or more and it locks into place.whereby a tab on the difuser catches a groove on the cone which keeps it form coming off.  If you don&#x27;t turn it, it will come off.  It seems to me the diffuser makes a pretty good, fairly tight friction fit.  Perhaps, if you are a hair salonist, constantly sliding the diffuser on and off, it might eventually weaken the plastic tab on the diffuser, but for the average user I doubt this will ever be an issue. There is a good quality, plastic to plastic friction fit.  I should add that I rarely ever write reviews.  However, I like this product so much, and did so much research, that I felt compelled to do so in hope of saving many of you the aggravation of 4 hours of research.  (I intend to buy a 2nd one and keep it for the future, just in case).</li>
            <li> I received this a day ago and it works well, is quiet and my hair is still on my head.....I REALLY LIKE THE CONTROLS!  IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM!</li>
            <li> It was such a pity to receive this and plug it in only to find that it didn&#x27;t work. The lights came on and the unit got hot but the air didn&#x27;t blow. I was looking forward to using this as the reviews from others was outstanding. Had to return it and didn&#x27;t replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISED: December 1, 2015&lt;br /&gt;This new review is LONG overdue.&lt;br /&gt;NOT ALL HAIR DRYERS ARE CREATED EQUAL! I never knew there was such a difference a hair dryer could make on the styling of hair.  After I had returned the DOA hair dryer, Onei Beauty contacted me wanting me to be happy with my purchase and offered to replace the unit. Just the customer service was golden to me until I realized their product was equally as golden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I received the replacement I immediately had to wash and style my hair. I can&#x27;t believe how shiny and soft my hair felt. It&#x27;s so easy to style my hair now. And it&#x27;s quiet AND light.  If you&#x27;re on the fence in purchasing this hair dryer, do not hesitate, buy it. I can&#x27;t thank you enough, Onei, for making me so happy. Sorry it took so long to tell you how much you are appreciated.</li>
            <li> This hair drier does all that it says!  I have chemically relaxed hair, but still need to blow out my hair every week with touch ups daily.  This hair drier cuts down on my time significantly and my hair looks healthier than it has every been!  I used to burn my hair a lot and I have been using this product for a month and have had no problems with that!  The only complaint I have involves the power cord.  It is long, but it gets kinked very easily and adds weight to the blow drier, which in itself is very light.  It is also very ridged and when it gets kinked it often moves around on the counter and I&#x27;ve had to catch it a few times before it fell off or it has fallen into the sink!  So just be mindful of that, but otherwise awesome product.</li>
            <li> Very nice  color and design.especially with very very low noises,so that you can use it in the early morning.will recommend friends to have it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap hair dryers from the drug store for years. When my latest hair dryer started shooting sparks, I knew it was time to get a new one! I decided to spend a little extra, and settled on this product. The difference in quality was instantly apparent. My favorite features are its very long cord, light weight, and quiet motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it dries my very long hair quickly. I use the ion feature at the end and it made my hair very soft and shiny. I would wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> In love with my new hair dryer! I have never purchased a hairdryer that was this expensive and I researched many different types so that I can make the best decision. I certainly did! I can talk to people and even listen to music with the hairdryer on high because it has a low hum rather than a high pitched sound and does not hurt your ear drums. It dries my hair so well and in half the time. It also comes with a diffuser and a straightening piece which I&#x27;ve never used prior to owning this, but now that I have this hairdryer I use these pieces daily. Love it love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the fuss is about with this dryer. It&#x27;s pretty descent. It works about as good as my $20 dryer that lasted me 7 years. It&#x27;s quieter, but if I were to buy another one, I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer since store bought dryers tended to fry my hair and cause split ends. This hair dryer makes my hair much smoother while protecting the ends. It is quiet and doesn&#x27;t scare my cats away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the length of the cord. After plugging it in the bathroom, I can only make it into the living room. If it reached farther into the kitchen it would have been a real hit.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot, wish it had a little more power, but I like how quiet it is since I have to blow dry my hair in the morning while my husband is still asleep.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is amazing. It is fast, efficient, and doesn&#x27;t dry outta hair. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would recommend this product to a friend!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace a Jibere tourmaline hair dryer that quit after several years. I was looking for a quiet, powerful &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; ac motor dryer without soft-touch coating (it becomes sticky and wears off over time). I first replaced it with an Ion brand dryer, but promptly returned that model due to poor switch control placement and heavy weight. This hair dryer is light weight. It is quiet and fairly fast-drying for an 1800 watt dryer. I like that the controls are easy to work and do not get accidentally switched when I&#x27;m drying my hair. It came with a concentrator nozzle and a diffuser, which is nice if you like to switch up your style from straight to curly. The dryer has a 4-year warranty, which is mostly unheard of at this price point. The downside: there are no instructions regarding the ion switch, and I can&#x27;t say I notice any difference between neutral and negative ion settings. So far, my hair has not looked as shiny or smooth as when I used my Jibere, but to be fair, it has been really humid here. I&#x27;ve used this dryer about 5 times now. I hope it gives me many good hair days in the future!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is as good as all the reviews say it is. It does give off a gross plastic smell when you use it though. If you can get past that then you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer on the recommendation of so many others&#x27; reviews.  The last hairdryer I had was a $15 Revlon travel dryer that lasted 6 years and was shockingly quiet; however, Revlon has since discontinued the model.  Normally, I would buy any $15 hair dryer but over the past few years the noise level in most hairdryers bothers me; therefore, I sought out a hairdryer that would be of good quality, last for several years, and was also quiet.  The first one I purchased had defective testing buttons on its plug but I returned it and purchased another after being impressed with it after only one use.  For the first few months I was greatly impressed with how quiet and strong the motor is; I have really long hair and it dried it much quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple months the motor has started to make a whining noise when set to high; since I paid $80 for this dryer, I have treated it really well and am worried that it might be breaking already.  I&#x27;m holding out that this dryer will last a long time despite the whining noise because I&#x27;m really impressed with its performance (hence, the 4 star review.)  Fortunately, it comes with a limited warranty; if the product does break, I&#x27;ll have to take it up with the manufacturer and report back.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s possible to have a love affair with a hair dryer, this would be the one.  The dryer&#x27;s best feature is how quiet it is compared to the many that I have owned over the past, well let&#x27;s just say 4 decades.  The other advantages are the multiple heat/cool settings, length of the power cord and the cool shot button.  All controls are arranged conveniently so you don&#x27;t mistakenly flip the wrong switch while using.  Dries my color treated fine shoulder length hair with little or no frizz and have actually cut back by at least half, the use of anti-frizz and shine boosting products so think of the $ savings there.  Only thing I would change are the lack of detail in the \\&quot;instruction\\&quot; manual, but thanks to this review section it&#x27;s not really needed.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for about a month and so far I have been very satisfied.  As mentioned in many other reviews, I love that it emit much less noise than many other hair dryers.  It is also a nice size and lightweight.  My hair looks shiny and soft when I use it.  I would definitely recomment this product to others who want a nice hair dryer without spending over $100.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!!! It manages to dry your hair with high heat in a gentle way.  Whatever voodoo they are using, I approve whole heartedly.  I like it that my hair feels soft after I use it.  After I dry my hair, I use the cool setting on high and gently cool down my whole hair.  It feels so nice, it&#x27;s making me want to wash my hair right now!</li>
            <li> As a person who was in the Hair Care business for more than a decade I can  honestly say that I wish they made products of this quality when I was in the business.  This blow dryer is amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because I became convinced she was going to go deaf eventually from her previous hairdryer, I found it deafening from down the hallway but she&#x27;s running the thing for minutes a day right next to her ears :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is remarkably quieter - still a noisy gadget, but what a difference.  Much lower decibels and a more pleasant, lower frequency sound as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury seems to be out on whether ions do anything or not, but after a couple weeks&#x27; use she did remark that it worked faster and she thought her hair looked better too.</li>
            <li> I did give a good review after a couple weeks of use.  But forget it now.  Now I changed my review. That 4 year warranty a joke, especially when Onei company won&#x27;t contact me back after weeks of waiting.  I bought my hair dryer from the MKT Distribution off Amazon.  Good follow-up from this company but I received a bad unit.  I bought my hair dryer August 2013 and it broke down 3 weeks ago.  While I was blow drying my hair all of a sudden the power went down to a 1/3 of what it was.  As if the life was sucked out of it.  It can&#x27;t even dry my hair now.  It&#x27;s like a humming useless object.  Nice to know I wasted 90.00.</li>
            <li> Gave to my wife for Christmas. I wanted a dryer that was quiet and light. Well made and very quiet. I am a Hairstylist and got one for myself to use in my shop. You will like it!!</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled by all of the fabulous reviews for this dryer.  Mine stopped working completely after less than six months.  I contacted the company and they told me to send it back with a note saying &amp;#34;defective&amp;#34; and my address so they could send a replacement.  I paid $12 shipping to send it to them.  It&#x27;s been two weeks and I have yet to receive a replacement.  I have contacted the company multiple times since to find out what is going on and I have not received a response.  Terrible hairdryer.  Terrible company.  For all we know, their company representatives could be the ones writing the glowing reviews because I don&#x27;t know how anyone could actually recommend this product or company.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hot it&#x27;s cold and in between it&#x27;s quiet, lightweight, easy to use and leaves my hair smooth and shiny without frizz.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> My favorite so far. Takes less time to dry and is quiet. My original one stopped working after about 1 1/2 year, they sent me a replacement right away. I had the new one in 2 days!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! I have had it 4 weeks now, and every time I use it I still marvel at how much I love it. It is light weight which is a must with my carpel tunnel syndrome. It is quiet, which is a huge plus because my husband already contributes some hearing loss to my blow dryers over the years. The cord seems twice as long as all previous models. And it blows very hot which speeds up my drying time. My hair always looks exactly like I had imagined or better in less time. I did struggle a bit to get used to the cold blast button being on the inside of the handle, but it is comfortable now. My sister will definitely be getting one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> For some time now I&#x27;ve been searching for a more quiet hair dryer and I have finally found it!! I love that this dryer is so quiet I can blow dry my hair even after everyone has gone to sleep! At 75db it is perfect and it is a lower frequency as well which helps keep it quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the Ionic technology. My husband &amp; I were a bit skeptical about this feature, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it I&#x27;m a believer! With the Ionic generator turned OFF my hair does gain volume but it also tangles really easily. With the Ionic Generator turned ON the tangles disappear and my hair gets really smooth and soft! It&#x27;s also helping with my split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 heat seatings are great too! I believe the manufacture claims the lowest setting is a cool 62°F and the hottest is approximately 223°F. It gets really hot, but it&#x27;s great that you can use the cool shot feature to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; you style when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline: quietest dryer I&#x27;ve ever used and totally worth the money too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this dryer for a few months now and love it. I was looking for a dryer that was quiet and light. I got both. I emailed the company becaues my diffuser was not staying on the dryer. They responded quickly and are sending me a new diffuser. I am confident if that doesn&#x27;t solve the problem they will continue to assist me. Great company, great product!</li>
            <li> I really love the Onei MK-II dryer &amp; definitely rate this a 5 star  The dryer is plenty hot, but soooo much quieter than my old Revlon one.  I do get some flyaway &amp; static, but my hair isn&#x27;t totally dried out &amp; is easy to comb through, even with a tight perm. At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t blowing hot enough, or forceful enough, but I was wrong!  My arm usually gets fatigued when I&#x27;m blowing my hair &amp; I have to stop for a minute or two to rest it, but that doesn&#x27;t happen with this one!  I didn&#x27;t time it, but I would guess maybe 3 minutes to be completely dry, &amp; it had been taking about 15 minutes with my old one that fried my hair.  It does get hot &amp; I love that you can turn the heat setting down, without sacrificing the force of air &amp; still get your hair dry in no time!  I have thin hair, so others may need a little longer time, but it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> Loved the dryer, but very disappointed it didn&#x27;t even make it up to 1 1/2 years before it started smoking and couldn&#x27;t be used again.</li>
            <li> Busy mom has drying time cut in half, plus shinier hair. Only regret I have is not buying sooner! Also, it is quiet which is soothing to me and less intimidating to my littles on the occasion I dry their hair.</li>
            <li> It is definitely faster and quieter than my old dryer - I love that about it. I can&#x27;t tell if the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; part does anything at all, and the diffuser dryer doesn&#x27;t seem super effective. But my favorite thing is that the cool shot button actually works! quickly! amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but it makes my hair look like a wig.  LIKE A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL WIG.  It&#x27;s smooth and shiny and requires no flat ironing, it&#x27;s just perfect.  Totally crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
            <li> I purchased it hoping to get that salon blowout look. I was disappointed when it worked the exact same a my old $15 dollar hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, it&#x27;s so quiet we can talk while she does her hair without her turning off the blow dryer to here what I said.</li>
            <li> This dryer was fantastic for the first 6 months. Stopped working after that! I didn&#x27;t realize there was a warranty card at the back of the user information booklet so I never sent it in. They won&#x27;t replace this $80.00 hair dryer now. Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Came with great attachments! Love the long cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled I have long thick hair which usually takes forever to dry. But with this blow dryer takes me only 10 mins !</li>
            <li> I am happy with the fact that my hair does feel healthier but dry time which was supposed to be cut in half was not so. For the cost of the dryer I would have like directions to running the dryer. I have no idea what the difference is between Negative ions or neutral ions. This would be helpful since its all about the ions! Overall I feel like it is a good dryer just wish it had done all it was supposed to do for the price!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. Quiet, light weight, and has lots of heat and air options.  Thenfar-infared techinology dries in Hal the time.  It&#x27;s a great product that I&#x27;ve recommended to my hair dresser!</li>
            <li> I like how quickly this dryer dries my hair.  I like the negative ion feature, which seems to leave my hair glossier. It comes with both a concentrator and diffuser.  The attachments do fall off once in a while - not a big problem.  I would prefer a lighter-weight dryer and cord, which is VERY long.  But otherwise I think it a very good dryer and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This arrived fast and in great shape.  The dryer is quiet.  It works perfectly well.  It&#x27;s just what my daughter asked for, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Quiet, very light and long cord, work as promised, cool air wonderful, medium heat is all required...&lt;br /&gt;loved the 2 attachments that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;came earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything the other 4-5 star reviewers said. My favorite part is the soft sound and the long cord.  And of course Amazons service is one of the best!!! Love Amazon!!    Update;  8 months after purchasing this dryer, I pressed the cold shot button and it would not pop back out! I was unable to send it back to Amazon for an exchange but they told me to contact the manufacturer and that it was still on warranty! I did and Onei Beauty made it simple! I send it back to them and they&#x27;ll send me another! Voila! Done! I&#x27;m not sure how long this product will last, but feel confident that the company will take good care of me should it happen again within a reasonable time frame! Because after all I REALLY LOVE THIS DRYER!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST blow dryer I have ever used.  It is extremely light weight and my thick hair is blow dried very quickly without my arm getting tired and sore.  My hair looks amazing too, shiny ans smooth.  In the past, I often didn&#x27;t dry all the way because it took too long, but now my hair looks great everyday because it works so effectively by drying so fast.  I love this hair dryer.  Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my hair dryer but didn&#x27;t want to spend over a hundred dollars for it.  I checked with Amazon and the Onei MK-II hair dryer was featured for less than half that price.  I figured if it wasn&#x27;t that good I would keep it as a back up.  I am happy to report that this is a wonderful hair dryer. It works without the heat burning your scalp and it is more quiet than most hair dryers. My hair retains water and usually takes a long time to dry but this hair dryer does it faster.  I use this hair dryer every day and will order another for my beach house.  Another good quality is that for a full-size hair dryer, it is lighter than most.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. She says that it dries her hair fast without leaving it frizzy. In fact, we&#x27;ve noticed that her hair has more shine to it since using the MK-II Air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  - Light weight, especially for such a powerful unit&lt;br /&gt;  - 3 settings where many only have 2&lt;br /&gt;  - Quiet even on the highest setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  - Cost. We&#x27;ve never paid so much for a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was more than we wanted to pay but we both agree that it is worth every penny. This has our highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> The Onei-II Ionique Hair Dryer does a really good job drying my hair.  The hair dryer is lightweight and powerful.  My only question that was not in with instructions, when would I use the &amp;#34;Negative Ion&amp;#34; setting or the &amp;#34;Regular Ion&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li> I like the weight, the size, the feel in my hand. This dryer is way too hot.  I used the lowest heat setting and just holding up to my hand burns my skin, so drying my hair, burns my scalp.  I will be returning.</li>
            <li> After years with my old hairdryer, I found that the new, cheaper ones were just that, cheap.  This is great hairdryer.  It actually makes my hair look better -- gives my short hair more body.  It is very quiet -- my dogs don&#x27;t run out of the bathroom!  Works great and feels like it should last...</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  It is quiet, quick dry and even looks good.  I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Dries my hair without any frizz, is lightweight and not noisy.  Comes with a nice 4 year warranty.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, quiet and easy to operate . Well worth the price. I am a hair product junkie and snob. So give it a try, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> RATING WAS HIGH MY GIRL FRIEND LOVE THE WAY IT GET HOT FAST AND EASY TO USE ATTACHMENTS THE BEST THING I EVER BOUGHT FOR HER.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and I couldn&#x27;t have chosen a better product myself.  I am able to dry my hair in about half the time w/o a lot of frizz.  It is light-weight and the placement of the controls are perfect. No accidental control switching while holding and styling.  Never heard of this company but you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist so it&#x27;s important that a dryer is lightweight. This one is the most lightweight dryer I&#x27;ve ever held! It also gets really hot which helps drying time and it&#x27;s extremely quiet which is also important when trying to hear your client while blow drying. I would absolutely recommend this dryer to anyone. It was actually recommended to me from another stylist at my salon and it&#x27;s the best hair dryer purchase I&#x27;ve made!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer as a gift for a family member. She has curly hair and her previous hair dryer - an old conair - has recently started just plain burning hair. I personally own a supersolano 232b hair dryer, which I am very happy with, but she was not very impressed with it when she visited, so I looked for something with more settings and better for curly hair (my own hair is wavy). Based on the reviews, I purchased this hair dryer and well - I have gotten a phone call, every day for two weeks, telling me what an amazing hair dryer this is.    The trick to making the best use of this hair dryer is using the regular ion setting when drying and then switching to the negative ion to give your hair that sleek, shiny look. Today, she also told me that for restyling between washes, she&#x27;s been spraying her hair with a spray bottle - getting it just a little damp - and redrying with the negative ion setting. She loves how it dries without drying out hair, and how the flexibility in settings makes it much, much easier for dealing with brittle, curly hair. After two weeks of use, her hair is soft and staying styled rather than going back to messy curls from the slightest exposure to humidity. She can&#x27;t wait until the conair-damaged hair grows out so she can really see what this hair dryer can do.    Based on her excellent feedback, I would definitely consider purchasing one of these myself - although I love my current hair dryer and won&#x27;t need a new one for a long time yet. In August, I am paying her a visit, and will try to remember to update this post to reflect how this hair dryer performs with thick, wavy hair.    UPDATE 8/2014: I have now tried out this hair dryer and I love it. Compared to my supersolano, it is slower, but has many advantages: it weighs less, the cord doesn&#x27;t seem as ridiculously prone to becoming a tangly overly-long mess, and the settings allow for more flexibility in drying your hair. The biggest difference is really the negative ion setting: after drying with neutral ion, my hair is a little frizzy, but going over the slightly-moist hair with negative ion makes it looks silky and shiny with zero frizz. I love this product and although I think my personal hair dryer is pretty great too, if it was to break tomorrow, I&#x27;d definitely go for one of these.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairdryer I have ever purchased and used. I feel like I am in a salon every time I blow dry my hair. It is definitely salon quality.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a decent hair dryer that would not cost an arm and a leg.  This hair dryer has far exceeded my expectations on both!  It is an incredible hair dryer - quiet and really powerful and it cost less than $100!!!  And it leaves my hair feeling incredible - no frizz or flyways!</li>
            <li> Edit #2: Again, the Cool Shot button is stuck in the on position.  I can not believe this has happened again.  I will not be trying to run this company down again as the first time was hassle enough.  Save your time, money and energy by purchasing from a well known brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I received my replacement hair dryer today and I hope the cool shot button doesn&#x27;t give me trouble because I really love this hair dryer! Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is very quiet and I am impressed by how hot it can get. Most of the time I use it on warm only as hot can get too hot really fast. I loved it until this morning. I pressed the Cool Shot button to set my curl and the button would not pop back up. Thank goodness I was nearly done blow drying my hair because I could only blow cold air unless I physically pried the button back up. Even if I barely touched the Cool Shot button with my finger, it would blow cold and I would again have to pry it back out. So now I am stuck with an expensive 6 month old dryer that will only blow cold. Waiting to hear back from the manufacturer about the warranty. It&#x27;s more of a hassle than anything, especially with our humid summer starting and no blow dryer to tame this frizz ball.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lightweight and quiet dryer.  This is perfect.  Although I do not need the long cord now, it would have been great in other bathrooms.  Love the quiet .  It is replacing an old Brookstone that was very quiet but also pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> This item exceeded my expectations.  My hair is very prone to dry and brittle ends.  This is the type of dryer it needed to carefully&lt;br /&gt;dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I am still getting used to the dryer.  As a blow out stylist, it is hard to transition to a new hair dryer.  It is lightweight and quiet.  I am not sure if I notice a big difference with the ion button.  It could just be me, I do move quickly from client to client.</li>
            <li> So far love this dryer! Very light and powerful. My hair looks smooth and healthy. And I love the diffuser that comes with it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this hair dryer.  It is light weight, very powerful and super quiet.  Well worth spending the extra money!  Controls are easy to use and in just the right place.  Drys my hair super fast and leaves it nice and shiny!</li>
            <li> The item arrived perfectly on time and in great condition. It has an adequate blowing system and heating for my medium texture of hair.</li>
            <li> Our cats get the joy of this Hair Dryer as we give them a Bath every other week.  This hair dryer is very quiet and does not disturb our cats as much as other hair dryers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet and with the long cord it makes it very useable.  Hot setting is just right; warm setting works great.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair this is the perfect hair dryer.  I previously owned a T3 that gave out and I wanted to find a similar dryer for less.  This is better than a T3 and it comes with a diffuser.  There is a slight smell when you first use the dryer but it disappears after a few uses.  Well worth the money. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about purchasing an expensive hairdryer....I was not sure there would be much difference.  After reading all the reviews AND asking my stylist, I decided it would be a good investment.  I LOVE my new dryer and my hair seems healthier and not as dry.  Even my husband noticed a difference.  It dried my hair in half the time and is very quiet.  I am glad I decided to purchase this product!  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> In the photo the cord looks round, which was one of my criteria (round truly doesn&#x27;t kink) but it isn&#x27;t.  The air speed isn&#x27;t great.  Overall, if I had seen it perform I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased.</li>
            <li> I finally tired of the inexpensive blow dryers, and decided to splurge on this after reading the reviews. I am not disappointed! I have very fine, thin hair, and this dryer makes my hair look as if I just stepped out of the salon. No frizzy hair or dry ends, and it dries very fast. I really like how you can select either negative or neutral ion drying. I LOVE this dryer! I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a couple of weeks, and so far, I really like it. It is quiet, but powerful. Light weight, but seems to be good quality. The cool-shot button is in a convenient place, unlike some of dryers I&#x27;ve had. The extra long cord is also nice. Remains to be seen how long it lasts. But I&#x27;m happy with it and the way it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my daughter and my wife tried it once and so I had to order her one also...seems to be the best they have used and is a great company...</li>
            <li> Love this dryer!!! Bought it for work as a professional stylist and really love how quiet and light it is. Awesome dryer at an incredible price!  I tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li> Best Pro Dryer ever! Super long cord makes it #1</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! That is how my daughter describes this hair dryer.  She enjoys the performance, the many choices of heat and power plus the outcome!  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> In with the new, out with the old! At first, when it didn&#x27;t roar like my old one I thought I had bought a dud, but then it worked faster, with less heat, and less air. I love it. I only wish it had a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, don&#x27;t love it.......... I expected my medium fine hair to glide through the bristles but it can be a little difficult if you have product in your hair and are trying to blow dry it yourself. I am sure it works great if someone else is drying your hair ; - )</li>
            <li> The Onei MK-II hair dryer is an excellent way to reduce frizz when drying while styling.  I would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  It seems to help with body.  It is not really powerful, but it is okay with me.</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer!  Helps reduce frizz, dries hair quickly and it&#x27;s very quiet.  Only issue I have is the concentrator does not fit the nozzle accurately.  I have to really work at it to get it to stay on.  Other than that it&#x27;s great and I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell you how much loved this dryer...for 2 weeks. The first one I bought burnt out on me in less than a week..shipped it back and gave it another try. I&#x27;ve not had my replacement one for 5 weeks and now the cool button is stuck. Sending this one back too..don&#x27;t buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer, compared it with the SEdu 4000 and ended up returning the Sedu because it was much heavier and louder.  THis dryer is quiet, light, and I don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair after. My hair is thick, wavy and frizzy. It also cut down my drying time about 5 minutes.  So glad I found it on Amazon after a very extensive search. And it was half the price of the Sedu!</li>
            <li> She likes the control over power.  She says it makes her hair less &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; and the handle fits her hand well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas 2013. It is now September 2014 and the plug is completely broken through normal use. It just started to come apart one day and despite my best efforts kept cracking. I emailed the company twice because they have a 5 year warranty but did not even get a response.    Update:  Onei got in touch with me and it appears as though they attempted to contact me. Customer service is very important to me and the service they have provided me since they we have been in touch is exemplary. I really appreciate it and have changed my review to reflect this.</li>
            <li> Seems like a great top of the line hair dryer, well built. I would recommend to anyone, beats the department store models hands down.</li>
            <li> &#x27;ve been through three hair dryers in the past year. One of them broke after a short fall from my hand to the bathroom counter (seriously??), the second one always got too hot and stunk up my bathroom, even on the lowest hear setting (grrrr...) And then there was the Onei.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Onei is just perfect! I really like that is has an ion activation switch in the handle. When you turn on the dryer, you can hear it speed and warm up - there isn&#x27;t that sudden blast of metal smelling heat like the cheaper dryers I&#x27;ve owned. I definitely recommend the Onei to anyone who wants a quality dryer.</li>
            <li> buttons interfere with handle.  always turning off</li>
            <li> No problems, arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> My old ionic dryer was dying- I liked that this one featured an &amp;#34;on demand&amp;#34; ion option, and other reviewers vouched for its quiet. I am using it now for a few months, and it is really a great dryer.  It is light, balanced, and easy to handle.  I like that you can switch the ion on/off, and that heat/air settings are completely adjustable.  And it really, really is quiet. It does what is says it does, and it is worth the $$.  Also shipped quickly. Makes you hair shiny and fires very quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my lady as one of her Christmas gifts. She had her last hair dryer for 7 years or so. This one drys her hair in half the time and is about 20 times quieter. I can&#x27;t write much about the features, but I do know that she loves it.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer itself, while it was working.  Mine lasted 4 months and completely died.  Now I have to figure out how to return it, because it says I am past my return period on Amazon and can&#x27;t return it here.  Would not do this again because it is too much of a hassle!</li>
            <li> After using the Onei flat iron I decided to see what other Onei products I could purchase. This blow dryer is fabulous. I have a lot of hair and because of the dryers power, my blow dry time has been shortened. Every time I use this dryer i feel like I am at a salon because the blow dryer is top of the line. No more blow dry bars for me. I am more then happy to blow dry my own hair with the Onei Hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. It&#x27;s fast at drying and quiet. It&#x27;s a great tool for everyday drying and worth the money. I also bought the hair straightner and it&#x27;s just as good. I hope Onei keeps making great products like Chi use too!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how great this hairdryer really is. I searched and searched for months unsure of who to believe. I have fine hair, not the thick curly that drives most shoppers toward a certain brand. This one works great for my fine hair, and a plus is that I have not had static during the drying process like with the cheaper hairdryers. There are two settings for ionic, and I don&#x27;t know what the other setting is supposed to do, but the other setting does introduce static, so I use one ionic setting at all times. The main characteristic I searched for was the sound volume and pitch. Someone wrote a review that said they could actually hear the doorbell ring while using this hairdryer, and that convinced me to purchase this model. It is actually true - the pitch is not really a pitch, but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums. My husband can actually sleep when I blow dry, where he could not before. As for lasting ability, it is a quality hairdryer, and I have been using this for about 6 months and it looks as though it will hold up for the long haul.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this hair dryer - I have short hair and it can be difficult to style sometimes, especially as it grows out. Not with this dryer! Will all the different settings I can get my hair to do exactly as I want - in half the time! It literally takes me 5 minutes or less to dry my hair now. And it&#x27;s quiet on top of it all. I had bought this for my daughter who needed a new hair dryer, so I read a lot of reviews and decided on this one. It is so worth the price, which really isn&#x27;t too bad. When she came home from college I made her share it with me over the summer and then I bought my own when she went back. She loves it as well.  I have now had this hair dryer for 2 years and 3 months. It just blew out; the power switch switched off on it&#x27;s own 2 times and the 3rd time, there was a huge spark and smoke came out of it. I dropped it and unplugged it right away.  I have called and emailed the company to ask them about their 4-year warranty with no response. I&#x27;ve had much much cheaper hair dryers go for years. That being said, my daughter&#x27;s unit which we purchased over 3 years ago is still working fine. I don&#x27;t think she uses it as often as I do, though. I paid $80 for hers and $105 for mine, but I&#x27;m certainly not buying another. And yes, the customer service is terrible.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer  based on all the good reviews but also a little apprehensive because of of the few negative reviews, but because of the price, I decided to try it. I am glad I bought this hair dryer. It&#x27;s very light and quiet and  I like that there is a cool air button so you don&#x27;t have to keep your finger on it like most dryers. Great dryer for me!    I am now reviewing after 5 months of use.  WELL......it died on me today:-(  It did perform well while it worked! Disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Read the other positive reviews and decided to purchase this model.&lt;br /&gt;Have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Works as promised and although no hair dryer is truly &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34;, this one comes close.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DRYER, BECAUSE HAS SEVERAL DRYING SETTING, COOL, WARM, OR HOT, HIGH , LOW, NEGATIVE ION, NETURAL ION,  My husband mention how quiet  this blow dryer is to use and how fast it dries the hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know there was a difference between cheap dryers and a professional dryer. I have medium length, not thick but not thin blonde hair. It drys quickly, the condition of my hair feels like my hairdresser dried my hair. I am pleasantly surprised by my findings. Love the dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. It&#x27;s very light.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really notice quicker drying times than my old CHI dryer which I loved.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my daughter and I got this one for myself. Good product.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer. Best I&#x27;ve ever owned! Love how it is so quiet as well. Even my son said it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife. She did some research online an picked this one out. She really likes it, and it&#x27;s much quieter than her old hair dryer, so I like it too.</li>
            <li> I want you to send me a new one.  After 1.5 years of using this, it blew up on me.  This is the worst hair dryer I have ever bought.  Even my conair hair dryer from 15 years ago still works.  Please contact me to send me a new one.</li>
            <li> So far I love it , very quiet!</li>
            <li> This is the first hair dryer that is so low noise. I like it.</li>
            <li> Best darn Hair Dryer you can find.  Professional 4 year warranty and a 9&#x27; cord make the hair dryer an excellent choice and should be very reliable.  The hair dryer is very quiet compared to the others I&#x27;ve owned.  The only thing I can&#x27;t figure out is the ion settings, I&#x27;ll have to ask my hair dresser the next time I&#x27;m in her shop.</li>
            <li> I made a huge mistake by not returning this hair dryer immediately.  The reviews were all terrific, so I just assumed I was not adjusting the ion settings correctly.  My hair is somewhat curly and I usually blow it straight, although sometimes I diffuse it curly.  This hair dryer has, without exception, left my hair extremely unruly.  It makes my hair appear very dry and unhealthy.  I have used some excellent ionic hair dryers in the past and kept waiting for this one to work as well.  Big mistake.  The high heat is extremely hot and damaging to hair.  The medium heat just doesn&#x27;t seem to create any smoothness and there is no cooling button.  One must keep switching the heat settings constantly while trying to dry your hair.  I&#x27;ve been trying to contact the seller, but have been unsuccessful.  I&#x27;d love to know if there is some trick that I haven&#x27;t discovered!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is fantastic. I was hesitant on spending this much, since my previous $30 Revlon lasted me 13 years. I expect this one to last at least that long, if not longer.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is the quietness of this dryer. I have hated most driers simply because I felt like I was going deaf every time I turned one on. But this one is amazing! I like the medium setting, since the high is a little too powerful for my liking, it just splatters water all over my mirror. The sound is a medium hum, like a space heater but a bit louder. The high setting is like a kitchen fan. It&#x27;s just incredible.&lt;br /&gt;The concentrator is great, it really focuses the air where you want it to go. And it does come with a diffuser, but since I have straight asian hair I have no need for it.&lt;br /&gt;Great investment.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and quick drying hair dryer</li>
            <li> I too bought this hair dryer in November 2013 wanting something that would last longer but it quit working two weeks ago. Love the hairdryer but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money if it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> When it works, it a lightweight and powerful hair dryer. However, it started to make weird noises and squeaky sounds after 1 year and three months. Other hair dryers I used usually last more than 2.5 years!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair dryer!  Very quiet but powerful.  It leaves my hair soft and silky.  The best hair dryer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the dryer twice and so far am very pleased.  Haven&#x27;t used it enough to say \\&quot;I love it\\&quot;, but I do like it very much.  It is much quieter than my previous dryer, and it dries my hair quickly on the warm setting which I feel is less damaging.  There is a negative and neutral ion switch which I had to look up online as to how to use the feature because the instruction booklet didn&#x27;t include any information.  Found that strange!!  Not sure I really noticed a huge difference between the settings, but maybe time will tell.  Love the controls for fan speed and temperature because they are easy to push, unlike my other which slid and were difficult to use.  That was one of the main reasons I selected this dryer.  It is also lightweight and has a long cord.  As for durability and longevity, I can&#x27;t vouch for that, but the dryer does have a 4-year warranty.  I liked that, and so far I would recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked and looked, and finally found an amazing hair dryer! It&#x27;s quite, has a super long cord, and dries my hair quickly. The nozzle stays on when I use it, and it&#x27;s lightweight. It&#x27;s a combo of factors that I didn&#x27;t think was possible. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I researched and read reviews.  This was one of the better ones I found.  After I received it I opened and used it.  The hot is really hot - but good when your hair is really wet.  Then you can set it on warm and its good.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I was trying to figure out what the bad smell was in my bathroom.  Turns out it&#x27;s the plastic piece that covers where the cord meets the dryer.  It smells a little like asparagus pee!  Totally confusing and I kept cleaning until I figured it out.  It&#x27;s been weeks now and while the smell is getting better, I still smell it.  If you have a good sniffer, like I do, you probably want to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> After a month of using this Onei hair dryer, I&#x27;d give it four stars. It is lightweight and easy to use. What more could anyone ask for in a hair dryer?  Update-This hair dryer just lost its ability to heat. It is definitely a waste of money. I won&#x27;t purchase another Onei to replace it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and curly and is incredibly difficult to get it dry in a reasonable amount of time, especially with outit frizzing. The Onei blew hot air but wasn&#x27;t like a wind tunnel - it works flawlessly for me. I had a fantastic hair day, and got several complements. Love!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer but why is it more expensive 5 months later? I paid $90 in April. Will definitely not pay what it&#x27;s going for right now. But works perfectly. Long cord is a plus and very light weight.</li>
            <li> I was mostly happy with this dryer. Very lightweight and quiet, great heat, not as much wind and I can wear my finer hair longer. However, it died in the middle of drying my hair for work this AM and it&#x27;s nine months old. I&#x27;ve had cheap hair dryers last for years! Disappointed and now have to start over in search of a good dryer for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer but it did break almost a year after I got it.  I sent it to them Thursday and they sent me tracking and my new one should arrive today (Tuesday).  I think that is pretty great customer service.  I love how quiet and so fast it works.</li>
            <li> I bought &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and received a visibly used product....  The blow dryer works great but I would have never ordered a used blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is great.  I love the option of switching the ionizer on and off.  The dryer is light and easy to control the switches with the hand that is holding the drier.  It arrived quickly and as promised.  Update:  After a year and a half the cool button jammed and I had to pry it out.  Now after two years the heat sensor shuts the hair dryer off after a minute and blows the fuse in the bathroom.  I asked about the warranty and was told they would give me a discount to allow me to purchase a new one for only $60.  Fat chance of that happening!  For what I spent on this hair dryer, I&#x27;ll go with a brand that works for more than two years and a company that actually honors their warranty.</li>
            <li> My wife love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer was good while it lasted until it just sputtered out after owning it for less than two years and with very light use. It broke just before a job interview, which is very special. I had to sit there with half straight and half curly hair. My life is so funny like that. But seriously, I will miss it. I&#x27;m a little upset that it died so soon for the price.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very light, super quiet, and dries hair very quickly. I definitely recommend it, and you will not be sorry you bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is kind of wavy &amp; frizzy, but can be styled into a smoother straighter look with the right hair dryer, brush, and flat iron. This is why I needed a more expensive dryer, and was willing to pay more for it. But I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank, and this price tag was right in line with what I wanted to spend. A lot of people think I&#x27;m crazy for spending $80 on a hair dryer, but my hair style is very important to me. I had my previous hair dryer for at least 10 years when it died and I was beside myself because I was so used to it, I felt like it was an extension of my own arm. I looked all over the internet, but it was discontinued so it wasn&#x27;t available anywhere. I spent a lot of time reading reviews and trying to find the best hair dryer out there for the money, and this is the one I finally decided on. I&#x27;m now ecstatic that I didn&#x27;t find the same model I had before, because this is SO much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use the &amp;#34;negative ion&amp;#34; setting because it closes the cuticle and makes it sleeker/smoother. My hair has definitely been shinier, softer, and smoother than it&#x27;s ever been. I believe the &amp;#34;neutral ion&amp;#34; setting is for more texturized/curly styles, so I don&#x27;t typically use that one. I&#x27;ve accidentally had the switch set to that, though, and it still dried my hair quicker than my last hair dryer (and WAY quicker than my travel hair dryer, the hair driers at the gym, the hotel hair dryers, i.e. the inexpensive ones you can buy at Target/Walmart etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hard of hearing when there&#x27;s any background noise, but this hair dryer is so quiet that I can carry on a conversation while it&#x27;s on the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; velocity setting. It&#x27;s also very very light, so my arms do not get tired when I&#x27;m spending a lot of time styling the back of my head, when my arms are at odd angles. The cord is extra long, so gives you plenty of freedom to move around while styling your hair. It is very convenient because I&#x27;m bending over a lot, plus having to maneuver around other people and big counters when getting ready at the gym. The buttons are perfectly placed, so you don&#x27;t accidentally change the velocity or heat settings just by where you keep your hand on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things about this hair dryer. If you have the money to spend on this hair dryer, you will not regret it.extra long, so gives you plenty of freedom to move around while styling your hair.

            <li> I have searched high and low for the perfect hair dryer and I am so happy to say that I have finally found it. Having crazy curly hair I am no stranger to losing the battle against frizz when trying to straighten my hair. I was amazed at how fast I could blow dry my hair and I barely had to use any product to tame my lions mane. Not only that, but I barely had to use my straightener to finish the job! It&#x27;s an amazing styling tool, and if I had to buy one again I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate buying another Onei MK-II Air Ionique. And to boot it&#x27;s a fabulous Christmas present!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional but have naturally wavy hair which is prone to frizz and fly-away action.  This hair dryer is amazing.  It is heat controlled and not air controlled.  Instead of blowing my hair to dry it out, it gently blows heat at target area and dries hair faster, without wildness and frizz. My hair feels soft, is shiny and dries evenly.  It was worth the money and the time to wait for it to arrive.  But with Prime you&#x27;ll get it pretty quick!</li>
            <li> this is a nice dryer but I saw NO change in the time it took to dry or the way my hair felt and looked after use.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line... Not worth the $$$</li>
            <li> I never realized how much difference a good hair dryer makes on your hair!! I&#x27;m a cancer survivor and have been growing out my hair.  I needed a new hair dryer and I didn&#x27;t want another one from the drugstore.  I started researching hair dryers on the internet and kept reading about the Onei hair dryer. I love the different settings and it&#x27;s light weight in your hand. Just wish it had a retractable cord. It&#x27;s a great medium priced product.  You certainly could pay a lot more for a hair dryer but the Onei is perfect!!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is soooo quiet and quite powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Quality: This is the best hair dryer I have used. Hands down. My favorite feature is that it doesn&#x27;t produce a ton of noise like the T3 I previously had, and if you have a sleeping baby in the next room you&#x27;ll really appreciate the low noise it makes. The performance is perfect and the temperature and fan speed are fully adjustable. I set mine on negative ion, which helps my hair look great before work and after the gym. My wife and I share it and she&#x27;s as satisfied with the quality as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this dryer. I paid over $200 for a T3 and the Onei feels, looks, and sounds like a better product. The performance of both are good, but the Onei has more adjustment options, so I have to rate it higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: I came back from a two-day business trip and it was waiting for me, even though I didn&#x27;t expect it for a week or so. Of course the wife got to it first :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service: The seller sent me a nice email to make sure I was satisfied with the quality and shipping speed. I couldn&#x27;t ask for better customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Highly recommended, both dyer and seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I used this dryer and I am literally amazed I have no frizz at all, I have really big curly hair and now combined with Onei flat iron my hair looks so different healthy,shiny and totally in control .I loved this products and definitely will like to recommend this blowdryer to all of you and absolutely  will keep buying Onei hair products.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned...lightweight, and I have NO STATIC ELECTRICITY in my hair after use...this is amazing!!!  I will purchase another one soon for a back-up...don&#x27;t ever want to be without this hair dryer!!!!</li>
            <li> Hair dryer died today, after 3 months of use, starting making noise, sputtered, then quit working.Still searching for a good dryer that can last.</li>
            <li> after too many drops it finally stop working. I am surprised it took so long! def. buying another one</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this hair dryer because I had never heard of Onei.  After looking at the reviews, I went ahead and took a chance.  It does everything it claims and I am extremely happy that I went ahead and made the purchase.  Now I know why it has gotten excellent reviews.  My daughter&#x27;s birthday is coming up and I will purchase one for her.  I know she will love it :-) as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t rate this five stars because I expected more blowing power. It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do. Drys hair well, Love the different settings. Not too heavy. All in all, it&#x27;s good, but not stupendous.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this hair dryer I have gotten 4 compliments on how good I look (the only change was the hair dryer).  It truly leaves my hair looking silky and smooth.  Also, it dries my hair very quickly and is not heavy like my old hair dryer.  The cool button is also very nice for finishing touches.</li>
            <li> I have held off on writing this review so I could gauge it&#x27;s performance over a long period of time instead of just writing a first impression.  This has been a fantastic hair dryer.  It is not terribly loud and does an excellent job at drying you hair.  I also love how it has an actual cool setting as well as the normal button.  It was always difficult for me to hold the button down to set the style as either my fingers would slip off or my hand would cramp trying to hold it long enough.  Having the ability to just switch it to cool is great.  Definitely one of the best dryers we have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have spent the past few months researching several different hair dryers and finally decided on this one. I&#x27;m so glad I did! I have super thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair and have been using a cheap drugstore dryer for the past several years. I&#x27;m not sure why I never realized that a good hair dryer could make such a difference, but I really wish I had figured it out sooner! I learned this lesson a few years ago when it comes to hair straighteners; I have the T3 Mane Tamer that I absolutely adore. So, I started there. T3 has a few different dryers, all with positive ratings, and all VERY expensive. I wasn&#x27;t convinced that it would be worth it to spend that much. I read through tons of reviews for this Onei hair dryer and was happy with the positive reviews and the price. It arrived quickly and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it out of the box and use it! Normally, I spend a good half hour to 45 mins just getting my hair dry--not blowing it out, not using any brushes or styling tools/techniques, just getting it dry so that I can use my flat iron. The result (before flat ironing) is what I like to call my &amp;#34;white girl afro&amp;#34;--it is big, it is fluffy and it is crazy!&lt;br /&gt;After reading some reviews and Q&amp;As, I switched on the negative ion button, got my round brush and went to town. I could not believe how smooth my hair got just from blowing it dry. My technique was sadly out of practice and I did end up using my flat iron on a few spots, but I think that was entirely user error and expect it to get better with a little practice. I really believe that, once I get used to blowing my hair out again, I will be able to dry and style my hair with no flat iron required!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair was so smooth and VERY shiny in the end, I was so happy with it. The dryer itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold and use and I love all the options it has with heat/cool, fan speed, etc. The buttons are perfectly located for my taste, not in the way at all and no risk of accidentallypushing buttons while using. I also love that there is both a cool shot (if you just need a quick blast of cool air) and a cool temperature setting (for when you want cool air for an extended period of time). I was also really impressed with how quiet this dryer is. When I first turned it on, it actually made me a little nervous because it was so quiet and I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be very powerful, but that is definitely not the case--plenty of power without all the noise.&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very happy with this hair dryer and would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a quiet hair dryer that worked well &amp; this one is perfect.  A little difficult to work the buttons one handed at first, but I&#x27;m sure that I just have to get used to it  -- i recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> My birthday gift to my wife was received very well and she loves the quality of this hair dryer. I love the price!</li>
            <li> Salon quality dryer.  Great size and color. Love that its so quite. I&#x27;ve had to adapt to the controls being on the outside of the handle.(my old one was on the inside) but it&#x27;s well worth it.  My hair dries so fast I have extra time in the mornings.. Love it, Love it, Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this dryer to anyone that wants a quality dryer. Four year warranty. Where can you find that on a hair dryer?</li>
            <li> I was little skepital for spending $70 for a hair dryer. I thought there are no difference between $30 dryer and $70 dryer. This hair dryer is very quite, light weight, dry quick and well made. I got it for two weeks now so far so good!</li>
            <li> After reading all the glowing reviews of this hair dryer here on Amazon, I decided to buy it.  My previous hair dryer had died on me after almost 10 years (Baybliss Pro), and I figured I would spend some extra money to &#x27;upgrade&#x27;.  What a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this dryer almost daily for three months now.  I have long, fine, straight hair.  I kept hoping to eventually like it.  But every time I take it out of the cabinet, I think, \\&quot;Ugh.  I hate this dryer.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t have buyer&#x27;s remorse very often.  This is one of those times, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the dryer itself.  Everyone has commented on how light this dryer is.  It is very light.  It is made out of a light plastic, and feels cheap.  I&#x27;m sick to think that I dropped eighty bucks on it.  It&#x27;s worth about $30.  I&#x27;m afraid that if this dryer fell off the counter, it would easily break.  I&#x27;ve been careful not to let it anywhere near the edge of the counter for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord itself is also flimsy and cheap.  The area where it attaches at the dryer feels rigid, and does not mold to the cord.  It&#x27;s difficult to explain, but I&#x27;ve had other hair appliances that I paid much less for, and the cords all felt superior (thick, more substantial weight) to the one on this hair dryer.  The cord twists and tangles very, very easily.  There is no easy way to wrap the cord without it twisting on itself.  I&#x27;ve tried many times to untwist the cord, but it coils back on itself again.  Think of those old corded phone cords.  Very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no removable hair/lint filter on this dryer.  I don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t design one for it.  Every other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned has one, and they&#x27;re important to help keep hair and lint out of the dryer itself.  The circular plastic piece at the back of the dryer comes off, but why?  There is no filter under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw no difference in the green light/blue light settings for my hair.  It dries my hair, but even doing half my hair on blue setting, and half on green, there was NO DIFFERENCE in shine or volume.  I believe that the switch is simply a gimmicky way to sell the dryer.  My old ionic dryer left my hair in shiny, silky condition.  This one, it just leaves it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  As for me, I&#x27;m going back to BayBliss for a new hair dryer (costs less, better quality!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the [[ASIN:B002JSL6QI Babylis Pro BABTT5585 Tourmaline Titanium 3000 Dryer]] to replace this dryer, and I&#x27;m much, much happier with the Bayblis Pro.on blue setting, and half on green, there was NO DIFFERENCE in shine or volume.

            <li> I guess the temperature is not the same that I used before. It seems like the middle is already too hot for me.</li>
            <li> I broke my wife&#x27;s Babyliss TT 3000 dryer (guess they don&#x27;t bounce), so I had to buy her a replacement.  She has fine hair that lacks body.  As I researched dryers I read that people with fine hair will get better volume &amp; body if they don&#x27;t use NEGATIVE Ion dryers but instead use NEUTRAL Ion dryers.  The price on the MK-II was about $30 more than the TT3000 (which she liked) but I thought that with all the 5 star comments (i.e. lighter weight, quieter, 4 yr warranty, etc.) it was worth it, especially since it had a Negative/Neutral Ion switch.  When it came I mentioned all of its advantages to her.  I was crushed when her first comments were:&lt;br /&gt;1. Yes, its quieter than the TT3000 but that&#x27;s because on high fan the air volume was equal to the low fan speed of the TT3000.&lt;br /&gt;2. No, the neutral Ion setting didn&#x27;t give her any more body/volume than the TT3000 did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 2.5 ounces lighter than the TT3000 (according to our digital postage scale) and she&#x27;s OK with it&#x27;s performance so I&#x27;m not sending it back but I wished I&#x27;d just gotten another TT3000 and saved the $30.  Maybe a $180 unit with neutral Ion&#x27;s would give her more volume but I do know that if this one breaks I&#x27;m not buying another MK-II.  Sure wished someone would have posted a comment like this one so I didn&#x27;t waste my money.  Personally, I like the build quality of the TT3000 also.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer has performed very, very well. I hadn&#x27;t realized how much time the old dryer was taking to dry and style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Claire Greenberg</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer.  I have naturally curly hair and it often gets frizzy after I blow dry it but I can see a difference when I used this hair dryer.  Not perfect but definitely better.  Someone mentioned how quiet it is and I absolutely agree.  The first time I used it my husband commented on how quiet that hair dryer was.  Great blow dryer.  Try it you will like it!</li>
            <li> It is a good hairdryer and quieter than most. More than I would normally spend but if it lasts as expected, it will prove to be a good buy.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the best I have ever used. This is the second one I have purchased as after using the first, I decided to throw away the one at our second home and replace it with one of these..</li>
            <li> Another 5 star rating for this hair dryer!  I have really thick hair with some natural wave that usually takes a long time to dry.  This dryer gets it dry in about half the time of other dryers I&#x27;ve used, and dries it straighter.  I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron nearly as much to tame the poof.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> This is one hell of a blow dryer. It doesn&#x27;t blow hard, but boy does it blow hot. It&#x27;s practically able to strip paint. And the switches and overall build quality are quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short - THIS THING SERIOUSLY BLOWS. It will blow you HOT and HARD and leave you DRY.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in the half the time of any dryer I have used. My husband and kids thank you!</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews commenting on how quiet it is, but I was disappointed to see that it also meant it was lacking power to dry hair quickly. I don&#x27;t understand the negative ion feature but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. The hair dryer is ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it knowing what I know now.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer a year and a half ago as a Christmas present to myself. It was lightweight &amp; very quiet. Well today it completely stopped working. The buttons on the side light up, but the motor is done. I&#x27;m very disappointed. A dryer this expensive should last a few years. I also don&#x27;t use it daily. I would possibly understand if I had very long hair &amp; spend a half hour blowing it out each day but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I bought this drying thinking it would be stronger than the Babyliss I bought for myself a few months ago... Spending more money on a product is sometimes not the better product for my needs.  I have long curly hair that need a strong blowout.  My Babyliss dryer has been the best dryer yet.  I wanted to give this one to my husband but we are drying out hair with the Babyliss now.  I&#x27;ll buy another when this one dies.</li>
            <li> It seems that I&#x27;ve been buying 2 hair dryers a year for my wife. So far, this one seems well made and she loves how quite it is. Even though it produces a great deal of energy, it only has a faint hum when in use. Definitely her favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife -- so I&#x27;m not the end-user. But from my observation, this hair dryer was much quieter than her old one. It also did the job much faster. The only reason I can&#x27;t give it five stars was that the documentation was very sparse. There are a couple of features that would benefit greatly if it came with a manual to explain it. I ended up having to Google to find out what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very good product. My wife would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was finally ready to replace my 8-year old travel hairdryer  with something more powerful and quite, and yet just as light-weight. I have fine shoulder length hair with a tendency towards frizz.. I stumbled across the positive reviews for the Onei MKII while researching several other hairdryers (T3 featherweight, Elchim 2001 and BaBlyiss 2800). I chose the Onei based upon the great reviews, the 4-year warranty, and the price. I think this hairdryer is great. It is very quite, dries my hair in half the time, and feels like it will last. My hair feels great - not scorched like with my old dryer. If you are looking for a top-performing dryer, I would highly recommend trying this dryer first! The cool setting actually gets very cold, which is also  a great bonus for locking in curl and reducing frizz.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of settings. Has a great long lead to move around as you dry your hair. Can just about carry out a conversation as you use it.</li>
            <li> I made the blow dryer purchase based on previous reviews and reasonable price. My teenage daughter has processed hair (&amp;#34;magenta&amp;#34; at the moment!) and wanted a quality dryer that wouldn&#x27;t further damage her hair. She LOVES this dryer. She said it leaves her hair feeling smoother and softer after using it. The dryer is very light weight and comes with a long cord allowing for plenty of movement. I actually took it with her when she had her roots touched-up and the stylist (a friend for years who would tell me what she &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; thought) was impressed as well. We&#x27;ve only had it a week but so far, so good! Also, the distributor, who I hadn&#x27;t heard of before this transaction, is the only person/company that I ordered through this holiday that has sent me what seem to be personal &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34;, follow-up emails. I don&#x27;t generally shop on line much, but did this season, and have been impressed with this personal touch. I really think if anything went wrong within a reasonable time period that they would do what they could to make it right. That is the impression from their correspondence. The whole transaction was a good experience.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this hair dryer.  She says it drys her hair quick and is really light.  When I told her of all the good reviews I had read about it, she totally agreed with me!!</li>
            <li> Loving. Dries fast and quiet.  I have RA and have a hard time gripping and the weight is so light I can dry my hair more.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this Onei Mk-l Air Ionque Hair Dryer and it&#x27;s the best ever!  It arrived so fast to my door and I use it on my shampooed  hair and it dries fast and my hair is not dried out like my other hair dryer..  My hair actualy feels like silk..very smooth...  I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you..&lt;br /&gt;Linda&lt;br /&gt;RI</li>
            <li> I splurged for a really nice blow dryer.  It was pretty quiet and did the job every other day - pretty normal usage.  But, this morning while using it, it just stopped.  I tried to unplug it from the surge protector and it had fused itself to it.  Not what I expected from an $80 hair dryer. I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t plugged into the wall.  Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Light weight and dries hair fast!  Super-quiet as advertised.  Highly recommend! This is a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! It&#x27;s super quiet and doesn&#x27;t get too hot on the Medium setting as with many other hair dryers. I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> My days of buying $20 or less hair dryers from the big box stores are OVER.  I have long thick hair that takes forever to dry.  I have taken to wearing a pony tail far too often because it is such a pain to dry my hair.  I am very sensitive to loud noises and really hate high pitched wails.  Hairdryers always made me cringe and using low speed is not an option for my hair.  I got this home and immediately plugged it in to find it has a lower pitched noise that is absolute music to my ears.  It will not drive me nuts and I will no longer feel like I am waking anyone up in the house using it.  It also cranks out the air and has excellent settings to power through my drying.  Thanks amazon for changing my life through exposure to products that actually work!</li>
            <li> This is very, very quiet. It has the longest cord. I have ever seen on a dryer. I don&#x27;t understand the ion thing.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing and I do to. The cheap one she had before was soooooo loud in the mornings would wake me up. This one is quiet and efficient (fast). Was a great gift.</li>
            <li> The exterior of this hair dryer melted and I can no longer use any of the attachments. Poor quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer because it works well and is very quiet compared to the ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past. I have had it a couple of months now and I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a new hair dryer, my 8 year old Conair dried my hair just fine, or so I thought.  Even though I use the same products as my hair stylist, my hair always looked better after I left the salon than anything I could do my self.  My hair stylist mentioned getting a new Ionic hair dryer but that was months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then when visiting friends I used an Ionic hairdryer she had and my hair looked great during our trip.  After coming home and doing lots of research and review reading I decided to purchase the Onei Hair Dryer.  It had by far the largest percent of positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I really didn&#x27;t realize that a dryer could make that much difference but it has.  No more frizzes, just SOFT shining hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several readers have mentioned about the controls being in an awkward place and I have come to the conclusion that this dryer is designed for the hands of a profession stylists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you are doing someone else&#x27;s hair, then the controls are in the perfect place&lt;br /&gt;2. That would explain the very long cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it just takes a day or two to get used to where the controls.  Do not hesitate to purchase this dryer.  Great investment.  So glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> We are very picky about hair dryers and this is the best hair dryer we have ever had. It has a long cord and lots of settings that actually differ which makes it easy to dry hair for kids as well as adults. I have recommended this hair dryer to friends.</li>
            <li> It works very well! I appreciate that it not heavy. It has lots of heat settings and comes with attachments. I just don&#x27;t know what the negative vs. positive ion charge is for? What is the difference?</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered the Onei I accidentally had it shipped to my mom! Her address is saved in my account from presents I have bought her through amazon in the past. She liked it so much that she decided to keep it for herself and made me order another one! I must admit my expectations were fairly high, as I decided to buy the dryer initially from outstanding reviews. I have thick curly hair that I blow our daily, and I have had A LOT of blow dryers over the years. I was definitely not disappointed! This blow dryer is very light weight, very quiet, and blow drys my hair quickly. It also has a good range of settings. I would definitely recommend it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer. It is lightweight,  quieter than most dryers and dries quickly. I like the fact that it has a longer cord than most. It is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great optionsl  Feels good.</li>
            <li> I received the MK-II hair dryer fairly quickly. I am extremely happy with my experience so far and have the reviewers to thank. It is light, sleek, and functions great. I have noticed that my hair is a lot healthier and shinier and would highlt recommend this hair dryer. It is so much more quieter than your usual hair dryer and the options foe dryinf sixh as negative ion or neutral switch ha e both worked wonders on my dry, damaged hair. So far, I am enjoying this hair dryer especially the quick dry time. Plus it comes with a 4-year warranty which is awesome! For those of you debating on what hair dryer to purchase, look no further, buy the Onei MK-II Ionique hair dryer. You will not regret this investment for healthy, shiny, smooth looking hair.</li>
            <li> Wow - this is the best blow dryer I have ever used (or had used on me at a salon).  I have long, full hair that is wavy/frizzy.  This blow dryer is VERY lightweight, amke my hair dry VERY quickly and makes my hair soft and smooth.  WOW!  The lightweight of the dryer makes blow outs of my long hair SO much easier - less stress and sweating before I go out :).  I never noiticed how heavy my old blow dryer was until I got this one.</li>
            <li> Not the best dryer for fine hair.  Will return it.</li>
            <li> As my first dryer, I find it very nice and efficient. It takes about 40 mins to thoroughly dry my hair (which holds ALOT of water) with rollers in. I also think that it leaves my hair soft :)</li>
            <li> As described. On sale.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because it does not have a retractable cord.  Otherwise the product works as expected and does have an extra long cord.</li>
            <li> I hate blow-drying my hair because it makes my arms tired, but this one is so light it doesn&#x27;t get tired at all!  It&#x27;s also quiet and so my family members don&#x27;t get annoyed by the noise.</li>
            <li> It works well, it&#x27;s really quiet, but I expected it to blow harder. I had used my sister in law&#x27;s Paul Mitchel hair dryer(VERY nice hair dryer) which you can find on here for about the same price as this one. Well I had bought the Onei straightener and was in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blow dryer works nice over all, but set aside the how quiet it is, it&#x27;s no different then my old $40 Revlon from Walmart. I definitely wish I had went ahead and just got the Paul Mitchel dryer.</li>
            <li> The cold button stuck on the 2nd use.  Now have to have it replaced.  Just annoying to have to deal with this.</li>
            <li> I would defiantly recommend this hair dryer!! It&#x27;s lightweight, quiet and drys my hair fast without leaving it frizzy! I was hesitant to buy because it was a little on the expensive side but I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. Drys my hair quickly with less frizzy/dried out hair. Would definiitely recommend this hair dryer to all</li>
            <li> It is light weight and powerfull. Love the different settings, easy to use. Like the switch for ion or non ion settings. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is a sleek modern piece that lives up to its on-line product description and specifications. I paid more for it than one from the drugstore. But because I use it almost every day and enjoy its performance and its looks, it is worth a few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> Worst hair dryer ever! It dried out my hair, and left it in a mass of tangles. I threw out the box and packaging, so I ended up throwing it away. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it away.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer and it is very quiet compared to others I&#x27;ve had. I am very happy with this purchase. I keep it on neutral ions for the most part. I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference between the 2 ion settings, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting to anyway. It seems like a gimmick. I was more concerned with having multiple speeds and heat settings which this has.</li>
            <li> After 8 months, the cold button froze in position and no longer works. Don&#x27;t buy this device.</li>
            <li> Love my hair with this new dryer!!!</li>
            <li> Hair dryer died and would only sputter a little air.  Died within 6 months :( Now only the heating coils work and no air movement.  A fire just waiting to happen.  Don&#x27;t buy.  ******UPDATE********  I contacted D.R.G. Trading about my broken hair dryer.  They wrote me back instantly.  Not only did they send me a free replacement but also a little gift to say sorry.  I really appreciate it D.R.G. Trading.  This four star is for the blow dryer but D.R.G. Trading deserves a 5 star.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it...great quality and really quiet! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a quality hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Amazing blow dryer. I will never buy another brand but this one. My hair looks &amp; feels amazing, plus love how quite it is. The best.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to get used to it and I have not figured out the neutral and negative ion setting.  I kinda figured there would be a little more information regarding the settings in the manual, but it&#x27;s a pretty basic phamplet.  Other than that it is a great blow dryer and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> From Amazon&#x27;s description:  &amp;#34;Guaranteed authentic. Never counterfeit. 4-year warranty.&amp;#34;  When I went to fill out the warranty card it states One (1) year warranty only.  What happened to the other 3 years?  My wife likes it and would rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I have ever owned.Love the cool setting.It makes my fine straight hair shiny and silky but still gives it volumn.I dry it part way on the medium setting and finish with the cool.It takes a little longer to dry but my hair looks amazing.Four stars only because for me the extra long cord is way longer than I need.I can see where it would be useful to a lot of people though.Nice weight for anyone that has issues with arthritis or tendonitis like I do.Throw out your drug store hair dryers and make the investment.You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through three hair dryers in the past year. One of them broke after a short fall from my hand to the bathroom counter (seriously??), the second one always got too hot and stunk up my bathroom, even on the lowest hear setting (grrrr...) And then there was the Onei.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Onei is just perfect! I really like that is has an ion activation switch in the handle. When you turn on the dryer, you can hear it speed and warm up - there isn&#x27;t that sudden blast of metal smelling heat like the cheaper dryers I&#x27;ve owned. I definitely recommend the Onei to anyone who wants a quality dryer.</li>
            <li> I want to thank you for a quick delivery, I love this hair dryer, its quiet, it dries my hair fast, I have very little frizz, I purchased the flat iron by the same brand name and love it just as well. Your company is great to deal with. I have loved doing business with you&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;Robin</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about ordering this since no one who had reviewed it yet mentioned how it performed on curly hair, other than to say it straightens great. It took me a couple of times of using it to figure out which temperature setting and speed would work best for me but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up and ship it back after my first use (as I was tempted to do) because now I don&#x27;t dread the task of drying my hair. It is indeed speedy, and light, and quiet.  I&#x27;m loving it!  Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> By far the best hair dryer I have owned. I have very frizzy curly hair and this dryer definitely does its job. I can tell a huge difference after using it the first time.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that can be coaxed into curls or dried straight. This hairdryer works for both, and dries quickly whether for curly or for straight hair. The diffuser is wonderful. I can put my hair into it and my hair stays without blowing out of it. I get nice, voluminous curly hair. There is a wide range of  blower strength and heat available for this hairdryer, and for blowdrying straight, I need to use one notch below the maximum for both. Otherwise, my hair blows everywhere. Despite the blower strength, the hair dryer is pretty quiet and fairly light. The cord is nice and long. One last thing--I already knocked this hair dryer off my counter top, and it survived, seemingly without any problems.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft with this dryer and it doesnt frizz out.  Also, it isnt as loud as my previous cheaper dryer.</li>
            <li> does just what the product review says&lt;br /&gt;its a very good product, hope it works for a very long time.....</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer -- I purchased it based on the customer reviews -- it was everything everyone said it was.  I would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone looking to purchase one.</li>
            <li> I really love this hair dryer. My old dryer died and I needed to get a new one quickly. I wanted one that was quiet and dry well. I have an Onei flat iron that I&#x27;m very happy with so I was happy to buy the hair dryer. I love the low volume of the hair dryer, love the ionic switch, and it really does dry well. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife as her Conair of 15 years finally quit. Meets all expectations only concern is the warranty even thought there is a clarification on amazon site of 4 years no questions asked warranty. paper work with dryer only stated 1 year. I expect the full 4 years.</li>
            <li> A powerful hair dryer that is not heavy and is quiet! Gets my hair nice and smooth if I blow dry it straight. Also love that it came with a diffuser for when I want to dry my hair curly.</li>
            <li> I love the weight of this dryer, just the right amount of heat, great cool setting, but after a couple of months the writing around the buttons came off (not a huge deal), then the silver paint on the handle came off, and now it seems the hair dryer is disintegrating. The handle is wobbly and seems like it is about to detach from the rest of the dryer making me afraid to continue using it. This is after moderate use of about 3 times/week over the last year plus a few months. So disappointing because I really loved this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! It&#x27;s quiet.  My hair dries quickly and with more volume than my previous dryer. I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product.</li>
            <li> It was better than my ancient hair dryer from the 80s/90s but I still had frizz and not that impressed. The only good thing about it was that it does cut down on drying times.</li>
            <li> NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT!!!</li>
            <li> so I would give it t a 5 star as I love this hairdryer but.. it just broke :((  I  never thought a particular type of hair dryer could made a difference but I invested in this anyway. I love love love it. I used to get blow outs but I havent recently because this dryer makes a huge difference in my hair texture. I have now convinced my 2 friends and my sister to purchase one too.  the only reason I did not give it a 5 is that I purchased 4 months ago and it is already broken.. the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button is depressed permanently so it only dries using cold air. Im hopeful that this is a just an anomaly  and that the company will send me a new one.... but we will see. PS... I never use the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34;, I just depressed the button by mistake when I picked up the dryer and now it wont un-press :((</li>
            <li> This dryer arrived quickly and was packaged well.  I replaced my old dryer that was similar to this one but this one is lighter and easier to style your hair with.  Itdries your hair quickly too.  I don&#x27;t need it on the highest setting for too long.  It came with a concentrator and a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Onei MK-II Air Ionique Hair Dryer for my wife just over a week ago and she is thrilled with it.  She loves the variable temperature feature.  The first time she used the dryer she said &amp;#34;My hair looks GREAT!&amp;#34;  I would certainly recommend this dryer.  The price is excellent for a professional-quality dryer and it&#x27;s strongly constructed.  Also, the shipping service was amazing.  I ordered standard shipping, thinking the dryer would arrive in five or ten days, but it arrived in just two days.</li>
            <li> I have had this blowdryer for about a year and it already died.  Ironically, it is the most expensive blow dryer I have ever bought and shortest life as well.  Disappointing...</li>
            <li> When my good hair dryer finally stopped working, I decided to purchase the Onei MK-II Air Ionic Hair Dryer, impressed with all the positive reviews. I have thick, coarse hair and usually find it a chore to dry my hair even though I had been using an expensive professional dryer. The Onei is an excellent dryer. It is quiet, light, easy to handle, provides perfect heat and blower settings and dries my hair in half the time without leaving it frizzy. Excellent value all around.You won&#x27;t regret this purchase and the company provides excellent customer service.</li>
