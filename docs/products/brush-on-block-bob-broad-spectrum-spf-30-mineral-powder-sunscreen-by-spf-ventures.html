            <li>Loved it and worked great on a summer boat trip!  </li>
            <li>Great to wear for driving and shopping outdoors.</li>

            <li>Great idea.  </li>

            <li>It is also great for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Women would look great, but it might not be so great for men.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect size for throwing in your purse to make sure you don&#x27;t get sunburned as you run errands or have a spontaneous lunch at the park.</li>
            <li>This product seemed like a good idea for me</li>

            <li>Actually nice to brush it on as opposed to putting cream on.</li>

            <li>Saw this product on MSN as one of the top 10 beauty products this summer.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to brush on sunblock over my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this sunscreen is a powder.</li>
            <li>They make me feel like my face is melting off, especially on hot days.</li>
            <li>For some reason it seemed to work okay on my hands but the rest of my neck got burned.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this</li>
            <li>The size and shape of the tube is easily portable and compact.</li>
            <li>EAsy to keep reapplying during the day without getting all greasy.  </li>
            <li>did go on really easily</li>
            <li>The product works and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for times when you don&#x27;t want to put on traditional sunscreen</li>
            <li>This is such a great idea....</li>
            <li>Very convenient and handy to carry around in your purse or beach bag.</li>
            <li>This powder brush sunscreen is GREAT cause it is the opposite.  </li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and easy to carry in purse or pocket, unisex, good for kids&#x27; faces with a fast swish.  </li>
            <li>It is so quick and easy to use, that I keep it in my car and use it anytime</li>
            <li>I was so excited about the convenience of this item for someone like me.&lt;br /&gt;OH</li>
            <li>Plus it is a physical barrier sunscreen rather than a chemical barrier type which experts are saying is more effective.  </li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this on myself and my two children we we need quick application of suncreen.</li>
            <li>Regular sunscreen goes farther and covers more, and more quickly.  </li>
            <li>Any questions I had were answered so quickly by email.  </li>
            <li>, I also wrote to the company and the responded pretty quickly with directions on how to apply it.</li>
            <li>I tried using it another time this time putting lotion on right before applying the powder.</li>
            <li>(although I think I was doing it right)</li>
            <li>The only suggestion i would have is that it would dispense more evening onto the brush if there were an opening through the powder compartment therefore not &amp;#34;wasting&amp;#34; powder as it is applied from the compartment to the brush then to the skin.</li>
            <li>I want to keep one at home and keep the first one in my purse.</li>
            <li>I was pleased for it is like a mineral powder and stays on, which makes protection simple.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Heather Ayala.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li>very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lightweight translucent powder that anyone of any complexion can use (I&#x27;m African American with a medium brown skin tone.</li>
            <li>I use the brush on sunblock for my running and so far it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>instructions were available on how to use the product other than opening it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the sunscreen for the past week while visiting a southern state and enjoyed how easy it is to open, apply, and use on my face.</li>
            <li>It offers good protection but the cap is too small to fit back on over the bristles once you&#x27;ve taken it off, without ruining half the bristles.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying Brush On Block, and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>it is soft and applies sunscreen continuously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has worked well do far.</li>
            <li>Brush On Block is completely invisible on my skin.)</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t really seem like it would last that long (at least not for my own purposes).</li>
            <li>I have been thrilled to find this less expensive brand that works fabulously and has a refill cartridge.  </li>
            <li>I do wish they had a slightly ligher tint available as well as the regular, though.</li>
            <li>It takes a few minutes to sink in (on its own), then it looks slightly like makeup</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far but no sunburn.</li>
            <li>(I had bare minerals mineral veil on my face).</li>
            <li>The plastic slip (that goes up and down) and protects the brush never works very well.</li>

            <li> The plastic slip (that goes up and down) and protects the brush never works very well.</li>
            <li> Maybe this was old dried up stock.&lt;br /&gt;Dan</li>
            <li> Not worth the money - next time</li>
            <li> Small tube fits in pocket or waist pack - no mess.</li>
            <li> my&lt;br /&gt;skin felt rough.  </li>
            <li> It took a few people to finally get it to work!  </li>
            <li> I thought I spent alot of time applying it.</li>
            <li> I received this in just a few days and the seller enclosed a lovely note asking that I respond if unhappy with the product or ordering experience and if not completely satisfied to return the product.  </li>
            <li> I really like the idea of this product, but it&#x27;s difficult to shake down the powder into the brush, and then hard to know if there&#x27;s enough in there!</li>
            <li> I also used it to keep my part from getting sunburned, and I didn&#x27;t notice any unflattering powder in my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> wish it cost less for the amount you get.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I went through half of it using it</li>
            <li> and if it gets jostled a little and knocked over, half the product spills out with it.</li>
            <li> This is not a mineral make-up and has little to no &amp;#34;color&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid to try it again as I really don&#x27;t want to burn by accident.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy and yucky and burns my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I had to unscrew the bottom and try to poke holes with a pin into the opening where the powder is supposed to enter the brush in order to get any product to flow, but still very little powder flow compared to my previous purchase of the identical product.</li>
            <li> Even with applying the product every few hours, my toddler got a pretty bad sun burn that resulted in a blister.</li>
            <li> am not sure if I could recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, so I hate lotions and sprays.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m never sure if the product is coming out!</li>
            <li> I will buy a less expensive mineral powder with sunblock protection.</li>
            <li> I used this last summer on my grandchildren since lotion is almost impossible to keep on them when they are in and out of the pool.  </li>
            <li> Poor dispenser and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Try it with caution and if it works correct me if I am wrong.</li>
            <li> Also unhappy that I was sent a product in which the expiration date had passed.</li>
            <li> I started using a very expensive name brand powder sunscreen about 5 years ago when my daughter was born.  </li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to get the powder to flow through to the brush.  </li>
            <li> The one I received however was almost impossible to get the powder thru the brush.</li>
            <li> I want this to work soooo bad.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t work on me :-(</li>
            <li> I HATE sunscreen</li>
    </ol>

            <li> First time I have tried this kind of product and very happy with the ease of application and the compact size.  I received this in just a few days and the seller enclosed a lovely note asking that I respond if unhappy with the product or ordering experience and if not completely satisfied to return the product.  I have no doubt that she would have made any effort to make sure that I was pleased with this transaction - and I am!!  Thanks to Heather Ayala.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a way to reapply sunscreen throughout the day without messing up my makeup and came across this product. It worked great! It didn&#x27;t stick to my makeup (or wrinkles) in an unflattering way and kept me from getting roasted on an all day zoo trip. I also used it to keep my part from getting sunburned, and I didn&#x27;t notice any unflattering powder in my dark brown hair. It is a perfect size for throwing in your purse to make sure you don&#x27;t get sunburned as you run errands or have a spontaneous lunch at the park. I would also use it on my kids if I needed to.</li>
            <li> I  am a woman and was looking for something to use on my thinning hair (scalp).  This wasn&#x27;t it.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I started using a very expensive name brand powder sunscreen about 5 years ago when my daughter was born.  I have been thrilled to find this less expensive brand that works fabulously and has a refill cartridge.  The brush quality is also very good - it is soft and applies sunscreen continuously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is a staple in my family.  I keep one in my purse, in the car and in our swim/beach bag.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of this product, but it&#x27;s difficult to shake down the powder into the brush, and then hard to know if there&#x27;s enough in there!</li>
            <li> The plastic slip (that goes up and down) and protects the brush never works very well. The one I just purchased is already cracked. Also, I&#x27;m never sure if the product is coming out! I love the ease of use and believe it is a great product. I will keep purchasing, but it has some faults.</li>
            <li> Nice product if you don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in the sun.  Great to wear for driving and shopping outdoors.</li>
            <li> This product seemed like a good idea for me so it was ordered. Problems:&lt;br /&gt;product had an expired expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;no instructions were available on how to use the product other than opening it.</li>
            <li> This brush on powder sun block is great! I wouldn&#x27;t use it as my only sunblock, but when you brush it on your face after the lotion type sunblock, you don&#x27;t look sweaty and greasy. The size and shape of the tube is easily portable and compact.</li>
            <li> Even with applying the product every few hours, my toddler got a pretty bad sun burn that resulted in a blister.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and I have not tried it yet, but am looking forward to using it during my vacation.  Seems like a great idea for adding sunscreen after make up when touch up is needed.</li>
            <li> I use the brush on sunblock for my running and so far it has worked very well.  I have only used it once so far but no sunburn.</li>
            <li> I have used this on myself and my two children we we need quick application of suncreen. It has worked well do far. No burns. Haven&#x27;t tried it in the heat of summer yet, it is just upon us.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably easy to use, good sunblock!  Convenient for reapplying and keeping skin safe.  Easy to carry in a purse, tote or pack for a trip!</li>
            <li> The only suggestion i would have is that it would dispense more evening onto the brush if there were an opening through the powder compartment therefore not &amp;#34;wasting&amp;#34; powder as it is applied from the compartment to the brush then to the skin.</li>
            <li> This is not a mineral make-up and has little to no &amp;#34;color&amp;#34;.  It is very lightweight and easy to carry in purse or pocket, unisex, good for kids&#x27; faces with a fast swish.  Not enough product to cover arms and legs, etc.  Good for the face, ears, neck as a quick fix-up when traveling.  Regular sunscreen goes farther and covers more, and more quickly.  This is a bit pricey....wish it cost less for the amount you get.  Can be carried-on airlines as it is not liquid.</li>
            <li> Poor dispenser and ineffective. Not worth the money p, get a spray on sunscreen instead which will be more effective.</li>
            <li> It offers good protection but the cap is too small to fit back on over the bristles once you&#x27;ve taken it off, without ruining half the bristles. So I have to leave it uncovered and if it gets jostled a little and knocked over, half the product spills out with it. Not worth the money - next time I will buy a less expensive mineral powder with sunblock protection.</li>
            <li> Saw this product on MSN as one of the top 10 beauty products this summer.  Loved it and worked great on a summer boat trip!  EAsy to keep reapplying during the day without getting all greasy.  Made it easier for kids to even want to put on sunblock.  Any questions I had were answered so quickly by email.  Great response and great product.</li>
            <li> Great idea.  I love being able to brush on sunblock over my makeup.  I use it throughout the day-I work outside.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have oily skin, and this powder protects and absorbs. It blends in well, and doesn&#x27;t look chalky.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this sunscreen is a powder. I have very oily skin, so I hate lotions and sprays. They make me feel like my face is melting off, especially on hot days. This is my first time buying Brush On Block, and I will definitely buy it again. I want to keep one at home and keep the first one in my purse. It&#x27;s a nice lightweight translucent powder that anyone of any complexion can use (I&#x27;m African American with a medium brown skin tone. Brush On Block is completely invisible on my skin.) The brush is nice and soft. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. This will be my sunscreen from now on.</li>
            <li> I like it It&#x27;s great for times when you don&#x27;t want to put on traditional sunscreen Also it doesn&#x27;t make me break out even though it has a tint to it. One reviewer said that they didn&#x27;t like it because they couldn&#x27;t put the cover back on once the brush was opened but the brush does retract back in so that you can put the cover back on</li>
            <li> I think i am having an allergic reaction to this....it took me a while to figure out why I was itchy and my&lt;br /&gt;skin felt rough.  This is such a great idea....just didn&#x27;t work on me :-(</li>
            <li> I used this last summer on my grandchildren since lotion is almost impossible to keep on them when they are in and out of the pool.  I was pleased for it is like a mineral powder and stays on, which makes protection simple.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and handy to carry around in your purse or beach bag.</li>
            <li> I HATE sunscreen cause it&#x27;s messy and yucky and burns my eyes.  This powder brush sunscreen is GREAT cause it is the opposite.  Plus it is a physical barrier sunscreen rather than a chemical barrier type which experts are saying is more effective.  Works great for me.  Small tube fits in pocket or waist pack - no mess.</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to get the powder to flow through to the brush.  It took a few people to finally get it to work!  It seems like a lot of work for a product that should be so simple to use.</li>
            <li> I want this to work soooo bad. I have skin sensitivities and sunscreens all seem to make my skin sting and burn. This did NOT irritate my skin - so that was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my hands, as well as my neck, chest and arms. (I had bare minerals mineral veil on my face). For some reason it seemed to work okay on my hands but the rest of my neck got burned. I really don&#x27;t know why. I tried using it another time this time putting lotion on right before applying the powder. I burned again. To be fair I burn really really easily. I thought I spent alot of time applying it. It also didn&#x27;t really seem like it would last that long (at least not for my own purposes). I feel like I went through half of it using it twice.&lt;br /&gt;It did go on really easily, it was not visible (and i am very fair), it felt fine - not sticky or anything, very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I could recommend it. I am afraid to try it again as I really don&#x27;t want to burn by accident. Try it with caution and if it works correct me if I am wrong. I was so excited about the convenience of this item for someone like me.&lt;br /&gt;OH, I also wrote to the company and the responded pretty quickly with directions on how to apply it. (although I think I was doing it right)</li>
            <li> The product would not dispense through the brush at all.  I had to unscrew the bottom and try to poke holes with a pin into the opening where the powder is supposed to enter the brush in order to get any product to flow, but still very little powder flow compared to my previous purchase of the identical product. Maybe this was old dried up stock.&lt;br /&gt;Dan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the sunscreen for the past week while visiting a southern state and enjoyed how easy it is to open, apply, and use on my face. I do wish they had a slightly ligher tint available as well as the regular, though.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this and I know there are several brands that provide such a product. The one I received however was almost impossible to get the powder thru the brush. Bought it for golfing but to use it had to open it entirely pour it into my hand then use the brush. Also unhappy that I was sent a product in which the expiration date had passed.</li>
            <li> Brush on Block is great!  I started using it on the golf course because it didn&#x27;t make my hands greasy.  It is also great for thinning hair.  It is so quick and easy to use, that I keep it in my car and use it anytime I&#x27;m going to be in the sun.  As a father, I like it because it isn&#x27;t a battle to get sunscreen on my kids faces anymore; in fact they keep it in their lunchbox to use at recess.</li>
            <li> Women would look great, but it might not be so great for men. It takes a few minutes to sink in (on its own), then it looks slightly like makeup</li>
            <li> The product works and is easy to apply. Actually nice to brush it on as opposed to putting cream on. I like it  !!!</li>
