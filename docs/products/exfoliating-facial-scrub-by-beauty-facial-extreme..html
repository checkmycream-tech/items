            <li>It&#x27;s very rare to find something that my daughter and i both can share when it comes to facial products.</li>
            <li>Another good product by Beauty facial extreme.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely rub gently though, because its powerful on its own and won&#x27;t need lot of pressure to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how a small amount goes a long way, and it is gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>It also feels so soft after the first use.</li>
            <li>A dermatologist recently told me that if I used an exfoliant it would help tremendously.</li>
            <li>For anyone struggling with acne or skin problems, I would highly encourage you to try this out.</li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing and different from other scrubs that I have used.</li>
            <li>I normally use it 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>It cleans my pores very well which in turn makes them appear smaller, and I&#x27;ve always struggled with large pores.</li>
            <li>My face feels brand new after every time I use it.</li>
            <li>This is my new jam.</li>
            <li>This scrub makes your skin feel like new.</li>
            <li>She wanted to get a new skin tone.</li>
            <li>A new face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lifesaver and left the skin on my face and back problem free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lifesaver and left the skin on my face and back problem free.</li>
            <li>My hands and legs are very soft.</li>
            <li>and I found better improvement compared to past.</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>Just one jar has gone so far I highly recommend to anyone wanting to clear up troublesome acne, it&#x27;s been a lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li>It is really good on my skin it lighten and dark spot faded in just few uses..</li>
            <li>I use a gentle facial wash first to open my pores, then the scrub, and rinse.</li>
            <li>I made the decision to get this clean because I’ve always had discolorations on my experience (dark splotches)</li>
            <li>I applied this scrub for nearly two weeks</li>
            <li>I like how soft and clear my skin looked after using it for a week.  </li>
            <li>I had a lot of spots on my face when i was young</li>
            <li>but my skin felt as soft as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s such a gentle exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>and you can smell the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was worried it would make me break out</li>
            <li>but I really like the deep cleansing it provides for my skin.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>High quality product, I definitely recommend trying</li>
            <li>After several it&#x27;s like one have new skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely ordering a new batch.</li>
            <li>A small amount goes a long way, and the skin feels clean and ready for moisturizing or make-up.</li>
            <li>Have used it as directed for 4 or 5 weeks, but I am not sure if it&#x27;s really effective as they claim for reducing scars or dark spots.</li>
            <li>I only used it on my face for my acne, and saw some clear improvement in about three weeks.</li>
            <li>This scrub worked so well for me that I doubt I&#x27;ll ever switch back to my old scrub.</li>
            <li>This product really help fade the dark spots on my face .</li>
            <li>and I haven’t had much fortune with items in previous times to create them vanish.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> The fact that I can use this on my face AND body is perfect because I get occasional breakouts on my shoulders too.  This is great for making your skin feel fresh, clean, and for getting rid of those blemishes.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have decided to stick with using this scrub by Beauty Facial Extreme because it delivers the perfect amount of moisture to my skin while also cleaning it. I decided to try this one because it&#x27;s for both the face and body. Usually products are only for one or the other. I&#x27;ve had dry and flaky skin during these winter months. It was rather embarrassing walking around with flaky skin on my face. It would also look way worse if I tried to cover it up with makeup. No product has taken care of it until I&#x27;ve tried this scrub. The scrub action in it is very powerful. It&#x27;s a lifesaver and left the skin on my face and back problem free. I absolutely love it! It works so well on my skin. It&#x27;s very rare to find something that my daughter and I both can share when it comes to facial products.&lt;br /&gt; It would also look way worse if I tried to cover it up with makeup. No product has taken care of it until I&#x27;ve tried this scrub. The scrub action in it is very powerful. It&#x27;s a lifesaver and left the skin on my face and back problem free.</li>

            <li> This product is truly amazing and different from other scrubs that I have used. I wear a lot of make up so scrubbing my face and getting all of the make up off is a must for me. Unfortunately, all other scrubs eventually dry my skin out and I can&#x27;t use them anymore. This product is so gentle yet so so effective. My face feels brand new after every time I use it. It&#x27;s soft, make up free, and refreshed. It cleans my pores very well which in turn makes them appear smaller, and I&#x27;ve always struggled with large pores. A little of this product goes a long way. Give it a try and treat yourself.</li>
