            <li>Love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li>Great under cover!</li>
            <li>This is the best concealer and cover to blend with skin i have ever found!!  </li>
            <li>This is the best yet.</li>
            <li>but like I said, I&#x27;ve tried a lot and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Great deal and delivery</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>However why YBF is still a good product</li>
            <li>Works the best and wears very well.</li>
            <li>I have nice skin anyway</li>
            <li>I LOVE this concealer.</li>
            <li>prompt service, love this product</li>
            <li>excellent coverage that last all day...easy to wash off...does not clog pores..</li>
            <li>OK product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many concealers over the years.</li>
            <li>anything more...</li>
            <li>but, this is pretty good with covering areas of the face that may be blotchy.</li>
            <li>It is so easy- just as they demonstrate.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth and not greasy. .</li>
            <li>It is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to find  quality cruelty free products and it&#x27;s works great.</li>
            <li>It is easy, It hides a multitude of sins, the hardest part is , getting used to not using too much.</li>
            <li>Covers all my red spots, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin &amp; is the perfect concealer shade.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money, but aside from that</li>
            <li>the product&#x27;s performance works like that of a much higher designer line.  </li>
            <li>I just received this and used it this morning for the first time.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should have bought a different shade, but too, any shade of this product is going to give you better looking skin.</li>
            <li>Really should up date photo and product description.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying this product.</li>
            <li>Takes more to cover than some other products.</li>
            <li>I have dark circles, and have tried many concealers.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this makeup.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone, Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>The lady loves it and says she can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have medium skin tone and use it primarily to cover dark under eye&lt;</li>
            <li>I also really like the tri-color cream which comes in a slightly larger sized compact.  </li>
            <li>, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m strawberry blonde with fair like skin, and this makes my skin vibrant, if not perfect.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on in certain areas (nose) as long as I&#x27;d like,</li>
            <li>so kind of expensive for what you get</li>
            <li>I have several red spots on my face and this completely covers them.  </li>
            <li>it covers dark circles and such really well..</li>

            <li> I guess you pay the same price for less nowadays.</li>
            <li> but the pkg it came is is really small... thought it was bigger.</li>
            <li> This creme does what its name says - it neutralizes redness and other discoloration.</li>
            <li> It works wonders under your eyes to brighten and cover dark.</li>
            <li> If you have dark circles, keep looking.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product for dark circles.</li>
            <li> It blends well with other make up and hides all the little flaws of redness and blotches on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Like the previous reviewer mentioned, I also used to get this from HSN but they no longer sell it.</li>
            <li> Only issue I had was failing to read the dimensions as this is a very small little compact.</li>
            <li> The compact is small, but not much is needed.</li>
            <li> Hides dark circles well and brightens up my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Just a little product goes along way.</li>
            <li> I usually get this product from HSN and I have used it in the past.</li>

            <li> Great deal and delivery</li>
            <li> I LOVE this concealer. it covers dark circles and such really well.. Makes you look rested. goes on smooth and not greasy. . but the pkg it came is is really small... thought it was bigger. so kind of expensive for what you get.. will watch for it onsale on HSN.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find  quality cruelty free products and it&#x27;s works great. It is so easy- just as they demonstrate. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> I usually get this product from HSN and I have used it in the past. It works wonders under your eyes to brighten and cover dark.</li>
            <li> This creme does what its name says - it neutralizes redness and other discoloration. And the texture is almost undetectable on your skin.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for yrs. nothing else compares to it.  I have medium skin tone and use it primarily to cover dark under eye&lt;br /&gt;circles.  Works the best and wears very well.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s yellow like I wanted and that is about it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best beauty lines I have ever used  It is well worth the money, but aside from that the product&#x27;s performance works like that of a much higher designer line.  I also really like the tri-color cream which comes in a slightly larger sized compact.  There is a  skin tone, highlighter and a contouring cream that between these four colors you can create any look you like for a fraction of the cost of a department store designer line . . . three words . . . go for it.</li>
            <li> I have several red spots on my face and this completely covers them.  I also use it on my eyelids.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering from HSN &amp; the one I ordered from you is smaller. I do like the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great under cover! Hides dark circles well and brightens up my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> The product I recieved was not the same as presented in the photo. Photo shows a compact with mirror. What I recieved was a simple jar of cosmetics. Really should up date photo and product description.</li>
            <li> prompt service, love this product</li>
            <li> this product is a staple for me..excellent coverage that last all day...easy to wash off...does not clog pores..</li>
            <li> The lady loves it and says she can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this product. I have dark circles, and have tried many concealers. This product does nothing. If you have dark circles, keep looking.</li>
            <li> I just received this and used it this morning for the first time. I like the product but the container and the amount is so tiny, I was surprised. I guess you pay the same price for less nowadays. However why YBF is still a good product</li>
            <li> I have nice skin anyway but, this is pretty good with covering areas of the face that may be blotchy. Maybe I should have bought a different shade, but too, any shade of this product is going to give you better looking skin. I&#x27;m strawberry blonde with fair like skin, and this makes my skin vibrant, if not perfect.</li>
            <li> OK product. Takes more to cover than some other products.</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer and cover to blend with skin i have ever found!!  It blends well with other make up and hides all the little flaws of redness and blotches on the skin.  It is fabulous.  I will highly recommend this makeup.</li>
            <li> Like the previous reviewer mentioned, I also used to get this from HSN but they no longer sell it. Covers all my red spots, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin &amp; is the perfect concealer shade. Only issue I had was failing to read the dimensions as this is a very small little compact. Guess I was expecting a larger amount for the price but it is still fab &amp; I&#x27;ll keep purchasing!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product for dark circles. Just a little product goes along way. It&#x27;s my must have product. The compact is small, but not much is needed. It should last a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many concealers over the years. This is the best yet. It does cover well. It doesn&#x27;t stay on in certain areas (nose) as long as I&#x27;d like, but like I said, I&#x27;ve tried a lot and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I was always a lip gloss, mascara, and basic shadow girl...maybe blush...anything more...I&#x27;m lost!  Doing all this &amp;#34;painting on the yellow &amp;#34;,I thought, would be the biggest horror of my life. NOT so. It is easy, It hides a multitude of sins, the hardest part is , getting used to not using too much. I would recommend it to anyone, Highly recommend it</li>
