            <li>it&#x27;s side just to fit it in my soap dish.</li>
            <li>It just gets you clean and makes you feel clean.</li>

            <li>It is mild.  </li>
            <li>I need a mild soap.  </li>
            <li>The soap is mild, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just as worthy and has earned a spot in my rotation.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced, non-irritating, and lightly scented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as popular as other more advertised soaps</li>
            <li>An old standby and still my favorite bath soap.</li>
            <li>It has always been a very reasonably priced soap.</li>
            <li>Mild and only lightly scented</li>

            <li>Decent quality and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Mild basic soap with no chemical fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild, the scent is mellow, rinses well, and it is the only soap I will use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like Ivory soap of yesteryear and has no almond fragrance that Jergens usually has.</li>
            <li>particular bar (4.5 oz)  is so big</li>
            <li>It then becomes the new big bar.  </li>
            <li>This soap makes me feel squeaky clean, but is doesn&#x27;t dry me out like other bar soaps on the market.  </li>
            <li>When the bar is super small</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a pure soap that the smaller sized bars don&#x27;t last long at all in the shower.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Free of strong smells. Suds up well, and lasts a long time.  One of the best bargains for bath soap.</li>
            <li> Jergens Mild Soap has been my choice for years.  Mild and only lightly scented, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  Jergens bar soap is, however, difficult to find.  On-line shopping has made it easy to buy.  I am well pleased with amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Jergens soap.  I think they stopped making it as I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any stores in my area.  When the bar is super small I put it and a new bar to soak in hot water for 10 minutes.  Then fuse together and let sit for a day.  It then becomes the new big bar.  Never have to throw out anything.</li>
            <li> Mild basic soap with no chemical fragrances.  The bar doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a comparable soap that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Due to allergies, only soap I can use. Can no longer find it in any stores -- found it online (hallelujah) -- good prices -- I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li> Huge bars (4.5 oz) last a long time but may be difficult to handle for small hands. Mild soap, pleasant fragrance and makes a good lather. I purchase on a regular basis via Subscribe &amp; Save...</li>
            <li> I buy this by the case (well, not quite but almost).  It is mild.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s.  My skin dries out faster then it used to.  I need a mild soap.  But I don&#x27;t like a soap that has that &amp;#34;cold cream&amp;#34; feeling or has a fragrance about it.  This soap is perfect.  I buy it on Amazon.com because I can&#x27;t find it at the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jergens for almost 30 years. It used to be available in ALL stores. Today, I can find it only at Dollar Tree or through Amazon. Jergens neither dries out nor causes skin to break out; neither clogs the sinuses nor causes them to drain; while working beautifully for every family member from youngest to oldest. In my life, Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap is for my face and hair. Jergens soap is for everything else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like Ivory soap of yesteryear and has no almond fragrance that Jergens usually has.</li>
            <li> An old standby and still my favorite bath soap. Very reasonably priced, non-irritating, and lightly scented.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this soap. Next to impossible to find the 4.5 oz size in stores in Southern California. No problem finding the 3 oz bars. It&#x27;s such a pure soap that the smaller sized bars don&#x27;t last long at all in the shower. I have allergies to everything. This is the one soap I can use. The only problem is finding somewhere to buy it where you aren&#x27;t price gouged. Plus shipping bars of soap can be very expensive. It has always been a very reasonably priced soap.If you are allergic to everything under the sun,TRY IT! My big fear is that Jergens will stop making it.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Love Jergens. Can&#x27;t find it in the store any more.</li>
            <li> I like the soap, its odorless.</li>
            <li> Love this soap but am unable to find it locally. Glad it is available here. Suds up nicely.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that doesn&#x27;t tear up my skin and I can&#x27;t get it overseas.  I have to have it shipped to friends who are coming.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years, but am unable to find it in local stores, especially the bath sized bars. The soap is mild, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> Decent quality and reasonably priced. Not as harsh as Ivory during the cold, dry NJ winters. I put it in my rotation of 2-3 other soaps because I like variety once in a while. It&#x27;s not as popular as other more advertised soaps but it&#x27;s just as worthy and has earned a spot in my rotation.&lt;br /&gt;This particular bar (4.5 oz)  is so big I had to stand it up on it&#x27;s side just to fit it in my soap dish. Try it if you&#x27;re watching pennies and comparing prices.</li>
            <li> This soap is so perfect for me.  I don&#x27;t like how many liquid soaps for women have lots of nice fragrances but leave me feeling greasy after a bath.  This soap makes me feel squeaky clean, but is doesn&#x27;t dry me out like other bar soaps on the market.  There isn&#x27;t a strong fragrance or anything either.  It just gets you clean and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild, the scent is mellow, rinses well, and it is the only soap I will use!</li>
