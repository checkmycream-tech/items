    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with it!</li>
            <li>excellent product and service!</li>
            <li>The best cleanser for both morning and night</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s perfect under makeup and soothing after a day in the sun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very good at rejuvenating the skin, making it tighter without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Great product and a great deal!  </li>
            <li>This is a great astringent for my face.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m definitely happy with that</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Nice quality product!</li>
            <li>So delighted, I purchased two bottles, in expectation of great cleansing of a child-creature.</li>
            <li>It arrived well packaged and in good time.</li>
            <li>The price is right for the best quality astringent made.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>IMO, witch hazel is a superior face cleaner in that it will help your skin whether you have dry, oily, perfect, or combo skin.  </li>
            <li>love it for rashes , cuts, bug bites...skin toner and cleanser</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than those toners, and much more effective.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and pure, just the thing to get the dust off at any time of day or soothe after sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I originally started using witch hazel just to clean my pores after shaving, and it works excellently for that, as expected, but I&#x27;ve come to find out</li>
            <li>It helps eliminate the itchiness associated with shaving different parts of the body, and thoroughly cleans the pores as mentioned, which is great for helping to prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>This particular vendor offers this product at a great price, too.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find &amp;#34;100% natural witch hazel&amp;#34; at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Witch Hazel is what you need!&lt;br /&gt;Simply squirt some Witch Hazel on a cotton pad and apply it to the problem area at the first signs of discomfort and feel immediate relief!</li>
            <li>I may exercise my right of return.</li>
            <li>Use this first before using the bump stopper, that is if you have to.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Witch Hazel</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more when the time comes.</li>
            <li>I awaited with bright anticipation the arrival of my astringent, and so my chagrin upon opening the parcel to find &amp;#34;14% grain alcohol&amp;#34; under &amp;#34;inactive ingredients.&amp;#34; Right under the line which reads, &amp;#34;100% natural witch hazel ....... 86%&amp;#34; A quick trip back to Amazon, and nowhere in the marketing blurb is anything to suggest that the product is less than wholly witch hazel.</li>
            <li>It also helps the bruises I get from time to time heal much faster.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I understand there&#x27;s a certain amount of caveat emptor when it comes to buying, well, anything, and so it is with no small amount of consternation I undertake to write this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for all types of uses.</li>
            <li>Easy to pour and mix with other things!  </li>
            <li>Completely stops the razor bumps from forming!&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed how well this works!</li>
            <li>I am uncertain at this time what my course of action will be, beyond this missive.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to any other brand since this is the first time I&#x27;ve used it, but it&#x27;s served</li>
            <li>With three teen girls, this helps their skin clear.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product for use in a homemade baby wipe solution for application to the nether regions of my infant son and heir apparent.</li>
            <li>And while &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34; is true (to an extent) and accurate (for a given value thereof), it is at least shady trending to outright deceitful to suggest that a product is wholly one substance, when it is point of fact adulterated by another - in this case unwanted - solute.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I clean and exfoliate before shaving, a small back part of my leg would always get razor bumps, Until discovered Witch Hazel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also got a lot of other highly touted uses as well.</li>
            <li>good for my dogs after a bad case of diarrhea</li>
    </ol>

Completely stops the razor bumps from forming!&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed how well this works!</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for, and this was what I got.  Witch hazel as an alternative cleaning agent on my skin, in a similar use category as rubbing alcohol or tea tree oil.  Was shipped in sealed packaging to help protect against leakage if things broke, but the items arrived to me intact.</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it to tone my skin, refresh, and on sunburn.  Life saver.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell. Did absolutely nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> this stuff should be in every household closet! love it for rashes , cuts, bug bites...skin toner and cleanser</li>
            <li> I had problems getting rid of bumps at the back of head after shaving but this stuff works wonders for those with bump problems. Use this first before using the bump stopper, that is if you have to.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Witch Hazel and I love it! I can&#x27;t compare it to any other brand since this is the first time I&#x27;ve used it, but it&#x27;s served it&#x27;s purpose for me. Will definitely be buying more when the time comes.</li>

I am uncertain at this time what my course of action will be, beyond this missive. I may exercise my right of return. Or I may not, depending on fees. I may, slim though the chance is, find a legitimate use for this detestable liquid. I may even ceremonially pour the unwanted solution down the drain.

            <li> Love it! Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
