            <li>Great product and price point!</li>
            <li>My hairline gets burned in summer and this works great to prevent flakes.</li>
            <li>Hair looks great.</li>
            <li>It was very useful for my dandruff!!!</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>This is a good shampoo for an itchy and flaking scalp.</li>
            <li>Good lather and rinses well.</li>
            <li>Awesome Product for Cheap Price.</li>
            <li>good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Gentle on your scalp and has a great sent.</li>
            <li>and I feel as though I have more dandruff than ever before.</li>
            <li>I switched over from the Itchy Scalp with eucalyptus because I read that this one lathered up better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the 2 in one format, which is more easily found).</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and am allergic to many things</li>
            <li>So gentle on my scalp!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t itched since my first use.</li>
            <li>The additional aloe vera definitely makes it feel a little more gentle, and it smells nice as well.</li>
            <li>the only shampoo my husband uses and it does work good on dandrugg and dry itchy skin, esp in the summer heat1</li>
            <li>I previously used and loved Head and Shoulders SENSITIVE SCALP which also used Aloe Vera.  </li>
            <li>Took a while longer to receive than I expected, and shipping and handling was more than I felt</li>
            <li>actually really like this though.</li>
            <li>i really like this product.  </li>
            <li>If they are advertising it as being &amp;#34;PURELY GENTLE&amp;#34; then why did they add so much conditioner and fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with the SENSITIVE SCALP Head and Shoulders and the fragrance was minimal which is better for peole with allergies.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be switching back to the Itchy Scalp shampoo which got rid of scalp itch and 99% of the time gets rid of most, if not all, of the dandruff.</li>
            <li>H &amp; S PURELY GENTLE replaced SENSITIVE SCALP</li>
            <li>helps clear up husband&#x27;s dandruff and maintains it well.</li>
            <li>They should have never changed their old product that did work.</li>
            <li>HEAD AND SHOULDERS BRING BACK THE SENSITIVE SCALP FORMULA!  </li>
            <li>started using this to combat the BedBug and Mite infestation (they love eating dead scalp-skin and dandruff) and ever since, there are&lt;br /&gt;less and less, and I don&#x27;t even see them crawling on the pillows and sheets anymore.</li>

            <li> I like it.  But this is getting harder to find in this format (and I don&#x27;t like the 2 in one format, which is more easily found).</li>
            <li> Took a while longer to receive than I expected, and shipping and handling was more than I felt it should be.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints about the product itself.</li>
            <li> What can I say: It&#x27;s head and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the standard head and shoulders on a regular basis and never had any complaints. I tried this because it was on sale on Amazon and since I have Prime, it did not cost me anything to ship since I had some other items to order at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really like this though. The additional aloe vera definitely makes it feel a little more gentle, and it smells nice as well. Other than that, it is just like the standard H&amp;S shampoo.</li>
            <li> Hate the way the smells lingers in your hair</li>
            <li> Love this product! So gentle on my scalp! Smells great too! I was suffering from really bad itchy/dry scalp. I used this for about 3 weeks and it worked wonderful for those problems! Of course, I&#x27;m still using it!</li>
            <li> The Vidal Sassoon and Treseme I&#x27;ve been using were making my scalp itch like crazy. Saw this on sale and ordered it. I haven&#x27;t itched since my first use.</li>
            <li> Gentle on your scalp and has a great sent.</li>

            <li> No itch. Hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Good price and I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house to shop.</li>
            <li> Awesome item, just as described.</li>
            <li> the only shampoo my husband uses and it does work good on dandrugg and dry itchy skin, esp in the summer heat1</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo for an itchy and flaking scalp. Good lather and rinses well.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product for Cheap Price.</li>
            <li> HEAD AND SHOULDERS BRING BACK THE SENSITIVE SCALP FORMULA!  I previously used and loved Head and Shoulders SENSITIVE SCALP which also used Aloe Vera.  H &amp; S PURELY GENTLE replaced SENSITIVE SCALP and it is a horrible replacement.  I have a very sensitive scalp and am allergic to many things but I didn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with the SENSITIVE SCALP Head and Shoulders and the fragrance was minimal which is better for peole with allergies.  PG has a disgusting fragrance that gives me a headache.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to rinse out of your hair and leaves your hair so oily that it becomes flattened.  Worse yet as if you hadn&#x27;t even washed your hair at all.  I called corporate Head and Shoulders to complain.  The Shampoo feels harsh and irritated my scalp.  If they are advertising it as being &amp;#34;PURELY GENTLE&amp;#34; then why did they add so much conditioner and fragrance.  Yuck!  They should have never changed their old product that did work.</li>
            <li> If they would just stick with this and keep the bottles the same it would make life easier.  Those of us who suffer from sinus/skin/allergy issues desperately need this type of product.  But we need it to be hypo-allergenic and unscented.  Every time I turn around it seems they have added something that gives it a smell that has me reaching for an inhaler.  I always order several bottles when I find an acceptable combination and then start cursing as I get close to running out as I start the hunt all over again.</li>
            <li> Great product and price point!</li>
            <li> good shampoo.  helps clear up husband&#x27;s dandruff and maintains it well.</li>
            <li> For me it has not helped my severe dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> Hi y&#x27;all&lt;br /&gt;I started using this to combat the BedBug and Mite infestation (they love eating dead scalp-skin and dandruff) and ever since, there are&lt;br /&gt;less and less, and I don&#x27;t even see them crawling on the pillows and sheets anymore. My head is less itchy, is healing and I invite the ladies to the Boudoir with confidence now. My only problem is that the mites and bedbugs have migrated to the toilet paper... :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and I feel as though I have more dandruff than ever before. I switched over from the Itchy Scalp with eucalyptus because I read that this one lathered up better. While it does, it is not nearly as effective as the Itchy Scalp shampoo. It&#x27;s not getting rid of the dandruff at all. I will definitely be switching back to the Itchy Scalp shampoo which got rid of scalp itch and 99% of the time gets rid of most, if not all, of the dandruff.</li>
            <li> One of the only shampoo&#x27;s that actually work for me. As a person with dandruff and psoriasis, Head &amp; Shoulders keep me from scratching.. and that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
