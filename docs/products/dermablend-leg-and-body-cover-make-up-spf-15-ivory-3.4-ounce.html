            <li>IT IS AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best makeup ever!</li>
            <li>Go on youtube &amp; watch the videos for this stuff, it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I am extremely fair - I never ever go out in the sun - and this shade (Ivory) matches me perfectly.</li>
            <li>Dermablend&#x27;s Leg and Body Cover does great at covering all of them up.</li>
            <li>This seller is awesome &amp; you get your product very quickly!</li>
            <li>It covers my freckles on my arms perfectly, and also works great as a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>The good news is that I also ordered the setting powder, which I use over my face makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>This really is the best makeup your going to get to cover up your stuff.</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged, too.</li>
            <li>It covers it completely!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>You can see my results in the attached photo - just the top star has the Dermablend applied.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to get setting powder otherwise it will start to run off your face because of sweating.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic in a tube.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time now :)</li>
            <li>If you can see even a shadow of what you&#x27;re trying to cover you&#x27;ll be able to see it after the makeup dries.</li>
            <li>On my monitor, the beige shade looks more like an ivory, and bronze looks more like a beige.</li>
            <li>I thought I was never going to be able to wear a bikini again until I found this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be a wise decision to go to a retailer and find out which color is right for you.</li>
            <li>Amazing coverage for my very large and noticeable stretch marks.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to assume their shade of &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is really light.</li>
            <li>I just use a cheap $3 translucent powder I got from target to go obey it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an ivory skin tone, so I went with ivory, and it was way too light.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly on my paler than pale self.</li>
            <li>Then I wait five more minutes &amp; put another layer on right on what I&#x27;m trying to cover.</li>
            <li>First, make sure you get the correct color for your skin tone</li>
            <li>I am so excited for summer now.</li>
            <li>The coverage seemed excellent, but it was hard to tell because it looked like liquid chalk on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light but not white - and makes my hands and arms look so much better, plus it has sunscreen for protection.</li>
            <li>This does a good job of covering minor skin discolorations and minimizing skin texture imperfections.</li>
            <li>I wait just five more minutes &amp; get a good bit of regular face powder on a brush &amp; gently press in in the whole covered area, until it&#x27;s covered.</li>
            <li>This product covers anything, if you use it right.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a human being whose skin is that light (with apologies to any readers who disagree!).</li>
            <li>I put my lotion on &amp; wait five minutes to apply my first layer.</li>
            <li>but if you get the right color it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Dermablend&#x27;s tones vary from other popular makeup brands.</li>
            <li>I wait another five minutes &amp; pretty much just touch up what I can still see.</li>
            <li>Wait 15 minutes inbetween each layer application, or until the makeup layer is mostly darkened and dry</li>
            <li>I then apply my first layer, not really trying to do a whole lot of coverage, but more to blend on &amp; around the area.</li>
            <li>(Light actually made me look orange)</li>
            <li>After a couple of minutes the makeup should be set &amp; you can then gently brush off the remaining powder.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had to get ivory even though it&#x27;s a shade lighter than I would normally buy because after it dries on your skin it darkens that much.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to freckle coverer!</li>
            <li>Decent coverage.  </li>
            <li>When you put that second or third layer on, make sure that you can&#x27;t see whatever you&#x27;re covering up AT ALL so that it will stay that way when it dries.</li>
            <li>It was very simple to apply and does not take very much to cover a large area.</li>
            <li>It was so light and pink</li>
            <li>If I figure out how to add pictures I will for non professional application, non-retouched photo results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything before Dermablend that would completely cover it.</li>
            <li>and they were completely gone for wedding photos.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested the theory, but I wouldn&#x27;t be a bit surprised if you could go swimming in this without it wearing</li>
            <li>I have a port wine stain birthmark that&#x27;s less intensely pigmented than most of those type of birthmarks, and this made the pigment stand out less, but it didn&#x27;t cover it up completely, even with layering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to start out with clean scrubed skin &amp; moisturize with your everyday lotion or moisturizer too.</li>
            <li>After swimming for approximately 60 minutes was completely washed off however so would not work if intent was to actually hide scars and swim, but definitely worth the money and the very fast application time to be comfortable and confident in casual summer clothes.</li>
            <li>I do this process while applying my daily makeup, so that I dont take extra time getting ready.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and when I used it, I turned red and was itchy, otherwise the product covered the area well</li>
            <li>I ordered this from the DrSkinSpa sellers and it arrived an entire day early!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of pale but not THAT pale</li>
            <li>Takes many layers to work and dried very pink.</li>
            <li>This will last far longer than had anticipated when purchased.</li>
            <li>Ok, not great.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s exceptionally difficult if not impossible to determine the right shade.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s 1 thin background layer to blend in with your skin tone at the edges, and then 1 to 2 thicker layers on top to cover the actual scars/strech marks/tattoos</li>
            <li>and you MUST use loose powder for it to look soft,  </li>
            <li>I read both good and bad reviews for Dermablend</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If used correctly and directions are followed, tattoos (and other imperfections) will be completely covered, smudge resistant, waterproof, and protected all day long!</li>
            <li> finish on this is smooth-looking but not a natural finish.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wearing it for spot use and not complete coverage of an area, you&#x27;ll need to blend the edges</li>
            <li> It will cover tattoos, birthmarks, dark stretchmarks &amp; scars, age spots, acne, or other imperfections completely.</li>
            <li> I have a very deep and dark tattoo with color on my ankle.</li>
            <li> Also, you HAVE to use the loose setting powder with it, otherwise it will smudge and will not be waterproof.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way so if this product works for you, this tube will last awhile.</li>
            <li> I started with just a tiny dab, less than the size of an eraser</li>
            <li> Then I take a slightly thicker second layer and cover up the darker spots.</li>
            <li> What I do is I put a really thin, large layer on about an inch to two inches wider than what I&#x27;m trying to cover and blend the edges out, and then wait 15 minutes for that layer to dry.</li>
            <li> (otherwise your next application will pull up the wet makeup and make a mess of it).</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> It did take me a few tries to apply it correctly so be prepared to practice before actually using it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the lightest color possible, because I am extremely pale.</li>
            <li> otherwise i have extremely noticeable stubble.</li>
            <li> I do one under eye then the other</li>
            <li> Was disappointed after hearing so many rave reviews.</li>
            <li> You have to let it dry for a few min</li>
            <li> I have a medium to dark grape sized brown birthmark on the front of my neck.</li>
            <li> I have dark purple scars all over my arms</li>
            <li> Also keep in mind when applying it that you will probably need to put two or three layers on to fully cover something really dark.</li>
            <li> even after I shave I have the black dots all over my face from the hair under the skin that can&#x27;t be shaved away.</li>
            <li> went nuts when I put it on and a little rubbed off on my wedding dress from my underarms</li>
            <li> I ordered Ivory and it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have hirsutism of the face and have to have to shave it everyday</li>
            <li> It also rubs off on my clothes just with everyday activities.  </li>
            <li> that makeup does not fit well</li>
            <li> I am pale and got the ivory.</li>
            <li> You can use this on your face as a regular base or dab it on problem spots &amp; let dry for five minutes before putting on your regular foundation or cover-up.</li>
            <li> My skin is very pale and my hair is very dark, so</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it,  it looked cakey and I was disappointed but thought I&#x27;d give it another</li>
            <li> Bought this to cover a small tattoo for a wedding.</li>
            <li> Used with the dermablend setting powder and from 6 feet away very noticeable symmetrical cutting scars were unnoticeable from casual looks.</li>
            <li> I am usually two steps up from the lightest tone in makeup, and thought this would work, but alas no.</li>
            <li> The people who give this a bad reivew must not be using it correctly.</li>
            <li> I got really bad stretch marks from my two pregnancies.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I ordered Ivory and it was a waste of money. It was so light and pink I can&#x27;t imagine a human being whose skin is that light (with apologies to any readers who disagree!). I am usually two steps up from the lightest tone in makeup, and thought this would work, but alas no. The coverage seemed excellent, but it was hard to tell because it looked like liquid chalk on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and when I used it, I turned red and was itchy, otherwise the product covered the area well</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover my forearm tattoos for my job. I ordered the lightest color possible, because I am extremely pale. The makeup looks orange on my skin, and it did not cover the tattoo at all. I watched dozens of videos online for how to properly apply the makeup, and I still did not achieve the results I wanted. You can see my results in the attached photo - just the top star has the Dermablend applied. The good news is that I also ordered the setting powder, which I use over my face makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> I needed something to cover my tattoo for my job. I read both good and bad reviews for Dermablend so I thought I would try. IT IS AMAZING!!! I have a very deep and dark tattoo with color on my ankle. It covers it completely!!!!!!!! The people who give this a bad reivew must not be using it correctly. It did take me a few tries to apply it correctly so be prepared to practice before actually using it. First, make sure you get the correct color for your skin tone (you may have to mix colors). It has to be patted on. If you blend it, it won&#x27;t work. Also, you HAVE to use the loose setting powder with it, otherwise it will smudge and will not be waterproof. The powder is what seals it. If used correctly and directions are followed, tattoos (and other imperfections) will be completely covered, smudge resistant, waterproof, and protected all day long!</li>
            <li> I have hirsutism of the face and have to have to shave it everyday otherwise i have extremely noticeable stubble. My skin is very pale and my hair is very dark, so even after I shave I have the black dots all over my face from the hair under the skin that can&#x27;t be shaved away. Dermablend&#x27;s Leg and Body Cover does great at covering all of them up. Just make sure to get setting powder otherwise it will start to run off your face because of sweating. Using setting power will keep it on all day on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;It would be a wise decision to go to a retailer and find out which color is right for you. Dermablend&#x27;s tones vary from other popular makeup brands. You don&#x27;t want to assume their shade of &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is really light. (Light actually made me look orange)</li>
            <li> Love. This. It covers my freckles on my arms perfectly, and also works great as a full coverage foundation. I am extremely fair - I never ever go out in the sun - and this shade (Ivory) matches me perfectly. It&#x27;s very light but not white - and makes my hands and arms look so much better, plus it has sunscreen for protection. This is my new go-to freckle coverer!</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage for my very large and noticeable stretch marks. Does wonders!</li>
            <li> Does not cover well at all.</li>
            <li> Ok, not great.  Decent coverage.  Doesn&#x27;t last and not waterproof.  I bought it to cover my surgery scar when I&#x27;m in my bathing suit but not waterproof.  It also rubs off on my clothes just with everyday activities.  A little does go a long way so if this product works for you, this tube will last awhile.</li>
            <li> It was very simple to apply and does not take very much to cover a large area. This will last far longer than had anticipated when purchased. Used with the dermablend setting powder and from 6 feet away very noticeable symmetrical cutting scars were unnoticeable from casual looks. Made it so can walk in shorts or swim suit without any notice at all. After swimming for approximately 60 minutes was completely washed off however so would not work if intent was to actually hide scars and swim, but definitely worth the money and the very fast application time to be comfortable and confident in casual summer clothes. Matching the skin tone to choose is the most difficult part but if you get the right color it works very well.  If I figure out how to add pictures I will for non professional application, non-retouched photo results.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it,  it looked cakey and I was disappointed but thought I&#x27;d give it another try the next day.  I started with just a tiny dab, less than the size of an eraser then I use my finger and just tap it into my skin. I do one under eye then the other then my nose then do another coat the same way.  You have to let it dry for a few min and you MUST use loose powder for it to look soft,  if you don&#x27;t it looks like makeup caked on your face.  I just use a cheap $3 translucent powder I got from target to go obey it.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup ever! I have a medium to dark grape sized brown birthmark on the front of my neck. I haven&#x27;t found anything before Dermablend that would completely cover it. This product covers anything, if you use it right. You have to start out with clean scrubed skin &amp; moisturize with your everyday lotion or moisturizer too. You need to wait five minutes in between each application too. I put my lotion on &amp; wait five minutes to apply my first layer. I then apply my first layer, not really trying to do a whole lot of coverage, but more to blend on &amp; around the area. Then I wait five more minutes &amp; put another layer on right on what I&#x27;m trying to cover. Now don&#x27;t use but a tiny bit each time just to cover it. I wait another five minutes &amp; pretty much just touch up what I can still see. I wait just five more minutes &amp; get a good bit of regular face powder on a brush &amp; gently press in in the whole covered area, until it&#x27;s covered. You should have lots of extra powder on you at this point. After a couple of minutes the makeup should be set &amp; you can then gently brush off the remaining powder. I use an eyeshadow applicator to put mine pn, but you can use a brush or your finger. You can use this on your face as a regular base or dab it on problem spots &amp; let dry for five minutes before putting on your regular foundation or cover-up. I do this process while applying my daily makeup, so that I dont take extra time getting ready. This really is the best makeup your going to get to cover up your stuff. It will cover tattoos, birthmarks, dark stretchmarks &amp; scars, age spots, acne, or other imperfections completely. This seller is awesome &amp; you get your product very quickly! Go on youtube &amp; watch the videos for this stuff, it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic in a tube. It covers EVERYTHING. I have dark purple scars all over my arms and they were completely gone for wedding photos. I use it all the time now :)&lt;br /&gt;I went nuts when I put it on and a little rubbed off on my wedding dress from my underarms but I think that&#x27;s to be expected. I wasn&#x27;t upset about that!</li>
            <li> I ordered this from the DrSkinSpa sellers and it arrived an entire day early! Nicely packaged, too. As for the makeup itself - this stuff is like gold. Keep in mind that once the makeup oxidizes it gets darker. I&#x27;m kind of pale but not THAT pale and I had to get ivory even though it&#x27;s a shade lighter than I would normally buy because after it dries on your skin it darkens that much. Also keep in mind when applying it that you will probably need to put two or three layers on to fully cover something really dark. What I do is I put a really thin, large layer on about an inch to two inches wider than what I&#x27;m trying to cover and blend the edges out, and then wait 15 minutes for that layer to dry. Then I take a slightly thicker second layer and cover up the darker spots. When you put that second or third layer on, make sure that you can&#x27;t see whatever you&#x27;re covering up AT ALL so that it will stay that way when it dries. If you can see even a shadow of what you&#x27;re trying to cover you&#x27;ll be able to see it after the makeup dries. So that&#x27;s 1 thin background layer to blend in with your skin tone at the edges, and then 1 to 2 thicker layers on top to cover the actual scars/strech marks/tattoos/what have you. Wait 15 minutes inbetween each layer application, or until the makeup layer is mostly darkened and dry (otherwise your next application will pull up the wet makeup and make a mess of it). Good luck!</li>
            <li> that makeup does not fit well</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the product. Takes many layers to work and dried very pink. Some people might like it...</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly on my paler than pale self. Blend, blend, blend and then set with powder and it will last for hours and hours!  Will buy again</li>
            <li> This does a good job of covering minor skin discolorations and minimizing skin texture imperfections. I have a port wine stain birthmark that&#x27;s less intensely pigmented than most of those type of birthmarks, and this made the pigment stand out less, but it didn&#x27;t cover it up completely, even with layering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish on this is smooth-looking but not a natural finish. If you&#x27;re wearing it for spot use and not complete coverage of an area, you&#x27;ll need to blend the edges really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a heck of a time getting it off my skin, even with makeup-removing cleanser and a bath poof. I haven&#x27;t tested the theory, but I wouldn&#x27;t be a bit surprised if you could go swimming in this without it wearing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Online, it&#x27;s exceptionally difficult if not impossible to determine the right shade. I&#x27;m an ivory skin tone, so I went with ivory, and it was way too light. On my monitor, the beige shade looks more like an ivory, and bronze looks more like a beige. If at all possible definitely go to a retailer to determine your shade match before buying online.</li>
            <li> Product as described. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I got really bad stretch marks from my two pregnancies. I thought I was never going to be able to wear a bikini again until I found this product. I am so excited for summer now. I am pale and got the ivory. If you are deciding between two shades, I suggest you get the lighter one to cover imperfections.</li>
            <li> Bought this to cover a small tattoo for a wedding. Ivory dries darker than pictured and turns orange. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Was disappointed after hearing so many rave reviews.</li>
