            <li>Love it, love it, love it..</li>
            <li>Smells like baby powder but better</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Not overpowering like many perfumes.</li>
            <li>I really love this smell and everyone is always asking me what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY love it.</li>
            <li>Baby is my favorite Wicked Style scent--sweet with a light musky undertone (but not overly so).</li>
            <li>Many reviewing this perfume have said it to be light and not overbearing</li>
            <li>Its a very light scent, that smells sweet like candy.</li>
            <li>As for the bottle it is a delightful little casing that I just want to carry around with me everywhere</li>

            <li>I was very glad to find this on amazon and hope that the next time I run out I will be able to buy here again.</li>
            <li>if you didnt like the original version of Baby because of her smelling like baby powder, \\&quot;Kawaii\\</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something more sweet and floral, like the description (vanilla and floral), but the sandalwood is pretty</li>
            <li>I love this elegant scent, not to over powering but still a very sweet smell, both my mother and my sister (who are very picky when it come to perfume) enjoyed the fragrance, they also both agreed with me that it smells very much like an old friend of ours,</li>
            <li>I think it should be renamed: Sweet and Spicy.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, long lasting scent.  </li>
            <li>scent lasts 8+ hours, which is great for long days at work.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume packaging was pretty smashed, but the shipping box was fine, which means that they shipped a crushed box.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what daughter-in-law wanted.  </li>
            <li>My girls love perfume and the bottles are an extra bonus.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume, can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent that is a little sharp and is suitable for all times of day, including school and work.</li>
            <li>&quot; Baby makes up for it, she has a sweet vanilla and slightly fruity scent and when it hits the heart notes the scent will remind you of a fruity bubblegum  perfect for everyday or summer.</li>
            <li>and I got so many compliments from younger girls and older ladies(yep</li>
            <li>The head is huge but you will not be disappointed the smell is awesome.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is very adorable and I see me buying the rest of the collection in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>I like it almost as much as they do.</li>
            <li>This is a tiny amount, for a pretty hefty price, but to me, its well worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought a huge smaple size last year and while it DID last me a loooooong time and was cheap, the smell WASn&amp;#34;T THE SAME.</li>
            <li>A very soft and flirty fragrance.</li>
            <li>And wow!</li>
            <li>Soft and sweet smell but absolutely no perfume headache like lots of perfume sprays give me.  </li>
            <li>I gave it as a gift and was excited about the long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>if your one to get headaches by wearing perfumes(like me &gt;.&gt;) you wont have to worry about that when wearing this, this is light and soft enough for anyone who has a sensitive nose, this is even soft enough for much younger girls.(I recommend this as a gift for little girls because the scent is soft enough for them and they will think the doll is cute.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed at all this one was larger than my usual</li>
            <li>The scent is a little more heavy and musky than I imagined it, but it still smells alright.  </li>
            <li>She is sweet and a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>A little too much of a spicy-sweet smell for me.</li>

            <li> Bought this as a gift for my teen niece. She loved it. The price of this item was very good.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little more heavy and musky than I imagined it, but it still smells alright.

The perfume bottle was in perfect condition and I am just glad that this was not going to be a gift.&lt;br /&gt;I would have only rated this 2 stars if the price hadn&#x27;t been discounted.</li>
            <li> if your one to get headaches by wearing perfumes(like me &gt;.&gt;) you wont have to worry about that when wearing this, this is light and soft enough for anyone who has a sensitive nose, this is even soft enough for much younger girls.(I recommend this as a gift for little girls because the scent is soft enough for them and they will think the doll is cute. also perfect for any anime fan girl that likes cute and chibi things as well)  if you didnt like the original version of Baby because of her smelling like baby powder, \\&quot;Kawaii\\&quot; Baby makes up for it, she has a sweet vanilla and slightly fruity scent and when it hits the heart notes the scent will remind you of a fruity bubblegum  perfect for everyday or summer. I wore this and I got so many compliments from younger girls and older ladies(yep this scent is not just for tweens)</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.. Bought it for my daughter and it&#x27;s light and airy.. Will purchase it again</li>
            <li> Smells like baby powder but better</li>
            <li> Exactly what daughter-in-law wanted.  Glad to have found it for good price, received quickly.  Great for all of us!  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this elegant scent, not to over powering but still a very sweet smell, both my mother and my sister (who are very picky when it come to perfume) enjoyed the fragrance, they also both agreed with me that it smells very much like an old friend of ours, wonder if she used ever used this perfume. As for the bottle it is a delightful little casing that I just want to carry around with me everywhere I go. Overall, it is very adorable and I see me buying the rest of the collection in the future. :)</li>
            <li> A very soft and flirty fragrance. Not overpowering like many perfumes. I was also impressed by it&#x27;s \\&quot;staying power\\&quot;. I only wish it came in a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> A little too much of a spicy-sweet smell for me. The bottle is the most attractive part. I think it should be renamed: Sweet and Spicy.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite perfume. I really love this smell and everyone is always asking me what I am wearing. The head is huge but you will not be disappointed the smell is awesome. For this price I feel like it was a steal.</li>
            <li> And wow! What a steal the price is on Amazon. I used to buy her at the military base we have here, but they stopped selling this line and now I just buy on here. She is sweet and a little goes a LONG way. Just a few sprays on your skin and the scent surrounds you for maybe an hour or two, but if you spray on your clothes it lasts HOURS. If you are like me, who wears it to work and wears a uniform to work I usually wear the same shirt twice a week. If I spray it on Monday and use the same shirt Thursday it still smells like the scent. My boyfriend used to love sticking his face in my (fully clothed!) chest and taking a big wiff..it sounds weird, lol but he loves the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would just spend the extra money and buy this one. I bought a huge smaple size last year and while it DID last me a loooooong time and was cheap, the smell WASn&amp;#34;T THE SAME. It smelled deluted and water downed, plus it didn&#x27;t last at all. I would douse my body in it before work and by the time I got there it would be gone. BUYER BEWARE DO NOT GET THE SAMPLE PERFUMES THEY ARE TRASH.&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS. It&#x27;s the real deal. Plus, with this ADD one thing Amazon has now i got this then got &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34; from the wicked line (smaller size) for about $6 and she smells wonderful as well. What a great deal.</li>
            <li> My girls love perfume and the bottles are an extra bonus.  I like it almost as much as they do.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for a year now, first finding it in a commissary on an Army base. I ABSOLUTELY love it. Its a very light scent, that smells sweet like candy. I get compliments all the time. All perfumes/frangrances mix with differently body chemistries though. This is definitely my signature frangrance. I am no longer stationed at the base I was recently aat, and I cannot find it here, in ANY retail store, so online has been the online place I can buy it. This is a tiny amount, for a pretty hefty price, but to me, its well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, long lasting scent.  Great for all.  I gave it as a gift and was excited about the long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, can&#x27;t get enough of it! this was a great deal!! I am not disappointed at all this one was larger than my usual I think I will look for this size from now on.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple years ago and couldn&#x27;t wear this as a practical scent, it just smells like cloves to me. Many reviewing this perfume have said it to be light and not overbearing, I cannot say that I agree. I feel it too be a VERY strong clove scent. Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t wear it because I didn&#x27;t want to smell like a spiced ham. Sadly, the bottle was the only thing going for this perfume.</li>
