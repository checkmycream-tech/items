            <li>; i have super fair skin.</li>
            <li>this product is very well pigmented even better than M.A.C&#x27;s lipstick collection, it has a Matte finish and it sets beautifully.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this color and how it compliments my lips.</li>
            <li>but I prefer a more muted neutral lip color.</li>
            <li>love the texture and it glides on so well.</li>
            <li>I love this color looks just like the picture</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product it goes on matte.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Beautiful color the line is fair, just apply a lipbalm before the lipstick it stays better and it doesn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li>This is one of my favs especially how i can mix it with another and the color is still very nice its a good lipstick for on the go .</li>
            <li>I thought from the pic the lipstick would be a smooth chocolate/mocha color.</li>
            <li>Love this color not to much but not to little just perfect!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something good and cheap i will definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have a fair skin tone more on the lighter side with dark hair and brown eyes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>worth your money</li>
            <li>The color is less brown than I was expecting and looks very much like this Nyx lipstick I already own, but it goes on smooth with a matte finish.</li>
            <li>glides on really well and is super pigmented.</li>
            <li>This color, combined with my natural pink, looks great.  </li>
            <li>it really compliments my medium to brown skin and it arrived faster than was supposed too!</li>
            <li>Really pretty color.</li>
            <li>I did find I needed a gloss to go with it, but that&#x27;s also personal preference as I find most lipstick to be a bit drying.</li>
            <li>Another surprising Wet N Wild find for me!</li>
            <li>Expected more of a mauve</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much darker.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in case anybody wants to know</li>
            <li>Really like the matte, not into glossy lipstick.</li>
            <li>You can manage the darkness of the lip color by either patting it on lightly for a nude tone or applying it on as a regular lipstick for a darker night look.</li>
            <li>i like the creamy texture and it lasts for a good 3 hours at least.</li>
            <li>High Quality Lipstick @ a fraction of the cost of HIGH END BRANDS!</li>
            <li>Not my favorite matte lipstick from wet n wild.</li>
            <li>The lipstick is great but it smells a bit weird.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear lipstick, but I really like this color brown on me which isn&#x27;t too loud.</li>
            <li>I love this color and its very long lasting (applied twice a day).</li>
            <li>As A Very Natural Looking Lip Color For me.</li>
            <li>So far this is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last the four hours not even an hour really.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pale/olive skin tone, snow-white level of pale, so it&#x27;s very easy for a color to be too dark.</li>
            <li>But It is a pretty color its not really matte until it dry&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I will order again from Wet N&#x27; Wild!</li>

            <li> Question asked, How long does it last and the option I selected was It needs to be reapplied occasionally</li>
            <li> I gave a 5 star rating because the lipstick is long lasting.</li>
            <li> My new everyday &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; lip color.</li>
            <li> all of those complaining about how difficult it is to apply: just hold it against your lip for a few moments to warm it up and then spread.</li>
            <li> If lips become a bit chapped or dry, use a tiny dab of Vaseline underneath product.</li>
            <li> I hope that&#x27;s normal :/</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price - wet n</li>
            <li> If you have dry lips this product may not be for you</li>
            <li> but I only select that option because the actual option was not available.  </li>
            <li> not much to say besides</li>
            <li> I received the product faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I have really pink lips</li>
            <li> Got it faster then expected!</li>
            <li> Your lip pencil should be reddish brown instead of dark brown.</li>
            <li> im dark skinned chick</li>
            <li> I prefer dark lipstick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Black Of Medium Skin Tone</li>

            <li> My everyday fall lip!</li>
            <li> Stayed on my whole 8hour shift with no reapplication and isn&#x27;t annoying and sticky</li>
            <li> I do not like the texture either - its too thick and when applied to the lips they appear cracked.</li>
            <li> Yet, unfortunately, the color is dull and lacks luster.</li>
            <li> (Unless you prefer that horrible dark line around your mouth.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This lipstick makes me look purrrty</li>
            <li> i like the creamy texture and it lasts for a good 3 hours at least. Good coverage for brown skin and/or darker lips. (Im medium brown with yellow undertones kinda like Whitney Houston)&lt;br /&gt;A lot of the reviews kept saying that its a good neutral, but it does have reddish undertones. It comes out like a red clay/ brown color. It should be called \\&quot;Pueblo\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;Mocha-licious\\&quot;. Your lip pencil should be reddish brown instead of dark brown. (Unless you prefer that horrible dark line around your mouth. There will be a distinction.)&lt;br /&gt;*For all of those complaining about how difficult it is to apply: just hold it against your lip for a few moments to warm it up and then spread.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this lipstick! It&#x27;s matte which is what I prefer. I will order again from Wet N&#x27; Wild!</li>
            <li> Expected more of a mauve but it&#x27;s much darker. I have pale oliveskin (but brown eyes)but this looks like I smeared chocolate on myself</li>
            <li> Beautiful color!! Since it&#x27;s matte it doesn&#x27;t make your lips sticky and leaves them looking fuller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favs especially how i can mix it with another and the color is still very nice its a good lipstick for on the go .</li>
            <li> Loved it! I get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is great but it smells a bit weird. I hope that&#x27;s normal :/</li>
            <li> Amazing lipstick I love it</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!!!!! I love this color and its very long lasting (applied twice a day). I have a fair skin tone more on the lighter side with dark hair and brown eyes and I absolutely love this color and how it compliments my lips. It has alot of color and it&#x27;s not runny.</li>
            <li> perfect brown/mocha shade!!! glides on really well and is super pigmented. not much to say besides this is awesome! don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price - wet n wild has awesome products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in case anybody wants to know; i have super fair skin. that being said, this would look good on a variety of skin tones! probably a very nice nude for deeper-skinned women.</li>
            <li> this product is very well pigmented even better than M.A.C&#x27;s lipstick collection, it has a Matte finish and it sets beautifully. If you&#x27;re looking for something good and cheap i will definitely recommend this product. So far this is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> This is somewhat of a fleshtone lipstick for women of color it looks great nothing to noticble . I was very pleased at how well it complement my skin.</li>
            <li> I received the product faster than expected. The color is beautiful and would look great on any skin tone.  I gave a 5 star rating because the lipstick is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Got it on time with prime, and it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way this color looks on my skin. I&#x27;m brownskin about Keke Palmers complexion. I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a nude color at all. (Which is the color I was going for)  it resembles the same color of powdered cinnamon on dark/brown skin.</li>
            <li> I have really pink lips but I prefer a more muted neutral lip color. This color, combined with my natural pink, looks great.  nice neutral for summer.</li>
            <li> I thought color waa darker drown but ine u put on its a tan color  im dark skinned chick it did look good when i liner it up it last 4 hrs</li>
            <li> Great lipstick shade!</li>
            <li> If you have brown skin and want the perfect color, buy this.</li>
            <li> perfect color for fall! love the texture and it glides on so well. worth your money</li>
            <li> Good color, like milk chocolate but a hit deeper. Stayed on my whole 8hour shift with no reapplication and isn&#x27;t annoying and sticky</li>
            <li> The color is horrible. In my opinion, it looks like I&#x27;m applying brick coloring to my lips. I do not like the texture either - its too thick and when applied to the lips they appear cracked. I thought from the pic the lipstick would be a smooth chocolate/mocha color. Yet, unfortunately, the color is dull and lacks luster.</li>
            <li> Love this color! Really like the matte, not into glossy lipstick. I&#x27;m very light skinned, but it look nice. I prefer dark lipstick. Price is great also.</li>
            <li> Question asked, How long does it last and the option I selected was It needs to be reapplied occasionally but I only select that option because the actual option was not available.  I only have to reapply once and that&#x27;s after lunch in my 8 hour work day.</li>
            <li> I love this color looks just like the picture it really compliments my medium to brown skin and it arrived faster than was supposed too!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color the line is fair, just apply a lipbalm before the lipstick it stays better and it doesn&#x27;t dry you&#x27;re lips that way. Great price!</li>
            <li> Really pretty color. I love it. Goes well with lighter skin completions, like mine.</li>
            <li> The color is less brown than I was expecting and looks very much like this Nyx lipstick I already own, but it goes on smooth with a matte finish. Which are basically the two things I need from a successful lipstick.</li>
            <li> Perfect nude lip for WOC! Stays put &amp; is a lovely matte! My everyday fall lip!</li>
            <li> Their lipsticks are the BOMB!!!!</li>
            <li> Another surprising Wet N Wild find for me! Beautiful shade, on the deeper side without being too overpowering. I&#x27;m a pale/olive skin tone, snow-white level of pale, so it&#x27;s very easy for a color to be too dark. This one was not at all too dark! It&#x27;s a great day-time shade that is an equally beautiful night-out shade, depending on what you&#x27;re doing with the rest of your makeup. Loving it! I did find I needed a gloss to go with it, but that&#x27;s also personal preference as I find most lipstick to be a bit drying. Regardless, 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> High Quality Lipstick @ a fraction of the cost of HIGH END BRANDS! - (as good as &amp; will rival BOBBI BROWN COSMETICS - lip color line) The Matte Version (lasts and lasts)...... drenched with pigment!! .....SUGGESTION: If lips become a bit chapped or dry, use a tiny dab of Vaseline underneath product.</li>
            <li> Very nice mocha. I don&#x27;t normally wear lipstick, but I really like this color brown on me which isn&#x27;t too loud.</li>
            <li> You can manage the darkness of the lip color by either patting it on lightly for a nude tone or applying it on as a regular lipstick for a darker night look. My new everyday &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; lip color.</li>
            <li> I love this product it goes on matte. I have brown skin so it goes on as a bit brown but if you are darker it will look nude. If you have dry lips this product may not be for you</li>
            <li> I loved it , it fits perfect &amp; its matte &amp; lasts up to 6 hours on me</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last the four hours not even an hour really. But It is a pretty color its not really matte until it dry&#x27;s. Not my favorite matte lipstick from wet n wild. But it is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Got it faster then expected! Love this color not to much but not to little just perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Black Of Medium Skin Tone And This Works Well As A Very Natural Looking Lip Color For me.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and great staying power.  Love it</li>
