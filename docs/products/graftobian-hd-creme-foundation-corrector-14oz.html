            <li>The texture is very good</li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>It does a great job of brightening the eye area and does not burn eyes.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>It does give really good coverage.</li>
            <li>Amazing product</li>
            <li>It did not cover as well as i would of liked.</li>
            <li>However mine are a nice shade a lot like like plum</li>
            <li>You get a good amount for the price, great coverage, and shipping is fast.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This cover worked ok.</li>
            <li>but you get a lot more in this package.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with this product; I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formula</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality&lt;br /&gt;For covering up redness and undereye circles, its Yellow Hi-Lite is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Eons better than the Stila concealer I bought months ago for $20</li>
            <li>You have to use something else on top of it thou.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a good balance, and just the right consistency for covering up undereye circles.  </li>
            <li>Coverage&lt;br /&gt;is pretty good, but that doesn&#x27;t matter if the color doesn&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application&lt;br /&gt;To apply it, I usually warm the creme between my fingers so it spreads more easily, then gently work it into my problem areas.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It covers well and blends smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is way too light.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product because I saw a makeup guru (Klaire de Lys on Youtube) use it often in her tutorials.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great concealer, especially given the price, and is worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t anything special you need to do to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t look cakey but has medium to full coverage, so it looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use the green and it is great.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, pretty damn good.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth, too.</li>
            <li>Phenomenal highlight for yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>This correcter totally cancels out the purple and i and SO excited!</li>
            <li>Very silky and creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>Really brightens the face</li>
            <li>It blends really well.</li>
            <li>First off, I have under eye circles, which is normal.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I sleep.</li>
            <li>I prefer HD one I used previously it just worked better.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This highlighter is great and only a little product is needed to go a long way.</li>
            <li>This is great for very dark under eye circles, I&#x27;ve tried a few different colors and brands and for me this has really helped so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very concentrated formula, so you won&#x27;t need much; just a dab in the bottle should be enough.  </li>
            <li>I started using this in a palette that I had ordered and found that I emptied the Yellow Hi-Lite more than any other in the concealer palette.  </li>
            <li>I can finally feel pretty.</li>
            <li>The consistency is creamy but not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star because it does settle into wrinkles a little bit, but this is mostly when my skin is really dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone is different, but I would highly suggest giving this project a shot.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage for blemishes, a little difficult to use under eyes because it&#x27;s so thick but overall very pleased.</li>
            <li>It covers the dark eyes pretty well.</li>
            <li>The consistency is very creamy but matte, but not drying to the point it will make your dry skin or wrinkles look really obvious.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s better than any other liquid or cream concealer I&#x27;ve used, but I like it.</li>
            <li>pigments were not very finely milled, so it didn&#x27;t turn out to be very discrete.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product.  It is a corrector, like it is intended.  You will not regret purchasing this.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> pigments were not very finely milled, so it didn&#x27;t turn out to be very discrete.  left visible particulate on the skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well for concealing dark circles.</li>
            <li> its not as moisturizing and goes on dryer than expected</li>
            <li> This cover worked ok. It did not cover as well as i would of liked. I used it under my eyes to cover the dark circles. I prefer HD one I used previously it just worked better.</li>
            <li> Very silky and creamy consistency. Not sure if it&#x27;s better than any other liquid or cream concealer I&#x27;ve used, but I like it. It covers well and blends smoothly. Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth, too.</li>
            <li> Amazing product I Luv it I will definitely buy this again and I&#x27;m gonna try there other products now</li>
            <li> I cannot wear this under anything. It is way too light. Coverage&lt;br /&gt;is pretty good, but that doesn&#x27;t matter if the color doesn&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li> I started using this in a palette that I had ordered and found that I emptied the Yellow Hi-Lite more than any other in the concealer palette.  I have hereditary under eye circles, which is the number one reason I wear make up at all.  I have tried Avon, Mary Kay, CG, etc looking for a concealer that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different, but I would highly suggest giving this project a shot.  You get a good amount for the price, great coverage, and shipping is fast.  The consistency is creamy but not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star because it does settle into wrinkles a little bit, but this is mostly when my skin is really dry.  I find this happens to me a lot with every product I&#x27;ve ever tried - so not a particular diss on this product.  Other than that, pretty damn good.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it covers my dark blue veins on the inner corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great coverage for blemishes, a little difficult to use under eyes because it&#x27;s so thick but overall very pleased. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal highlight for yellow undertones. Really brightens the face</li>
            <li> This came is a very small jar, but a little bit goes a very long way.  It does a great job of brightening the eye area and does not burn eyes.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is great for very dark under eye circles, I&#x27;ve tried a few different colors and brands and for me this has really helped so much. I can finally feel pretty.</li>
            <li> It does give really good coverage. I have really dark circles and this covers them it reminds me of the boing concealer by benefit but you get a lot more in this package. It blends really well. A little goes a very long way and the coverage is really buildable. I tried the bh pallete but that one was way to cakey. If you have dry skin especially under your eyes this will work well also notice that I have less creasing with this one</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product because I saw a makeup guru (Klaire de Lys on Youtube) use it often in her tutorials.  I looked it up and saw it was affordable, so I decided to have a spin.  I am more than pleased with this product; I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formula&lt;br /&gt;This is a very concentrated formula, so you won&#x27;t need much; just a dab in the bottle should be enough.  The consistency is very creamy but matte, but not drying to the point it will make your dry skin or wrinkles look really obvious.  So it&#x27;s a good balance, and just the right consistency for covering up undereye circles.  The formula also works well as a corrector for red skin; I use this around my nose area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application&lt;br /&gt;To apply it, I usually warm the creme between my fingers so it spreads more easily, then gently work it into my problem areas.  There isn&#x27;t anything special you need to do to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality&lt;br /&gt;For covering up redness and undereye circles, its Yellow Hi-Lite is perfect.  The yellowness counteracts any deep red or purple marks, making your skin look clearer.  It also doesn&#x27;t look cakey but has medium to full coverage, so it looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great concealer, especially given the price, and is worth the investment.  Eons better than the Stila concealer I bought months ago for $20+.</li>
            <li> First off, I have under eye circles, which is normal. However mine are a nice shade a lot like like plum no matter how much I sleep. This correcter totally cancels out the purple and i and SO excited! it is yellow tough, so you&#x27;ll have to use your normal concealer I would recommend this only for people which dark under eyes, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up looking like you have yellow under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Finally a corrector that covers the redness of cystic acne.  I also have red patches on my face from age.  I also use the green and it is great.  Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. It covers the dark eyes pretty well. You have to use something else on top of it thou. The texture is very good and it&#x27;s easy to apply. Loved it!</li>
            <li> This highlighter is great and only a little product is needed to go a long way. I just wished it came in a bigger container.</li>
