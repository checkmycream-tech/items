            <li>But each time I put on Pacifica&#x27;s French Lilac Body Butter, I am transported to that perfect day on the cusp between Spring and Summer.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more!!!</li>
            <li>But if you want a lotion that smells pretty darn close to that, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>said it smelled perfect and lasted a long time</li>

            <li>This is the truest lilac scent available.</li>
            <li>The scent is really close to actual lilacs, but not quite perfect.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite !</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for dry skin, but it&#x27;s great as a light perfume lotion.</li>
            <li>My favorite smell in the whole world!</li>
            <li>This lotion smells like real lilacs, and it goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>It is the best and hard to find</li>
            <li>this body butter has the scent of true lilacs.  </li>
            <li>Has the true fragrance of lilacs and</li>
            <li>The smell is so genuine, not artificial at all.</li>
            <li>Each inhale brings me back to these good memories - picnics, fresh lilacs from my husband, or playing outdoors as a child.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend for people who love natural flower scent!</li>
            <li>The lilac scent (my favorite scent) is not strong or overpowering, and the cream applies nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich feeling and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Now I HAVE to put it on right after my shower.  </li>
            <li>really has a true lilac scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that the scent lasts a long time on my skin .</li>
            <li>Very relaxing to put on after a shower, and I love that Pacifica&#x27;s products are natural and chemical-free.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly with no greasy residue and really softens my skin.</li>
            <li>It is so difficult to find good quality lilac scents, so I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more for</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast.  </li>
            <li>French Lilac is my favorite scent in the Pacifica body butter.  </li>
            <li>This product smells exactly like lilacs.</li>
            <li>exactly* like the lilacs in my yard in the spring.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>The lotion rubs in pretty quick and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>The perfume is strong when you first put it on, but quickly fades to a delicate, appropriate level of French Lilac perfection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like lilacs at all, just has a very acrid chemical odor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing, and leaves a slight floral scent on skin all day.  </li>
            <li>I love the slight weight to the lotion, and how well it absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>Below is my wifes opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh and realistic lilac scent.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing on my dry skin and absorbs quickly without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>scent is quite strong, so that could be a plus or a minus, depending how strongy-scented you (and your co-workers/family!)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get better if you wait a few minutes either.</li>
            <li>I live in the south where we don&#x27;t have a yearly bloom and this body butter and the complimenting body wash</li>
            <li>The lotion had a seal on it, so I knew it was new.</li>
            <li>Have only used it a few times since getting, but I do love it.  </li>
            <li>order came right away, even sooner than the expected delivery date</li>
            <li>The sky is blue, the trees are swaying in a light breeze, and the sun is shining down on our picnic.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, I was a little overwhelmed by the lilac, but I used it any way.  </li>

            <li> Best smelling lilac lotion.  Not greasy, smells like real lilacs and is a great consistency.  A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is very soothing on my dry skin and absorbs quickly without a greasy feeling. Lilacs are my favorite flower and this body butter has the scent of true lilacs.  It smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;The order came right away, even sooner than the expected delivery date</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell! Very relaxing to put on after a shower, and I love that Pacifica&#x27;s products are natural and chemical-free.  This lotion goes on easily and the moisture stays all day. Love it.</li>
            <li> French Lilac is my favorite scent in the Pacifica body butter.  When I first opened it, I was a little overwhelmed by the lilac, but I used it any way.  Now I HAVE to put it on right after my shower.  It&#x27;s so refreshing, and leaves a slight floral scent on skin all day.  I also feel great knowing I&#x27;m not putting harmful chemicals onto my skin.</li>
            <li> This product smells exactly like lilacs. If you like that smell you will love this body butter!</li>
            <li> It is the best and hard to find</li>
            <li> This fragrance is just wonderful.  I never want to be without it.  Has the true fragrance of lilacs and the price was good.  It arrived very fast.  I will get another when this runs out.</li>
            <li> If there were a 4 1/2 star option, that&#x27;s what I would have chosen.  I am between \\&quot;liking\\&quot; and \\&quot;loving\\&quot; it.  Although it is a little pricey, it&#x27;s very thick and rich, and a little goes a long way.  It is so difficult to find good quality lilac scents, so I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is quite strong, so that could be a plus or a minus, depending how strongy-scented you (and your co-workers/family!) like your products.  The scent is really close to actual lilacs, but not quite perfect.  I read another review that described it as being more like peonies.  I don&#x27;t think I independently would have thought that, but after reading it and smelling the product, I can&#x27;t get that nagging thought out of my head.  It IS a bit like peonies, but there is definitely lilac in there as well.  If you&#x27;re looking for it to smell exactly like inhaling the fresh scent of actual lilacs, you may be a little disappointed.  But if you want a lotion that smells pretty darn close to that, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the most beautiful smell! I love it! The smell lasts and you can actually smell it for several hours after application. The lotion rubs in pretty quick and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I love and miss the smell of lilacs.  I live in the south where we don&#x27;t have a yearly bloom and this body butter and the complimenting body wash make me feel like I&#x27;m back home.  Both are moisturizing and very refreshing.  Will definitely buy more!!!</li>
            <li> My new favorite ! It applies like silk and smells incredibly good. I&#x27;m thrilled that the scent lasts a long time on my skin .</li>
            <li> I love this! it feels and smells wonderful going on and it keeps my skin from feeling itchy or dry al day long.</li>
            <li> slow shipment but they had what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> my wife loved this. said it smelled perfect and lasted a long time</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful.  It is smooth on the skin, and smells *exactly* like the lilacs in my yard in the spring.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend going through chemo, and she said it was the highlight of her day when she could lotion up with this lovely smelling body butter.</li>
            <li> Below is my wifes opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh and realistic lilac scent. This creamy butter hydrates and perfumes skin delightfully. I layer this body butter with the convenient French lilac roll-on perfume.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion it&#x27;s light and is not overpowering or chemically, but I was disappointed with the sticky gross feeling that is leaves on your skin like it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.  Pacifica always makes a great lotion/body butter but this one is just ehhh.</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin and people are always asking me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing!</li>
            <li> Really accurate smell of lilac! I love this product and highly recommend for people who love natural flower scent!</li>
            <li> I always love Pacifica Body Butters during the cold winters we have in Minneapolis. Lilac isn&#x27;t really my scent of choice, but it had good reviews, so I figured I would try it. Woah! It smells so good, and reminds me of fond childhood memories of when I would steal lilacs from the neighbors trees, and then give them to my mom. The smell is so genuine, not artificial at all. I will for sure be buying this again.</li>
            <li> An excellent product! If you like the scent of lilac as I do you&#x27;ll love this body cream. It&#x27;s very rich feeling and makes your skin so soft. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! ! It&#x27;s also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My favorite smell in the whole world!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent and the body butter smells heavenly and lasts. This is the truest lilac scent available. It absorbs quickly with no greasy residue and really softens my skin. Great product</li>
            <li> Pacifica Body Butters are the best in the market.  This one in particular smells wonderful and leaves your skin cool, soft and not greasy!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!  Just what I needed in the dead of winter!  The smell of lilacs and the richness of the lotion brings Springtime to Ohio!  I had to buy more for my daughter!</li>
            <li> Love it, rich and creamy, smells like Lilacs I remember</li>
            <li> The sky is blue, the trees are swaying in a light breeze, and the sun is shining down on our picnic. Our noses are being tickled by the enchanting smell of lilacs floating in the air... Reality check: It is the dead of winter and it is snowing. But each time I put on Pacifica&#x27;s French Lilac Body Butter, I am transported to that perfect day on the cusp between Spring and Summer. Each inhale brings me back to these good memories - picnics, fresh lilacs from my husband, or playing outdoors as a child. The order itself came swiftly and was well packaged. The lotion had a seal on it, so I knew it was new. I love the slight weight to the lotion, and how well it absorbs into the skin. The perfume is strong when you first put it on, but quickly fades to a delicate, appropriate level of French Lilac perfection.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like lilacs at all, just has a very acrid chemical odor. It doesn&#x27;t get better if you wait a few minutes either. And, of course, once it&#x27;s been opened it can&#x27;t be returned. I will never buy a product from this company again. $17.95 down the drain!!</li>
            <li> Smells just like lilacs.  Feels creamy.  Absorbs nice.</li>
