            <li>It is a great value</li>
            <li>it was a great buy</li>
            <li>lol, cuz it flakes .....</li>

            <li>Great mascera at a great price..</li>
            <li>she likes it a lot thought it was a great mascara.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>the applicator is great.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product but</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll look great.</li>
            <li>The mascara is great.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!!</li>
            <li>friend says Sexy Curves by Rimmel London has been the best non-clumping mascara for her.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, but still like Great Lash better.</li>
            <li>Good mascara in a pinch and for the price</li>
            <li>and I can always depend on&lt;br /&gt;it to do a good job.</li>
            <li>but my daughter loved it and took it, so I had to get another.  </li>
            <li>price was good</li>
            <li>I wore Great Lash when I was a kid and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Always have loved this brand</li>
            <li>Maybelline makes some good mascara/brush combos, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li>This would not make a good clubbing or evening wear mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried on very many brands and types of mascara.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap using subscribe and save option!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, will purchase again.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re going to keep making so many of the items I want to purchase add-ons, I&#x27;ll buy them somewhere else, which I just did!  </li>
            <li>I love the brush!  </li>
            <li>But, I have to say I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>

            <li>I have been using Mabelline mascara for many years!  </li>
            <li>tried to switch to another mascara, but I&#x27;ll stick with this stuff for the Price and the amazing job it does on me</li>
            <li>Great Lash has been at the top of best lists as far as mascara goes for years.</li>
            <li>honestly, it clumped my lashes together</li>
            <li>For the price I liked this polish.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and goes on perfectly!</li>
            <li>The thing I did like, is that in my opinion this washed off very easily.</li>
            <li>This by far is the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>the best mascara by far.</li>
            <li>I love this product, plumps and lengthens lashes nicely</li>
            <li>And it washes off really easy with soap and water!</li>
            <li>I liked this mascara all right, but I loved it after I started using the Ardell lash and brow accelerator.  </li>
            <li>It washes off easily with warm soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite and easiest site for shopping.  </li>

            <li>Wohoo! :)</li>
            <li>Also, I have noticed on more than one occasion after I have been wearing this for a while</li>
            <li>and I really love using it.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the shape of the applicator,  </li>

            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This mascara is my favorite mascara, and I am so glad they sell it on Amazon Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>I needed something to bring my shopping cart up to free shipping - and I know maybelline mascara will always come in handy ....</li>
            <li>Best mascara ever for daily use!</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>is making sure every lash is coated and all lashes are separated.  </li>
            <li>Well, this review tells me I need five more words</li>
            <li>so now you have them and more.  </li>
            <li>This mascara has more fl.</li>
            <li>than most mascaras</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s our favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the brush on this mascara, it keeps the lashes separate.  </li>
            <li>To start, I absolutely LOVE the brush for this mascara.</li>
            <li>The tiny bristles are great for grabbing every lash!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the option of brushing mascara onto both the fuller part of my lashes as well as the thinner ones on my lower lids.  </li>
            <li>I have loved great lash since I was a teen, and I still do!</li>
            <li>I really love the brush&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li>It hurt my eyelids when I applied it and gave me a huge scare when it kind of touched my eyeball.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I will defiantly keep buying it for sure</li>
            <li>My all time favorite mascara</li>
            <li>The brush has so many clumps of mascara on it when you pull it out of the tube.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my lashes look.  </li>
            <li>but I put more than one layer on anyway.</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and I do love the fact it&#x27;s safe for contact users who may be concerned of product accidentally getting in eye.</li>
            <li>Maybelline seems to have discontinued my favorite mascara, so I thought I&#x27;d try Great Lash with this nifty new brush.  </li>
            <li>Good brand was one of the first products my mother bought me when I started to wear make up.</li>
            <li>Pretty good mascara.</li>
            <li>Easily one of the most clumpy mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily, it doesn&#x27;t flake, and has pretty good staying power throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I threw the applicator away and use an old great lash mascara applicator instead.</li>
            <li>The whole thing came in a good package with no issues.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smear under the eyes and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It holds up throughout the day and is easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li>I like this product,I like the brush because it makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>An easy, go-to mascara.</li>
            <li>It does flake off at the end of the day or if you&#x27;ve been rubbing your eyes, but it wipes off easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove using eye make up remover.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to wash off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The mascara was easy to remove with makeup remover, and didn&#x27;t run or flake during the day.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>It washes off easily but does not run during the day if I sweat.  </li>
            <li>I like the brush, applies easy</li>
            <li>it goes on fine and a couple coats is all I need to cover my lashes.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a cheap and easy choice for a daytime/workday mascara.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li>: I think the brush ends up being a huge problem.</li>
            <li>My point is I am reasonable in my expectations-volume and definition of my own lash length</li>
            <li>It is cheap for a reason.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap though....</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly without clumping.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and comes off with ease.</li>
            <li>I have short lashes, and this product has done a great job of bringing them out and making them appear longer.  </li>
            <li>Mascara goes on smoothly and does not clump.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>no clumping, bold lashes, classic color and good price.  </li>
            <li>It looks fine when on, nice, normal mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to spot in your make up arsenal due to the bright colors of the tube.</li>
            <li>I love mascara and love to try new kinds.</li>
            <li>Used great lash for a long time.</li>
            <li>Great product that I have used for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>It gives me significant length that I notice with one coat, and I need it.</li>
            <li>love it exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>I have purchased lots of different types of mascaras, this is my new favorite one!!!</li>
            <li>it is good for daily using</li>
            <li>Not as good as what I remember, brush is different.</li>
            <li>but it seems cool</li>
            <li>I might very well purchase this again, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than $4 on a tube.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but I prefer the skinny end rather than the cone shaped end like this one.</li>
            <li>The color did look very natural also it was very easy to correct any mistakes</li>
            <li>Great product, I&#x27;ve never used any other mascara but this one.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>The blush is perfect; the tiny bristles grab each last!</li>
            <li>It is a very good product I just don&#x27;t like the small brush.</li>
            <li>Looks good, doesn&#x27;t get globby, and lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li>Super easy to put on, dries fast and doesn&#x27;t break the bank, everything needed or wanted.</li>
            <li>Love the new brush style</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several tubes of the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; Great Lash mascara, but I wanted to try this one because I saw it has a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara by far, adds volume, length, and color.</li>
            <li>It always looks freshly applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is cheaper when you subscribe with Amazon Mom than if you buy the mascara at Walmart, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>Liked the shape of brush, it seemed to keep my lashes separated especially after applying one coat.</li>
            <li>I love the brush more than any other I&#x27;ve found, but I don&#x27;t care for the mascara itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Lash is a very washable mascara (I just use Dove unscented body wash) and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like some other mascaras</li>
            <li>super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I do not like this wand/applicator as much as the original.</li>
            <li>It separates and thickens at just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>Plus the price is right</li>
            <li>The quest for the right mascara continues...</li>
            <li>This goes on fine, looks nice, but towards the end of the day there is a flaky mess underneath my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have very long eyelashes, and one of the most important aspects for purchasing mascara for me</li>
            <li>I have used Maybelline Great Lash in the past and saw the price and decided to try it again.</li>
            <li>First I have to say this is probably the cheapest you can find mascara that is is any way worth buying.  </li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers, this mascara tends to flake and smudge easily, and I end up making sure that the flakes do not smear.  </li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth ordering and is fairly straightforward as far as mascaras go.</li>
            <li>It does flake a little after ten hours or so, but that&#x27;s great for cheap mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but who cares about the next day :)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Straight in the trash!  </li>
            <li>I find myself using a different mascara to create the volume, and then using this product to make sure the lashes are separated.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw the applicator for this mascara I was intrigued.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is just okay.</li>
            <li>My eyes are in so much pain!  </li>
            <li>I actually ended up like it more than I thought I would, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li>It only pumps and lengthens a bit, it mostly makes lashes darker.  </li>
            <li>Overall, for daytime wear this is a more than acceptable drugstore product.  </li>
            <li>I did want to say that at first I did not notice any flakes.  </li>
            <li>This is a classic, no fail mascara!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super affordable and lengthens my lashes more than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried, even pricey brands.</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara and it is such a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Lots of Lashes Washable Mascara is a good all-around mascara that I frequently find myself going back to over and over again.</li>
            <li>My long time favorite.  </li>
            <li>I try other brands but always end up back with Maybelline Great Lash</li>
            <li>It made my eyelash look full and professional.</li>
            <li>I liked that it made my lashes look really black and</li>
            <li>The applicator brush makes it easy to reach all lashes even the tiny ones at the corners of eyes.</li>
            <li>this mascara is not only VERY affordable, it also makes my eyelashes look longer and very bold.</li>
            <li>The brush in Lots of Lashes works well at grabbing smaller lashes so they can be darker too (naturally my lashes are very light brown and not visible).  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t clump if product it closed right.</li>
            <li>&amp; I just don&#x27;t like it as much as the covergirl LashBlast though.  </li>
            <li>Really irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>The combination really makes my eyelashes pop.  </li>
            <li>Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>Really like the applicator.</li>
            <li>The thin side is great for lower lashes.</li>
            <li>i have very sensative eyes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care much for</li>
            <li>Really flake...</li>
            <li>The applicator seems to grab too much mascara so that when you apply it, it just cakes your lashes together.</li>
            <li>Even wiping the tip with tissue to get off some excess product didn&#x27;t help, it was still just too much.</li>
            <li>Makes my eyelashes really pop.</li>
            <li>thanks dad)</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m ready to take a shower for the night</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the brush that much</li>
            <li>After spending at least 20 minutes choosing between mascaras, I picked this one after reading some good reviews.</li>
            <li>No clumping, but great dark and long lashes.</li>
            <li>so when i put this on you can see them and if you do 2 or 3 coats you have thick gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li>The daily mascara tends to leave a little black under my eyes by mid-day, but I&#x27;ve experienced this with most mascaras.</li>
            <li>it is true what everyone else said , next day be ready to really wash your face</li>
            <li>Love the small wand, useful for getting each and every lash.</li>
            <li>I will probably not be repurchasing Great Lash Lot of Lashes due to this flaking which I have neverhad with other drugstore mascaras I have used.</li>
            <li>The shape is perfect for getting the long lashes on the outside and small ones on the inside.  </li>
            <li>My sister asked for another tube after I bought her one we just live it!</li>
            <li>I like the brush and length of the wand AND love the pink tube, which is easy to find and grab even with buried under all my other makeup!  </li>
            <li>I can sincerely recommend this black mascara for day or evening wear.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you can&#x27;t beat a classic.</li>
            <li>I will probably use the rest of the product with a different applicator brush, but I most likely will not buy this again.</li>
            <li>I love to experiment with different cosmetics, and I&#x27;ve used tons of mascara in lots of different brands and formulas.</li>
            <li>So sad because it really has a great look.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this mascara to someone who wants long, defined lashes. :)</li>
            <li>I love this little brush.</li>
            <li>For that, you can always buy something a little bit better.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this mascara 4 stars because the shape of the brush makes it hard to evenly coat the lashes near the inner and outer sides of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great color and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>It does no flake or smear under normal circumstances.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this mascara to anyone who doesn&#x27;t apply many coats of mascara however, because as long as I only apply 1 or 2 coats of the mascara, my eyelashes are not crunchy.</li>
            <li>This mascara didn&#x27;t stay on for more than a few hours before ending up all over my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very black but looks great on dark eyes.</li>
            <li>I found a couple tube of my fav on ebay to hold me over till I can find a new mascara.</li>
            <li>So far no problems!</li>
            <li>I use a heavy amount of mascara and this product offers a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>This was fun to apply,It wasn&#x27;t a long time between drying and re-applying.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other mascaras, but always come back to Mabelline!</li>
            <li>The little bristles are great for getting those small \\&quot;corner of the eye\\&quot; lashes.</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend for a natural look or for those looking for a smaller wand for lower lashes only :)</li>
            <li>I love this product!It coats every single last hair,it creates the illusion that you have long,black,eyelashes,and I will DEFINITELY buy it again!</li>
            <li>Once I got them brushed out a little bit though end result was okay.</li>
            <li>This mascara applies okay, but the triangular brush shape is hard to work with</li>
            <li>so lush</li>
            <li>Lashes look natural instead of spidery after two applications.</li>
            <li>An old favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s only if I really start messing with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>When I opened this Maybelline tube, I laughed at the color and the weird shape of the brush</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes and bought it at my local store.</li>
            <li>The thin part makes it easy to really cover everything.</li>
            <li>It really defines and lengthens my eyelashes and makes them look really long!</li>
            <li>Because of how little the wand is, I am able to get into all the little corners of my eyes, completely eliminating the need for eyeliner!  </li>
            <li>The color is not as dark as L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Carbon Black (which is my favorite mascara color).  </li>
            <li>Gives you a natural look that you could layer for a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear mascara everyday usually only for special occasions</li>
            <li>The brush is great for thin, small lashed people.  </li>
            <li>Any time I wear it, after a week I can barely keep my contact lenses in through the end of the day, my eyes itch and burn, and eventually they feel scratched even when my lenses are out.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than those false lash mascaras out there</li>
            <li>Currently I was using NYC Showtime Volumizing mascara, a cheap mascara that somewhat clumped up, and I wanted to try something a little more expensive.</li>
            <li>It added no volume, very little length and was so wet that it was kind of clumpy like when you have wet eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Now I just get it every other month and throw out the old when the new one comes.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands off an on over the years but seriously, even the very expensive ones are not noticeably better than good old Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> lol, cuz it flakes .....</li>

            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!</li>
            <li> friend says Sexy Curves by Rimmel London has been the best non-clumping mascara for her.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but still like Great Lash better.</li>
            <li> Good mascara in a pinch and for the price</li>
            <li> and I can always depend on&lt;br /&gt;it to do a good job.</li>
            <li> but my daughter loved it and took it, so I had to get another.  </li>
            <li> price was good</li>
            <li> I wore Great Lash when I was a kid and liked it.  </li>
            <li> Always have loved this brand</li>
            <li> Maybelline makes some good mascara/brush combos, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> This would not make a good clubbing or evening wear mascara.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried on very many brands and types of mascara.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap using subscribe and save option!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re going to keep making so many of the items I want to purchase add-ons, I&#x27;ll buy them somewhere else, which I just did!  </li>
            <li> I love the brush!  </li>
            <li> But, I have to say I LOVE it!</li>

            <li> I have been using Mabelline mascara for many years!  </li>
            <li> tried to switch to another mascara, but I&#x27;ll stick with this stuff for the Price and the amazing job it does on me</li>
            <li> Great Lash has been at the top of best lists as far as mascara goes for years.</li>
            <li> honestly, it clumped my lashes together</li>
            <li> For the price I liked this polish.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced and goes on perfectly!</li>
            <li> The thing I did like, is that in my opinion this washed off very easily.</li>
            <li> This by far is the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> the best mascara by far.</li>
            <li> I love this product, plumps and lengthens lashes nicely</li>
            <li> And it washes off really easy with soap and water!</li>
            <li> I liked this mascara all right, but I loved it after I started using the Ardell lash and brow accelerator.  </li>
            <li> It washes off easily with warm soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and easiest site for shopping.  </li>

            <li> Wohoo! :)</li>
            <li> Also, I have noticed on more than one occasion after I have been wearing this for a while</li>
            <li> and I really love using it.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the shape of the applicator,  </li>
            <li> I have been using Maybelline mascara for as many years as they have made it I think.  </li>

            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is my favorite mascara, and I am so glad they sell it on Amazon Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> I needed something to bring my shopping cart up to free shipping - and I know maybelline mascara will always come in handy ....</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever for daily use!</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> is making sure every lash is coated and all lashes are separated.  </li>
            <li> Well, this review tells me I need five more words</li>
            <li> so now you have them and more.  </li>
            <li> This mascara has more fl.</li>
            <li> than most mascaras</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s our favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the brush on this mascara, it keeps the lashes separate.  </li>
            <li> To start, I absolutely LOVE the brush for this mascara.</li>
            <li> The tiny bristles are great for grabbing every lash!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the option of brushing mascara onto both the fuller part of my lashes as well as the thinner ones on my lower lids.  </li>
            <li> I have loved great lash since I was a teen, and I still do!</li>
            <li> I really love the brush&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> It hurt my eyelids when I applied it and gave me a huge scare when it kind of touched my eyeball.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I will defiantly keep buying it for sure</li>
            <li> My all time favorite mascara</li>
            <li> The brush has so many clumps of mascara on it when you pull it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my lashes look.  </li>
            <li> but I put more than one layer on anyway.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and I do love the fact it&#x27;s safe for contact users who may be concerned of product accidentally getting in eye.</li>
            <li> Maybelline seems to have discontinued my favorite mascara, so I thought I&#x27;d try Great Lash with this nifty new brush.  </li>
            <li> Good brand was one of the first products my mother bought me when I started to wear make up.</li>
            <li> Pretty good mascara.</li>
            <li> Easily one of the most clumpy mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily, it doesn&#x27;t flake, and has pretty good staying power throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I threw the applicator away and use an old great lash mascara applicator instead.</li>
            <li> The whole thing came in a good package with no issues.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear under the eyes and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> It holds up throughout the day and is easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li> I like this product,I like the brush because it makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> An easy, go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> It does flake off at the end of the day or if you&#x27;ve been rubbing your eyes, but it wipes off easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove using eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> I like how easy it is to wash off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The mascara was easy to remove with makeup remover, and didn&#x27;t run or flake during the day.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily.  </li>
            <li> It washes off easily but does not run during the day if I sweat.  </li>
            <li> I like the brush, applies easy</li>
            <li> it goes on fine and a couple coats is all I need to cover my lashes.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a cheap and easy choice for a daytime/workday mascara.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li> : I think the brush ends up being a huge problem.</li>
            <li> My point is I am reasonable in my expectations-volume and definition of my own lash length</li>
            <li> It is cheap for a reason.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap though....</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly without clumping.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and comes off with ease.</li>
            <li> I have short lashes, and this product has done a great job of bringing them out and making them appear longer.  </li>
            <li> Mascara goes on smoothly and does not clump.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> no clumping, bold lashes, classic color and good price.  </li>
            <li> It looks fine when on, nice, normal mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to spot in your make up arsenal due to the bright colors of the tube.</li>
            <li> I love mascara and love to try new kinds.</li>
            <li> Used great lash for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product that I have used for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> It gives me significant length that I notice with one coat, and I need it.</li>
            <li> love it exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> I have purchased lots of different types of mascaras, this is my new favorite one!!!</li>
            <li> it is good for daily using</li>
            <li> Not as good as what I remember, brush is different.</li>
            <li> but it seems cool</li>
            <li> I might very well purchase this again, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than $4 on a tube.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but I prefer the skinny end rather than the cone shaped end like this one.</li>
            <li> The color did look very natural also it was very easy to correct any mistakes</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve never used any other mascara but this one.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> The blush is perfect; the tiny bristles grab each last!</li>
            <li> It is a very good product I just don&#x27;t like the small brush.</li>
            <li> Looks good, doesn&#x27;t get globby, and lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Super easy to put on, dries fast and doesn&#x27;t break the bank, everything needed or wanted.</li>
            <li> Love the new brush style</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several tubes of the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; Great Lash mascara, but I wanted to try this one because I saw it has a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara by far, adds volume, length, and color.</li>
            <li> It always looks freshly applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is cheaper when you subscribe with Amazon Mom than if you buy the mascara at Walmart, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Liked the shape of brush, it seemed to keep my lashes separated especially after applying one coat.</li>
            <li> I love the brush more than any other I&#x27;ve found, but I don&#x27;t care for the mascara itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great Lash is a very washable mascara (I just use Dove unscented body wash) and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like some other mascaras</li>
            <li> super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I do not like this wand/applicator as much as the original.</li>
            <li> It separates and thickens at just the right amount.  </li>
            <li> Plus the price is right</li>
            <li> The quest for the right mascara continues...</li>
            <li> This goes on fine, looks nice, but towards the end of the day there is a flaky mess underneath my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have very long eyelashes, and one of the most important aspects for purchasing mascara for me</li>
            <li> I have used Maybelline Great Lash in the past and saw the price and decided to try it again.</li>
            <li> First I have to say this is probably the cheapest you can find mascara that is is any way worth buying.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers, this mascara tends to flake and smudge easily, and I end up making sure that the flakes do not smear.  </li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth ordering and is fairly straightforward as far as mascaras go.</li>
            <li> It does flake a little after ten hours or so, but that&#x27;s great for cheap mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but who cares about the next day :)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Straight in the trash!  </li>
            <li> I find myself using a different mascara to create the volume, and then using this product to make sure the lashes are separated.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw the applicator for this mascara I was intrigued.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is just okay.</li>
            <li> My eyes are in so much pain!  </li>
            <li> I actually ended up like it more than I thought I would, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> It only pumps and lengthens a bit, it mostly makes lashes darker.  </li>
            <li> Overall, for daytime wear this is a more than acceptable drugstore product.  </li>
            <li> I did want to say that at first I did not notice any flakes.  </li>
            <li> This is a classic, no fail mascara!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super affordable and lengthens my lashes more than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried, even pricey brands.</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara and it is such a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Lots of Lashes Washable Mascara is a good all-around mascara that I frequently find myself going back to over and over again.</li>
            <li> My long time favorite.  </li>
            <li> I try other brands but always end up back with Maybelline Great Lash</li>
            <li> It made my eyelash look full and professional.</li>
            <li> I liked that it made my lashes look really black and</li>
            <li> The applicator brush makes it easy to reach all lashes even the tiny ones at the corners of eyes.</li>
            <li> this mascara is not only VERY affordable, it also makes my eyelashes look longer and very bold.</li>
            <li> The brush in Lots of Lashes works well at grabbing smaller lashes so they can be darker too (naturally my lashes are very light brown and not visible).  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t clump if product it closed right.</li>
            <li> &amp; I just don&#x27;t like it as much as the covergirl LashBlast though.  </li>
            <li> Really irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> The combination really makes my eyelashes pop.  </li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Really like the applicator.</li>
            <li> The thin side is great for lower lashes.</li>
            <li> i have very sensative eyes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much for</li>
            <li> Really flake...</li>
            <li> The applicator seems to grab too much mascara so that when you apply it, it just cakes your lashes together.</li>
            <li> Even wiping the tip with tissue to get off some excess product didn&#x27;t help, it was still just too much.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes really pop.</li>
            <li> thanks dad)</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m ready to take a shower for the night</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the brush that much</li>
            <li> After spending at least 20 minutes choosing between mascaras, I picked this one after reading some good reviews.</li>
            <li> No clumping, but great dark and long lashes.</li>
            <li> so when i put this on you can see them and if you do 2 or 3 coats you have thick gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li> The daily mascara tends to leave a little black under my eyes by mid-day, but I&#x27;ve experienced this with most mascaras.</li>
            <li> it is true what everyone else said , next day be ready to really wash your face</li>
            <li> Love the small wand, useful for getting each and every lash.</li>
            <li> I will probably not be repurchasing Great Lash Lot of Lashes due to this flaking which I have neverhad with other drugstore mascaras I have used.</li>
            <li> The shape is perfect for getting the long lashes on the outside and small ones on the inside.  </li>
            <li> My sister asked for another tube after I bought her one we just live it!</li>
            <li> I like the brush and length of the wand AND love the pink tube, which is easy to find and grab even with buried under all my other makeup!  </li>
            <li> I can sincerely recommend this black mascara for day or evening wear.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you can&#x27;t beat a classic.</li>
            <li> I will probably use the rest of the product with a different applicator brush, but I most likely will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love to experiment with different cosmetics, and I&#x27;ve used tons of mascara in lots of different brands and formulas.</li>
            <li> So sad because it really has a great look.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this mascara to someone who wants long, defined lashes. :)</li>
            <li> I love this little brush.</li>
            <li> For that, you can always buy something a little bit better.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this mascara 4 stars because the shape of the brush makes it hard to evenly coat the lashes near the inner and outer sides of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great color and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> It does no flake or smear under normal circumstances.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this mascara to anyone who doesn&#x27;t apply many coats of mascara however, because as long as I only apply 1 or 2 coats of the mascara, my eyelashes are not crunchy.</li>
            <li> This mascara didn&#x27;t stay on for more than a few hours before ending up all over my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very black but looks great on dark eyes.</li>
            <li> I found a couple tube of my fav on ebay to hold me over till I can find a new mascara.</li>
            <li> So far no problems!</li>
            <li> I use a heavy amount of mascara and this product offers a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> This was fun to apply,It wasn&#x27;t a long time between drying and re-applying.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other mascaras, but always come back to Mabelline!</li>
            <li> The little bristles are great for getting those small \\&quot;corner of the eye\\&quot; lashes.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend for a natural look or for those looking for a smaller wand for lower lashes only :)</li>
            <li> I love this product!It coats every single last hair,it creates the illusion that you have long,black,eyelashes,and I will DEFINITELY buy it again!</li>
            <li> Once I got them brushed out a little bit though end result was okay.</li>
            <li> This mascara applies okay, but the triangular brush shape is hard to work with</li>
            <li> so lush</li>
            <li> Lashes look natural instead of spidery after two applications.</li>
            <li> An old favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only if I really start messing with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> When I opened this Maybelline tube, I laughed at the color and the weird shape of the brush</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and bought it at my local store.</li>
            <li> The thin part makes it easy to really cover everything.</li>
            <li> It really defines and lengthens my eyelashes and makes them look really long!</li>
            <li> Because of how little the wand is, I am able to get into all the little corners of my eyes, completely eliminating the need for eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> The color is not as dark as L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Carbon Black (which is my favorite mascara color).  </li>
            <li> Gives you a natural look that you could layer for a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara everyday usually only for special occasions</li>
            <li> The brush is great for thin, small lashed people.  </li>
            <li> Any time I wear it, after a week I can barely keep my contact lenses in through the end of the day, my eyes itch and burn, and eventually they feel scratched even when my lenses are out.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than those false lash mascaras out there</li>
            <li> Currently I was using NYC Showtime Volumizing mascara, a cheap mascara that somewhat clumped up, and I wanted to try something a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> It added no volume, very little length and was so wet that it was kind of clumpy like when you have wet eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Now I just get it every other month and throw out the old when the new one comes.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands off an on over the years but seriously, even the very expensive ones are not noticeably better than good old Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Lots of Lashes Washable Mascara, Blackest Black,</li>
            <li> I had hoped that it would apply smoothly and evenly since it is made of a rubbery type material and had all those tiny little delicate barbs.</li>
            <li> It isnt waterproof but it doesnt smude all over your lids, and is fluid enough to cover every single lash and make them look longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It last a long time and gives your lashes definition.</li>
            <li> because the entrance of the tube is wide enough for the thickest part of the brush, it&#x27;s took big for the rest of the brush, so it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;rake&amp;#34; the excess mascara off the middle and end.</li>
            <li> No major problems.</li>
            <li> It only causes clumps when the tube begins to dry out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the heavy leftover residue that most mascaras leave behind that makes you look like a rabid raccoon.</li>
            <li> and it adds fullness to the center lashes-which makes eyes look larger.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason, these have been selling for so long</li>
            <li> I get long and voluminous lashes.</li>
            <li> Tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This does not clump, flake, and it is long wearing so all in all</li>
            <li> My lashes aren&#x27;t long at all, and it gives me the \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; I need in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I mean, come on, I saw a photo of a known model for a very well known brand without her mascara&#x27;ed lashes</li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time!  </li>
            <li> I will admit I only tried it once, but it was so wet!  </li>
            <li> I have switched to other brands on promises of longer/fuller etc - but always come back to this.</li>
            <li> I always try other ones, then keep coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I like it for my bottom lashes because it grabs every single one.</li>
            <li> But this also makes me think if you get caught in the rain or shed a single tear</li>
            <li> Well, price evidently means nothing because this mascara is worse than NYC&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I have had to live with those icky brushes that always makes me smear my mascara.  </li>
            <li> I found it more difficult to get all the lashes covered with the small tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But after switching brands, I realize my eye allergies due to contact lenses were actually eye irritations due to THIS MASCARA.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really the fault of the really dumb brush design.</li>
            <li> The wand has a tight lid so that the extra mascara comes off in the lid, not on the wand or your eyelash, therefore making clumping on the wand and eyelash a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw Maybelline&#x27;s Lots of Lashes while shopping at Target and was instantly drawn to the little wand that came with it.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that it flakes a little</li>
            <li> and it looks great, but the flaking is awful!</li>
            <li> it is harder to work with than expected.</li>
            <li> It makes it harder</li>
            <li> I would recommend this mascara to budget focused people who want a mascara that actually isn&#x27;t all dried out.  </li>
            <li> I bought this b/c I thought it was the regular green and pink Maybelline mascara</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes very long and dark.</li>
            <li> One end of the brush is very small while the opposite end is big making a sharp angle.</li>
            <li> i also  find the mascara clumpier and harder to work with than my million years of working with other maybelline products.</li>
            <li> But just be careful buying it, it&#x27;s very very wet.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing other brands of mascara and price I pay</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to clump up as other brands sometimes do.</li>
            <li> I use this under my 3d mascara and I won&#x27;t use any other mascara under it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t purchase the waterproof style and at the end of the day with other brands,  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the difference between this mascara and their other products.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smear under my eyes as other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried have done.</li>
            <li> It coats evenly, and it&#x27;s small enough that I don&#x27;t get it all over my eye.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I am not sure if this is due to the product itself, or the massive combing I had to give my lashes.</li>
            <li> Of course I didn&#x27;t have this product long since it dried out almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I know the idea is that you can use the small end to get the tiny lashes in the corners of your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It clumps worse than any other mascara brush I&#x27;ve ever used, no matter how little or how much I use.</li>
            <li> Which, btw, is just stupid because so much mascara gets onto the first half of the brush due to the shorter bristles that it just smears all over your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It is NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as I had hoped</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m in love with this mascara for the distinction and separation my lashes receive, even if I use another mascara as a base.</li>
            <li> love this brand, but I hate this wand style.</li>
            <li> I think one coat is enough, since it does go on thick (NOT clumpy) Volume is non existent</li>
            <li> why I down graded it from a 4 star review to a 3 star review.  </li>
            <li> And this is the other!</li>
            <li> This mascara irritates my eyes by the end of the day, which isn&#x27;t a problem I typically have with mascara.</li>
            <li> At least not if you have thin lashes that are typically straight.</li>
            <li> This was a huge disappointment!  </li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment!  </li>
            <li> Never clump or made a mess.</li>
            <li> no need to reapply in the evening, creates long thick lashes, no clumping no smears.</li>
            <li> My lashes looked thick and really long.</li>
            <li> This tends to flake a little &amp; smudge some.  </li>
            <li> you want to use and make a thousand little strokes with that end to get coverage.</li>
            <li> and once it dries up it starts to like flake into little dots, got in my eye.</li>
            <li> it gets all the little lashes with ease.</li>
            <li> Found it to be a little clumpy</li>
            <li> : The mascara is very dark and thickens each lash, and maybe lengthens them a bit.</li>
            <li> I like using drugstore makeup and when it comes to mascara, I like somthing that doesnt feel heavy on my lashes or leaving clumps on them.</li>
            <li> I find that Maybellline has inexpensive quality mascarsas for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> But after a few hours, it starts to flake off.</li>
            <li> I use this mascara everyday and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was born with unfortunately short thin eyelashes (</li>
            <li> She loves and uses it faithful everyday.</li>
            <li> The formula is a wetter one, which works well with my thin, short lashes.  </li>
            <li> I knew wet formulas could be bad for my lashes, BUT I have used others with a decent result</li>
            <li> I find it a little hard to use.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little too thick.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this brand and type because it works just as well if not better</li>
            <li> so I never waisted money on those expensive mascaras with big claims.</li>
            <li> I usually get...</li>
            <li> I apply it at 7:30am and it is now past 5:00pm</li>
            <li> However I did not like how crunchy my lashes got after it dried!</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> At least, that is what I think.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick tip: Apply a thin layer of castor oil on lashes a few times a  week.</li>
            <li> The formula goes on thick and goopy and pulls all the lashes together because of the itty bitty bristles on the brush.</li>
            <li> It works well on my lashes though mine are thick.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to apply this mascara without clumping, compared to other brush styles.</li>
            <li> All the &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fancier&amp;#34; mascaras have crazy wands that are long or curled or think.</li>
            <li> There is a ridiculous amount of flaking.</li>
            <li> Not good, do not buy this mascara.</li>
            <li> Not a good design at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous Carbon Black in washable I was disappointed in the Blackest Black color.  </li>
            <li> I am used to using the types of mascara that have  a ball type tip on the end, but those are usually quite expensive.</li>
            <li> It is also very hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> My lashes literally feel so crunchy after using it which is really frustrating.</li>
            <li> Thin lashes take caution.</li>
            <li> But alas, I have yet to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t flake AT ALL.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush it a bit poor though.  </li>
            <li> I was HORRIBLE at throwing out old mascara in time!</li>
            <li> The prickly plastic makes this product dangerous and I think it could cause serious eye damage.</li>
            <li> and I am getting it with this mascara,without paying for expensive packaging and marketing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of mascaras from both expensive department stores and inexpensive drug stores.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The bottle and cap are, in my opinion, a very juvenile and ugly color combination.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about this mascara.</li>
            <li> The brush is small and terribly angled.</li>
            <li> everyone always asks if my lashes are fake and they are not!</li>
            <li> (wrong company, but whatever!)</li>
            <li> so well it makes you look like you have false eyelashes on!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that bad a lot of times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use the wand or just got a bad tube.</li>
            <li> to the bad, This stuff probably has about 8 hours staying power before it starts to flake...badly.</li>
            <li> flakes badly soon after you put it on, 3-4 hours and its all over my face.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t flake too bad.  </li>
            <li> I HATE the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is terrible.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever</li>
            <li> it was awful.</li>
            <li> I had always assumed I couldn&#x27;t wear contacts (one time a doctor told me I had horrible allergies that caused bumps on the inside of my lids, so he wouldn&#x27;t even prescribe me contacts!)  </li>

            <li> I cancelled my subscription. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I do not like this wand/applicator as much as the original. It goes on a little too thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried on very many brands and types of mascara.  This is the one I constantly have in my make up bag.  I just keep coming back to it.  It separates and thickens at just the right amount.  And for the price, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I was using Lancome Hypnose at $28 every month or so.  While Hypnose was great and made my eyes look &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34;---noticeable enough even for my husband, I found it getting clumpy.  I saw Maybelline&#x27;s Lots of Lashes while shopping at Target and was instantly drawn to the little wand that came with it.  I have not strayed from this mascara since.  Because of how little the wand is, I am able to get into all the little corners of my eyes, completely eliminating the need for eyeliner!  Great product.  Lasts a really long time!  Gives you a natural look that you could layer for a more dramatic look.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the Great Lash line. I found the wand/brush to not amplify my lashes the way that others do. Great Lash has been at the top of best lists as far as mascara goes for years. I decided that I would try it again since I had a coupon. I saw the Lots of Lashes type in the store and bought it. I just tried it and was amazed at how well it increased the size and volume of my lashes. I am used to using the types of mascara that have  a ball type tip on the end, but those are usually quite expensive. I will continue to purchase this brand and type because it works just as well if not better and I only paid $3.00 with my coupon.</li>
            <li> Come on, Amazon.  This is my favorite and easiest site for shopping.  But if you&#x27;re going to keep making so many of the items I want to purchase add-ons, I&#x27;ll buy them somewhere else, which I just did!  Not a fan of the add-ons! Please take this to heart!  I can&#x27;t be the only one who feels this way. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love the new brush style</li>
            <li> I love this product!It coats every single last hair,it creates the illusion that you have long,black,eyelashes,and I will DEFINITELY buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara glad i tried it. Love how my eyelashes look wearing it</li>
            <li> no clumping, bold lashes, classic color and good price.  This product is definitely worth ordering and is fairly straightforward as far as mascaras go.</li>
            <li> I like using drugstore makeup and when it comes to mascara, I like somthing that doesnt feel heavy on my lashes or leaving clumps on them. thats why I loe this mascara. It isnt waterproof but it doesnt smude all over your lids, and is fluid enough to cover every single lash and make them look longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to switch to another mascara, but I&#x27;ll stick with this stuff for the Price and the amazing job it does on me</li>
            <li> I love the brush!  The mascara has good coverage and the brush is the best shape Ive ever used.</li>
            <li> One coat does not quite do it, but two coats is great, no irritation, stays on great</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I bought it for a great price.</li>
            <li> I adore this mascara, but I didn&#x27;t rate it a five for one reason.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on even when I use my makeup remover, and causes my lashes to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very good for a night on the town.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara. The best thing about it is the brush itself. The shape allows me to get the tiny lashes and have a nonclumpy finish. Doesn&#x27;t smear under the eyes and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I always thought the commercials for longer lashes were bogus so I never waisted money on those expensive mascaras with big claims. I bought this b/c I thought it was the regular green and pink Maybelline mascara I usually get... didn&#x27;t notice the different brush. But, I have to say I LOVE it! I had always thought I had short lashes before but these actually make them appear longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline Mascara for ages and I love the way this looks for the price. No clumpy lashes with this and it says on all day without flaking off.</li>
            <li> Best drugstore mascara! Love the small wand, useful for getting each and every lash.</li>
            <li> I rolled my eyes and said, \\&quot;What the heck, for this price, why not...\\&quot; I have been wearing other brands of mascara and price I pay does not always equal \\&quot;latissed looking eyelashes\\&quot; and I have had to live with those icky brushes that always makes me smear my mascara.  When I opened this Maybelline tube, I laughed at the color and the weird shape of the brush but as I started to use it, I loved it! This is the bestEST best brush ever!  It gets to the corner of my eyelids without smearing the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the mascara itself. I apply it at 7:30am and it is now past 5:00pm and I still look put together. It adds volume to my eyelashes and let us face it, those models in magazines are not only wearing mascara, they have extensions with mascara...I mean, come on, I saw a photo of a known model for a very well known brand without her mascara&#x27;ed lashes so lush it looks like they planted the Amazon on her eyes. My point is I am reasonable in my expectations-volume and definition of my own lash length and I am getting it with this mascara,without paying for expensive packaging and marketing. And amongst the choices out there, this is now going to be my mascara of choice. Wohoo! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but still like Great Lash better.</li>
            <li> it is good for daily using</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived quickly.  As advertised.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Used great lash for a long time. Reliably great product.</li>
            <li> Tried this on a whim &amp; I just don&#x27;t like it as much as the covergirl LashBlast though.  This tends to flake a little &amp; smudge some.  It&#x27;s just Eh.</li>
            <li> I have used Maybelline Great Lash in the past and saw the price and decided to try it again. I HATE the brush. It is not like what is pictured. The brush is small and terribly angled. One end of the brush is very small while the opposite end is big making a sharp angle. It is hard to apply. You have to decide which end you want to use and make a thousand little strokes with that end to get coverage. I will not be purchasing again because of the brush. Also, I have noticed on more than one occasion after I have been wearing this for a while it makes my eyes water. I work 12.5 hour shifts and by the end of my shift I couldn&#x27;t wait to take it off. This may just be me, but I had to stop using this after only two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on for years.  It holds up throughout the day and is easy to remove at night. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clump up as other brands sometimes do.</li>
            <li> This is great mascara and I really love using it. The blush is perfect; the tiny bristles grab each last! I don&#x27;t wear mascara everyday usually only for special occasions so this one is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I use this under my 3d mascara and I won&#x27;t use any other mascara under it. Simply because of the wand. The wand is perfect! I can get every lash with it without getting it anywhere else. Super easy to put on, dries fast and doesn&#x27;t break the bank, everything needed or wanted.</li>
            <li> The brush is terrible. It clumps worse than any other mascara brush I&#x27;ve ever used, no matter how little or how much I use.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite honestly, it clumped my lashes together and once it dries up it starts to like flake into little dots, got in my eye. Really irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara by far, adds volume, length, and color. Plus the price is right</li>
            <li> A bit of flaking throughout the day...</li>
            <li> I liked this mascara all right, but I loved it after I started using the Ardell lash and brow accelerator.  The combination really makes my eyelashes pop.  I like the brush shape because I can get the corner lashes and it adds fullness to the center lashes-which makes eyes look larger.</li>
            <li> I like this product,I like the brush because it makes it easy to use. I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Maybelline makes a great eyelash product.  I would definitely recommend to others.  Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This by far is the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have purchased lots of different types of mascaras, this is my new favorite one!!! it works so well it makes you look like you have false eyelashes on!!</li>
            <li> Not good, do not buy this mascara. It is cheap for a reason.  My lashes clumped together and this mascara flakes off.</li>
            <li> This mascara made my eyelashes look like spider legs. I like it for my bottom lashes because it grabs every single one.</li>
            <li> I was HORRIBLE at throwing out old mascara in time! Now I just get it every other month and throw out the old when the new one comes. Great product that I have used for as long as I can remember. Sometimes you can&#x27;t beat a classic.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite mascara!  I love the shape of the applicator,  it gets all the little lashes with ease. I like the rectangle shape rather than cylinder so that it does not roll off my bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t purchase the waterproof style and at the end of the day with other brands,  i have racoon eyes, not with my great lash mascara.  It always looks freshly applied.&lt;br /&gt;My fave! !</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes very long and dark. Really like the applicator.</li>
            <li> Not as good as what I remember, brush is different. Good mascara in a pinch and for the price</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of mascaras and always come back to&lt;br /&gt;maybelline.  It is a great value and I can always depend on&lt;br /&gt;it to do a good job.</li>
            <li> it was a great buy it is true what everyone else said , next day be ready to really wash your face lol, cuz it flakes ..... but who cares about the next day :)</li>
            <li> Best drugstore mascara!</li>
            <li> This is a classic, no fail mascara! There&#x27;s a reason, these have been selling for so long and it&#x27;s because the formula is great and even compatible to mascaras that are 6 times the cost of this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Maybelline mascara for as many years as they have made it I think.  I have tried other brands off an on over the years but seriously, even the very expensive ones are not noticeably better than good old Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it washes off with soap and water. It does no flake or smear under normal circumstances.  I like the brush and length of the wand AND love the pink tube, which is easy to find and grab even with buried under all my other makeup!  I need a phone that color. ;)</li>
            <li> I do not like the triangularly shaped bruch. it is harder to work with than expected. i also  find the mascara clumpier and harder to work with than my million years of working with other maybelline products. will not reorder</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the difference between this mascara and their other products. I tried keeping an open mind, but blah! It is cheap though....okay for work I guess.</li>
            <li> the best mascara by far. love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The thin side is great for lower lashes. The whole thing came in a good package with no issues. It&#x27;s very black but looks great on dark eyes. So far no problems!</li>
            <li> Great mascera at a great price.. no need to reapply in the evening, creates long thick lashes, no clumping no smears.</li>
            <li> I got this for myself but my daughter loved it and took it, so I had to get another.  And this is the other!</li>
            <li> price was good I got it in 3days!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product, I&#x27;ve never used any other mascara but this one. I get long and voluminous lashes. I just love it!</li>
            <li> Good brand was one of the first products my mother bought me when I started to wear make up. Goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t clump if product it closed right. Bought for my friends daughter she likes it a lot thought it was a great mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is my favorite mascara, and I am so glad they sell it on Amazon Subscribe and Save. It is cheaper when you subscribe with Amazon Mom than if you buy the mascara at Walmart, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I needed something to bring my shopping cart up to free shipping - and I know maybelline mascara will always come in handy ....</li>
            <li> An easy, go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about this mascara. It&#x27;s super affordable and lengthens my lashes more than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried, even pricey brands. It only causes clumps when the tube begins to dry out. It does flake off at the end of the day or if you&#x27;ve been rubbing your eyes, but it wipes off easily.</li>
            <li> Enhance the eye lashes ,stay all day and no irritation.Easy to remove using eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever for daily use!</li>
            <li> Very cheap using subscribe and save option! I love this. Goes on smoothly without clumping. Tube lasts a long time. The daily mascara tends to leave a little black under my eyes by mid-day, but I&#x27;ve experienced this with most mascaras. I just wipe under my eyes once daily and it seems to solve the issue.</li>
            <li> This was a huge disappointment!  I wore Great Lash when I was a kid and liked it.  Maybelline seems to have discontinued my favorite mascara, so I thought I&#x27;d try Great Lash with this nifty new brush.  What a huge disappointment!  I will admit I only tried it once, but it was so wet!  It added no volume, very little length and was so wet that it was kind of clumpy like when you have wet eyelashes.  Straight in the trash!  I found a couple tube of my fav on ebay to hold me over till I can find a new mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of mascaras from both expensive department stores and inexpensive drug stores. I find that Maybellline has inexpensive quality mascarsas for everyday wear. I like this specific mascara since it doesn&#x27;t clump my lashes together and helps to fan them out.</li>
            <li> Always have loved this brand</li>
            <li> I really love this! It adds lots of vulume and I have not noticed any clumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this mascara 4 stars because the shape of the brush makes it hard to evenly coat the lashes near the inner and outer sides of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great color and doesn&#x27;t clump. I like how easy it is to wash off at the end of the day. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smear under my eyes as other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried have done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure of how to use this lol I&#x27;m in my experimenting stage but it seems cool</li>
            <li> my lashes looks soooo taaaalll !!!&amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;i even skipped my eyeliner for days&lt;br /&gt;doesnt leave blackness under my eyes like the yellow one from maybeline</li>
            <li> This goes on fine, looks nice, but towards the end of the day there is a flaky mess underneath my eyes.  Stick with the standard formula!</li>
            <li> Found it to be a little clumpy</li>
            <li> Using this mascara was an adjustment. I forgot how short the wand was when I ordered this. All the &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fancier&amp;#34; mascaras have crazy wands that are long or curled or think. This one is really short. I dont have any problems with the mascara itself though. Stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t flake. I miss having a longer brush, but this gets the job done at a fraction of the cost of what I was paying. I&#x27;d likely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Pretty good mascara. No major problems.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping! great price too!!</li>
            <li> I have very long eyelashes, and one of the most important aspects for purchasing mascara for me is making sure every lash is coated and all lashes are separated.  With the heart-shaped design of the wand, it does just that.  The corners of my eyes look expanded, and each lash is evenly coated.  The wand has a tight lid so that the extra mascara comes off in the lid, not on the wand or your eyelash, therefore making clumping on the wand and eyelash a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, while this mascara does wonders for separation and distinction, it does nothing for volume or lengthening of the eyelashes.  I find myself using a different mascara to create the volume, and then using this product to make sure the lashes are separated.  I agree with other reviewers, this mascara tends to flake and smudge easily, and I end up making sure that the flakes do not smear.  Yet, if you combine this product with another mascara, the flakes issue disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m in love with this mascara for the distinction and separation my lashes receive, even if I use another mascara as a base.</li>
            <li> Yuk!  This is the worst mascara I have ever procured.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
            <li> One of the best mascaras around! Great for lengthening! Lashes look natural instead of spidery after two applications. An old favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick tip: Apply a thin layer of castor oil on lashes a few times a  week. Your lashes will grow, become stronger and thicker. No need for falsies.</li>
            <li> This mascara irritates my eyes by the end of the day, which isn&#x27;t a problem I typically have with mascara. I&#x27;m not a fan of the brush. It&#x27;s not bad, but I prefer the skinny end rather than the cone shaped end like this one. It looks fine when on, nice, normal mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! The brush is great and the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump at all! The only thing is that it flakes a little but it&#x27;s only if I really start messing with my eyelashes. It really defines and lengthens my eyelashes and makes them look really long! And it washes off really easy with soap and water! I would definitely recommend this mascara to someone who wants long, defined lashes. :)</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!! Never flakes and the applicator is great.  I will definitely buy it again!!! Well, this review tells me I need five more words so now you have them and more.  Ha</li>
            <li> i have very sensative eyes and this mascara is the only one i will use! also my eyelashes are blonde so when i put this on you can see them and if you do 2 or 3 coats you have thick gorgeous lashes. everyone always asks if my lashes are fake and they are not!</li>
            <li> For the price I liked this polish. I liked that it made my lashes look really black and the brush got all of my lashes. However I did not like how crunchy my lashes got after it dried! My lashes literally feel so crunchy after using it which is really frustrating. The mascara was easy to remove with makeup remover, and didn&#x27;t run or flake during the day. I would recommend this mascara to anyone who doesn&#x27;t apply many coats of mascara however, because as long as I only apply 1 or 2 coats of the mascara, my eyelashes are not crunchy.</li>
            <li> This mascara has more fl. Oz. than most mascaras and my sister loves it too. It&#x27;s our favorite. I&#x27;m a mascara junkie and this bottle and brush rock! My sister asked for another tube after I bought her one we just live it! A couple coats and it&#x27;s better than those false lash mascaras out there</li>
            <li> I love the brush on this mascara, it keeps the lashes separate.  it does not clump like the last mascara I bought.</li>
            <li> I chose the two star rating because the mascara made my eyes water all the time (sensitivity) and the mascara clumped up; in addition, I didn&#x27;t care for the design of the brush.  I found it more difficult to get all the lashes covered with the small tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I use a heavy amount of mascara and this product offers a more natural look.  This does not clump, flake, and it is long wearing so all in all it&#x27;s a great product but not quite what I was looking for.  I now use it on my lower lashes and went back to my lash blast for the rest. Definitely would recommend for a natural look or for those looking for a smaller wand for lower lashes only :)</li>
            <li> There is a ridiculous amount of flaking. This mascara didn&#x27;t stay on for more than a few hours before ending up all over my cheeks. It was embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Great price for awesome mascara. Looks good, doesn&#x27;t get globby, and lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Great buy!! So happy I bought this!!</li>
            <li> To start, I absolutely LOVE the brush for this mascara. The tiny bristles are great for grabbing every lash! It coats evenly, and it&#x27;s small enough that I don&#x27;t get it all over my eye.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t care much for is the mascara itself... it goes on fine and a couple coats is all I need to cover my lashes. But after a few hours, it starts to flake off. Really flake... you can even see flakes of mascara under my eyes. It&#x27;s that bad a lot of times. The color is perfect, but the quality- not so great.&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I have a love/hate relationship with this mascara. I love the brush more than any other I&#x27;ve found, but I don&#x27;t care for the mascara itself.&lt;br /&gt;So I think I am going to keep the brush, and maybe use it with another mascara.</li>
            <li> I never knew when it was time to replace my mascara... now I just do it when the product arrives every two months!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. Goes on smooth and comes off with ease. Love it. would recommend to anyone on the go</li>
            <li> I love the option of brushing mascara onto both the fuller part of my lashes as well as the thinner ones on my lower lids.  Maybelline can always be counted on to bring us terrific products!</li>
            <li> My long time favorite.  I use this mascara everyday and will continue to use it.  Goes on nicely. Washes off easily.  &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have loved great lash since I was a teen, and I still do! Will always leave a 5 * review for Mabelline!</li>
            <li> When I first saw the applicator for this mascara I was intrigued. I had hoped that it would apply smoothly and evenly since it is made of a rubbery type material and had all those tiny little delicate barbs. This was not the case for me. The applicator seems to grab too much mascara so that when you apply it, it just cakes your lashes together. Even wiping the tip with tissue to get off some excess product didn&#x27;t help, it was still just too much. I had to use a lash comb to de clump my eyelashes....it was awful. Once I got them brushed out a little bit though end result was okay. My lashes looked thick and really long. However, I am not sure if this is due to the product itself, or the massive combing I had to give my lashes. The thing I did like, is that in my opinion this washed off very easily. I didn&#x27;t have the heavy leftover residue that most mascaras leave behind that makes you look like a rabid raccoon. But this also makes me think if you get caught in the rain or shed a single tear this stuff would be all over your face. Overall I think this is just okay. I will probably use the rest of the product with a different applicator brush, but I most likely will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have used this on and off for YEARS - I have switched to other brands on promises of longer/fuller etc - but always come back to this. It is a winner!</li>
            <li> This mascara applies okay, but the triangular brush shape is hard to work with and I&#x27;ve hit my eyeball a couple of times. It is also very hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I really love the brush&#x27;s shape. The thin part makes it easy to really cover everything. Makes my eyelashes really pop. The only problem I have with this mascara is that it does get very flaky after just a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li> I like the product, I just do not like the brush! It makes it harder and it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Makes me lashes look beautiful im hlad i bought iy</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the reviews and seeing how wonderful it was. I had high hopes and bought it at my local store. It is NOT worth it. At least not if you have thin lashes that are typically straight. I knew wet formulas could be bad for my lashes, BUT I have used others with a decent result so I gave this a shot. This made my lashes look like one giant lash, and like I painted IT ON WITH A PAINT BRUSH.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use the wand or just got a bad tube. But just be careful buying it, it&#x27;s very very wet. Thin lashes take caution.</li>
            <li> Very good.  I like the Maybelline NY Lots of Lashes mascara.  The mascara wears well and remains on throughout the day.  I have short lashes, and this product has done a great job of bringing them out and making them appear longer.  Very satisfied, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This applicator is plastic. It hurt my eyelids when I applied it and gave me a huge scare when it kind of touched my eyeball. The prickly plastic makes this product dangerous and I think it could cause serious eye damage. I threw the applicator away and use an old great lash mascara applicator instead. Of course I didn&#x27;t have this product long since it dried out almost immediately.</li>
            <li> love this brand, but I hate this wand style. doesn&#x27;t go onto lashes evenly.</li>
            <li> After spending at least 20 minutes choosing between mascaras, I picked this one after reading some good reviews. Currently I was using NYC Showtime Volumizing mascara, a cheap mascara that somewhat clumped up, and I wanted to try something a little more expensive. Well, price evidently means nothing because this mascara is worse than NYC&#x27;s. The formula goes on thick and goopy and pulls all the lashes together because of the itty bitty bristles on the brush. Which, btw, is just stupid because so much mascara gets onto the first half of the brush due to the shorter bristles that it just smears all over your eyelashes. Not a good design at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend says Sexy Curves by Rimmel London has been the best non-clumping mascara for her. I might try it out.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best I have ever used. The applicator brush makes it easy to reach all lashes even the tiny ones at the corners of eyes. Mascara goes on smoothly and does not clump. Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This is my newest staple. This was fun to apply,It wasn&#x27;t a long time between drying and re-applying. Never clump or made a mess. It made my eyelash look full and professional. The color did look very natural also it was very easy to correct any mistakes</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It works well on my lashes though mine are thick. I have experimented a bit and I think that you can brush your lashes different ways to get different looks. At least, that is what I think. Great mascara and a good buy!!</li>
            <li> this mascara is not only VERY affordable, it also makes my eyelashes look longer and very bold. I was born with unfortunately short thin eyelashes (thanks dad) but this mascara is the best one yet made by mabelline.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush. It&#x27;s flexible and doesn&#x27;t ever clump when I pull it out the tube. The little bristles are great for getting those small \\&quot;corner of the eye\\&quot; lashes. It gives me significant length that I notice with one coat, and I need it. My lashes aren&#x27;t long at all, and it gives me the \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; I need in my lashes. I think one coat is enough, since it does go on thick (NOT clumpy) Volume is non existent, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what this mascara&#x27;s claim to fame is. It&#x27;s very easy to spot in your make up arsenal due to the bright colors of the tube. And it&#x27;s a cheap and easy choice for a daytime/workday mascara. It washes off easily with warm soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the bad, This stuff probably has about 8 hours staying power before it starts to flake...badly. By the time I&#x27;m ready to take a shower for the night this stuff is all over my bottom lids. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for that nuisance. But alas, I have yet to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t flake AT ALL. For the price, and the lengthening I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> It smear&#x27;s.  I have been told several times to go look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Makes lashes look longer and separated. The smaller end of the brush makes it easier to get to the corner lashes.  It also stays on well throughout the day, no smudging or flaking.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I always try other ones, then keep coming back to this one.  The shape is perfect for getting the long lashes on the outside and small ones on the inside.  It goes on smoothly, lasts all day.  This does make my lashes look thicker, and longer.  One of the girls at work said that I look like I could be in a Lash Blast commercial!  (wrong company, but whatever!)</li>
            <li> love it exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara and it is such a reasonable price I will defiantly keep buying it for sure</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004Y9L926 Maybelline New York Lots of Lashes Washable Mascara, Blackest Black, 0.43 Fluid Ounce]]My daughter purchased this mascara at one of our local stores a while back. She loves and uses it faithful everyday. It last a long time and gives your lashes definition. You&#x27;ll look great. You should try it. My recommendation to you.</li>
            <li> Easily one of the most clumpy mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used. I think it&#x27;s really the fault of the really dumb brush design. Maybelline makes some good mascara/brush combos, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite mascara and I&#x27;ve tried them all!  This price is cheaper than the store and ships to the house!</li>
            <li> This is my go to mascara! It&#x27;s reasonably priced and goes on perfectly! I try other brands but always end up back with Maybelline Great Lash</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the brush that much</li>
            <li> I love mascara and love to try new kinds. I&#x27;ve had several tubes of the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; Great Lash mascara, but I wanted to try this one because I saw it has a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in the picture, the brush tapers off. I know the idea is that you can use the small end to get the tiny lashes in the corners of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The mascara is very dark and thickens each lash, and maybe lengthens them a bit. I can get by with just one coat in the morning if I&#x27;m in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I think the brush ends up being a huge problem. The brush has so many clumps of mascara on it when you pull it out of the tube. I figure that because the entrance of the tube is wide enough for the thickest part of the brush, it&#x27;s took big for the rest of the brush, so it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;rake&amp;#34; the excess mascara off the middle and end. As a result, I have to do extra work to prevent my eyelashes from clumping together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not buy this product again, because of the problems with the brush / clumping.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product I just don&#x27;t like the small brush. I find it a little hard to use. The color stays on well.</li>
            <li> No clumping, but great dark and long lashes.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Lots of Lashes Washable Mascara is a good all-around mascara that I frequently find myself going back to over and over again. I love to experiment with different cosmetics, and I&#x27;ve used tons of mascara in lots of different brands and formulas. I can sincerely recommend this black mascara for day or evening wear. It washes off easily, it doesn&#x27;t flake, and has pretty good staying power throughout the day. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off since my teens.  I love the way it makes my lashes look.  But after switching brands, I realize my eye allergies due to contact lenses were actually eye irritations due to THIS MASCARA.  Any time I wear it, after a week I can barely keep my contact lenses in through the end of the day, my eyes itch and burn, and eventually they feel scratched even when my lenses are out.  I had always assumed I couldn&#x27;t wear contacts (one time a doctor told me I had horrible allergies that caused bumps on the inside of my lids, so he wouldn&#x27;t even prescribe me contacts!)  Then, I switched mascara brands once to try a different one, and then lo I could wear contacts again.  Thought maybe it was seasonal, until two years later I bought this again.  Ahhh! My eyes are in so much pain!  So sad because it really has a great look.</li>
            <li> I actually ended up like it more than I thought I would, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again. The quest for the right mascara continues...</li>
            <li> Not as dark as I had hoped but I put more than one layer on anyway. Product did not clump but didn&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34;. Liked the shape of brush, it seemed to keep my lashes separated especially after applying one coat. I wear contacts and I do love the fact it&#x27;s safe for contact users who may be concerned of product accidentally getting in eye. No mess. No fuss.</li>
            <li> I love this product, plumps and lengthens lashes nicely</li>
            <li> The mascara is great.  I had no allergic reactions to it.  It washes off easily but does not run during the day if I sweat.  It does flake a little after ten hours or so, but that&#x27;s great for cheap mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush it a bit poor though.  It is difficult to apply this mascara without clumping, compared to other brush styles.</li>
            <li> flakes badly soon after you put it on, 3-4 hours and its all over my face. I like the brush, applies easy and it looks great, but the flaking is awful! im looking for a different product..</li>
            <li> I have been using Mabelline mascara for many years!  I have tried many other mascaras, but always come back to Mabelline!</li>
            <li> it clumps up your lashes a bit but it works well enough</li>
            <li> First I have to say this is probably the cheapest you can find mascara that is is any way worth buying.  The formula is a wetter one, which works well with my thin, short lashes.  The brush in Lots of Lashes works well at grabbing smaller lashes so they can be darker too (naturally my lashes are very light brown and not visible).  Great Lash is a very washable mascara (I just use Dove unscented body wash) and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like some other mascaras have, so I can go from almost root to tip.  Others have said this mascara flakes, but I have not had this problem.  As a disclaimer, I do line my bottom lid (don&#x27;t have enough lashes to use mascara there) so that might be why I don&#x27;t see any flakes there.  What I don&#x27;t like--not a lot of volume adding or length adding.  It only pumps and lengthens a bit, it mostly makes lashes darker.  The bottle and cap are, in my opinion, a very juvenile and ugly color combination.  The color is not as dark as L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Carbon Black (which is my favorite mascara color).  After using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous Carbon Black in washable I was disappointed in the Blackest Black color.  This would not make a good clubbing or evening wear mascara.  I would recommend this mascara to budget focused people who want a mascara that actually isn&#x27;t all dried out.  The brush is great for thin, small lashed people.  Overall, for daytime wear this is a more than acceptable drugstore product.  I might very well purchase this again, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than $4 on a tube.  For that, you can always buy something a little bit better.    Edit: I did want to say that at first I did not notice any flakes.  Now that I have been using this mascara for 2 weeks I do notice some flaking.  That is why I down graded it from a 4 star review to a 3 star review.  However, flaking it simply taken care of when I go to the restroom and it doesn&#x27;t flake too bad.  I will probably not be repurchasing Great Lash Lot of Lashes due to this flaking which I have neverhad with other drugstore mascaras I have used.</li>
