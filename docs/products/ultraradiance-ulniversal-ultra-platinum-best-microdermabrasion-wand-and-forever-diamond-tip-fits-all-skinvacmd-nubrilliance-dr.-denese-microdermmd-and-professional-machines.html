            <li>The quality is outstanding!</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels amazing today.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and my own experience</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m saving money along with the convenience of performing the treatments in my own home.</li>
            <li>it looks great and most importantly  </li>
            <li>Had purchased an at home peel but this will replace that as its gentler and more effective.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to replace the NB top with this wand.</li>
            <li>I can use it on more areas easier with the hand wand</li>
            <li>My Nu Brilliance works perfectly, better than it EVER did with the plastic tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this tip.</li>
            <li>It has much more suction than the tips that came with the Nu Brilliance.</li>
            <li>It work so much better with my Microdermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you enough how wonderful this product is.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave UltraRadiance a chance.</li>
            <li>top quality wand</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt smoother, and I swear my make-up goes on more evenly.  </li>
            <li>Two to get some more suction.</li>
            <li>so glad i got this.</li>
            <li>mu machine uses the flat heads and this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this will fit my machine or not, but I took a chance and order this wand.&lt;br /&gt;Not only this wand fits perfectly to my N.B, it works 100x better than the one that I had.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, excellent customer service and high quality item!</li>
            <li>I had been getting diamond tome microdermabrasion professionally every 2 months or so, but saw the great reviews for this unit and decided to bite the bullet.  </li>
            <li>The tip is also easy to clean, no replacement parts here!</li>
            <li>i like using the wand when microderming because it makes the experience easy to glide without hurting your wrist.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts that it would easily attach to my NB Machine &amp; work as well.</li>
            <li>I have an upright vac that I use with and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>But works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it numerous times and it works great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean as well.  </li>
            <li>The Diamond tip is far more effective than the NuBrilliance tips</li>
            <li>Love this - easy to fit on my Nu Brilliance machine and works REALLY well</li>
            <li>I do think I have found a new &#x27;love&#x27; in my treatment room!</li>
            <li>I pulled off the plastic tip from the Nu Brilliance (easy), stuck the flexible tube right on the end</li>
            <li>please do yourself a favor and click it into your cart right now!</li>
            <li>I love using the wand, it is makes microderming easy and comfortabe and gives me a professional experience.</li>
            <li>great price person loved it to go with their expensive machine</li>
            <li>I have a NuBrilliance machine and swapping out the NuBrilliance wand (for lack of a better term) with this one was easy and took only about 10 seconds, if that.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The name got it right &amp;#34;Forever&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It installed easily and felt very good in hand, but I was unable to use it because my NuBrilliance has no suction and this upgrade did not correct the problem.</li>
            <li>My skin immediately responded to the first session.  </li>
            <li>My skin was smoother, more even in texture, and my 40 something co-workers were constantly asking me what I had done.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have much diamond on it and it did nothing!</li>
            <li>This tip works much better than the heads that actually come with the machine.</li>
            <li>Watch the video on YouTube and follow directions exactly.</li>
            <li>The replacement cost was adding up and the reviews for the UltraRadiance were so positive I made the decision to quit throwing my money away and try it.  </li>
            <li>had to set my machine alittle higher, didn&#x27;t have much suction on One, had to set the machine</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t have to keep buying tips that really don&#x27;t work well and some not at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have used this wand twice, and my skin feels really soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>anyone who has a microdermabrasion machine should really get this.</li>
            <li>I would really be interested in where I could buy tips for New Spa micro machine.</li>
            <li>Originally I ordered the NuBrilliance microdermabrasion vacuum and tips.  </li>
            <li>The brown spots have gotten much less noticeable and after using it, I see a healthy glow to my face which wasn&#x27;t there before.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I was discouraged that I would have to make an investment monthly on tips and was going to abandon the whole idea of trying to clear up my skin until I came across the forever diamond tips.  </li>
            <li>I began using it several times a week and see a distinct difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I can do microdermabrasion the same with the other attachement as far as results, but the wand gives you extra hose link making it easier and more comfortable to move around.</li>
            <li>It is a little more aggressive of a piece than I was looking for but it has been a while since I&#x27;ve replaced my tips &amp; mine old ones could just be worn out!</li>
            <li>I will have to continue to use my older pieces on my more sensitive clients for a little longer til this one is broke in.</li>
            <li>This tip fits the New Brilliance as described by a writer elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the tip that I ordered the larger one for the body as my chest area is also a mess from too much sunbathing in the years gone by.  </li>
            <li>was only interested in selling me new plastic tips (which didn&#x27;t fix the problem).</li>
            <li>Got this for myself as an early Christmas gift and I must now bid my facialist \\&quot;Adieu\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li>The wand really is universal and the tips really are &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I am completely sold.</li>
            <li>This is professional,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping this wand lasts &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34;...or at least longer than the nubrilliance tips:)</li>
            <li>and I was careful not to be too aggressive using it the first time.  </li>
            <li>I just received this the other day and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>The other reviewers are correct - you really CAN feel the quality of this product just be holding it in your hand.</li>
            <li>The hose is very stiff and my wrist would hurt right away.  </li>

            <li> en lugar de el vacuum de la maquina ,es decir ,es una extension perfecta mente adjustable y</li>
            <li> and I can already tell it&#x27;s going to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> It is only a single tip</li>
            <li> Do recommend doing test small patch on inner arm first and practice getting the rhythm down.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no troubles keeping constant suction when dragging it across even contoured areas of my face.</li>
            <li> Follow directions and go slow and gently.</li>
            <li> Money definitely well spent!</li>
            <li> I used this only a few times before going to the Dermatologist for laser treatment to remove sunspots on my face.  </li>
            <li> the replacement heads I had purchased for my NuBrilliance microdermabrasion unit were wearing down after only a few uses on face, neck, chest area.  </li>
            <li> I am going to order other tips from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I use less of it.  </li>
            <li> For less than cost of one treatment</li>
            <li> I cut the nubrilliance filters in half and put it just inside this wand.</li>
            <li> They reply my email within just few hours with detail explanation.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the mini kit before and it was hard to use with just the shopvac hose.  </li>
            <li> No more Diamond Tips for me!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately did not work with my microdermabrasion system.  </li>
            <li> Results on face were comparable to what I would get from expensive salon treatment.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical and was expecting to hate this.</li>
            <li> very disappointing</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this - easy to fit on my Nu Brilliance machine and works REALLY well</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service!</li>
            <li> I had purchased the mini kit before and it was hard to use with just the shopvac hose.  The hose is very stiff and my wrist would hurt right away.  The wand makes a big difference.  I can use it on more areas easier with the hand wand and my wrist doesn&#x27;t hurt with the wand. Thank you again for making a great product!</li>
            <li> The packaging and the sleek, high-quality materials in this instrument were wonderful. I bought mine in hopes it would correct the lack of suction problem with my NuBrilliance. It installed easily and felt very good in hand, but I was unable to use it because my NuBrilliance has no suction and this upgrade did not correct the problem. THIS REVIEW RATES QUALITY OF PRODUCT, BUT NOT PERFORMANCE. PROBLEM IS **NOT** THE FAULT OF ULTRARADIANCE</li>
            <li> I just received this the other day and used it for the first time last night. It. Is. AMAZING! I have a NuBrilliance machine and swapping out the NuBrilliance wand (for lack of a better term) with this one was easy and took only about 10 seconds, if that. The other reviewers are correct - you really CAN feel the quality of this product just be holding it in your hand. The best part? I had absolutely no troubles keeping constant suction when dragging it across even contoured areas of my face. The Diamond tip is far more effective than the NuBrilliance tips and I can already tell it&#x27;s going to last a very long time. My skin looks and feels amazing today. It&#x27;s so smooth and glowing. It feels like silk and looks like porcelain! This baby gets 5 stars! Anybody who has a compatible microdermabrasion device should have this product. Money definitely well spent!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and my own experience was similar:  the replacement heads I had purchased for my NuBrilliance microdermabrasion unit were wearing down after only a few uses on face, neck, chest area.  The replacement cost was adding up and the reviews for the UltraRadiance were so positive I made the decision to quit throwing my money away and try it.  I received it quickly and was impressed with the packaging.  But the minute I saw the design and felt the weight of the wand, I knew this was a quality product.  It fit perfectly on the NuBrilliance tubing and I was careful not to be too aggressive using it the first time.  My skin immediately responded to the first session.  My skin was smoother, more even in texture, and my 40 something co-workers were constantly asking me what I had done.  This treatment combined with alternating glycolic peels, has my skin glowing and even in tone.  And I&#x27;m saving money along with the convenience of performing the treatments in my own home. Great service, awesome product.</li>
            <li> I love using the wand, it is makes microderming easy and comfortabe and gives me a professional experience. I can do microdermabrasion the same with the other attachement as far as results, but the wand gives you extra hose link making it easier and more comfortable to move around.</li>
            <li> My Nu Brilliance microdermabrasion machine was sitting on a shelf for about a year before I bought this diamond metal tip. It had lost suction and the customer service at Nu Brilliance was only interested in selling me new plastic tips (which didn&#x27;t fix the problem). I pulled off the plastic tip from the Nu Brilliance (easy), stuck the flexible tube right on the end this metal tip (very easy also) and PRESTO! Suction! My Nu Brilliance works perfectly, better than it EVER did with the plastic tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the smaller finer tip for the face, and the larger coarser tip for the body. Both are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitating to buy this because you don&#x27;t know if it will work for you please do yourself a favor and click it into your cart right now! Your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> I used this only a few times before going to the Dermatologist for laser treatment to remove sunspots on my face.  However,  the suction provided was awesome and it did just what it is supposed to do.  I am still recovering from the laser but looking forward to getting permission to start with this SkinVac accessory again.  Great price!</li>
            <li> I use this with my nubrillance machine. I am so happy that I made this purchase! The quality is outstanding! I will never go back to using nubrillance tips- EVER. The wand really is universal and the tips really are &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have much diamond on it and it did nothing!</li>
            <li> This  attached to my Nu Brilliance with no problem. I love this tip. It has much more suction than the tips that came with the Nu Brilliance. I won&#x27;t have to keep buying tips that really don&#x27;t work well and some not at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing several of my microdermabrasion pieces &amp; found this deal. It is only a single tip &amp; I was looking for multiple pieces. This is for an all over the face piece. It is a little more aggressive of a piece than I was looking for but it has been a while since I&#x27;ve replaced my tips &amp; mine old ones could just be worn out! I will have to continue to use my older pieces on my more sensitive clients for a little longer til this one is broke in. I do think I have found a new &#x27;love&#x27; in my treatment room!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have found this sooner! Works great with my nubrilliance machine. This tip works much better than the heads that actually come with the machine.</li>
            <li> This is just what we needed. Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> great price person loved it to go with their expensive machine</li>
            <li> No more Diamond Tips for me! The name got it right &amp;#34;Forever&amp;#34;. It work so much better with my Microdermabrasion machine. I will save a lot of money using this!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you enough how wonderful this product is. I was going to replace by NB tips that were worn and cracked and stumbled upon this item.  After reading the wonderful reviews I decided to try it out for myself. This tip delivers excellent microdermabrasion treatments and is made of quality materials. I am completely sold. The tip is also easy to clean, no replacement parts here!</li>
            <li> Originally I ordered the NuBrilliance microdermabrasion vacuum and tips.  Since my skin is damaged from overexposure to the sun in So. Ca., I used the system several times a week.  In several weeks my tips needed replacement.  I was discouraged that I would have to make an investment monthly on tips and was going to abandon the whole idea of trying to clear up my skin until I came across the forever diamond tips.  I was a bit hesitant about investing more&lt;br /&gt;money and had my doubts there was a \\&quot;forever\\&quot; tip but decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m very glad I did.  The wand fit the machine perfectly and the tip was actually better than the one that came with the NuBrilliance machine.  I began using it several times a week and see a distinct difference in my skin.  The brown spots have gotten much less noticeable and after using it, I see a healthy glow to my face which wasn&#x27;t there before.  And I also notice my foundation goes on a lot smoother and I use less of it.  I was so pleased with the tip that I ordered the larger one for the body as my chest area is also a mess from too much sunbathing in the years gone by.  One of the things I like the most is it isn&#x27;t time consuming.  Once you get the hang of it, you can do your entire face in about ten minutes.  That works for me!</li>
            <li> i like using the wand when microderming because it makes the experience easy to glide without hurting your wrist. i like this device because its allows me to change multiple tip sizes for different areas.</li>
            <li> Very nice product and beautifully packaged, but unfortunately did not work with my microdermabrasion system.  Another person had recommended this tip to me, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make it work.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts that it would easily attach to my NB Machine &amp; work as well. When I considered the ongoing cost of NB heads &amp; pads, I gave this a try. It was very easy to replace the NB top with this wand. I&#x27;ve used it numerous times and it works great. I&#x27;m so glad I gave UltraRadiance a chance.</li>
            <li> Este products lo USO en lugar de el vacuum de la maquina ,es decir ,es una extension perfecta mente adjustable y no necessito compare una micro .</li>
            <li> This tip fits the New Brilliance as described by a writer elsewhere. A very good substitute and not purchasing disposablee NB heads will save money.  I found this tip easier to use than the NB tip.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have the All-in-One Microdermabrasion Conversion Set. Watch the video on YouTube and follow directions exactly. I was really skeptical and was expecting to hate this. I have an upright vac that I use with and it works just fine. Do recommend doing test small patch on inner arm first and practice getting the rhythm down. Results on face were comparable to what I would get from expensive salon treatment. For less than cost of one treatment and I can use repeatedly. Follow directions and go slow and gently. Acne is gone and the discoloration on my face are getting lighter. Had purchased an at home peel but this will replace that as its gentler and more effective.</li>
            <li> I was looking for my N.B. Microdermabrasion replacement tips and saw this wand. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this will fit my machine or not, but I took a chance and order this wand.&lt;br /&gt;Not only this wand fits perfectly to my N.B, it works 100x better than the one that I had.  This is professional, top quality wand and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I am going to order other tips from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mentioned that customer service is excellent. They reply my email within just few hours with detail explanation. I am very happy with my purchase. Fast shipping, excellent customer service and high quality item!</li>
            <li> I have the nubrilliance microderm system which requires a filter. I cut the nubrilliance filters in half and put it just inside this wand. I&#x27;m hoping this wand lasts &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34;...or at least longer than the nubrilliance tips:)</li>
            <li> It may be a wonderful tip, I wasn&#x27;t informed I needed additional attachments for my dermabrasion product....very disappointing</li>
            <li> Got this for myself as an early Christmas gift and I must now bid my facialist \\&quot;Adieu\\&quot;!  I had been getting diamond tome microdermabrasion professionally every 2 months or so, but saw the great reviews for this unit and decided to bite the bullet.  I have been using this every 3-4 days, and have not had any redness or irritation.  My skin has never felt smoother, and I swear my make-up goes on more evenly.  Easy to use and clean as well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It appeared and felt as though it was used.  I would really be interested in where I could buy tips for New Spa micro machine. The unit was compatible to the machine.</li>
            <li> I have used this wand twice, and my skin feels really soft.&lt;br /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t tightened my skin though, or made my wrinkle disappear yet.&lt;br /&gt;But please with the texture of my face. Maybe in time I will see a difference in&lt;br /&gt;the appearance of my wrinkles. Was real easy to install on my Nubrilliance machine.&lt;br /&gt;I had to set my machine alittle higher, didn&#x27;t have much suction on One, had to set the machine&lt;br /&gt;on Two to get some more suction. But works fine. Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> anyone who has a microdermabrasion machine should really get this. mu machine uses the flat heads and this works wonderfully. so glad i got this.</li>
            <li> The order came on time,  it looks great and most importantly  it fits my machine.  The reason for only 4 stars is that I have not used it yet!</li>
