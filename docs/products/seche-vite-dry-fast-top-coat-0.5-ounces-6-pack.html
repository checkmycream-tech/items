            <li>Love this top coat!  </li>
            <li>Very good product, thanks.</li>
            <li>Not only did these make my nails perfect for a bachelorette weekend, but I saved the day by having a bottle handy for another girl (since I had 6 from this listing).</li>
            <li>The gossip I heard about this being a superior brand of polish are clearly true in this case.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best quick dry top coat ever!!  </li>
            <li>Great deal, fast shipping and fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.  </li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I applied the top coat and waited approx.</li>
            <li>I have no issues with shrinkage, and I can paint nails at 12-1 am, top coat with Seche, and immediately go to bed.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it online for this cheap!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>To avoid polish shrinking, wrap nail tip with top coat.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite and I have one of those love love relationships.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s so shiny.</li>
            <li>love this 6 pack option, because once you start using Seche Vite</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat out there when it comes to dry time and glossiness.  </li>
            <li>I find this to be a good top coat for shine and quick dry, but experienced a lot of chipping.  </li>
            <li>The most amazing, fast drying top coat there is.</li>
            <li>So easy</li>
            <li>If you go through top coat quickly I would recommend the 6-pack.</li>
            <li>fast top coat dries literally in minutes...making your at home manicures a breeze!  </li>
            <li>the best fast dry top coat..</li>
            <li>I also think this is a great deal for your money, getting 6 bottles is worth it if you plan on giving yourself manicures and pedicures frequently (like I do).</li>
            <li>just remember to float it lightly across your nail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had numerous friends tell me how great this brand is</li>
            <li>The drying time on this is incomparable.</li>
            <li>Seche works great but tends to get goopy by the last 1/3 of the bottle.</li>
            <li>so this 6 pack is very useful</li>
            <li>Seriously the best top coat I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Its the first time ive ever used this top coat..</li>
            <li>My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI.</li>
            <li>This top coat dries FAST!</li>
            <li>Which is both expected and fine for me, it&#x27;s offered here at a great price, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Each bottle was a full 15 ml.</li>
            <li>There seems to be some confusion over the bottle size, and I feel obliged to mention that I did receive six full sized bottles.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s super fast drying.</li>
            <li>If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
            <li>quick drying</li>
            <li>It is shiny and dries extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>Best top coat, your nail polish last longer with this top coat, also the base works great too</li>
            <li>Make sure to seal the top edge of your nail to make it last!</li>
            <li>For looks this is a good knockoff, as far as product not so much.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, but does shrink.</li>
            <li>super speedy.</li>
            <li>I really love the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat!  </li>
            <li>I have tried a ton of different top coats and nothing beats this!  </li>
            <li>I really have to say, I am surprised at how well this top coat works!</li>
            <li>This set is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>this pack of 6 is economical and useful if u cant buy it often.</li>
            <li>It prevents chipping better than any other top coat I have tried.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is the ONLY brand of top coat that I will use, and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every top coat you can try.</li>
            <li>I recently found a new love for Seche Vite top coat and plan to get lots of use from these bottles.</li>
            <li>I originally found it at my local Sally&#x27;s for about $8 a bottle and fell in love the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish.</li>
            <li>I will say that it arrived super fast &amp; that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li>Dries very fast and evens out your nail polish</li>
            <li>Seriously, listen to me when I say, this is hands down the best top coat out there.</li>
            <li>This stuff sells for about $10 per bottle in-store so this was really one heck of a deal!</li>
            <li>This was my first experience using it</li>
            <li>so I am constantly washing dishes and giving baths, but this top coat held up.</li>
            <li>The only thing that makes this better is knowing I received six bottles versus just one for the price.</li>
            <li>It started chipping and that was my first clue.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using Seche Vite for several years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>This product really does what it says - it dries FAST!</li>
            <li>Quick dry and fabulous shine.</li>
            <li>5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry.</li>
            <li>I was never one to be able to wait and dry my nails which led to accidental nail rubs and my irritation with the salon process</li>
            <li>I can do whatever after AT MOST 5 minutes of dry time.</li>
            <li>real label reads 83005 - Seche Vite - Dry Fast Top Coat</li>
            <li>I particularly like how it is incredibly fast drying, and I have no problems with shrinkage!</li>
            <li>The price is great enough that I can even give a few away to family or friends.</li>
            <li>Also after a couple of coats it tends to peel off nail in one whole piece.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast, stays shiny, doesn&#x27;t bubble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the fence about whether this is the real deal or not.</li>
            <li>I hope this is the real thing</li>
            <li>It dries really fast.</li>
            <li>dries fast and stays on .</li>
            <li>Dry super fast very glossy and gentle on ur nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can find this on here at less than store price per bottle.</li>
            <li>and I was lucky enough to get it at a discount.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it look good, but the polish dries your nails so fast that you can be back to doing normal things within minutes instead of sitting around for hours waiting for your nails to fully dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My polish lasts so much longer than before, and my nails look like they are professionally done.  </li>
            <li>You can resume normal activities within a minute or two of putting on your Seche Vite topcoat.  </li>
            <li>I put the clear coat on top of my black nail polish and decided to wait.</li>
            <li>So I used this on my left hand and the one I bought at the beauty supply store on my right.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even go back to any other top coat.</li>
            <li>High gloss finish and dried super fast.</li>
            <li>Drys fast and helps my manicures last all week.</li>
            <li>It gives you the ability to look like you had your nails done professionally, but you can do it at home for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>By the time one minute completely passed I touched the nail.</li>
            <li>Otherwise your polish might get old before you get to use it.</li>
            <li>no peeling or chipping thus far.</li>
            <li>I love having a few extra bottles as a backup</li>
            <li>My right hand, as expected never chipped.</li>
            <li>Seriously, you need this top coat if you don&#x27;t want your nails chipping, flaking, peeling or tacky.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all the same, and it preforms exactly the same as the stuff I pick up from sallys.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to all who have trouble growing their nails and just plain keeping your finger nails healthy!</li>
            <li>You can sometimes have a problem with it when you get about half empty, but the Seche restore you can buy fixes the issue of it becoming gloopy.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and evenly, dries hard, super-shiny and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Provides a quick dry, long lasting gel-effect without the time, steps, cost and bother.</li>
            <li>Seche inevitably dries up before I can finish a bottle (I have acrylic wraps and therefore do not paint my nails as often as the average at home nail paint enthusiast), so a well priced six pack is right up my alley.</li>

            <li> I really love the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat!  </li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of different top coats and nothing beats this!  </li>
            <li> I really have to say, I am surprised at how well this top coat works!</li>
            <li> This set is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> this pack of 6 is economical and useful if u cant buy it often.</li>
            <li> It prevents chipping better than any other top coat I have tried.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is the ONLY brand of top coat that I will use, and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every top coat you can try.</li>
            <li> I recently found a new love for Seche Vite top coat and plan to get lots of use from these bottles.</li>
            <li> I originally found it at my local Sally&#x27;s for about $8 a bottle and fell in love the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish.</li>
            <li> I will say that it arrived super fast &amp; that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li> Dries very fast and evens out your nail polish</li>
            <li> Seriously, listen to me when I say, this is hands down the best top coat out there.</li>
            <li> This stuff sells for about $10 per bottle in-store so this was really one heck of a deal!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience using it</li>
            <li> so I am constantly washing dishes and giving baths, but this top coat held up.</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes this better is knowing I received six bottles versus just one for the price.</li>
            <li> It started chipping and that was my first clue.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using Seche Vite for several years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST!</li>
            <li> Quick dry and fabulous shine.</li>
            <li> 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry.</li>
            <li> I was never one to be able to wait and dry my nails which led to accidental nail rubs and my irritation with the salon process</li>
            <li> I can do whatever after AT MOST 5 minutes of dry time.</li>
            <li> real label reads 83005 - Seche Vite - Dry Fast Top Coat</li>
            <li> I particularly like how it is incredibly fast drying, and I have no problems with shrinkage!</li>
            <li> The price is great enough that I can even give a few away to family or friends.</li>
            <li> Also after a couple of coats it tends to peel off nail in one whole piece.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast, stays shiny, doesn&#x27;t bubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence about whether this is the real deal or not.</li>
            <li> I hope this is the real thing</li>
            <li> It dries really fast.</li>
            <li> dries fast and stays on .</li>
            <li> Dry super fast very glossy and gentle on ur nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I can find this on here at less than store price per bottle.</li>
            <li> and I was lucky enough to get it at a discount.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it look good, but the polish dries your nails so fast that you can be back to doing normal things within minutes instead of sitting around for hours waiting for your nails to fully dry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My polish lasts so much longer than before, and my nails look like they are professionally done.  </li>
            <li> You can resume normal activities within a minute or two of putting on your Seche Vite topcoat.  </li>
            <li> I put the clear coat on top of my black nail polish and decided to wait.</li>
            <li> So I used this on my left hand and the one I bought at the beauty supply store on my right.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even go back to any other top coat.</li>
            <li> High gloss finish and dried super fast.</li>
            <li> Drys fast and helps my manicures last all week.</li>
            <li> It gives you the ability to look like you had your nails done professionally, but you can do it at home for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> By the time one minute completely passed I touched the nail.</li>
            <li> Otherwise your polish might get old before you get to use it.</li>
            <li> no peeling or chipping thus far.</li>
            <li> I love having a few extra bottles as a backup</li>
            <li> My right hand, as expected never chipped.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you need this top coat if you don&#x27;t want your nails chipping, flaking, peeling or tacky.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all the same, and it preforms exactly the same as the stuff I pick up from sallys.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all who have trouble growing their nails and just plain keeping your finger nails healthy!</li>
            <li> You can sometimes have a problem with it when you get about half empty, but the Seche restore you can buy fixes the issue of it becoming gloopy.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and evenly, dries hard, super-shiny and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Provides a quick dry, long lasting gel-effect without the time, steps, cost and bother.</li>
            <li> Seche inevitably dries up before I can finish a bottle (I have acrylic wraps and therefore do not paint my nails as often as the average at home nail paint enthusiast), so a well priced six pack is right up my alley.</li>
            <li> It makes manicures last a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, I would recommend a smaller pack (4, 2, or a single bottle at a time).</li>
            <li> It is super shiny and dries hard in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> The item arrived earlier than expected from this seller.</li>
            <li> It was completely dry.</li>
            <li> A minute after applying it my nails are dry to the touch.</li>
            <li> My pilosh lasted 5 days with this over it, and it usually only lasts a few hours to one day.</li>
            <li> try this  product with no real expectation.</li>
            <li> The store bought seche vite dried faster, was shinier &amp; even the smell was different.</li>
            <li> It dries all the layers of your polish in under ten minutes, and leaves a hard, glossy finish.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
            <li> It does mean that you can do basic tasks like using the restroom without ruining your nail polish.</li>
            <li> you realize that due to it&#x27;s slightly thicker consistency, you do go through it a little faster.</li>
            <li> If you do something that is hard on your nails, like gardening, a minute after it feels dry you could still ruin your nail polish.</li>
            <li> It dries quicy and leave a high gloss sheen that I am crazy about.</li>
            <li> I have two small children</li>
            <li> Not authentic Seche.</li>
            <li> no matter how hard I try.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean you still can&#x27;t ruin your nail polish.</li>
            <li> , the label on the bottom is wrong.</li>
            <li> Too bad they increased the price.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works amazing.  Dries so quick love them and good deal!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is the ONLY brand of top coat that I will use, and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every top coat you can try. It dries quicy and leave a high gloss sheen that I am crazy about. All of my neons that I especially wear during summer, are always a matte finish and I just can&#x27;t get into that, no matter how hard I try. I can put Seche over the top and boom! Shiney and glossy perfection! This stuff sells for about $10 per bottle in-store so this was really one heck of a deal! About halfway through the bottle it starts getting noticeably thicker and that is an sign that you need to add in some of Seche Vite&#x27;s Restore product to get it back to it&#x27;s regular consistency.</li>
            <li> Love my shiny nails! My nails and polishes have never been as shiny as when I use Seche Vite Top Coat! It&#x27;s easily the best and I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li> I go through alot of these so this 6 pack is very useful&lt;br /&gt;Very quick drying</li>
            <li> i got this at a great price.  This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> This top coat is my FAVORITE! I have tried a ton of different top coats and nothing beats this!  It goes great with my nail polish collection.</li>
            <li> Great deal, fast shipping and fabulous product!</li>
            <li> Awesome price and the best top coat I have ever used! It is shiny and dries extremely quickly. It makes manicures last a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> Its the first time ive ever used this top coat..such a great value..works perfectly. .dries quickly..love it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, wish it wouldn&#x27;t shrink so much on indie polish, but all in all a great deal!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.  Dry super fast very glossy and gentle on ur nails.I will never stop using it. I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have had my nails done professionaly for years and this top coat is the best. My manicure lasts a week.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Great value! Too bad they increased the price.</li>
            <li> Dries in 10 minutes--fantastic.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best top coat I&#x27;ve found. Drys fast and helps my manicures last all week. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Best top coat, your nail polish last longer with this top coat, also the base works great too</li>
            <li> I find this to be a good top coat for shine and quick dry, but experienced a lot of chipping.  Also after a couple of coats it tends to peel off nail in one whole piece.  Has anyone else experienced this?</li>
            <li> Wonderful product - far better than the drug store brands!  Goes on smoothly and evenly, dries hard, super-shiny and sturdy.  You get days more wear with this stuff!  Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST! My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI. I applied the top coat and waited approx. 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry. Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish. If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
            <li> The headline of the review says it all...best top coat ever!!  Quick dry and fabulous shine.</li>
            <li> The most amazing, fast drying top coat there is. I have no issues with shrinkage, and I can paint nails at 12-1 am, top coat with Seche, and immediately go to bed.</li>
            <li> one of the best for nail art. just remember to float it lightly across your nail.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries FAST! So easy and I can get on with my day faster. It&#x27;s the BEST on the market and I don&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
            <li> The item arrived earlier than expected from this seller. This product is amazing! It gives you the ability to look like you had your nails done professionally, but you can do it at home for a fraction of the cost. Not only does it look good, but the polish dries your nails so fast that you can be back to doing normal things within minutes instead of sitting around for hours waiting for your nails to fully dry. It&#x27;s the only product I use. I used to pay $15 per bottle in a store. So glad I found it online for this cheap!</li>
            <li> I really love the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat!  This was my first experience using it and now I&#x27;m a fan for life.  I&#x27;ve had numerous friends tell me how great this brand is and I was lucky enough to get it at a discount.  I gave some of the bottles away, but kept enough to last me for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fast top coat dries literally in minutes...making your at home manicures a breeze!  I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This set is nothing short of amazing. This is my favorite top coat. Seche is a staple in my mani line up.  I love having a few extra bottles as a backup so this set worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li> I really have to say, I am surprised at how well this top coat works! I have two small children so I am constantly washing dishes and giving baths, but this top coat held up. My pilosh lasted 5 days with this over it, and it usually only lasts a few hours to one day. I also think this is a great deal for your money, getting 6 bottles is worth it if you plan on giving yourself manicures and pedicures frequently (like I do). I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This topcoat is magic! It dries all the layers of your polish in under ten minutes, and leaves a hard, glossy finish. Not only did these make my nails perfect for a bachelorette weekend, but I saved the day by having a bottle handy for another girl (since I had 6 from this listing). Love this stuff! It&#x27;s been 4 days and I have one chip and no peeling. Make sure to seal the top edge of your nail to make it last!</li>
            <li> I had never heard about this brand. If I did then I do not remember. I do my best to stay away from nail salons. I was never one to be able to wait and dry my nails which led to accidental nail rubs and my irritation with the salon process further increasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try this  product with no real expectation. I put the clear coat on top of my black nail polish and decided to wait. I knew that I started at the 55th second because I was recording a video of this review as well. By the time one minute completely passed I touched the nail. It was completely dry. I was floored. The gossip I heard about this being a superior brand of polish are clearly true in this case. The only thing that makes this better is knowing I received six bottles versus just one for the price. Great find!</li>
            <li> After finding this great deal, I could NOT pass this 6 pack up. I recently found a new love for Seche Vite top coat and plan to get lots of use from these bottles. The price is great enough that I can even give a few away to family or friends.</li>
            <li> The best top coat there is.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is the best top coat I have tried! It is super shiny and dries hard in less than 10 minutes. I did my nails at 9 and went to sleep soon after. When I woke up, there were no sheet marks. If you go through top coat quickly I would recommend the 6-pack. If you don&#x27;t, I would recommend a smaller pack (4, 2, or a single bottle at a time). Otherwise your polish might get old before you get to use it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Provides a quick dry, long lasting gel-effect without the time, steps, cost and bother.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even go back to any other top coat. Dries fast, stays shiny, doesn&#x27;t bubble. And the 6 pack is a great deal!</li>
            <li> This product is for use in helping your nails to revive and grow. I recommend this product to all who have trouble growing their nails and just plain keeping your finger nails healthy!</li>
            <li> The only difference between these bottles, and the seche I can buy at sallys, is the lids. The lids on these are longer, and have the logos on them. Where as the regular ones do not. The ingredients are all the same, and it preforms exactly the same as the stuff I pick up from sallys.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the wonderful nail coat.  My polish lasts so much longer than before, and my nails look like they are professionally done.  Don&#x27;t try to put a second coat on though, as it will peel off within a day or two.</li>
            <li> Not authentic Seche. I became suspicious after about a month if using it. It started chipping and that was my first clue. I went and bought a bottle from the local beauty supply store to compare. There was the slightest difference in the print on the bottle. That was my second clue. So I used this on my left hand and the one I bought at the beauty supply store on my right. Also the consistancy of this is not the same. If you have never used it you may not know. Spend the extra couple dollars and buy it from a beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the label on the bottom is wrong. On this one it just reads 83005 and Seche Vite.&lt;br /&gt;The real label reads 83005 - Seche Vite - Dry Fast Top Coat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL! My right hand, as expected never chipped. I can&#x27;t say the same for my left. I will give the company that makes this credit. The packaging is almost a perfect match. For looks this is a good knockoff, as far as product not so much. This deserves ZERO stars.</li>
            <li> the best fast dry top coat.. only one minutes and you&#x27;re good to go. this pack of 6 is economical and useful if u cant buy it often.</li>
            <li> No problem. Good experience.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, but does shrink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence about whether this is the real deal or not. The store bought seche vite dried faster, was shinier &amp; even the smell was different. I will say that it arrived super fast &amp; that&#x27;s always a plus. I hope this is the real thing &#x27;cause I love me some seche vite!!</li>
            <li> If there is anything that I love more than Seche Vite, it&#x27;s a 6 pack of Seche Vite!  This is the best top coat out there when it comes to dry time and glossiness.  You can sometimes have a problem with it when you get about half empty, but the Seche restore you can buy fixes the issue of it becoming gloopy.</li>
            <li> Very good product, thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat! It dries really fast. A minute after applying it my nails are dry to the touch. That doesn&#x27;t mean you still can&#x27;t ruin your nail polish. If you do something that is hard on your nails, like gardening, a minute after it feels dry you could still ruin your nail polish. It does mean that you can do basic tasks like using the restroom without ruining your nail polish. It prevents chipping better than any other top coat I have tried.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Dries very fast and evens out your nail polish</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best quick dry top coat ever!!  You can resume normal activities within a minute or two of putting on your Seche Vite topcoat.  The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but it&#x27;s SO worth it to be able to do your manicure and get on with life!!  I&#x27;ll never be without it in my mani kit.</li>
            <li> It was a great product! Each bottle was a full 15 ml. And box came with 6. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I recieved the shipping notice at 11 am today, was delivered by 11:45. super speedy. dries fast and stays on . no peeling or chipping thus far.</li>
            <li> Swear by this topcoat. Makes my manicures last longer. To avoid polish shrinking, wrap nail tip with top coat.</li>
            <li> This has the be the best top coat I have ever found! Now i&#x27;m all stocked up. Seriously, you need this top coat if you don&#x27;t want your nails chipping, flaking, peeling or tacky. High gloss finish and dried super fast. A++++</li>
            <li> Seriously, listen to me when I say, this is hands down the best top coat out there. I originally found it at my local Sally&#x27;s for about $8 a bottle and fell in love the first time I used it. It has the shiniest, clearest finish I&#x27;ve ever come across. The drying time on this is incomparable. I can do whatever after AT MOST 5 minutes of dry time. This top coat over glitter is just about the best thing ever. Seche has my heart when it comes to topcoats. I&#x27;m so glad I can find this on here at less than store price per bottle.</li>
            <li> Seche inevitably dries up before I can finish a bottle (I have acrylic wraps and therefore do not paint my nails as often as the average at home nail paint enthusiast), so a well priced six pack is right up my alley. There seems to be some confusion over the bottle size, and I feel obliged to mention that I did receive six full sized bottles.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love this top coat!  I particularly like how it is incredibly fast drying, and I have no problems with shrinkage!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. Seche works great but tends to get goopy by the last 1/3 of the bottle. At this price I don&#x27;t care...</li>
            <li> Seche Vite and I have one of those love love relationships. I love that it&#x27;s super fast drying. I love that it&#x27;s so shiny. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it well.&lt;br /&gt;I love this 6 pack option, because once you start using Seche Vite you realize that due to it&#x27;s slightly thicker consistency, you do go through it a little faster. Which is both expected and fine for me, it&#x27;s offered here at a great price, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is the best fast drying top coat!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this item.  She used it and loved it.  I have been using Seche Vite for several years now and love it.  This price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Does not disappoint..........I have been using Seche Vite for years!!!</li>
