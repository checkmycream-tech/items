            <li>: This is one of my favorite uses of lavender oil.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Be sure to take advantage of their bundle packages (ie.</li>
            <li>I love the lavender smell of this product, and I have been using it in my aromatherapy mister.  </li>
            <li>I have found that I need to use more then the suggested amount however.</li>
            <li>I actually used it to make a carpet freshener and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>The essential oils have wonderful properties.</li>
            <li>ok quality - will probably not order again</li>
            <li>Relax&#x27;s the body and helps sleep better.</li>
            <li>this has a very rich aroma of lavender.  </li>
            <li>I liked that very much!</li>
            <li>This product is a pure oil quality oil for a good price.</li>
            <li>It truly is an amazing and powerful oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have many lavender products but this lavender scent is not what I am familiar with.</li>
            <li>Both times I ordered it arrived very quickly, and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>And Plantlife&#x27;s product is consistent, of good quality and ships quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought it to smooth my baby at bed time because i heard it worked.</li>
            <li>I love using lavender products on my face to calm and sooth me ...</li>
            <li>Fantastic oil for making Cloud Dough which relaxes children who need to relax.</li>
            <li>I am an elementary teacher and stressed many days I leave work.    </li>
            <li>shipping was fast the scent is great and the oil is high quality</li>
            <li>love lavender oil, and when I used up my first bottle of it, I decided to check out the lavender oils available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so I knew if I am truly getting the best, as you are in Young Living Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and is much cheaper than similar lavender oils out there.</li>
            <li>(meaning it evaporates quickly).</li>
            <li>the oil quickly.  </li>
            <li>Delivery is very fast and accurate.  </li>
            <li>Also included were cute little body wash and herbal soap samples which I LOVE!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really helped my baby to sleep better, but still the product has a very nice small.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good because when you make soap you need essential oil that is 100% pure, and this stuff is.  </li>
            <li>I use it to provide a sense of calm in my home for me and my pets.</li>
            <li>I think you have to try it and let it calm a bit before coming to that conclusion.  </li>
            <li>-Maurice Gattefosse (Author), Robert B. Tisserand (Editor) ~ a wonderful book that explains the \\&quot;science\\&quot; behind Aromatherapy</li>
            <li>Along with this bottle of oil I received a complimentary bar of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; soup.</li>
            <li>I had to smile.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to test it so far because of all the flooding in Oklahoma.</li>
            <li>and she tells me that it&#x27;s really worth.</li>
            <li>Bought it to try and help my 2 year old sleep better, didnt work at all.</li>
            <li>I have used other oils, I like the amount they give for the price I paid, and it really is a good product</li>
            <li>The product smells great my only problem is that about a 3rd of the bottle spilled in shipment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got a fairly big bottle of this and its worth the price.</li>
            <li>Also recommended is : \\&quot;Gattefosse&#x27;s Aromatherapy: The First Book on Aromatherapy\\&quot; by&lt;br /&gt;Rene</li>
            <li>this oil ships FAST!</li>
            <li>I first heard about it in a yoga class</li>
            <li>There is a difference between a lavender \\&quot;perfume oil\\&quot; (mostly synthetic) which smells much nicer than a pure essential oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Although strong smelling this product does a lot of things for the hair, toothaches and overall soothing to the body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lavender and tea tree oil are listed by a large number of aromatherapy sources as oils you can use undiluted.  </li>
            <li>Below is the original review that I wrote generally for Plantlife&#x27;s lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pure oils are not synthetic, and are responsible for the healing properties of oils.</li>
            <li>I use this pure (non-cosmetic) lavendar oil for massage; it&#x27;s very calming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t fade much as the soap cures, so you get what you&#x27;re expecting that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the aroma was not as I expected.... and no idea how many days I need to use to see benefits</li>
            <li>I tried this product, followed the directions like they said and was fast asleep.    </li>
            <li>This essential oil smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a very pleasing aroma and is a known calming agent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, packaged properly and was in the condition exactly described.</li>
            <li>But if you are using it for the first time, it&#x27;s always safest to dilute it a little with a carrier oil (like olive oil) before applying to the skin to be sure you don&#x27;t have a sensitivity to it.</li>
            <li>I woke up refreshed, energized and ready to go to work with a new attitude!    </li>
            <li>I mix it with sweet almond oil (which is scentless), vitamin E oil, and orange essential oil to create the sweetest floral fruity body oil.</li>
            <li>It helps keep me alert (in particular after lunch when feeling groggy), and perks up my mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I add a few drops (bottle included the plastic inset dropper) to my bath water and the scent is very fragrant without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I found both to be of high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because I read in a health magazine that if you rub some right down the center along spine of your dog it would calm them - kind of lull them to relax and be quiet.</li>
            <li>This bottle of 100% pure lavender essential oil doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like lavender to me.</li>
            <li>But it is kind of hard to take the smell off your hands.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this lavender essential oil to anyone interested in making soap.</li>
            <li>This is my second order and once again I received my products very fast.</li>
            <li>This is my first essential oil purchase</li>
            <li>This is for a project I am making and it requires 100% pure essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Pure Essential Oil to put in my homemade liquid laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>have ordered this oil twice, for use in cold process soap, and it is great for that.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is a steal of a deal, really, for 30 ml, which is another reason it is great for making soap--it definitely cuts costs without cutting quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes to natural health.</li>
            <li>Plantlife products are all Natural with \\&quot;NO\\&quot; harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I sent this to my ill sister and she was delighted with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only just recently starting getting into oils and aromatherapy but just a whiff of this oil really helps to alleviate any stress or anxiety.</li>
            <li>I use Plantlife Lavender Essential Oil in an atomizer near my computer work station.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Young Living&#x27;s lavender essential oil and now this brand (Plant Life).  </li>
            <li>years later I found myself having sleeping issues and using it to help get back into normal sleep cycles</li>
            <li>...don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I drop some on a Qtip and guide along back - she lays down - not anxious!!</li>

            <li> Although strong smelling this product does a lot of things for the hair, toothaches and overall soothing to the body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lavender and tea tree oil are listed by a large number of aromatherapy sources as oils you can use undiluted.  </li>
            <li> Below is the original review that I wrote generally for Plantlife&#x27;s lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pure oils are not synthetic, and are responsible for the healing properties of oils.</li>
            <li> I use this pure (non-cosmetic) lavendar oil for massage; it&#x27;s very calming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t fade much as the soap cures, so you get what you&#x27;re expecting that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the aroma was not as I expected.... and no idea how many days I need to use to see benefits</li>
            <li> I tried this product, followed the directions like they said and was fast asleep.    </li>
            <li> This essential oil smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a very pleasing aroma and is a known calming agent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, packaged properly and was in the condition exactly described.</li>
            <li> But if you are using it for the first time, it&#x27;s always safest to dilute it a little with a carrier oil (like olive oil) before applying to the skin to be sure you don&#x27;t have a sensitivity to it.</li>
            <li> I woke up refreshed, energized and ready to go to work with a new attitude!    </li>
            <li> I mix it with sweet almond oil (which is scentless), vitamin E oil, and orange essential oil to create the sweetest floral fruity body oil.</li>
            <li> It helps keep me alert (in particular after lunch when feeling groggy), and perks up my mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I add a few drops (bottle included the plastic inset dropper) to my bath water and the scent is very fragrant without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I found both to be of high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read in a health magazine that if you rub some right down the center along spine of your dog it would calm them - kind of lull them to relax and be quiet.</li>
            <li> This bottle of 100% pure lavender essential oil doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like lavender to me.</li>
            <li> But it is kind of hard to take the smell off your hands.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this lavender essential oil to anyone interested in making soap.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and once again I received my products very fast.</li>
            <li> This is my first essential oil purchase</li>
            <li> This is for a project I am making and it requires 100% pure essential oil.  </li>
            <li> Pure Essential Oil to put in my homemade liquid laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> have ordered this oil twice, for use in cold process soap, and it is great for that.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is a steal of a deal, really, for 30 ml, which is another reason it is great for making soap--it definitely cuts costs without cutting quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes to natural health.</li>
            <li> Plantlife products are all Natural with \\&quot;NO\\&quot; harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my ill sister and she was delighted with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just recently starting getting into oils and aromatherapy but just a whiff of this oil really helps to alleviate any stress or anxiety.</li>
            <li> I use Plantlife Lavender Essential Oil in an atomizer near my computer work station.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Young Living&#x27;s lavender essential oil and now this brand (Plant Life).  </li>
            <li> years later I found myself having sleeping issues and using it to help get back into normal sleep cycles</li>
            <li> ...don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I drop some on a Qtip and guide along back - she lays down - not anxious!!</li>
            <li> I used it on my yoga stuff this week and the scent really last a long time.</li>
            <li> Oatmeal seems to go well with lavender because it gives the soap some texture, but it isn&#x27;t gritty the way some other things might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is calming, and like some of the other reviewers noted, it works well when added to a cotton ball next to your pillow to give you restful sleep.</li>
            <li> Thay may be used in small quantities in perfumes, but usually synthetics are used because essential oil is very \\&quot;volatile\\&quot;</li>
            <li> : I add water, drops of lavender and orange oil (or any other essential oil) to an empty squirt bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that when I use this essential oil in our soap I like to also add a little bit of oatmeal to the soap.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible lol.</li>
            <li> couple other things--</li>
            <li> Below are some of the other uses for lavender that</li>
            <li> know there are hundreds of other uses for lavender oil</li>
            <li> It mixes well with other unscented oils and some scented oils.</li>
            <li> and it is the second time I purchased this amount in the past</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle at work, squeeze a few drops on a tissue paper, and it seems to freshen up my office and mood.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops is I need for either in my bath or to freshen a room.</li>
            <li> It also included a small bar of peppermint soap to sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heals small wounds, cuts and burns.</li>
            <li> rub a little of the oil on to my horse&#x27;s chest area, and dab a little behind his ears.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again, I&#x27;ll try some other oil.</li>
            <li> This little bottle is expensive, but it has lasted me over a year.</li>
            <li> I like to put it on my wrists at night and behind my ears like a perfume before I braid my hair at night.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my wrists and behind my ears like perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s borderline unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I got a bad batch, or if it&#x27;s this species of lavender, or if all lavender oils smell this way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the reviews, but I was very disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gives you a lot of bang for the buck. Smells great and is much cheaper than similar lavender oils out there.</li>
            <li> There is a difference between a lavender \\&quot;perfume oil\\&quot; (mostly synthetic) which smells much nicer than a pure essential oil. Pure oils are not synthetic, and are responsible for the healing properties of oils. Thay may be used in small quantities in perfumes, but usually synthetics are used because essential oil is very \\&quot;volatile\\&quot; (meaning it evaporates quickly). The purity of this oil is excellent and great for all uses requiring a pure essential oil. As a licensed aromatherapist (UK &amp; NZ), I am quite happy with this oil-it is a great value for the price. Also recommended is : \\&quot;Gattefosse&#x27;s Aromatherapy: The First Book on Aromatherapy\\&quot; by&lt;br /&gt;Rene-Maurice Gattefosse (Author), Robert B. Tisserand (Editor) ~ a wonderful book that explains the \\&quot;science\\&quot; behind Aromatherapy &amp; it&#x27;s discovery by the chemist (1880&#x27;s) Gattefosse.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Received the oil quickly.  It was packaged very well.  It also included a small bar of peppermint soap to sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> Although strong smelling this product does a lot of things for the hair, toothaches and overall soothing to the body.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to make bath salts with. The product smells great my only problem is that about a 3rd of the bottle spilled in shipment. Seems like they should find a better way to ship it.</li>
            <li> This lavender essential oil is perfect for making soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this oil twice, for use in cold process soap, and it is great for that.  It&#x27;s good because when you make soap you need essential oil that is 100% pure, and this stuff is.  The scent doesn&#x27;t fade much as the soap cures, so you get what you&#x27;re expecting that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that when I use this essential oil in our soap I like to also add a little bit of oatmeal to the soap. Oatmeal seems to go well with lavender because it gives the soap some texture, but it isn&#x27;t gritty the way some other things might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple other things-- this oil ships FAST! Both times I ordered it arrived very quickly, and well packaged.  Also, it is a steal of a deal, really, for 30 ml, which is another reason it is great for making soap--it definitely cuts costs without cutting quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this lavender essential oil to anyone interested in making soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product I ordered and the service was fast. Along with this bottle of oil I received a complimentary bar of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; soup. I liked that very much!</li>
            <li> I wish I knew more about how the grow and distill this product so I knew if I am truly getting the best, as you are in Young Living Essential Oils.  Lavender is a must have, along with tea tree and peppermint. Yes to natural health.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, you can never go wrong when you buy Plantlife...I use it in my bath, burn it in my difuser, put alittle under my pillow...just so may great ways to use this oil.</li>
            <li> I bought it to smooth my baby at bed time because i heard it worked. I don&#x27;t think it really helped my baby to sleep better, but still the product has a very nice small. But it is kind of hard to take the smell off your hands. I still use it because i lie the smell. So i will give it a 4 starts.</li>
            <li> The essential oil based products I purchase through Amazon.com and Plantlife are most wonderful. Plantlife products are all Natural with \\&quot;NO\\&quot; harmful ingredients. I use Plantlife Lavender Essential Oil in an atomizer near my computer work station. It has a calming effect for me and allows me to think more creatively while doing my graphics work and online research.</li>
            <li> Lavender is the superhero of essential oils in my book. And Plantlife&#x27;s product is consistent, of good quality and ships quickly. I&#x27;ve ordered Lavender oil from Plantlife 2 to 3 times now and am completely satisfied. In our house, we use lavender oil in everything from diffusers to face cleanser to hand soap. Great stuff and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lavender oil.  Great for stress and a good night sleep.  Delivery is very fast and accurate.  Love the samples and tips sent along with your order.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil. The bottle is a nice size too. I use it to provide a sense of calm in my home for me and my pets.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, packaged properly and was in the condition exactly described. I received a trial size soap sliver too.  This is for a project I am making and it requires 100% pure essential oil.  No substitutes would suffice.   Will order from vendor again.</li>
            <li> The more, the merrier.  After first purchasing, the small 1/3 oz of this lavender oil, I decided to upgrade my buys to the 1 oz bottles.  I can&#x27;t seem to get enough of this oil.  I keep a bottle at work, squeeze a few drops on a tissue paper, and it seems to freshen up my office and mood.  One of my coworkers commented once at my desk that my area smells like an aroma therapy spa.  I had to smile.  Below is the original review that I wrote generally for Plantlife&#x27;s lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love lavender oil, and when I used up my first bottle of it, I decided to check out the lavender oils available on Amazon. This Plantlife brand of oil smells great! It is calming, and like some of the other reviewers noted, it works well when added to a cotton ball next to your pillow to give you restful sleep. Below are some of the other uses for lavender that I use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Homemade body sugar scrub: I use my favorite homemade sugar scrub recipe and add drops of lavender to the mix. It smells so delicious and feels great in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Body Mist: I add water, drops of lavender and orange oil (or any other essential oil) to an empty squirt bottle. I use it to freshen up a room and when at work and I&#x27;m staring at the computer screen, I spray a couple of squirts in the air as a refresher. It feels heavenly. It helps keep me alert (in particular after lunch when feeling groggy), and perks up my mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Homemade body oil: This is one of my favorite uses of lavender oil. I mix it with sweet almond oil (which is scentless), vitamin E oil, and orange essential oil to create the sweetest floral fruity body oil. I rub it all over my body after a shower, and it feels so therapeutic. It&#x27;s a great start to a day or the best nightcap before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are hundreds of other uses for lavender oil (and I&#x27;m going to check them out). I am very pleased with this lavender oil and my uses of it. I give this oil my HIGHEST Recommendation. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Years ago I began putting Lavender Oil underneath my pillows at night to help me sleep, years later I found myself having sleeping issues and using it to help get back into normal sleep cycles...works great!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the Lavender 100% Pure Essential Oil to put in my homemade liquid laundry detergent. I love the smell and it worked wonderfully in the laundry detergent, so pleased!</li>
            <li> I am a huge lavender fan! This bottle of 100% pure lavender essential oil doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like lavender to me. I have many lavender products but this lavender scent is not what I am familiar with. I cannot pinpoint what it smells like...don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still a nice scent. I&#x27;ll still use it but will look elsewhere for another lavender oil.</li>
            <li> I love using lavender products on my face to calm and sooth me ... I first heard about it in a yoga class so i purchased this and i love it !</li>
            <li> The health benefits of lavender essential oil include its ability to remove nervous tension, relieve pain, disinfect scalp and skin, lower blood pressure and treat respiratory problems. I use lavender oil for various skin ailments.  It works wonders on eczema and even clears up psoraisis.  It heals small wounds, cuts and burns. If I have an acne breakout, I put a couple drops of lavender oil on my skin and it begins clearing overnight.  It truly is an amazing and powerful oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Young Living&#x27;s lavender essential oil and now this brand (Plant Life).  I found both to be of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender and tea tree oil are listed by a large number of aromatherapy sources as oils you can use undiluted.  But if you are using it for the first time, it&#x27;s always safest to dilute it a little with a carrier oil (like olive oil) before applying to the skin to be sure you don&#x27;t have a sensitivity to it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the reviews, but I was very disappointed.  It smells like medicine - not lavender.  I will be throwing this away and looking elsewhere for another brand.</li>
            <li> A great product for my needs . Smells wonderful . A good brand ! I will buymore from this manufacturer .</li>
            <li> I sent this to my ill sister and she was delighted with it. She finds it helps her to relax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just recently starting getting into oils and aromatherapy but just a whiff of this oil really helps to alleviate any stress or anxiety. I like to put it on my wrists at night and behind my ears like a perfume before I braid my hair at night. My hands inevitably rub off some lavender oil in my hair and when I let my braid out in the morning, I can still smell this lavender oil! Love it</li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is unbeatable. I use it for perfume sometimes! It mixes well with other unscented oils and some scented oils. It would work if one were making scented candles.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and once again I received my products very fast. Also included were cute little body wash and herbal soap samples which I LOVE!  Be sure to take advantage of their bundle packages (ie.Lavenender+Rosemary) for incredible savings. Wonderful products from a great company!</li>
            <li> I love the lavender smell of this product, and I have been using it in my aromatherapy mister.  I have found that I need to use more then the suggested amount however. I&#x27;m glad I got a fairly big bottle of this and its worth the price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic oil for making Cloud Dough which relaxes children who need to relax.</li>
            <li> I read where lavender oil would keep mosquitoes away. I haven&#x27;t been able to test it so far because of all the flooding in Oklahoma. I am sure it will be put to good use when I am able to go out. Lord knows I will need it then.</li>
            <li> It did give me the stress releiving aroma...but the aroma was not as I expected.... and no idea how many days I need to use to see benefits</li>
            <li> Great product and speedy delivery. I&#x27;m using it as a bath soak, along with epson salt and baking soda. It&#x27;s a recipe I found on facebook.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a more pleasant aroma.  It&#x27;s borderline unpleasant.  This is my first essential oil purchase so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I got a bad batch, or if it&#x27;s this species of lavender, or if all lavender oils smell this way. Needless to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again, I&#x27;ll try some other oil.</li>
            <li> Great product enjoy using it and it is the second time I purchased this amount in the past I have used other oils, I like the amount they give for the price I paid, and it really is a good product and I have told family and friends.</li>
            <li> I am an elementary teacher and stressed many days I leave work.    I tried this product, followed the directions like they said and was fast asleep.    I woke up refreshed, energized and ready to go to work with a new attitude!    Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This essential oil smells fabulous. I actually used it to make a carpet freshener and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use this pure (non-cosmetic) lavendar oil for massage; it&#x27;s very calming.&lt;br /&gt;I rub a little of the oil on to my horse&#x27;s chest area, and dab a little behind his ears. It seems to have a calming effect, although I have not yet tried it under pressure (such as at shows or on trails).  It&#x27;s has a very pleasing aroma and is a known calming agent.</li>
            <li> husband loves this--bought for him to use on his martial arts ghee (sp)</li>
            <li> My skin broke out and I could not sue</li>
            <li> Améo are the newest, purest oils on the market.  Here&#x27;s a great site for checking out what they&#x27;re about:  www.amezingooils.com</li>
            <li> I love it! The essential oils have wonderful properties. The aroma is great and it brings a feeling of calm and relaxation. Pricing is good as well as quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I read that some people did not like the smell of this oil.  I think you have to try it and let it calm a bit before coming to that conclusion.  I think it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> ok quality - will probably not order again</li>
            <li> shipping was fast the scent is great and the oil is high quality and i add it to my home made bath salts</li>
            <li> Purchased to solve a problem that I&#x27;ve now solved another way.  One of these days I will experiment to see what else I can do with it.</li>
            <li> Appears to be good quality product and I use it for lots of things. Amazon had the best price for the amount at the time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful aroma.  Used it to help me sleep.  I put it on before bed...on my temples and it lulled me.  Wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this item!  I used it on my yoga stuff this week and the scent really last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was having muscle pain and a friend recommended Lavender Oil.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine that it would work but it was amazing.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in hair products that I concoct, I use it at night to relax me enough to fall asleep.  It does the job, I wake up refreshed after a good night&#x27;s rest and it gets more so as I use it.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the REAL essential oil but it works for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using essential oils for 3 year. This product is a pure oil quality oil for a good price.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this Lavender oil! And also how it helps ease the migraines and back aches! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this has a very rich aroma of lavender.  Just a few drops is I need for either in my bath or to freshen a room.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend and she tells me that it&#x27;s really worth. Relax&#x27;s the body and helps sleep better.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read in a health magazine that if you rub some right down the center along spine of your dog it would calm them - kind of lull them to relax and be quiet. IT WORKS - I drop some on a Qtip and guide along back - she lays down - not anxious!!</li>
            <li> Smells horrible lol. Bought it to try and help my 2 year old sleep better, didnt work at all. Lol.</li>
            <li> PERFECT for a soothing bath to relax at night! I also use it on my wrists and behind my ears like perfume. It is so relaxing!</li>
            <li> I use this product to reduce my headache and stress.  I like the smell and would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> This little bottle is expensive, but it has lasted me over a year. I add a few drops (bottle included the plastic inset dropper) to my bath water and the scent is very fragrant without being overwhelming. Perfect for a relaxing bath. Just add candles!</li>
            <li> Worked well on a cut on my hand.  I use in sleep recipes as well</li>
