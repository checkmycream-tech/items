            <li> I LOVE this case. It fits perfectly and it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li> It did not fit my phone.....tried to return it and nobody ever got back to me ðŸ˜•</li>
            <li> Actually came faster than I thought THANK YOU really good</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> The case came inside a plastic that was inside the standard shipping plastic. The outside of the pastiche was fine. One I opened the shipping plastic the inside of that was fine but the inside of the plastic that the phone was in was wet and smelled horrid. I dared to open it a d it&#x27;s not regular water. The was also a cardboard insode the case that said note 4 but that was completely wer and stuck to the case in some spots. Pretty gross and a waste cause now I&#x27;m just going to throw the case out.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, super cute. Love it. It&#x27;s not really for drop protection, but i rarely drop my phone. For the price, it&#x27;s perfect. I like the slim look look and the softness - it feels like gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, delivery took maybe 1-2 weeks, but I knew it was going to take some time and was fine. It came quicker than I had imagined though.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.. so cute an fits perfectly</li>
            <li> I purchased this case for my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 to use as a protection case for my phone but the case is very poor quality. It&#x27;s a very weak texture and material, and the phone is not well protected. However the picture of the owl is cute but the case it self is not worth having. ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> This phone case is great.&lt;br /&gt;all around protection for my device.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this case. Wish it had more color options.</li>
            <li> I love this case. It&#x27;s so slim and fits my Verizon note perfectly. Adorable picture too. It&#x27;s a little thin and doesn&#x27;t come quite as high as the lens but still love it</li>
            <li> Adorabe, fits great, long time to ship.</li>
            <li> Awesome case! It&#x27;s very cute and fits nicely. Decent protection. Much better than a more expensive case I&#x27;ve purchased for my Note 4. So far I love it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she loves it. The case itself is not the best of all but you get what you paid for. Personally I think buyers should read the description of the case before buying it. But they rather complain afterwards.</li>
            <li> Only had it on a few weeks and there&#x27;s a spot on the back that is peeling. Looks cute and fits well though.</li>
            <li> Fits snugly but not 100% perfect. Overall I am happy with this cover.</li>
