            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this merchandise</li>
            <li>Awesome colors too!</li>
            <li>While the description says, \\&quot;Perfect for professionals or</li>
            <li>the colours are beautiful.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re beautiful colors, but they don&#x27;t seem to work with an LED lamp.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful.  </li>
            <li>If anyone has advise to share that would be great.</li>
            <li>and it still isn&#x27;t good color.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the colors, BUT, SHANY does not do a good job of explaining what you need to do to get a good gel manicure.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It sets better than the ones I got, no gummy feeling!</li>
            <li>Per Amazon, \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The colors are good, and if you can figure out how to work with them, the results are fine.  </li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, and I would love to give it a higher rating, but its as if I am spreading taffy on my nails.</li>
            <li>I love the colors</li>
            <li>I will returing them for sure.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying 4 or 5 colors you like from gelish and just using those.</li>
            <li>sincerely hereby want to do my formal claim of the product that I received</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the price when I first ordered them, as there are so many colors!</li>
            <li>I did read another persons review who said to warm them by setting the container in hot water.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s all stuck together, bizarre.</li>
            <li>I received my nail polishes today, I was so excited until I opened the box.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this set of gel polish.  </li>
            <li>are all dirty watered most voted the box arrived in perfect condition but got voted most enamels</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of those situations where it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Was delivered quickly but when it arrived one of the jars had leaked all over the box.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do my nails often enough to warrant a big bottle of polish, so these were perfect.</li>
            <li>I use gel polish all the time and thought I&#x27;d check this brand out because of the amazing colors and low price.</li>
            <li>After adding acetone to the container to thin it out it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>polish, once dried with the nice UV light I have, lasted maybe 3 days before it started to peel.</li>
            <li>Even the few bright colors go on dully when applied</li>
            <li>I think because Shany made the mistake of putting them in clear containers where the light can get to them.</li>
            <li>The only problem I ran into was because there are so many colors to choose from I</li>
            <li>anyway it is fast shipping tho</li>
            <li>They Are very nice regular dry times like any other gel polish with UV light</li>
            <li>Very cheap as compared to buying 24 bottles of gelish or other UV gel polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I had read the information more closely and hadn&#x27;t spent the money!</li>
            <li>once everything was cured, it was still practically my normal nail color, with just a light sheen of blue on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product but it cures great in about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Just got the the uv lamp and a few gel polish for Xmas, and decided to get this set bc it had more colors.</li>
            <li>I did 4 coats of a blue color I thought was pretty, and</li>
            <li>most of the polishes were spilled a real mess</li>
            <li>Was a huge mess.</li>
            <li>I love the product got it and every item had been used and hardly any left in the containers.</li>
            <li>When I was finally able to get it on, the finish was very dull.</li>
            <li>does if you&#x27;re not perfectly careful.  </li>
            <li>Having such a hard time trying to clean them.</li>
            <li>They did soak off as well no harder than soaking off my regular gel polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Colors don&#x27;t come out bold, even after multiple coats, like gelish polishes do.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts less than a week, as compared to the 3 weeks I can get from gelish or other UV gel</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s stringy when you pull the brush out, as if it&#x27;s very old and slightly dried out, as you would notice from a normal bottle of polish after a month or so of having the cap loose.)</li>

            <li> (It&#x27;s stringy when you pull the brush out, as if it&#x27;s very old and slightly dried out, as you would notice from a normal bottle of polish after a month or so of having the cap loose.)</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this polish but upon receiving it, I was very disappointed to see that the polish was so old that it was in solid form and on top of that it didn&#x27;t come with a brush.</li>
            <li> having to paint my nails every three days is a mess, I might as well go back to normal polish.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know yet how long it will last</li>
            <li> They are pretty thick, and take some spreading with the brush to get the glitter to even out.</li>
            <li> When I received the package, I opened the first box and looked that some of the nail polish containers must of been broken, since I saw nail polish leaking through the bubble wrapping.</li>
            <li> so I suggest to use pure acetone to thin out before applying</li>
            <li> One jar is completely empty.</li>
            <li> So I got these and tried a few on with my regular gel polish.</li>
            <li> If the polish lasts two weeks, then these complaints are minimal.  </li>
            <li> thick, possibly old, polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 12 of them had leaked out and painted the other jars.</li>
            <li> Some broke it, not exactly what I espected</li>
            <li> Unlike all other nail polish these do not include a brush within the cap.</li>
            <li> not easy to spread if you are not a professional.</li>
            <li> Consistence is just not right.</li>
            <li> so NOT worth the $40 AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the Shany base and top coat</li>
            <li> LOTS of information and other product is missing (base coat, top coat, instructions, etc..)</li>
            <li> Be careful when opening the product the protective seal is not easy to remove.</li>
            <li> extremely thick and just a big mess.</li>
            <li> I left it just a little thick which makes it stay put and not pool on the edges like some gel polish</li>
            <li> Plus the tubs leak, casing a sticky messy mess.</li>
            <li> They are a little stink to work with</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and it will not dry under the UV light as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money buy these....</li>
            <li> The polished came in broken and leaked all over the box, receipt and all the colors are mixed.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be similar to other nail polishes, but these were very thick and gooey!  </li>
            <li> this items don&#x27;t come with the brush to apply and it hard to use must buy other items so it could work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a little maneuvering, I got the hang of twisting the brush around a few times, as to catch the &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; of the thick polish.</li>
            <li> disappointment and waste of nearly $50.00.</li>
            <li> Once I used them though, I was very, very disappointed, as I was with most all shany products I bought.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to spread the polish because it is much too thick to spread.</li>
            <li> The description also fails to state that bottles are a fraction of the size of regular nail polish bottles.  </li>
            <li> The colors themselves are very bland once you have them on, as it&#x27;s hard to darken them by adding coats.</li>
            <li> The colors are dull and not even close to what is pictured here.  </li>
            <li> had a hard time picking which ones to use.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the containers, I realized the polish was so thick and sticky, I could hardly get it on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is too thick or something.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick, adding thinner doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> it was so thick and sticky</li>
            <li> Polish is really thick</li>
            <li> I got these for Christmas and was so excited but then became very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The gel is too thick to spread on her nails.  </li>
            <li> They are really thick, but go on well with brushes.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it was way to thick to spread when I received it.  </li>
            <li> it was thick like toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Just too hard to deal with!  </li>
            <li> It is very thick.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> The polish is a thick goo that seemed impossible to apply a thin, even coat without brush lines.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with my purchase, and with Shany products in general.</li>
            <li> Very hard to work with!  </li>
            <li> you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this deal.</li>
            <li> very annoyed that this is not returnable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to add any thinner to it yet, as my experience with the colors were so disappointing</li>
            <li> of color choices.&lt;br /&gt;Not badly sized containers.</li>
            <li> it just got in bad shape</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find one of the bottles in the set had leaked out in shipping.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received the package I was disappointed to find that there was no brush included.  </li>
            <li> My bad!  </li>
            <li> How disappointing!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the delivery of this product.</li>

            <li> Product leaked everywhere before I even received it it is very sticky and goes on only for a few days</li>
            <li> This stuff is too thick or something. Consistence is just not right. I use gel polish all the time and thought I&#x27;d check this brand out because of the amazing colors and low price. It&#x27;s too thick, adding thinner doesn&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s like a glob that&#x27;s all stuck together, bizarre. Plus the tubs leak, casing a sticky messy mess.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is so sticky. It smells horrible and it will not dry under the UV light as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> this set leaked everywhere. it was so thick and sticky I would not recomend</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but it cures great in about 1 minute. Polish is really thick so I suggest to use pure acetone to thin out before applying</li>
            <li> I received my nail polishes today, I was so excited until I opened the box. 12 of them had leaked out and painted the other jars. Having such a hard time trying to clean them. One jar is completely empty. Very disappointed in the delivery of this product.</li>
            <li> Some broke it, not exactly what I espected</li>
            <li> So I got these and tried a few on with my regular gel polish. They Are very nice regular dry times like any other gel polish with UV light They did soak off as well no harder than soaking off my regular gel polish. I don&#x27;t have any repeat colors. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Gel polish at the store is 9-22 dollars a piece you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this deal. .... They are a little stink to work with but besides that no complaints.the consistancy is that of tooth paste.</li>
            <li> It is very thick. not easy to spread if you are not a professional. Be careful when opening the product the protective seal is not easy to remove. the colours are beautiful.</li>
            <li> containers were leaking when i got them.</li>
            <li> Was delivered quickly but when it arrived one of the jars had leaked all over the box. Was a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I got these for Christmas and was so excited but then became very disappointed. I have been trying for the last 3 months to figure out how to keep the polish on my nails longer than 3 days. If anyone has advise to share that would be great. I love the colors and I can work around the thickness but having to paint my nails every three days is a mess, I might as well go back to normal polish.</li>
            <li> The polished came in broken and leaked all over the box, receipt and all the colors are mixed. No one will contact me regarding this matter!!! I would like a refund.</li>
            <li> Unlike all other nail polish these do not include a brush within the cap. I bought three sets and UV lights for my daughter and daughter&#x27;s -in -law. I was disappointed to find one of the bottles in the set had leaked out in shipping. Not one has tried out the polish because the need ti purchase brushes. How disappointing!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re beautiful colors, but they don&#x27;t seem to work with an LED lamp. They are pretty thick, and take some spreading with the brush to get the glitter to even out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommed this product at all,  within 3 days the color was peeing off.  I will returing them for sure.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, BUT, SHANY does not do a good job of explaining what you need to do to get a good gel manicure. LOTS of information and other product is missing (base coat, top coat, instructions, etc..)</li>
            <li> the get chips, but will use it for French tips only</li>
            <li> When I received the package, I opened the first box and looked that some of the nail polish containers must of been broken, since I saw nail polish leaking through the bubble wrapping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this merchandise</li>
            <li> so transparent you need like 5 coats and it still isn&#x27;t good color. extremely thick and just a big mess. very annoyed that this is not returnable. so NOT worth the $40 AT ALL.</li>
            <li> My daughter just tried to apply this gel polish she received for Christmas.  The gel is too thick to spread on her nails.  Since the item cannot be returned, we are very unhappy with our purchase!</li>
            <li> this items don&#x27;t come with the brush to apply and it hard to use must buy other items so it could work.</li>
            <li> Just got the the uv lamp and a few gel polish for Xmas, and decided to get this set bc it had more colors. I love it! It sets better than the ones I got, no gummy feeling! Awesome colors too!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to spread the polish because it is much too thick to spread. The colors are beautiful, and I would love to give it a higher rating, but its as if I am spreading taffy on my nails. When I was finally able to get it on, the finish was very dull. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT AND IT IS NOT AT ALL USABLE, A TEASPOON IN EACH CONTAINER. NOT HAPPY AT ALL</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the price when I first ordered them, as there are so many colors! I don&#x27;t do my nails often enough to warrant a big bottle of polish, so these were perfect. Once I used them though, I was very, very disappointed, as I was with most all shany products I bought. Upon opening the containers, I realized the polish was so thick and sticky, I could hardly get it on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a little maneuvering, I got the hang of twisting the brush around a few times, as to catch the &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; of the thick polish. (It&#x27;s stringy when you pull the brush out, as if it&#x27;s very old and slightly dried out, as you would notice from a normal bottle of polish after a month or so of having the cap loose.) I haven&#x27;t tried to add any thinner to it yet, as my experience with the colors were so disappointing, I haven&#x27;t done my nails again with it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish, once dried with the nice UV light I have, lasted maybe 3 days before it started to peel. The colors themselves are very bland once you have them on, as it&#x27;s hard to darken them by adding coats. I did 4 coats of a blue color I thought was pretty, and once everything was cured, it was still practically my normal nail color, with just a light sheen of blue on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap. Very cheap as compared to buying 24 bottles of gelish or other UV gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of color choices.&lt;br /&gt;Not badly sized containers. You could get probably 10 or so manicures out of each color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very thick, possibly old, polish.&lt;br /&gt;Colors don&#x27;t come out bold, even after multiple coats, like gelish polishes do.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts less than a week, as compared to the 3 weeks I can get from gelish or other UV gel polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I suggest passing over this. You&#x27;re better off buying 4 or 5 colors you like from gelish and just using those. I&#x27;m very disappointed with my purchase, and with Shany products in general.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this polish but upon receiving it, I was very disappointed to see that the polish was so old that it was in solid form and on top of that it didn&#x27;t come with a brush. This is definitely one of those situations where it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the rest of the reviews.  The colors are dull and not even close to what is pictured here.  They are really thick, but go on well with brushes.  Even the few bright colors go on dully when applied (I even used 4 coats)...lesson learned</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this set of gel polish.  The colors are beautiful.  As soon as I received the package I was disappointed to find that there was no brush included.  While the description says, \\&quot;Perfect for professionals or amateurs - use shany up gel brushes and up lamp\\&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t specify that no brush is included.  The description also fails to state that bottles are a fraction of the size of regular nail polish bottles.  \\&quot;Oh well\\&quot;, I thought.  If the polish lasts two weeks, then these complaints are minimal.  After buying a brush from a local beauty supply store, I tried to apply the polish.  Only one word could properly describe the consistency of it:  tar.  It was awful!  The polish is a thick goo that seemed impossible to apply a thin, even coat without brush lines.  I gave up and repackaged the polish so that I can return it.  Per Amazon, \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com\\&quot;.  What??? You can sell it and ship it but not accept returns?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge disappointment and waste of nearly $50.00.</li>
            <li> sincerely hereby want to do my formal claim of the product that I received it just got in bad shape are all dirty watered most voted the box arrived in perfect condition but got voted most enamels</li>
            <li> most of the polishes were spilled a real mess</li>
            <li> Yes, it was way to thick to spread when I received it.  I think because Shany made the mistake of putting them in clear containers where the light can get to them. BUT!  After adding acetone to the container to thin it out it was perfect.  I left it just a little thick which makes it stay put and not pool on the edges like some gel polish does if you&#x27;re not perfectly careful.  I&#x27;ve only had it on for a day so I don&#x27;t know yet how long it will last I will update that later.  I didn&#x27;t have the Shany base and top coat so I used my Gelish ones.  The only problem I ran into was because there are so many colors to choose from I had a hard time picking which ones to use.</li>
            <li> I bought these colors to go with my UV gel curer.  I thought they would be similar to other nail polishes, but these were very thick and gooey!  Very hard to work with!  I did read another persons review who said to warm them by setting the container in hot water.  That helped quite a bit, but I still don&#x27;t care for them.  The colors are good, and if you can figure out how to work with them, the results are fine.  Just too hard to deal with!  I wanted to return them, but I hadn&#x27;t read the &amp;#34;fine print&amp;#34; when I purchased them that said they were non-returnable.  My bad!  I wish I had read the information more closely and hadn&#x27;t spent the money!</li>
            <li> Item took forever to show up. When it did arrive no color was usable it was thick like toothpaste. Stuck a toothpick in it to try and stir it and came out in one big blob</li>
