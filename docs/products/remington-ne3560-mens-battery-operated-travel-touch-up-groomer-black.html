            <li>Good Buy</li>
            <li>Battery powered devices like these are never any good.</li>
            <li>Good for ears,nose and those pesky eye brows.  </li>
            <li>But,if it won&#x27;t turn on reliably it isn&#x27;t much good is</li>
            <li>GOod Product for trims</li>
            <li>Fulfilled the expectations, it is a good product and it arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>I loved the adjustable guard, I like my arm hair a 3, pits a 2 and under carriage a 1.</li>
            <li>It is quite comfortable for trimming nose hairs and comes with an assortment of attachments that will allow you to trim and look your best.</li>

            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>It does a very nice job of removing hair &amp; easy to handle</li>
            <li>Good Times :)</li>
            <li>Thanks Remington for a great product !!!!!</li>
            <li>The biggest fault is that there are no directions suggesting technique for using it effectively.</li>
            <li>tidy.</li>
            <li>it comes with a battery, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>does a good job and safe.....</li>
            <li>I was lucky to see this item at my Friend&#x27;s house, for which he did strongly advise me to purchase it as it is excellent</li>
            <li>also it is a very cute and stylish case</li>
            <li>This by far is the easiest best way I have found.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s STILL very important to me.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy to have received such a great product and for very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking care of the customers.</li>
            <li>My favorite groomer.</li>
            <li>However, after having used this one, I prefer the Conair I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>Okay, it says I have to say more...</li>
            <li>This item is a thousand times better than the rotary one that I used to use.  </li>
            <li>The Remington Ne3560 Travel Touch Up Groomer is fantastic !  </li>
            <li>seems like it did an ok job the 2 times they worked.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>Too many plastic parts.</li>
            <li>In a fraction of the time I used to take, these clippers do an outstanding job.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I bought one of these a year or so ago and it worked Ok until it quit.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and it does the work of something that you would think makes much more noise.</li>
            <li>Husband love this item</li>
            <li>All trimmers using AAA batteries could not supply enough power to cut my hairs and this one using a AA battery does perfect.</li>
            <li>Very useful!</li>
            <li>It works great and does th job way better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>payed $13 including shipping, and I have to say that it&#x27;s the best $13 I&#x27;ve spent in years.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t consider it adequate for anything more challenging.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is painless, and very quick to finish the nose trim.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Light and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Trims</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to keep sanitized.</li>
            <li>What more can I say it is most useful.</li>
            <li>and heads switch out easily</li>
            <li>My husband needed a personal trimmer for sideburns and this works great for this as well as has attachments to do alot more.</li>
            <li>This groomer is sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li>I recommend this strongly.</li>
            <li>you need strong, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li>To be quite frankly, I have used many different products from different brands, but honestly I can say this is the best</li>
            <li>and it did a fine job.</li>
            <li>This groomer works just fine.  </li>
            <li>However, the little b-tard works great!</li>
            <li>Works fine, all attachments are very useful and work like they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li>This is the best tool by far for getting my nose totally clear of hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to keep clean and change attachments although I don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li>I bought it primarily to trim eyebrows, and I have to coax it along to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Feels cheap and fidgety.</li>
            <li>The plastic is definitely cheap.  </li>
            <li>This so called &amp;#34;Travel Touch Up Groomer&amp;#34; is just fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of ways to keep nostrils and ears smooth.</li>
            <li>product is so cheap</li>
            <li>Since I use it primarily for trimming nose hairs, I do this for hygiene purposes.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of great facial and hair trimmers, yet none have an attachment geared for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Gets a bit warm after it has been on for several minutes, but still does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>but when its clean it works fine.</li>
            <li>versatile and effective - i use this one all the time for trimming between cuts and find it to be of high quality</li>
            <li>Worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure its days are numbered</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always looking neat and clean....</li>
            <li>It tickles a lot at first in certain places, but works perfectly passing it around in one direction and then the opposite direction to get hairs growing in all directions.  </li>
            <li>It is a very useful accessory as it allows me to keep my good image and personal presence.</li>
            <li>This one does an OK job, but really does not excel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use it anymore because it&#x27;s aggravating and only good for trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li>I have used different &amp;#34;personal trimmers&amp;#34; but never found any to be that good.</li>
            <li>I like that it is battery operated as the rechargeable trimmers die quickly.</li>
            <li>quality.&lt;br /&gt;Battery goes quick, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Happily, I was quickly standing in a little furry circle of cast off hair in the bathtub.</li>
            <li>Happily, I was quickly standing in a little furry circle of cast off hair in the bathtub.</li>
            <li>This product works very well!!  </li>
            <li>It fit my needs very well.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li>works well and has useful attachments.  </li>
            <li>I put the nose piece back on, no go, but it was getting warm.</li>
            <li>I put the nose piece back on, no go, but it was getting warm.</li>
            <li>Thjis is the best of them, but still am not completely happy.  </li>
            <li>It takes many passes for me to completely trim those rogue nose hairs.</li>
            <li>the right amount of power&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great for those hard to get to places.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to do something along the lines of trimming a mustache or beard, from the looks of the included attachments, you might have a higher opinion of this trimmer than I do.</li>
            <li>It is pretty close shaving too.  </li>
            <li>If the blade gets &amp;#34;stuch&amp;#34; rotate the head off, start the motor and click the top back on, it will get it un-stuck.</li>
            <li>It was used only once and it wouldn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li>This one is in the first category.</li>
            <li>Most days when I start this thing up, I have to remove the head and put it back on just to get the motor spinning.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer and used it once; it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>first bought one of these at Wal-Mart and it lasted exactly two times before the on/off switch stopped functioning.</li>
            <li>and I thought the first one was just a lemon.  </li>
            <li>With a better switch this would be my favorite small trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Just like the first one I bought</li>
            <li>This cuts right through, so be careful.  :)</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it is sturdy and comes with a variety of heads.  </li>
            <li>This Remington is far superior and also has other attachments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few of these type things, and this has a good feeling about it - high</li>
            <li>easy to operate, uses one AA battery and comes with several attachments.</li>
            <li>THe only con to this product is the trim level adjuster which will often come off easily.</li>
            <li>have used several styles of these small trimmers, and this one ids the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Again, I was sure there was a design flaw with the snap on adjustable piece, that it would become loose and give me a &#x27;1&#x27; shave when I wanted a &#x27;3&#x27; length.</li>
            <li>I was happy with it, but when I tried to use it again a few weeks later, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>This trimmer trims all areas very close without pain and pulling of the hairs.</li>
            <li>too much money for what you get</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this groomer to anyone!  </li>
            <li>I also grow nose hair as fast as a wookie.  </li>
            <li>this trimmer works absolutely to perfection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really cannot find one flaw at all, nothing but praise.  </li>
            <li>Buy this product as a gift for my wife and she likes me, so much colors recommended.</li>
            <li>Trims very close.</li>
            <li>That flaw is the on/off switch, which is very erratic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hedge trimmer can be used without the guard for a really close shave, though I admit to being nicked a couple times, but I&#x27;m curvy.</li>
            <li>But after looking around online, at stores, in friend&#x27;s cabinets, reading reviews and asking intimate details, I realised I was in for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered that it is not broken</li>
            <li>Thanks Remington</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed about the product.</li>
            <li>Well, this works very well for your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how this trimmer got such a good review from other people.  </li>
            <li>I love it for getting around in the ear a lot easier than my other clippers.</li>
            <li>Then, I took the nose trimmer off after putting in a new battery and miracle of miracles!</li>
            <li>Then, I took the nose trimmer off after putting in a new battery and miracle of miracles!</li>
            <li>Works really great for those places inside the nose that are hard to find with a regular razor</li>
            <li>Through the years he has used many of this type of groomer to trim the hair in and on his ears and they didn&#x27;t last or have the power to cut the coarse hairs.</li>
            <li>It is decent and does its job</li>
            <li>Just a quick swipe back and forth over the eyebrows and they look neat and well kempt!  </li>
            <li>nose hairs in particular were a bugger to trim.</li>
            <li>the exact same thing happened - it worked the first time and then never worked again.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer does a good job but the problem is the motor is weak.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who need to shape up their eye brows.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to everyone.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for cleaning out ears.</li>
            <li>As I age, my hair seems to move from my head down onto my ears and nose!  :-)  </li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer as a supplement to the one I normally use at home.</li>
            <li>Works great for the nose, or other areas that are small , you may need to get the hair out of , like even the ear .</li>
            <li>New batteries did not make a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thinking it needed a new battery, I put in a new one and it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I exchanged it for a new one and</li>
            <li>I was using a Micro touch for years and replaced it with the new Ultra Microtouch.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned in my previous reviews, I am not an easy man to please, i am so fussy to the point of being neurotic.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it could be pushed in if I was just jabbing away and pressing hard, but that&#x27;s the sweet thing about this little tool; the blades are sharp and the guard is designed to pick up the hair off the skin for easy trimming!</li>
            <li>I really like how accessible the cutting edge is for close cuts, and it really is safe without causing any nicks.</li>
            <li>There are a few attachments that comes with it and is easy to attach and detach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This means that while trimming sideburns for example, it may pop off and cause you to accidentally trim a large section forcing you to trim off the entire sideburn so you don&#x27;t look like a fool.</li>
            <li>I have used several other trimmers in the past, some of them great...</li>
            <li>This works very well and only uses 1 AA battery</li>
            <li>have contacted Reimington directly to see if they will replace the blade.</li>
            <li>SO FAR AS I&#x27;M CONCERNED.  </li>
            <li>Why does Amazon not sell them directly?</li>
            <li>I have never had a machine that worked nearly as well</li>
            <li>This gets all my nose hare and does not mess with my flesh.  </li>
            <li>First one broke, took it back and got a replacement and that one worked once - weeks later (today)</li>
            <li>This replaced an older model we had for several years.</li>
            <li>Between my sensitive skin, which I never let a razor touch, and my fear of blades in general, because they can cut.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I bought this almost 4 years ago, and was pretty sure I hated it most of the time, but ONLY because of the twist action on/off.</li>
            <li>This little razor makes it easy to eliminate those &amp;#34; I am an old man!&amp;#34; hairs from your nose and ears, and with the eyebrow attachment, there is no need on earth to have long scraggly hair over your eyes either!  </li>
            <li>Small in scope but very powerful and not too invasive.</li>
            <li>It is much much faster because it gets the hair cut in a single pass.</li>
            <li>When it comes to trimming hair in hard to reach places this one does a much better job than a few others I have tried, mostly the ones with a round end.</li>
            <li>It is much nicer than I expected, the pictures don&#x27;t it justice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m supprised that a 3rd grader has nose hair that young???</li>
            <li>Has good cutting power.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, compared to my other gadgets.</li>
            <li>spent a ton of money over the years in order to find a decent ear &amp; nose trimmer.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several other brands over the years and this one really works.  </li>
            <li>The thin profile makes it so easy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but this thing does way better!  </li>
            <li> We both love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> It does a very nice job of removing hair &amp; easy to handle</li>
            <li> Good Times :)</li>
            <li> Thanks Remington for a great product !!!!!</li>
            <li> The biggest fault is that there are no directions suggesting technique for using it effectively.</li>
            <li> tidy.</li>
            <li> it comes with a battery, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> does a good job and safe.....</li>
            <li> I was lucky to see this item at my Friend&#x27;s house, for which he did strongly advise me to purchase it as it is excellent</li>
            <li> also it is a very cute and stylish case</li>
            <li> This by far is the easiest best way I have found.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s STILL very important to me.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy to have received such a great product and for very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking care of the customers.</li>
            <li> My favorite groomer.</li>
            <li> However, after having used this one, I prefer the Conair I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> Okay, it says I have to say more...</li>
            <li> This item is a thousand times better than the rotary one that I used to use.  </li>
            <li> The Remington Ne3560 Travel Touch Up Groomer is fantastic !  </li>
            <li> seems like it did an ok job the 2 times they worked.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> Too many plastic parts.</li>
            <li> In a fraction of the time I used to take, these clippers do an outstanding job.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a year or so ago and it worked Ok until it quit.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and it does the work of something that you would think makes much more noise.</li>
            <li> Husband love this item</li>
            <li> All trimmers using AAA batteries could not supply enough power to cut my hairs and this one using a AA battery does perfect.</li>
            <li> Very useful!</li>
            <li> It works great and does th job way better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> payed $13 including shipping, and I have to say that it&#x27;s the best $13 I&#x27;ve spent in years.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider it adequate for anything more challenging.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is painless, and very quick to finish the nose trim.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Light and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Trims</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to keep sanitized.</li>
            <li> What more can I say it is most useful.</li>
            <li> and heads switch out easily</li>
            <li> My husband needed a personal trimmer for sideburns and this works great for this as well as has attachments to do alot more.</li>
            <li> This groomer is sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> I recommend this strongly.</li>
            <li> you need strong, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> To be quite frankly, I have used many different products from different brands, but honestly I can say this is the best</li>
            <li> and it did a fine job.</li>
            <li> This groomer works just fine.  </li>
            <li> However, the little b-tard works great!</li>
            <li> Works fine, all attachments are very useful and work like they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> This is the best tool by far for getting my nose totally clear of hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to keep clean and change attachments although I don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> I bought it primarily to trim eyebrows, and I have to coax it along to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap and fidgety.</li>
            <li> The plastic is definitely cheap.  </li>
            <li> This so called &amp;#34;Travel Touch Up Groomer&amp;#34; is just fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of ways to keep nostrils and ears smooth.</li>
            <li> product is so cheap</li>
            <li> Since I use it primarily for trimming nose hairs, I do this for hygiene purposes.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of great facial and hair trimmers, yet none have an attachment geared for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Gets a bit warm after it has been on for several minutes, but still does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> but when its clean it works fine.</li>
            <li> versatile and effective - i use this one all the time for trimming between cuts and find it to be of high quality</li>
            <li> Worth the price!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure its days are numbered</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always looking neat and clean....</li>
            <li> It tickles a lot at first in certain places, but works perfectly passing it around in one direction and then the opposite direction to get hairs growing in all directions.  </li>
            <li> It is a very useful accessory as it allows me to keep my good image and personal presence.</li>
            <li> This one does an OK job, but really does not excel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it anymore because it&#x27;s aggravating and only good for trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li> I have used different &amp;#34;personal trimmers&amp;#34; but never found any to be that good.</li>
            <li> I like that it is battery operated as the rechargeable trimmers die quickly.</li>
            <li> quality.&lt;br /&gt;Battery goes quick, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Happily, I was quickly standing in a little furry circle of cast off hair in the bathtub.</li>
            <li> Happily, I was quickly standing in a little furry circle of cast off hair in the bathtub.</li>
            <li> This product works very well!!  </li>
            <li> It fit my needs very well.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li> works well and has useful attachments.  </li>
            <li> I put the nose piece back on, no go, but it was getting warm.</li>
            <li> I put the nose piece back on, no go, but it was getting warm.</li>
            <li> Thjis is the best of them, but still am not completely happy.  </li>
            <li> It takes many passes for me to completely trim those rogue nose hairs.</li>
            <li> the right amount of power&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great for those hard to get to places.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to do something along the lines of trimming a mustache or beard, from the looks of the included attachments, you might have a higher opinion of this trimmer than I do.</li>
            <li> It is pretty close shaving too.  </li>
            <li> If the blade gets &amp;#34;stuch&amp;#34; rotate the head off, start the motor and click the top back on, it will get it un-stuck.</li>
            <li> It was used only once and it wouldn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li> This one is in the first category.</li>
            <li> Most days when I start this thing up, I have to remove the head and put it back on just to get the motor spinning.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer and used it once; it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> first bought one of these at Wal-Mart and it lasted exactly two times before the on/off switch stopped functioning.</li>
            <li> and I thought the first one was just a lemon.  </li>
            <li> With a better switch this would be my favorite small trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Just like the first one I bought</li>
            <li> This cuts right through, so be careful.  :)</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it is sturdy and comes with a variety of heads.  </li>
            <li> This Remington is far superior and also has other attachments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these type things, and this has a good feeling about it - high</li>
            <li> easy to operate, uses one AA battery and comes with several attachments.</li>
            <li> THe only con to this product is the trim level adjuster which will often come off easily.</li>
            <li> have used several styles of these small trimmers, and this one ids the best so far.  </li>
            <li> Again, I was sure there was a design flaw with the snap on adjustable piece, that it would become loose and give me a &#x27;1&#x27; shave when I wanted a &#x27;3&#x27; length.</li>
            <li> I was happy with it, but when I tried to use it again a few weeks later, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> This trimmer trims all areas very close without pain and pulling of the hairs.</li>
            <li> too much money for what you get</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this groomer to anyone!  </li>
            <li> I also grow nose hair as fast as a wookie.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer works absolutely to perfection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really cannot find one flaw at all, nothing but praise.  </li>
            <li> Buy this product as a gift for my wife and she likes me, so much colors recommended.</li>
            <li> Trims very close.</li>
            <li> That flaw is the on/off switch, which is very erratic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hedge trimmer can be used without the guard for a really close shave, though I admit to being nicked a couple times, but I&#x27;m curvy.</li>
            <li> But after looking around online, at stores, in friend&#x27;s cabinets, reading reviews and asking intimate details, I realised I was in for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered that it is not broken</li>
            <li> Thanks Remington</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed about the product.</li>
            <li> Well, this works very well for your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this trimmer got such a good review from other people.  </li>
            <li> I love it for getting around in the ear a lot easier than my other clippers.</li>
            <li> Then, I took the nose trimmer off after putting in a new battery and miracle of miracles!</li>
            <li> Then, I took the nose trimmer off after putting in a new battery and miracle of miracles!</li>
            <li> Works really great for those places inside the nose that are hard to find with a regular razor</li>
            <li> Through the years he has used many of this type of groomer to trim the hair in and on his ears and they didn&#x27;t last or have the power to cut the coarse hairs.</li>
            <li> It is decent and does its job</li>
            <li> Just a quick swipe back and forth over the eyebrows and they look neat and well kempt!  </li>
            <li> nose hairs in particular were a bugger to trim.</li>
            <li> the exact same thing happened - it worked the first time and then never worked again.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer does a good job but the problem is the motor is weak.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone who need to shape up their eye brows.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to everyone.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for cleaning out ears.</li>
            <li> As I age, my hair seems to move from my head down onto my ears and nose!  :-)  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer as a supplement to the one I normally use at home.</li>
            <li> Works great for the nose, or other areas that are small , you may need to get the hair out of , like even the ear .</li>
            <li> New batteries did not make a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thinking it needed a new battery, I put in a new one and it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I exchanged it for a new one and</li>
            <li> I was using a Micro touch for years and replaced it with the new Ultra Microtouch.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned in my previous reviews, I am not an easy man to please, i am so fussy to the point of being neurotic.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it could be pushed in if I was just jabbing away and pressing hard, but that&#x27;s the sweet thing about this little tool; the blades are sharp and the guard is designed to pick up the hair off the skin for easy trimming!</li>
            <li> I really like how accessible the cutting edge is for close cuts, and it really is safe without causing any nicks.</li>
            <li> There are a few attachments that comes with it and is easy to attach and detach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This means that while trimming sideburns for example, it may pop off and cause you to accidentally trim a large section forcing you to trim off the entire sideburn so you don&#x27;t look like a fool.</li>
            <li> I have used several other trimmers in the past, some of them great...</li>
            <li> This works very well and only uses 1 AA battery</li>
            <li> have contacted Reimington directly to see if they will replace the blade.</li>
            <li> SO FAR AS I&#x27;M CONCERNED.  </li>
            <li> Why does Amazon not sell them directly?</li>
            <li> I have never had a machine that worked nearly as well</li>
            <li> This gets all my nose hare and does not mess with my flesh.  </li>
            <li> First one broke, took it back and got a replacement and that one worked once - weeks later (today)</li>
            <li> This replaced an older model we had for several years.</li>
            <li> Between my sensitive skin, which I never let a razor touch, and my fear of blades in general, because they can cut.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this almost 4 years ago, and was pretty sure I hated it most of the time, but ONLY because of the twist action on/off.</li>
            <li> This little razor makes it easy to eliminate those &amp;#34; I am an old man!&amp;#34; hairs from your nose and ears, and with the eyebrow attachment, there is no need on earth to have long scraggly hair over your eyes either!  </li>
            <li> Small in scope but very powerful and not too invasive.</li>
            <li> It is much much faster because it gets the hair cut in a single pass.</li>
            <li> When it comes to trimming hair in hard to reach places this one does a much better job than a few others I have tried, mostly the ones with a round end.</li>
            <li> It is much nicer than I expected, the pictures don&#x27;t it justice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m supprised that a 3rd grader has nose hair that young???</li>
            <li> Has good cutting power.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, compared to my other gadgets.</li>
            <li> spent a ton of money over the years in order to find a decent ear &amp; nose trimmer.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several other brands over the years and this one really works.  </li>
            <li> The thin profile makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> After 3-4 uses it started slowing down even when i replace the batteries with new ones</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one and it quit after only a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The cost is reasonable and it probably does what it is advertised to do, but no more.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that when I next use it after rinsing it and letting it dry, it often will not turn on.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had come across them a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my wife said my nose hairs were getting long.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for about 20 years for a tool that would be sharp enough to cut ear hair.  </li>
            <li> I guess due to the lack of Qulaity control at the Chinese factory.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other trimmers and this is the strongest of them all.</li>
            <li> I made sure I alcohol rinsed the attachments again, set them out to dry, gave it a little kiss and said sorry for all the meany things I&#x27;d thought about it before.</li>
            <li> I made sure I alcohol rinsed the attachments again, set them out to dry, gave it a little kiss and said sorry for all the meany things I&#x27;d thought about it before.</li>
            <li> It is powered by a single AA battery that is included.</li>
            <li> Battery cover is switch and comes off if you turn it too far past off.  </li>
            <li> And rightly or wrongly, I suspect that the long narrow business end of the product could easily break.</li>
            <li> I like the design of this product as it has two cutting edges opposed to each other which makes it easy to glide flat over the skin and get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I still think that&#x27;s the stupidest design ever because it also has, once or twice, caused the battery cover piece to pop off whilst I&#x27;m fumbling around down below and drop into the toilet, along with the battery.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it turns on by twisting, which is also how you change the battery, so I have accidentally removed the battery several times.</li>
            <li> I went to use it the next day and the thing was dead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;$9.99 seems inexpensive but given the $3 per nose hair / replacement blade, the frustration and the time spent contacting the manufacturer, the cost is way too high.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money because it won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Often, it would get nudged &#x27;on&#x27; in its drawer and the battery would be dead the next time I went to use it, which was about every 2 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> My facial hair (nose, beard) is quite thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the switch on the new one has the same troupblesome switch.</li>
            <li> Razor blade is sharp, but doesn&#x27;t cut the skin.  </li>
            <li> Also, compared to other ones of this design it has a blade on both sides.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked at the reviews of the product on other sites.  </li>
            <li> If you are very careful, this is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes very long time to move from side to side until it clipped a few hairs.</li>
            <li> The older rotary one was not only painful as it ripped half the hairs out instead of cutting them, but it also took like 5 minutes or more to get them all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very often that I have a terrible experience with a product because I think I&#x27;m usually a pretty smart shopper</li>
            <li> BUT LASTED LESS THAN 18 MONTHS.  </li>
            <li> Remington obviously has a serious design flaw in this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a groomer designed not to clog, and I searched long for this one.  </li>
            <li> After years of doing an average job of \\&quot;hair mantainance\\&quot; with a very average Wahl, I bought one of these Remington clippers.</li>
            <li> This groomer is tops for trimming hair in tight places, including ears.  </li>
            <li> The clipper attachments tend to bite a little.</li>
            <li> As a hair dresser I sometimes get a gentleman in my chair, that needs a little ear trimming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise that you don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> So for a few days it is hit and miss as you figure it out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the round attachment</li>
            <li> but the shaver is completely dead and is not showing any sign of life at all.</li>
            <li> The flat head blade is irritating and feels like I&#x27;m getting tattooed on my face.  </li>
            <li> Whether it is nose, ears, or eyebrows, this is the only trimmer that actually worked, and all without painful pulling.</li>
            <li> The little burr thingy spun up!</li>
            <li> The little burr thingy spun up!</li>
            <li> A SMALL BRASS RIVET IN THE OSCILLATING HEAD BROKE MAKING THE UNIT INOPERABLE.  </li>
            <li> Small for traveling, never pulls or tugs hairs</li>
            <li> Difficult to position properly.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers here have reported that the trimmer quits working after a small number of uses and that for that reason they have returned it.</li>
            <li> It looks at least as well made as other small trimmers but it has a serious flaw.  </li>
            <li> I hate when I buy something and can&#x27;t use it right away because I need to go buy batteries.</li>
            <li> It seems like the cutting edges are just not very sharp.  </li>
            <li> But it never happened, though I don&#x27;t press really hard-</li>
            <li> They are 9.96 dollars at a common large-box store that begins with W this week.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit awkward and fragile.  </li>
            <li> They are thick and everything else used to just pinch them</li>
            <li> Over taut skin I seriously doubt it would pinch.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good reviews elsewhere as here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased several others and was disappointed in the performances.</li>
            <li> Kinda weak power and the nose hair trimmer is a pain to use.</li>
            <li> I have a tough nose to trim.  </li>
            <li> I have had my nose broken three times</li>
            <li> but I use the pencil thin one.</li>
            <li> I like the curved neck of the hedge trimmer because I can reach under and behind my curvy bits with ease.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have very thick and tough nose hair.</li>
            <li> so there are some weird contours to go around.  </li>
            <li> and I have had some expensive ones.</li>
            <li> but combination battery cover / switch is not impressive.</li>
            <li> Also sometimes u need to replace the battery,,,, DUH!!!  </li>
            <li> cutting or tugging</li>
            <li> Either I have really bad luck or</li>
            <li> I kept at it, and even swabbed the inside of the burr area and got some crap outta there, too.</li>

            <li> but I cant find anything bad to say about this thing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before that, I had a very bad trim.</li>
            <li> This groomer is Terrible.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s insane what Amazon is charging now.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> To be quite frankly, I have used many different products from different brands, but honestly I can say this is the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;It happened I was lucky to see this item at my Friend&#x27;s house, for which he did strongly advise me to purchase it as it is excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Without any hesitation I did order the item and received with in delivery estimated time. I am very happy to have received such a great product and for very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking care of the customers.</li>
            <li> This product works very well!!  I was plesantly suprised to notice the different attachments.  I can use this on my arms, nose, eyebrows, and bikini area!!  What a difference!!</li>
            <li> Holds up and does the job. Easy to keep clean and change attachments although I don&#x27;t need them. Only complaint is that it turns on by twisting, which is also how you change the battery, so I have accidentally removed the battery several times. But it&#x27;s not that big of a deal</li>
            <li> This works very well and only uses 1 AA battery</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer and for no reason whatsoever after three months, it just stopped working. Changed the battery to no avail.</li>
            <li> My favorite groomer. I really like how accessible the cutting edge is for close cuts, and it really is safe without causing any nicks.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer as a supplement to the one I normally use at home. The plan is to keep this one in my travel bag so I don&#x27;t have to pack/unpack my regular trimmer, which is a cheaper, flimsier Conair model. However, after having used this one, I prefer the Conair I have used for many years. This one does an OK job, but really does not excel. I bought it primarily to trim eyebrows, and I have to coax it along to get the job done. It seems like the cutting edges are just not very sharp.  On the positive side, it is sturdy and comes with a variety of heads.  If you are looking to do something along the lines of trimming a mustache or beard, from the looks of the included attachments, you might have a higher opinion of this trimmer than I do.</li>
            <li> I put the battery in , touched up my mustache and it did a fine job. I went to use it the next day and the thing was dead. I replaced the battery an it still wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Works really well. The clipper attachments tend to bite a little. Trying to trim up hair with the attachments, it catches your skin sometimes</li>
            <li> This is the BEST trimmer I have found. I purchased several others and was disappointed in the performances. This trimmer trims all areas very close without pain and pulling of the hairs. I like that it is battery operated as the rechargeable trimmers die quickly. Good Times :)</li>
            <li> too much money for what you get</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the goods... nuff said! Okay, it says I have to say more... it&#x27;s the goods!  Now that&#x27;s nuff said!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband&#x27;s ears--literally and this is a the best groomer he have used to date.  Through the years he has used many of this type of groomer to trim the hair in and on his ears and they didn&#x27;t last or have the power to cut the coarse hairs. This one does the job!  And the dual head is also great. I highly recommend this groomer to anyone!  The others have not cut as neatly or as close. This groomer is sturdy and strong. Has good cutting power. Great gift!  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband. It is decent and does its job well. There are a few attachments that comes with it and is easy to attach and detach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for trimming nose hairs, back hairs, legs hairs. Would recommend to others to purchase!</li>
            <li> So easy to use. The thin profile makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> This Remington Nose Hair Trimmer purchsed from Amazon stopped working after 3 months, after being used about once a week. New batteries did not make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently there is no guarantee. I&#x27;d advise that you don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very often that I have a terrible experience with a product because I think I&#x27;m usually a pretty smart shopper but this product bit me. Literally.  The dual blade thing is garbage and won&#x27;t cut it. The flat head blade is irritating and feels like I&#x27;m getting tattooed on my face.  You turn the bottom of the trimmer to turn on/off and to take the battery out. Feels cheap and fidgety. The plastic is definitely cheap.  Don&#x27;t like it at all after one use.</li>
            <li> This item is a thousand times better than the rotary one that I used to use.  It is painless, and very quick to finish the nose trim.  The older rotary one was not only painful as it ripped half the hairs out instead of cutting them, but it also took like 5 minutes or more to get them all.  This one takes like 30 seconds and I am done.</li>
            <li> I have a tough nose to trim.  I have had my nose broken three times so there are some weird contours to go around.  I also grow nose hair as fast as a wookie.  This gets all my nose hare and does not mess with my flesh.  It is pretty close shaving too.  I use it for my Andy Rooney eyebrows too so I am no longer mistaken for Boris Yeltsin.  If the blade gets &amp;#34;stuch&amp;#34; rotate the head off, start the motor and click the top back on, it will get it un-stuck.</li>
            <li> have used several styles of these small trimmers, and this one ids the best so far.  It has dual blades and cuts verrry close, as it needs to.  easy to operate, uses one AA battery and comes with several attachments.</li>
            <li> Works great for those hard to get to places. It is much nicer than I expected, the pictures don&#x27;t it justice.Love it!!!</li>
            <li> The Remington Ne3560 Travel Touch Up Groomer is fantastic !  In a matter of a couple of minutes I can trim my nose and ears and touch up my sideburns so I&#x27;m always looking neat and clean....and at the age of 69 that&#x27;s STILL very important to me.  Thanks Remington for a great product !!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great. It comes with a double sided comb attachment. It is powered by a single AA battery that is included.</li>
            <li> seems like it did an ok job the 2 times they worked. First one broke, took it back and got a replacement and that one worked once - weeks later (today) I went to use it and now it doesn&#x27;t work. Piece of garbage ! Do not purchase !</li>
            <li> Where were you all my life?.&lt;br /&gt;I spent a ton of money over the years in order to find a decent ear &amp; nose trimmer.&lt;br /&gt; I finally ran across this Remington by accident, then found the holy grail. Oh my God!  this trimmer works absolutely to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;  As I mentioned in my previous reviews, I am not an easy man to please, i am so fussy to the point of being neurotic.&lt;br /&gt;All of the attachments work stupendously well also.  I really cannot find one flaw at all, nothing but praise.  I am now a believer.&lt;br /&gt;If this product lasts the years, this would be it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;Anthony</li>
            <li> It was used only once and it wouldn&#x27;t work any more.  Thinking it needed a new battery, I put in a new one and it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Works great for toughing up.  Nose, Ears, Face you name it.  I use to use a rotary clipper for my nose but this thing does way better!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Its ok. Not the best. After 3-4 uses it started slowing down even when i replace the batteries with new ones</li>
            <li> This groomer works just fine.  The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that the battery compartment opens all the time when I am turning it on and off.</li>
            <li> Buy this product as a gift for my wife and she likes me, so much colors recommended. also it is a very cute and stylish case</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Gets a bit warm after it has been on for several minutes, but still does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> This so called &amp;#34;Travel Touch Up Groomer&amp;#34; is just fabulous.  I&#x27;ve purchased several other brands over the years and this one really works.  I purchased it specifically for my boyfriend to trim the hair in his nose and he loves it.  Razor blade is sharp, but doesn&#x27;t cut the skin.  The attachments included work perfectly for trimming his neckline hair in between barbershop appointments, and work great for shaping my eyebrows rather than plucking.  We both love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the trimmer from Target (not amazon.) Price was 9.99. I used the trimmer 1 time and the precision blade stopped working. A precision blade costs $3 to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted Reimington directly to see if they will replace the blade. We will see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$9.99 seems inexpensive but given the $3 per nose hair / replacement blade, the frustration and the time spent contacting the manufacturer, the cost is way too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy something else and hit me up with a recommendation.</li>
            <li> PURCHASED THIS TRIMMER ON AUGUST 28, 2013.  WORKED WELL BUT LASTED LESS THAN 18 MONTHS.  A SMALL BRASS RIVET IN THE OSCILLATING HEAD BROKE MAKING THE UNIT INOPERABLE.  NEVER ABUSED SO SEEMS LIKE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT TO ME - FORGET REMINGTON PRODUCTS SO FAR AS I&#x27;M CONCERNED.  DATE PASSED FOR RETURN/REFUND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT&#x27;S THE CHINESE WORD FOR &amp;#34;JUNK&amp;#34; ? ? ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOUGHT A WAHL UNIT FROM AMAZON TO REPLACE IT.  WE&#x27;LL SEE.</li>
            <li> The biggest fault is that there are no directions suggesting technique for using it effectively. So for a few days it is hit and miss as you figure it out. And rightly or wrongly, I suspect that the long narrow business end of the product could easily break.</li>
            <li> As a hair dresser I sometimes get a gentleman in my chair, that needs a little ear trimming. This works great. Bought two of them, one for the salon and one for home.</li>
            <li> This replaced an older model we had for several years. It&#x27;s still a good buy at this price and the groomer works great.</li>
            <li> It sometimes cloggs up and has to be cleaned.  The cost is reasonable and it probably does what it is advertised to do, but no more.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I expected. Just like the picture. I highly recommend this for anyone who need to shape up their eye brows.</li>
            <li> Does not even pull the nose hair of a Filipino from the Batangas.</li>
            <li> Whether it is nose, ears, or eyebrows, this is the only trimmer that actually worked, and all without painful pulling.</li>
            <li> I have used several other trimmers in the past, some of them great...some not so great. This one is in the first category. Small for traveling, never pulls or tugs hairs and there is no worry of cut skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Light and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Trims nose hairs and ear hairs perfectly&lt;br /&gt;No cutting or tugging&lt;br /&gt;Just the right amount of power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;AAA battery, not rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;No cap of cover for blades for storage</li>
            <li> This groomer is tops for trimming hair in tight places, including ears.  It was a bargain at 8.97 dollars on 14JUL2013.  Just tried to buy a second one 10JUL2014 as a gift and they are 44.95 dollars from a LLC selling through Amazon.  They are 9.96 dollars at a common large-box store that begins with W this week.  What is going on with some of Amazon’s prices?  Why does Amazon not sell them directly?</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the heads for the various trimming tasks.  Difficult to position properly.  Battery cover falls off constantly.</li>
            <li> This groomer is Terrible. It  Broke after 1 month. Don&#x27;t waste your money because it won&#x27;t last. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> It does a very nice job of removing hair &amp; easy to handle</li>
            <li> versatile and effective - i use this one all the time for trimming between cuts and find it to be of high quality</li>
            <li> Works great for the nose, or other areas that are small , you may need to get the hair out of , like even the ear .</li>
            <li> Great.  Works fine, all attachments are very useful and work like they are supposed to.  Worth the price!  I would buy again if I need one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like,  but it does do the job. Too many plastic parts.</li>
            <li> It works great and does th job way better than my old one.  I would highly recommend to everyone.  Trims very close.</li>
            <li> It fit my needs very well.  As I age, my hair seems to move from my head down onto my ears and nose!  :-)  This little razor makes it easy to eliminate those &amp;#34; I am an old man!&amp;#34; hairs from your nose and ears, and with the eyebrow attachment, there is no need on earth to have long scraggly hair over your eyes either!  Just a quick swipe back and forth over the eyebrows and they look neat and well kempt!  Would recommend for anyone in my boat, and even those who just like looking good!</li>
            <li> Works great, I like the eye-brow clipper.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have very thick and tough nose hair. This cuts right through, so be careful.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to rate the products you purchase.</li>
            <li> This product works well for the &amp;#34;nasty.&amp;#34;  It handles nose and ear hairs well.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider it adequate for anything more challenging.  Leave that to your barber or hair stylist.</li>
            <li> After years of doing an average job of \\&quot;hair mantainance\\&quot; with a very average Wahl, I bought one of these Remington clippers. In a fraction of the time I used to take, these clippers do an outstanding job.&lt;br /&gt;My nose hairs in particular were a bugger to trim. They are thick and everything else used to just pinch them and I never could get them all either. This Remington turns them to dust!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I payed $13 including shipping, and I have to say that it&#x27;s the best $13 I&#x27;ve spent in years. I wish that I had come across them a long time ago. They are absolutely superb!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied, very good cuts hair from the nose. Do not feel that it works. Several moves made ​​and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Before that, I had a very bad trim. It takes very long time to move from side to side until it clipped a few hairs.</li>
            <li> When it comes to trimming hair in hard to reach places this one does a much better job than a few others I have tried, mostly the ones with a round end. It is much much faster because it gets the hair cut in a single pass. Also, compared to other ones of this design it has a blade on both sides. Very useful!</li>
            <li> It is a very useful accessory as it allows me to keep my good image and personal presence. Good Buy</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for about 20 years for a tool that would be sharp enough to cut ear hair.  This one is great!</li>
            <li> This thing has no nut to it at all. Don&#x27;t event think about grooming facial hair with it! Battery powered devices like these are never any good. Most days when I start this thing up, I have to remove the head and put it back on just to get the motor spinning. If there&#x27;s even the smallest hair stuck in one of the blades the motor won&#x27;t spin. I don&#x27;t even use it anymore because it&#x27;s aggravating and only good for trimming nose hair. This is JUNK and it&#x27;s insane what Amazon is charging now. I paid ten bucks for this p.o.s. and it wasn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li> It looked great but it&#x27;s a bit awkward and fragile.  I haven&#x27;t dropped it or anything but mine stopped working about a week later. The battery compartment is also he on/off switch, and I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on but maybe something there broke.</li>
            <li> I try to be frank in my reviews and I tell it like it is but I cant find anything bad to say about this thing! granted, I dont use it for mustache or beard trimming but for getting nose and ear hair I have never had a machine that worked nearly as well and I have had some expensive ones. I will defer to those who criticize it for facial hair but if your goal is to keep your orifices (Orifi?) tidy. I recommend this strongly.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer and used it once; it worked pretty well.  I was happy with it, but when I tried to use it again a few weeks later, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I exchanged it for a new one and the exact same thing happened - it worked the first time and then never worked again.  Either I have really bad luck or this product is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does a good job but the problem is the motor is weak. If you do not rinse the tip thoroughly, the blades often become stuck together, which makes it appear on the next use that the switch is defective.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these. one for my husband and one for my barber shop customers. I love it for getting around in the ear a lot easier than my other clippers. it cleans the hair out very nicely. it&#x27;s easy to keep sanitized. I don&#x27;t use the round attachment but I use the pencil thin one. I will be ordering another when this one wears out. I highly recommend it for cleaning out ears.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer.  works well and has useful attachments.  it comes with a battery, which is nice.  I hate when I buy something and can&#x27;t use it right away because I need to go buy batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these type things, and this has a good feeling about it - high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Battery goes quick, but worth it.</li>
            <li> As a guy in my mid 40&#x27;s I have tried all kinds of ways to keep nostrils and ears smooth. This by far is the easiest best way I have found.</li>
            <li> Upon receipt the product worked as described.  After 12 weeks it simply died.  At this point I am beyond Amazon&#x27;s return window.  I will contact Remington next.</li>
            <li> No hair pulling.  Good for ears,nose and those pesky eye brows.  Additional attachments work for a beard if you have one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He has side burns that sometimes get out of hand in between hair cuts. Its nice and sturdy! I would recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I like the design of this product as it has two cutting edges opposed to each other which makes it easy to glide flat over the skin and get a close shave.  It looks at least as well made as other small trimmers but it has a serious flaw.  That flaw is the on/off switch, which is very erratic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought one of these at Wal-Mart and it lasted exactly two times before the on/off switch stopped functioning. Got my money back since they were out of stock at Wal-Mart.  Order this one from Amazon as a replacement because I do like the design and I thought the first one was just a lemon.  Unfortunately the switch on the new one has the same troupblesome switch. It hasn&#x27;t stopped functioning yet but it requires a lot of twisting and pushing to turn on.  I&#x27;m pretty sure its days are numbered and that&#x27;s a shame.  With a better switch this would be my favorite small trimmer.  But,if it won&#x27;t turn on reliably it isn&#x27;t much good is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this Remington trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIED.  Yes, it stopped working after 7 uses.  Just like the first one I bought it will not turn on no matter what I do.  Remington obviously has a serious design flaw in this product.  Do Not Buy this trimmer.  You have been warned!</li>
            <li> does a good job and safe.....</li>
            <li> This puts those infomercial trimmers to shame. Small in scope but very powerful and not too invasive. GOod Product for trims</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a year or so ago and it worked Ok until it quit.  I ordered a new one and it quit after only a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This product is so cheap I guess due to the lack of Qulaity control at the Chinese factory.</li>
            <li> Fulfilled the expectations, it is a good product and it arrived in good condition. It is just as it appears in the photo</li>
            <li> I bought this almost 4 years ago, and was pretty sure I hated it most of the time, but ONLY because of the twist action on/off. Often, it would get nudged &#x27;on&#x27; in its drawer and the battery would be dead the next time I went to use it, which was about every 2 weeks or so. I still think that&#x27;s the stupidest design ever because it also has, once or twice, caused the battery cover piece to pop off whilst I&#x27;m fumbling around down below and drop into the toilet, along with the battery. However, the little b-tard works great! The nose trimmer is perfect for me- I had to buy a wahl eyebrow/nose groomer for Himself because this couldn&#x27;t hack through his manly steel-like sprouts, but this buzzed through my silken fem-threads with no issues and no nicks or pinches. I used the adjustable snap on guard over the &#x27;hedge&#x27; trimmer for my armpits, arm hair and under carriage. Again, I was sure there was a design flaw with the snap on adjustable piece, that it would become loose and give me a &#x27;1&#x27; shave when I wanted a &#x27;3&#x27; length. But it never happened, though I don&#x27;t press really hard- I&#x27;m sure it could be pushed in if I was just jabbing away and pressing hard, but that&#x27;s the sweet thing about this little tool; the blades are sharp and the guard is designed to pick up the hair off the skin for easy trimming! I like the curved neck of the hedge trimmer because I can reach under and behind my curvy bits with ease. The hedge trimmer can be used without the guard for a really close shave, though I admit to being nicked a couple times, but I&#x27;m curvy. Over taut skin I seriously doubt it would pinch. I loved the adjustable guard, I like my arm hair a 3, pits a 2 and under carriage a 1. Still, I was thinking, man I can&#x27;t wait to get a different one, because of the couple of things mentioned that I didn&#x27;t like. And then, last week, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on! I was like \\&quot;sweet!\\&quot;. But after looking around online, at stores, in friend&#x27;s cabinets, reading reviews and asking intimate details, I realised I was in for it. I bought, broke, returned, and tossed several models of which ripped, pinched, nicked or did freakin&#x27; nothing at all. This morning I decided to give the Touch Up one. last. chance. I tried three batteries, I left it on while searching online for a replacement, I banged it in my hand a bit, I pleaded. Then, I took the nose trimmer off after putting in a new battery and miracle of miracles! The little burr thingy spun up! I put the nose piece back on, no go, but it was getting warm. I thought, yk I&#x27;ve never cleaned it properly, just rinsed it with some water and tossed it in its drawer. So I doused the attachments in rubbing alcohol and shook them around and yuck! lots of gunk and hair began to issue forth. I kept at it, and even swabbed the inside of the burr area and got some crap outta there, too. Holding my breathe, I applied the trimmer and the guard and &#x27;rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr&#x27; it was off and running. Happily, I was quickly standing in a little furry circle of cast off hair in the bathtub. I made sure I alcohol rinsed the attachments again, set them out to dry, gave it a little kiss and said sorry for all the meany things I&#x27;d thought about it before.I was in for it. I bought, broke, returned, and tossed several models of which ripped, pinched, nicked or did freakin&#x27; nothing at all. This morning I decided to give the Touch Up one. last. chance. I tried three batteries, I left it on while searching online for a replacement, I banged it in my hand a bit, I pleaded. Then, I took the nose trimmer off after putting in a new battery and miracle of miracles! The little burr thingy spun up! I put the nose piece back on, no go, but it was getting warm. I thought, yk I&#x27;ve never cleaned it properly, just rinsed it with some water and tossed it in its drawer. So I doused the attachments in rubbing alcohol and shook them around and yuck! lots of gunk and hair began to issue forth. I kept at it, and even swabbed the inside of the burr area and got some crap outta there, too. Holding my breathe, I applied the trimmer and the guard and &#x27;rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr&#x27; it was off and running.

            <li> What more can I say it is most useful. Although some electric razors have a trimmer built in. This Remington is far superior and also has other attachments.</li>
            <li> Kinda weak power and the nose hair trimmer is a pain to use.</li>
            <li> Have another one and woks real good.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers here have reported that the trimmer quits working after a small number of uses and that for that reason they have returned it. Here&#x27;s my experience with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I occasionally rinse off the head of my trimmer by holding it under running water. Since I use it primarily for trimming nose hairs, I do this for hygiene purposes. I have noticed that when I next use it after rinsing it and letting it dry, it often will not turn on. I&#x27;ve discovered that it is not broken but rather that the head mechanism is simply stuck--probably with some gunk or something that is obstructing some key moving part. What solves that is removing the head, turning the trimmer on to see if it runs without the head (it always does in my experience), and putting the head back on. That has solved the problem every time for me.</li>
            <li> Battery cover is switch and comes off if you turn it too far past off.  Seems to work okay and heads switch out easily but combination battery cover / switch is not impressive.</li>
            <li> I was using a Micro touch for years and replaced it with the new Ultra Microtouch. Horrible. On my quest to find something that works well. This has 3 attachments that all work well and it does the work of something that you would think makes much more noise. It is quiet and seems to do the job effortlessly. Definitely recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> For the one that said they break... Step 1, take the blade part off. Step 2, Rinse the pc that snaps off when done. Step 3, put it back on,,,, done.  I thought mine stopped working also but when its clean it works fine. I love it!  Also sometimes u need to replace the battery,,,, DUH!!!  I&#x27;m supprised that a 3rd grader has nose hair that young???</li>
            <li> I bought this because my wife said my nose hairs were getting long. Between my sensitive skin, which I never let a razor touch, and my fear of blades in general, because they can cut. It is quite comfortable for trimming nose hairs and comes with an assortment of attachments that will allow you to trim and look your best. Thanks Remington</li>
            <li> I used it once, then it stopped working. Very dissapointed about the product. Did change the batteries etc but the shaver is completely dead and is not showing any sign of life at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a groomer designed not to clog, and I searched long for this one.  It works.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> Husband love this item</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other trimmers and this is the strongest of them all. My facial hair (nose, beard) is quite thick and coarse. All trimmers using AAA batteries could not supply enough power to cut my hairs and this one using a AA battery does perfect. THe only con to this product is the trim level adjuster which will often come off easily. This means that while trimming sideburns for example, it may pop off and cause you to accidentally trim a large section forcing you to trim off the entire sideburn so you don&#x27;t look like a fool. If you are very careful, this is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need strong, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> This is the best tool by far for getting my nose totally clear of hair.  It tickles a lot at first in certain places, but works perfectly passing it around in one direction and then the opposite direction to get hairs growing in all directions.  Good for ears too.</li>
            <li> got this as a gift, still works</li>
            <li> Works really great for those places inside the nose that are hard to find with a regular razor</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for my eyebrows. I have a lot of great facial and hair trimmers, yet none have an attachment geared for eyebrows. Some are claiming that the nose trimmer (the rounded attachment that you know is for your nose) is also for your eyebrows.... Well, this works very well for your eyebrows. Very inexpensive, compared to my other gadgets. Problem solved! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I would like the battery life was better, the trimmer dose a very good job. Fits well in your hand. Will buy it again when this one quits.</li>
            <li> My husband needed a personal trimmer for sideburns and this works great for this as well as has attachments to do alot more.</li>
            <li> I have used different &amp;#34;personal trimmers&amp;#34; but never found any to be that good. Thjis is the best of them, but still am not completely happy.  It takes many passes for me to completely trim those rogue nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this trimmer got such a good review from other people.  It worked 3 times for me.  I replaced the battery and it won&#x27;t even spin.  I&#x27;ve looked at the reviews of the product on other sites.  Not nearly as good reviews elsewhere as here on Amazon.</li>
