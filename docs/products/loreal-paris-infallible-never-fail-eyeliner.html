            <li>Great eyeliner!  </li>
            <li>(although any pencil-type eyeliner is going to smudge if you rub it, so don&#x27;t expect a perfect cat eye.</li>

            <li>My favorite eyeliner!</li>

            <li>I love my L&#x27;Oreal products!</li>
            <li>this eyeliner has been absolutely amazing for the porpose I use it for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice liner.</li>
            <li>Nice texture, nice pencil.</li>
            <li>not like they said that kind of waterproof</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best eyeliner I have ever used!</li>
            <li>and ppl ask me what kind</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and best of all it doesn&#x27;t run, even after a full day of work and a couple of hours at the gym.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, just not as great as advertised.</li>
            <li>That comes with a really good brush &amp; it makes water lining really easy.  </li>
            <li>I have used higher end eyeliners, but have always experienced smudging by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I do like this eyeliner, the application is very smooth -</li>
            <li>Rubs off kind of easy after a while, but they all do.</li>
            <li>I wear a strong cat eye eyeliner every day, and this is the best drug store brand I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Item came new and in good condition!</li>
            <li>Love love love this eyeliner...</li>
            <li>I used to not be able to wear eyeliner on the waterline of my eyes without getting cloudy eyed and itchy while wearing my contacts.</li>
            <li>I have used better and will not buy again.</li>
            <li>I love this b/c</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>and I love.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve tried many different brands over the years and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Yes you do have to reapply, but I love this liner.  </li>
            <li>however, if you plan on writing with it then it does :-)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than a lot of eyeliners out there.</li>
            <li>Great liner, very pigmented, lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Very happy, have purchased multiple times!</li>
            <li>So if you haven&#x27;t already, add to cart and buy it now! :)</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner</li>
            <li>I love it all of my eye liners</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and smooth, I haven&#x27;t even had a problem with smearing!</li>
            <li>I also love that it is not liquid and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth &amp; lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is easy to apply and I like the self sharpening feature, but I find after wearing it a while it gives me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>Easily the shortest lifespan of any eyeliner I have ever used</li>
            <li>Goes on really easy.</li>
            <li>This pencil is easy to use, there is no sharpening, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge after a 12 hour day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smear as easily and stays on for a loong time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s SUPER EASY to apply, glides smoothly, and easy to wash off!</li>
            <li>Hands down best eyeliner i have ever used.</li>
            <li>it is smudge free, easy to wear and stays on.  </li>
            <li>This really is a super addition to my favorite makeup.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smooth and stays all day.</li>
            <li>of course I am just being picky and want all my products to be super easy to remove.</li>
            <li>The eye pencil was not in the original packaging as pictured on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautifully rich color, and it stays just where I want it to.</li>
            <li>This item did not come in its original packaging, and I feel that it is not the product they describe it to be.</li>
            <li>This smudger is easier to keep clean because the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t get gunked in to a \\&quot;spongy\\&quot;</li>
            <li>sure if I got a crummy one or if they are all defective, but the product is nice, just wish it functioned properly.</li>
            <li>It goes on quickly and smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Alot better than Revlon color stay black eyeliner which I use to use  before which is not as good as the L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>Arrived fairly quick.</li>
            <li>My eyes were mildly bloodshot, also.</li>
            <li>This is better than an eyeliner that was highly recommended from another site.</li>
            <li>I generally use a felt-tip marker kind of eyeliner for that because i&#x27;m hopeless with liquid)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very versatile.  </li>
            <li>but this one stays put very well and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and I would never switch to any other kind!</li>
            <li>The only thing that&#x27;s not so great is that it also does not stay for too long and smudges easily.</li>
            <li>Every time I ran out, I would try a new brand because I was never satisfied - even after trying all of the best sellers from Sephora.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice black, and feels good going on, just wish it were a little better.</li>
            <li>its pigmented, soft, stays very well, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a good facial cleanser to get it off, it can be a bit stubborn due to its abilty to perform well all day.</li>
            <li>and there is this tiny sharpener attached that can be used to sharpened very precisely.  </li>
            <li>but I like it very much</li>
            <li>though I like this pencil very much, my preferred liner for doing waterline eyeliner is the L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Gel Lacquer Liner in Navy #172.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner, it is very black and stays on a long time, and it has the sharpener which is great.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge too much!</li>
            <li>I actually recommend this over some of the top brands that I have used and I have been using make-up for over 15 years.</li>
            <li>I have gotten used to this, but at first I did not like how it went on.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner, and purchased it for myself at a local Target store.</li>
            <li>It is a deep navy &amp; helps make my eye whites, appear a bit more white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many different eyeliners but this one stays on very well.</li>
            <li>Better than my last liner as it is pretty dark and spreads very smoothly across my eye.</li>
            <li>Only gave it 4 stars as it smears easily.</li>
            <li>It is just right consistency, not hard and not too smudgy.</li>
            <li>the next best thing to buying the super expensive ones.</li>
            <li>This eye liner came without any packaging, and the top was jammed on to the point of breaking off the tip.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>work it into my upper lashes (after brushing on some light shadow) and soften the line with my pinkie.  </li>
            <li>but in this case, it really is.</li>
            <li>smudger on this pencil is unusual; it is not the spongy/bendable smudger.  </li>
            <li>It really stays out for hours.</li>
            <li>I have used this product a couple of times, and what I really like about</li>
            <li>thank you for the fast shipping</li>
            <li>Only problem is that it can never really set on the water line so it will smudge there but works great for upper lid.</li>
            <li>My favorite hands down.</li>
            <li>The only problem is it is kind of hard to remove and no matter how much I clean my eyes</li>
            <li>I put a black line of this eyeliner on my top lid, by lunch</li>
            <li>I use it on my bottom lids when I use liquid on top or all around on more casual days.</li>
            <li>I had a blobby gray mess along on my top and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Before I found Loreal Infallible, I never had a normal brand that I stuck to.</li>
            <li>I love this fordable, long lasting, eye liner.</li>
            <li>Is it new or not?</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona where the heat tends to make everything else smear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented, it last a very long time like advertised, and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dark, blends beautifully, is a strong black, and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many eyeliners in the past, nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li>have dark brown eyes &amp; my favorite is the navy blue.  </li>
            <li>I wear contacts and I have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this eyeliner since I saw it recommended on a makeup video, which said it stays longer than others when applied on the inner eye; and it does but not as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>Just after a week of using this product, my Mom developed sores all over her eyelids.</li>
            <li>It is soft enough that the color goes on without hurting your eye lids, but not so soft that it smears or is washed away by eye drops or tears.</li>
            <li>Finally, when I stop using this product, the irritation completely cleared up in a couple of days!</li>
            <li>Cool day, no eye rubbing or watering just straight up failure to sit there on my eyelid which is the only thing it needs to do.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that it gets dull quickly and the sharpener that comes with it gets caked up fast and its hard to clean.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and applies smoothly and dark.</li>
            <li>only use this type of eyeliner for tightlining my upper lids, so I can&#x27;t say too much about how well it does if you&#x27;re putting it above your lashes</li>
            <li>have been wearing eyeliner every day since I was old enough to wear makeup.</li>
            <li>I like that it stays on much longer than other liners.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, easy to use, the cap stays on, comes out a nice black, I can line thin or thick, so suits me</li>
            <li>It may smudge a little bit if it&#x27;s particularly hot out</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t typically spend this much on eyeliner.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s SUPER EASY to apply, glides smoothly, and easy to wash off!</li>
            <li> Hands down best eyeliner i have ever used.</li>
            <li> it is smudge free, easy to wear and stays on.  </li>
            <li> This really is a super addition to my favorite makeup.  </li>
            <li> It glides on smooth and stays all day.</li>
            <li> of course I am just being picky and want all my products to be super easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The eye pencil was not in the original packaging as pictured on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautifully rich color, and it stays just where I want it to.</li>
            <li> This item did not come in its original packaging, and I feel that it is not the product they describe it to be.</li>
            <li> This smudger is easier to keep clean because the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t get gunked in to a \\&quot;spongy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> sure if I got a crummy one or if they are all defective, but the product is nice, just wish it functioned properly.</li>
            <li> It goes on quickly and smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Alot better than Revlon color stay black eyeliner which I use to use  before which is not as good as the L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Arrived fairly quick.</li>
            <li> My eyes were mildly bloodshot, also.</li>
            <li> This is better than an eyeliner that was highly recommended from another site.</li>
            <li> I generally use a felt-tip marker kind of eyeliner for that because i&#x27;m hopeless with liquid)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very versatile.  </li>
            <li> but this one stays put very well and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and I would never switch to any other kind!</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s not so great is that it also does not stay for too long and smudges easily.</li>
            <li> Every time I ran out, I would try a new brand because I was never satisfied - even after trying all of the best sellers from Sephora.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice black, and feels good going on, just wish it were a little better.</li>
            <li> its pigmented, soft, stays very well, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a good facial cleanser to get it off, it can be a bit stubborn due to its abilty to perform well all day.</li>
            <li> and there is this tiny sharpener attached that can be used to sharpened very precisely.  </li>
            <li> but I like it very much</li>
            <li> though I like this pencil very much, my preferred liner for doing waterline eyeliner is the L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Gel Lacquer Liner in Navy #172.  </li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, it is very black and stays on a long time, and it has the sharpener which is great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge too much!</li>
            <li> I actually recommend this over some of the top brands that I have used and I have been using make-up for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> I have gotten used to this, but at first I did not like how it went on.  </li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, and purchased it for myself at a local Target store.</li>
            <li> It is a deep navy &amp; helps make my eye whites, appear a bit more white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many different eyeliners but this one stays on very well.</li>
            <li> Better than my last liner as it is pretty dark and spreads very smoothly across my eye.</li>
            <li> Only gave it 4 stars as it smears easily.</li>
            <li> It is just right consistency, not hard and not too smudgy.</li>
            <li> the next best thing to buying the super expensive ones.</li>
            <li> This eye liner came without any packaging, and the top was jammed on to the point of breaking off the tip.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> work it into my upper lashes (after brushing on some light shadow) and soften the line with my pinkie.  </li>
            <li> but in this case, it really is.</li>
            <li> smudger on this pencil is unusual; it is not the spongy/bendable smudger.  </li>
            <li> It really stays out for hours.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a couple of times, and what I really like about</li>
            <li> thank you for the fast shipping</li>
            <li> Only problem is that it can never really set on the water line so it will smudge there but works great for upper lid.</li>
            <li> My favorite hands down.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it is kind of hard to remove and no matter how much I clean my eyes</li>
            <li> I put a black line of this eyeliner on my top lid, by lunch</li>
            <li> I use it on my bottom lids when I use liquid on top or all around on more casual days.</li>
            <li> I had a blobby gray mess along on my top and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Before I found Loreal Infallible, I never had a normal brand that I stuck to.</li>
            <li> I love this fordable, long lasting, eye liner.</li>
            <li> Is it new or not?</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where the heat tends to make everything else smear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented, it last a very long time like advertised, and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dark, blends beautifully, is a strong black, and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many eyeliners in the past, nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li> have dark brown eyes &amp; my favorite is the navy blue.  </li>
            <li> I wear contacts and I have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyeliner since I saw it recommended on a makeup video, which said it stays longer than others when applied on the inner eye; and it does but not as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> Just after a week of using this product, my Mom developed sores all over her eyelids.</li>
            <li> It is soft enough that the color goes on without hurting your eye lids, but not so soft that it smears or is washed away by eye drops or tears.</li>
            <li> Finally, when I stop using this product, the irritation completely cleared up in a couple of days!</li>
            <li> Cool day, no eye rubbing or watering just straight up failure to sit there on my eyelid which is the only thing it needs to do.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that it gets dull quickly and the sharpener that comes with it gets caked up fast and its hard to clean.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and applies smoothly and dark.</li>
            <li> only use this type of eyeliner for tightlining my upper lids, so I can&#x27;t say too much about how well it does if you&#x27;re putting it above your lashes</li>
            <li> have been wearing eyeliner every day since I was old enough to wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I like that it stays on much longer than other liners.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, easy to use, the cap stays on, comes out a nice black, I can line thin or thick, so suits me</li>
            <li> It may smudge a little bit if it&#x27;s particularly hot out</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t typically spend this much on eyeliner.</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s been a particularly rough day for my makeup, but it by far still outshines any other pencil-type eyeliner in its price range as far as I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I use these and have a lot of them, line my eyes carefully, looks neat, stays on, doesnt give too heavy a look depending on how much you apply, and works for me!  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and doesn&#x27;t run during the day.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it is a little easier to apply and it does not smudge as fast as the other drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> At this point, I have stopped considering permanent eyeliner, as long as L&#x27;Oreal keeps making Infallible eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge throughout the day like several other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get the tip sharp enough to get this effect.</li>
            <li> it last a long time and is very dark.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  </li>
            <li> the paper and back was missing.</li>
            <li> I usually use Stila, and Bare Minerals, and other eyeliners that cost 3 times this.  </li>
            <li> other eyeliners dont compare.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have purchased other brands similar to this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to work like any other drugstore eye liner product.</li>
            <li> I have been so disappointed with so many eye liners out there.</li>
            <li> The liner wouldn&#x27;t give more product by turning the base or any other way.</li>
            <li> With other eyeliners, it was either too dull and would both fade and smudge on my waterline, or it was really nicely black, but would get all over the place instantly and make me look like an insomniac raccoon (looking at you, Maybelline Define-A-Line).</li>
            <li> As weird as this sounds, I receive compliments like \\&quot;I really like your eyeliner,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> I despise having to sharpen a pencil that will cut your eyelid if the pencil wears down and I can&#x27;t stand that feeling.</li>
            <li> I have an oily eye area and slightly hooded eyes.</li>
            <li> I like the &amp;#34;smudge brush&amp;#34; at the end which is not made of typical sponge material but a plastic type material.</li>
            <li> Attaching a photo the color is actually black but looks lighter with the flash.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend because it can be expensive in stores.</li>
            <li> This is barely visible, cheap looking, terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not as \\&quot;infallible\\&quot; as I&#x27;d like - one little wipe at the eyes and this is all over the place.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it skips a little</li>
            <li> If you are an eyeliner person and you&#x27;ve never tried this brand, you are missing out...</li>
            <li> No smearing, not too hard to make a sharp line, stays on all day-</li>
            <li> I am one of those who wears at least a little eyeliner everyday</li>
            <li> and it seriously looks about as dark at the end if the day as it did in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tip was dull and uneven.  </li>
            <li> but anyway if you wear contacts and have trouble with lining the water line, TRY THIS!</li>
            <li> I usually have problems with these types of eyeliners smudging all over</li>
            <li> I do not like this eyeliner, it never stays sharp, very dull tip, which makes it hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> but I still reach for my dedicated smudger when I need to get at a very small areas/touchup.  </li>
            <li> Does not irritate the skin, but does require that you have make-up remover as it&#x27;s very difficult to remove with just a wet towel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this review because I feel really bad for the ppl who haven&#x27;t found this yet and are wasting their money on other eyeliners.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the money to buy the expensive eyeliners I recommend you try this drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I was getting desperate, even changing contact lens solutions to find the cause.</li>
            <li> If you can keep your hands away from your eyes, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was a bad product!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff a million times, never fails/ Doesn&#x27;t smudge throughout the day like several other brands I&#x27;ve tried. the next best thing to buying the super expensive ones.</li>
            <li> This really is a super addition to my favorite makeup.  It is just right consistency, not hard and not too smudgy. Easy to use and very versatile.  It even has a tiny sharpener just pull off the tip with the blender and there is this tiny sharpener attached that can be used to sharpened very precisely.  Every thing designed just so.</li>
            <li> This eye liner came without any packaging, and the top was jammed on to the point of breaking off the tip. The eyeliner it&#x27;s self was melted. This was a bad product!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Love love love this eyeliner...it doesn&#x27;t wear off! It&#x27;s better than the expensive brands...I&#x27;m gonna be using this from now on</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is perfect for people with contacts. I used to not be able to wear eyeliner on the waterline of my eyes without getting cloudy eyed and itchy while wearing my contacts. This eyeliner DOES NOT SMUDGE. Truly the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used .</li>
            <li> This is the best liner I have ever found does not smear at all like others during the day. Absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> other eyeliners dont compare. its pigmented, soft, stays very well, and very easy to use. replaces your liquid and pencil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do well with eyeliner but this product is great for my skin type. It looks flawless for hours.</li>
            <li> I have used better and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I had 2 days of use, then had to toss it.  The liner wouldn&#x27;t give more product by turning the base or any other way.</li>
            <li> I wear a strong cat eye eyeliner every day, and this is the best drug store brand I&#x27;ve found so far. No smearing, not too hard to make a sharp line, stays on all day- no creeping into the creases.</li>
            <li> This is better than an eyeliner that was highly recommended from another site. It goes on easy and smooth, I haven&#x27;t even had a problem with smearing! It is such an affordable product, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I use these and have a lot of them, line my eyes carefully, looks neat, stays on, doesnt give too heavy a look depending on how much you apply, and works for me!  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, easy to use, the cap stays on, comes out a nice black, I can line thin or thick, so suits me fine.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this b/c it is smudge free, easy to wear and stays on.  I also love that it is not liquid and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The eye pencil was not in the original packaging as pictured on Amazon. Is it new or not? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner!  I like that it stays on much longer than other liners.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I got this a while ago from Ulta, and I&#x27;m never turning back.&lt;br /&gt;I only use this type of eyeliner for tightlining my upper lids, so I can&#x27;t say too much about how well it does if you&#x27;re putting it above your lashes (although any pencil-type eyeliner is going to smudge if you rub it, so don&#x27;t expect a perfect cat eye. I generally use a felt-tip marker kind of eyeliner for that because i&#x27;m hopeless with liquid)&lt;br /&gt;But this eyeliner has been absolutely amazing for the porpose I use it for. With other eyeliners, it was either too dull and would both fade and smudge on my waterline, or it was really nicely black, but would get all over the place instantly and make me look like an insomniac raccoon (looking at you, Maybelline Define-A-Line). This liner, however is just perfect. It&#x27;s a beautifully rich color, and it stays just where I want it to. It may smudge a little bit if it&#x27;s particularly hot out or if it&#x27;s been a particularly rough day for my makeup, but it by far still outshines any other pencil-type eyeliner in its price range as far as I&#x27;ve seen. I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loved it..</li>
            <li> In the past, I have purchased other brands similar to this product. I thought I would try L&#x27;Oreal and they didn&#x27;t let me down. Goes on easy and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice liner. Better than my last liner as it is pretty dark and spreads very smoothly across my eye. The only thing that&#x27;s not so great is that it also does not stay for too long and smudges easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I will probably buy it again.  I wish the tip would stay sharper maybe add that</li>
            <li> In the heat of summer this only lasts about 1 hour on me.  I have an oily eye area and slightly hooded eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and I love. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that it gets dull quickly and the sharpener that comes with it gets caked up fast and its hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I am one of those who wears at least a little eyeliner everyday so I&#x27;ve tried many different brands over the years and this is the best I&#x27;ve found. It goes on easily and best of all it doesn&#x27;t run, even after a full day of work and a couple of hours at the gym.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner! Does not smudge and stays on throughout the day!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. It&#x27;s very pigmented, it last a very long time like advertised, and it goes on smooth. I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is easy to apply and I like the self sharpening feature, but I find after wearing it a while it gives me raccoon eyes. I will have to continue looking for a good eyeliner and won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Love this it works so great.</li>
            <li> 9:30 am I put a black line of this eyeliner on my top lid, by lunch I had a blobby gray mess along on my top and bottom lashes. Cool day, no eye rubbing or watering just straight up failure to sit there on my eyelid which is the only thing it needs to do. Easily the shortest lifespan of any eyeliner I have ever used and I don&#x27;t typically spend this much on eyeliner. \\&quot;16 hours\\&quot; \\&quot;infallible\\&quot; \\&quot;never fail\\&quot; and there I was, emo mom. Boo.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great! I have used many different eyeliners but this one stays on very well. I like the &amp;#34;smudge brush&amp;#34; at the end which is not made of typical sponge material but a plastic type material. It allows me to go back over my eyeliner to even out the lines.</li>
            <li> My favorite. Goes on really easy. Rubs off kind of easy after a while, but they all do.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY eyeliner I will use on my lash line. It doesnt smeer like the others I&#x27;ve had have and it stays on well. I use to use it on my top eyelid and it worked great, but now I use a gel liner on top which I would suggest, but this is still great!</li>
            <li> Long lasting and doesn&#x27;t run during the day. Love it.</li>
            <li> After you out this on let it set... it works great. Only problem is that it can never really set on the water line so it will smudge there but works great for upper lid.</li>
            <li> Yes you do have to reapply, but I love this liner.  It&#x27;s a regular for me.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner does not gllide on as it was supposed to do... however, if you plan on writing with it then it does :-)</li>
            <li> I do like this eyeliner, the application is very smooth - but the built in sharpener seems to only shave off the sides and won&#x27;t make the tip into an actual point - got this to try and do a kitten eye effect and I can&#x27;t get the tip sharp enough to get this effect. It&#x27;s also not as \\&quot;infallible\\&quot; as I&#x27;d like - one little wipe at the eyes and this is all over the place. It&#x27;s a nice black, and feels good going on, just wish it were a little better.</li>
            <li> I usually use Stila, and Bare Minerals, and other eyeliners that cost 3 times this.  I&#x27;m sold.  I will be purchasing this from now on.</li>
            <li> If you want gPod drugstore eyeliner, try Maybelline Ultraliner. This is barely visible, cheap looking, terrible.</li>
            <li> Product does as it says. It stays on all day. I live in Arizona where the heat tends to make everything else smear. I like this because it stays put and I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  Nice texture, nice pencil.</li>
            <li> For me this is the best eyeliner I found.. It is soft enough that the color goes on without hurting your eye lids, but not so soft that it smears or is washed away by eye drops or tears. It does not cost a fortune either.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Just buy it and you will like it!</li>
            <li> Seems to work like any other drugstore eye liner product. Only thing is that it is a little easier to apply and it does not smudge as fast as the other drugstore brands. But, it will smudge. Not a bad product, just not as great as advertised.</li>
            <li> Best... Eyeliner... EVER!</li>
            <li> This is a good every day eyeliner. I use it on my bottom lids when I use liquid on top or all around on more casual days. It doesn&#x27;t stay perfectly but it&#x27;s better than a lot of eyeliners out there. Doesn&#x27;t smudge too much!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the money to buy the expensive eyeliners I recommend you try this drugstore brand. It is long lasting and applies smoothly and dark. I actually recommend this over some of the top brands that I have used and I have been using make-up for over 15 years. Arrived fairly quick. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and I have sensitive combination skin. I have been so disappointed with so many eye liners out there. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Chanel to MAC and nothing seems to work. I despise having to sharpen a pencil that will cut your eyelid if the pencil wears down and I can&#x27;t stand that feeling. This pencil is easy to use, there is no sharpening, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge after a 12 hour day. Make sure you use a good facial cleanser to get it off, it can be a bit stubborn due to its abilty to perform well all day. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great liner, very pigmented, lasts all day. Very happy, have purchased multiple times!</li>
            <li> packaging was nothing like what you see in the picture. the paper and back was missing. and if you want to sell it or give it as a gift that would be a problem.</li>
            <li> Really good product, and stays all day.  Sometimes it skips a little but I like it very much</li>
            <li> not like they said that kind of waterproof</li>
            <li> I like to line my water line when I wear makeup, but the problem with most of my eyeliners is they smear onto my contacts and are really uncomfortable. This one stays put all day and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all! The only problem is it is kind of hard to remove and no matter how much I clean my eyes there is always some leftover product smudged around the next day. of course I am just being picky and want all my products to be super easy to remove. but anyway if you wear contacts and have trouble with lining the water line, TRY THIS!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Only gave it 4 stars as it smears easily. If you can keep your hands away from your eyes, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I do not like this eyeliner, it never stays sharp, very dull tip, which makes it hard to apply.  Even after applying it smears.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing eyeliner for 30 years. I have used higher end eyeliners, but have always experienced smudging by the end of the day. This is absolutely the best eyeliner I have ever used! At the end of the day my makeup looks the same as when I applied it. HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> If you are an eyeliner person and you&#x27;ve never tried this brand, you are missing out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing eyeliner every day since I was old enough to wear makeup. Before I found Loreal Infallible, I never had a normal brand that I stuck to. Every time I ran out, I would try a new brand because I was never satisfied - even after trying all of the best sellers from Sephora. But ever since I bought this on sale at CVS, it has been the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve used for almost 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smear as easily and stays on for a loong time. As weird as this sounds, I receive compliments like \\&quot;I really like your eyeliner,\\&quot; and ppl ask me what kind I use all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this review because I feel really bad for the ppl who haven&#x27;t found this yet and are wasting their money on other eyeliners. So if you haven&#x27;t already, add to cart and buy it now! :)</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  Love it.  I do not feel like it is anywhere in the same neighborhood as \\&quot;dry,\\&quot; and it seriously looks about as dark at the end if the day as it did in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work it into my upper lashes (after brushing on some light shadow) and soften the line with my pinkie.  It goes on smooth and dark, blends beautifully, is a strong black, and stays on all day.  No smudging at all for me.  Hands down best eyeliner i have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have gotten used to this, but at first I did not like how it went on.  It&#x27;s good now.</li>
            <li> I was considering getting permanent eyeliner because no matter what I do, my eyeliner tends to fade or smear or wear off by the end of a day. I decided to try this because the packaging said it was smudge-resistent and lasts for 16 hours. I realize it&#x27;s what companies do when marketing or advertising, they promise the product is the best, and sometimes it&#x27;s not, but in this case, it really is. I am very impressed. At this point, I have stopped considering permanent eyeliner, as long as L&#x27;Oreal keeps making Infallible eyeliners. I have bought them in almost every color and each one is great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyeliner!! I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for 3 years and I would never switch to any other kind! The packaging says it lasts for 16 hours, but It stays on for more than 16 hours for me! (Eventhough I have moderately oily eye lids.) it&#x27;s SUPER EASY to apply, glides smoothly, and easy to wash off! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Threw away burned my eyeS</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyeliner since I saw it recommended on a makeup video, which said it stays longer than others when applied on the inner eye; and it does but not as much as I would like. Anyway itâ€™s a good product, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, it is very black and stays on a long time, and it has the sharpener which is great. Alot better than Revlon color stay black eyeliner which I use to use  before which is not as good as the L&#x27;Oreal. Great purchase..totally recommend this..</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, and purchased it for myself at a local Target store. My Mom asked for me to get her an eyeliner like mine, so I check on Amazon, and purchased this one which was the same as mine. Just after a week of using this product, my Mom developed sores all over her eyelids. This item did not come in its original packaging, and I feel that it is not the product they describe it to be. Do not buy from this!!</li>
            <li> This is very good eyeliner.  It goes on smooth &amp; lasts most of the day. When I do waterline eyeliner, it works well &amp; does not leave a smudge on the lower lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smudger on this pencil is unusual; it is not the spongy/bendable smudger.  It does a good job of smudging but I still reach for my dedicated smudger when I need to get at a very small areas/touchup.  This smudger is easier to keep clean because the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t get gunked in to a \\&quot;spongy\\&quot; smudger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown eyes &amp; my favorite is the navy blue.  It is a deep navy &amp; helps make my eye whites, appear a bit more white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I like this pencil very much, my preferred liner for doing waterline eyeliner is the L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Gel Lacquer Liner in Navy #172.  That comes with a really good brush &amp; it makes water lining really easy.  It lasts longer &amp; the brush gives me lots of control to do a neat job of lining.</li>
            <li> I am not allergic to anything, but after using this eyeliner, my eyelids started to get rather dry-looking &amp; flaky; then progressed to redness &amp; puffiness. My eyes were mildly bloodshot, also. This was a gradual situation taking place over 5 months or so. I tried eliminating one eye product after another to try &amp; pinpoint what was causing the irritation! I was getting desperate, even changing contact lens solutions to find the cause. Finally, when I stop using this product, the irritation completely cleared up in a couple of days!</li>
            <li> A great stick eyeliner. My favorite hands down. It really stays out for hours.</li>
            <li> Item did not come in factory packaging and was not safety sealed. The tip was dull and uneven.  I am scared it was used which is a health concern. I buy this eyeliner often in local stores and I have never had a tip start out looking like this.  Attaching a photo the color is actually black but looks lighter with the flash.</li>
            <li> I love this fordable, long lasting, eye liner. It glides on smooth and stays all day. I don&#x27;t use the smudge tip it does not seem to work that great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a couple of times, and what I really like about it is the smudger tool.  But it keeps popping out of it&#x27;s spot at the end of the pencil, which is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I got a crummy one or if they are all defective, but the product is nice, just wish it functioned properly.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner it last a long time and is very dark. Item came new and in good condition! I highly recommend because it can be expensive in stores.</li>
            <li> I love it all of my eye liners always smear this one lasts!! thank you for the fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  It goes on quickly and smoothly and lasts all day. I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> Glides on well. Stays on all day. Looks so good! I have tried so many eyeliners in the past, nothing compares to this one. I will be sticking with it!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner stays on all day. I usually have problems with these types of eyeliners smudging all over but this one stays put very well and is easy to apply. Does not irritate the skin, but does require that you have make-up remover as it&#x27;s very difficult to remove with just a wet towel.</li>
            <li> I love my L&#x27;Oreal products!</li>
