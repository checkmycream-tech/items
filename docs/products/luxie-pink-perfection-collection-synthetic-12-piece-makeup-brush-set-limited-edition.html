            <li>UNTIL, I bought Luxie Lush&#x27;s 12 Piece High Quality Synthetic Makeup Brush Set!!!!</li>

            <li>rose gold and black)</li>
            <li>I bought these for my wife and she absolutely loves them.  </li>
            <li>and she really loves them.  </li>
            <li>I had no idea some very well known makeup artists have already started using them.  </li>
            <li>plus who doesn&#x27;t love pink!</li>
            <li>I ran across these brushes and not only are they super cute and pink..</li>
            <li>last but not leaset, this 12 makeup brush collection set also comes in a high-end quality pink leather  cup holder (with lid) which is great for daily organization and traveling (close the lid, snap the lid lock and go!).</li>
            <li>There are a lot of small eye brushes which I don&#x27;t often use but it is nice to have.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li>These brushes are high quality and softer than the MAC or Sephora brushes I have.  </li>
            <li>and the prices were always sooo high.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable set that is high quality.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing a set for myself and now I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>i opened the packaged and notice the brushes were really soft!</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon Luxie lush when i was on a friends</li>
            <li>, the bristles are SO soft.</li>
            <li>It would have never crossed my mind, however my friend is a professional makeup artist and insisted that I try out these brushes.</li>
            <li>I almost fainted when she told me that other brushes are as much as $40 per brush.  </li>
            <li>The stippling brush is not very dense, it is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>The price of these high quality brushes are reasonable and half the cost of any other designer brushes!</li>

            <li> I bought these for my wife and she absolutely loves them.  I almost fainted when she told me that other brushes are as much as $40 per brush.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the value of getting 12 high quality brushes for an excellent price.  My wife loves the feel and quality of these brushes.  I immediately bought another set for my daughter who loves them as well.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my friend as a gift and she really loves them.  Great quality so soft and at an amazing price... plus who doesn&#x27;t love pink!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is a bit of a diva.  I bought her these brushes while searching for a &amp;#34;thinking about you&amp;#34; gift and knocked it out of the park.  She is obsessed with them and has ordered more than I would like to admit as gifts for her friends. I had no idea some very well known makeup artists have already started using them.  Girls, I am sure this will be a makeup purchase you will not regret. Guys, if you want to score some points grab these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased these brushes yet, but i have used a friends for trial. They are soft, do not shed and perfect weight for a makeupartist. I love these brushes and reccomend them!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush set. Great quality, love the antibacterial technology and the baby softness against the skin. Surprising they&#x27;re much better than the Mac I&#x27;ve been using. Too bad I got mine when it wasn&#x27;t on sale though.</li>
            <li> Have you ever feel in love with the perfect makeup brush set? Neither have I... UNTIL, I bought Luxie Lush&#x27;s 12 Piece High Quality Synthetic Makeup Brush Set!!!! You get all the typical brushes that you need and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are made with the finest quality of synthetic fibers. The bristle size and softness are perfect for natural makeup application.  My favorite brushes in the set are: 1) Foundation Brush Precision Concealer Brush - this brush applies your foundation and concealer flawlessly; It doesn&#x27;t even look like I am wearing foundation, 2) Eye Shadow Brush - applies colors on your eye lid easily with 1-2 strokes of application and 3) Angel Brush, is the perfect size to help crease your eye inner lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last but not leaset, this 12 makeup brush collection set also comes in a high-end quality pink leather  cup holder (with lid) which is great for daily organization and traveling (close the lid, snap the lid lock and go!).</li>
            <li> Good price on Amazon for 12 pieces!!!  These brushes are high quality and softer than the MAC or Sephora brushes I have.  They are also a nice shade of pink and rose gold and look beautiful!!!  Only downside is that I didn&#x27;t get them at this rate on Amazon!  :(</li>
            <li> Love the softness against my skin, the colors, and the price!!! Def better than the brushes I got from MAC.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon Luxie lush when i was on a friends Facebook, I saw in bold letters that they were having a 30% dc so i immediately checked amazon and it so happens to be available. I read that there were 2 sets of colors (rose gold and black) but i didn&#x27;t see any option for purchase. This brush set reminds me of Sigma 12 piece makeup brush set but @ a cheaper price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the shipment arrived home i opened the packaged and notice the brushes were really soft! The only down fall i would say is that they do not label their brushes. As for the Sigma brush set they have labeled each brush for a specific need - It would also be a plus for beginners if they had their brushes labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet used the brush but i am so excited! Luckily i have found this brush set at a discounted price - It&#x27;s so compact and is so convenient to pack in your suitcase for your travel needs.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING set of brushes that I bought for my college daughter!  She said the &amp;#34;softest, most durable&amp;#34; that she or her friends have ever seen.  They apply make-up flawlessly and are so very pretty just to look at.  Very study case rounds it all out to a beautiful gift and must have for self.  AND, arrived ahead of time!  Thank you :-)</li>
            <li> Love love these brushes! Got them last year as a gift and they still work wonderfully. The brushes are super soft and feel great on my skin. They apply all foundations, eyeshadows, concealers, and blushes really well for a smooth, beautiful finish. Definitely a great investment for the price point, too. If you can, get their rose-scented brush cleaner for an easy way to care for your brushes.</li>

            <li> Very glad i bought these brushes! The brushes are super soft and very cute! Nice light pink handle and rose gold ferrule, the bristles are SO soft. The brushes come in a cute and sturdy container and the face brushes have a protective plastic sleeve to keep its shape! The brushes are good quality and when i contacted the luxie lush team they are quick to respond and help with any problems or questions! Excellent customer service and shipped promptly! Absolutely satisfied! Would recommend this to anyone looking for a cute set of brushes!</li>
            <li> Based on all the positive reviews I decided to buy my girlfriend a set &amp; she Loves them!! Great quality. Awesome find</li>
            <li> I heard about these brushes through a friend who is a make up artist. She highly recommended these brushes to me and I was pleasantly surprised of how great they work. I have used cosmetic counter brushes in the past, such as: MAC, Bobbi Brown, NARS etc. These brushes are just as great quality at a fraction of the price. In this set, you recieve 12 brushes at the price of 2 of the other name brand brushes! I wish I knew about these brushes sooner so I could have saved money! I definitely recommend this brush set!</li>
            <li> These are the cutest and best brushes ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was so sick of people at the makeup counter telling me that I needed to buy a different brush for this and that and the prices were always sooo high.  I would buy one and lose it because I couldn&#x27;t keep track of all of the different brands I had to buy.  I ran across these brushes and not only are they super cute and pink..but the quality is excellent as well.  The price is wonderful…..I feel like you can only buy 1 or 2 brushes at this price .  I have a brush now for all of my makeup and plus a cute carrying case for them too!!!! I would highly recommend buying this fabulous set! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have been using my MAC brushes for the longest time and refused to ever switch. It would have never crossed my mind, however my friend is a professional makeup artist and insisted that I try out these brushes. Since I was there at her home, I decided to experiment with them. I&#x27;m so glad I did because the application went on so smooth and gives my eyes so much pigment. The application and blending looks so flawless and the foundation and face brushes made my face look perfect throughout the day. After 10 hours my face never felt and looked so fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes so pretty in a light pink color and rose gold. More importantly, the bristles of the brushes are soft and works like like a charm. I ended up purchasing a set for myself and now I can&#x27;t live without them. The brushes also comes in a brush case which is perfect for traveling. The price of these high quality brushes are reasonable and half the cost of any other designer brushes! Don&#x27;t let any other name brand labels fool you! If you&#x27;re looking for a flawless and professional makeup look, these brushes will not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the softness of the brushes and how well they pick up product. There are a lot of small eye brushes which I don&#x27;t often use but it is nice to have. The stippling brush is not very dense, it is my least favorite. I love the large powder brush and concealer brush. The concealer brush tops Mac&#x27;s 195. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable set that is high quality.</li>
