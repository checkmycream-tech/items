            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Image products for 10 years now, and I love all of them I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...discovered it in a spa in Vegas</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both use it - it is bar none the best product I&#x27;ve used for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect combination for my type of dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My face looks better, brighter and more full of life.</li>
            <li>Excellent serum combined with a variety of other Image One skin care products.  </li>
            <li>I use it around my eye area, too and it helps soften fine lines and plump up my skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT, CAN USE UNDER MAKE-UP, DRYS QUICKLY, TAKES PUFFINESS AWAY UNDER AND AROUND YOUR EYES.</li>
            <li>It dries on the skin quickly so make sure to apply moisturizer immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This type is so smooth, it doesn&#x27;t react with your make up, or face lotions.  </li>
            <li>In my many years of trying so many other products, I have never been more pleased with what Image does for my skin!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants nice skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth.</li>
            <li>The Image Skin Line is perfect for aging skin - really can see tightening based on your regular skin regiment.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the whole Image line!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with out this amazing product.</li>
            <li>For usage, I apply a pea-sized amount to a clean face overnight.  </li>
            <li>sure if I&#x27;m looking younger, but my skin is more hydrated.</li>
            <li>This is very lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it gets absorbed immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time Image product user and just love this line!</li>
            <li>You can feel the reaction right away.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>The first ingredient listed was aqua(water).  </li>
            <li>It has always been exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I think this is really making a difference!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had adult onset acne for 10 years and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that calms my skin, reduces breakouts, plumps up light scars, and never looks greasy.  </li>
            <li>I am 62 and my dermatologist says that I simply have to start taking better care of my skin.</li>
            <li>I am trying to rid my house of the top ten toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>This one really works as I feel the &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; right away.  </li>
            <li>Initially got it from my esthetician, then ordered it much cheaper :)</li>
            <li>Just started using it, but ingredients are slightly different than last time I ordered it, so I hope it is as good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and stays on and then just dryes in white flakes on the skin even if you do your best to rub it in.</li>
            <li>I do not know if there are long term effects of using this product, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Dry skin may need more moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But be sure to apply it first before any other products and let it work for about 5 minutes before applying a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Will have to look elsewhere for the real product.</li>
            <li>This item is not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Very diappointed</li>
            <li>It really is.</li>
            <li>I really like what this does for my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels really hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Each product I have used from Image has worked really well on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft, fresh, and supple.</li>
            <li>and I must say, I really do like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Makes a noticeable difference and leaves my skin very hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten any new spots, but I wish I would get some fading!</li>
            <li>Paid 125 in a salon, love that I found it for WAY less on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My product came very quickly and there were absolutely no problems.</li>
            <li>It adds moisture to every skin cell supposedly - which as we get older everyone needs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft after it absorbs!</li>
            <li>(my first bottle lasted almost the entire 6 months)</li>
            <li>it turned out to be caused by something else but simply coincided with first usage of this.</li>
            <li>I normally spend twice as much on this product at my local salon.</li>
            <li>The Image line is the only line of skin products that allows me to see nearly instantly, positive results in the skin of my face and neck.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your skin sensitive</li>
            <li>and I am sensitive to perfume.  </li>
            <li>I will not waste my money ever again on all these gimmicks (Dr. OZ and Opera promises just to name a couple).</li>
            <li>Ordering my fourth bottle through Amazon today - after initially getting it (at a much higher price) through my esthetician.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft, and my pores appear much smaller.</li>
            <li>When other people notice the results as much as I do, that&#x27;s a vote of confidence too.</li>
            <li>I live at 8,000+ feet altitude, and it is totally dry up here.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily with the Vital C Hydrating Anti Aging Serum during the day, and several times a month at night with the Image Ageless Retinol A creme.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t envision purchasing anything different in the near future!</li>

            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> It was thick and gooey almost like glue which is an indication that the product was old and out dated.</li>
            <li> the aethetician suggested patting on my face (instead of massaging in) because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use it  along with all other Image skincare.</li>
            <li> Yes you can combine this with other Image products.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have tried other Hyaluronic serums from other companies and they never worked like the Image product.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other products (creams, lotions, etc) this does not run down my face if I start to sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately one year, and I have far fewer breakouts.  </li>
            <li> it is watered down.  </li>
            <li> I wrote a review previously about developing a rash from this product...</li>
            <li> Just go to their website: [...] and read up on this fantastic line.</li>
            <li> Just wish the price was a little lower</li>
            <li> As for taking care of the sagging (which isn&#x27;t all too bad yet thanks to other Image products) this one helps when combined with a retinol product in the evening.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount</li>
            <li> Could see a difference in my skin in less than a week!!</li>
            <li> I hope this is helping, it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slowly converted to using just Image products.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that slowly the spots would fade, but no.</li>
            <li> It is sticky and thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suppose to be thick and this bottle was thin and had an odor.  </li>
            <li> Vital C has some terrible chemicals in some products.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s asking a lot for my awful complexion.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, CAN USE UNDER MAKE-UP, DRYS QUICKLY, TAKES PUFFINESS AWAY UNDER AND AROUND YOUR EYES.</li>
            <li> I have use fillers for years.  This type is so smooth, it doesn&#x27;t react with your make up, or face lotions.  You can feel the reaction right away.  The price is excellent. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin sensitive</li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended it and I LOVE IT....</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Initially got it from my esthetician, then ordered it much cheaper :)</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have tried many skincare lines. Image is by far the best on the market</li>
            <li> I use it twice daily, morning and evening.  I can see seem improvements in my face.  Not a miracle worker but really good stuff.  I use it  along with all other Image skincare.</li>
            <li> Love it, feels great as it goes on and my skin is so soft after it absorbs! Paid 125 in a salon, love that I found it for WAY less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient listed was aqua(water).  Ive bought this product 4 or 5 times.  It has always been exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;Now it is watered down.  Will have to look elsewhere for the real product.</li>
            <li> Excellent serum combined with a variety of other Image One skin care products.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> After using this product for over two weeks, when I went for my monthly facial, my esthetician was amazed and impressed at how plumb and moisturized my skin was. I&#x27;ve slowly converted to using just Image products. Their excellent!!!</li>
            <li> I think this is really making a difference!  Lines above my lips were getting really deep and now they are maybe 75% less after just a few weeks.  I use this in the morning with my Olay CC cream and at night with my Image Vitamin C cream.  It goes on very nicely and absorbs quickly and I have not notice any order or fragrance - and I am sensitive to perfume.  I&#x27;ll be using this forever so definitely will buy and again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that slowly the spots would fade, but no. I haven&#x27;t gotten any new spots, but I wish I would get some fading!</li>
            <li> This item is not the real thing.  It&#x27;s suppose to be thick and this bottle was thin and had an odor.  Very diappointed</li>
            <li> Great hydration and smells great. Image line is one of the best lines and I work in dermatology so I have seen everything</li>
            <li> I have been using Image skin care for about a year now and I am very happy that I switched.  This Hyaluronic Filler is great to put on after you have cleaned your face.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t put it on when I&#x27;m in a hurry and I&#x27;m always upset when I don&#x27;t take the time to put it on because my skin just doesn&#x27;t feel the same without it.  I have purchased this product several times.</li>
            <li> This serum is absolutely amazing!  My husband and I both use it - it is bar none the best product I&#x27;ve used for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months and it has made a noticeable difference in the lines at the corner of my eyes and crow&#x27;s feet.  It has also improved my under eye darkness.  I use a small amount (my first bottle lasted almost the entire 6 months) under each eye every evening and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li> I am 50 1/2 (lol but true). My neck and jowls are showing signs of aging. Starting to sag as it were. I got this product for the super-hydration it promises. Well it works! I&#x27;m a long time Image product user and just love this line! But this product is superb! It really is. My face looks better, brighter and more full of life. As for taking care of the sagging (which isn&#x27;t all too bad yet thanks to other Image products) this one helps when combined with a retinol product in the evening. Yes you can combine this with other Image products. Just go to their website: [...] and read up on this fantastic line. And no I don&#x27;t sell them. I just endorse them because they have worked so well for me. And at the Image website you cannot buy these products unless you are licensed anyway. But it is a good source of information if you choose to start using the products. In my many years of trying so many other products, I have never been more pleased with what Image does for my skin! I will not waste my money ever again on all these gimmicks (Dr. OZ and Opera promises just to name a couple). I&#x27;m going to stick with what I know works. Especially for my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it makes my skin feel really wonderful.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants nice skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had adult onset acne for 10 years and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that calms my skin, reduces breakouts, plumps up light scars, and never looks greasy.  I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately one year, and I have far fewer breakouts.  For usage, I apply a pea-sized amount to a clean face overnight.  By morning, my skin looks plumped up, hydrated, and refreshed.  You can actually see the difference.  (I don&#x27;t have any affiliation with this brand, I just want to spread the good word!)</li>
            <li> I wrote a review previously about developing a rash from this product...it turned out to be caused by something else but simply coincided with first usage of this. So, now I know and am continuing to use this serum, I like it a lot. Makes my skin feel great and that&#x27;s asking a lot for my awful complexion. So, this is now a 5-star in my opinion 😊</li>
            <li> The Image Skin Line is perfect for aging skin - really can see tightening based on your regular skin regiment.</li>
            <li> This one really works as I feel the &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; right away.  But be sure to apply it first before any other products and let it work for about 5 minutes before applying a moisturizer.  Love the Amazon prices verses the spa prices!</li>
            <li> Not the results I had hoped for!</li>
            <li> I really like what this does for my skin.  I put in on in the morning and the evening.  My skin feels really hydrated.  I love the Image skin care line of products</li>
            <li> Excellent product for everyday use.  Helps retain moisture while providing a smoother non-oily finish.  Good for your skin.  I recommend using it morning and night.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell a difference--been using it about a week.</li>
            <li> Ordering my fourth bottle through Amazon today - after initially getting it (at a much higher price) through my esthetician.  Yes, it&#x27;s thicker but I personally like that.  I mix a drop in with moisturizer, vitamin C serum, liquid SPF that I put on my face - anything!  It makes anything you mix it with easier to apply, and think it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a cheaper hyaluronic acid through Amazon once, trying to save money, and the #1 ingredient was WATER.  It was SO runny and I returned it.  With this, the #1 ingredient is hyaluronic acid - and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re buying, right?</li>
            <li> I use Image Skin Care products for many years. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am 62 and my dermatologist says that I simply have to start taking better care of my skin. I am fair and have lots of skin damage because I grew up in the Tropics. I hope this is helping, it&#x27;s hard to tell. It adds moisture to every skin cell supposedly - which as we get older everyone needs. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, but ingredients are slightly different than last time I ordered it, so I hope it is as good.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the whole Image line! I live at 8,000+ feet altitude, and it is totally dry up here. The Image line is the only line of skin products that allows me to see nearly instantly, positive results in the skin of my face and neck. When other people notice the results as much as I do, that&#x27;s a vote of confidence too. I use this product daily with the Vital C Hydrating Anti Aging Serum during the day, and several times a month at night with the Image Ageless Retinol A creme. Each product I have used from Image has worked really well on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried Phytomer, Olay (Regenerist) and Garnier products and saw NO changes or effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This product does as stated. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I put this on before I go to bed and in the morning. My face feels so soft, fresh, and supple. I swear it is making me look younger and younger with each application. The seller was excellent too. My product came very quickly and there were absolutely no problems. I will definitely shop with them again.</li>
            <li> Only used this for a couple of weeks. So far so good. Leaves my skin feeling smooth. Can&#x27;t speak about long term effects yet.</li>
            <li> Prompt service. Great for my face</li>
            <li> have used before, excellent price and packaged very well</li>
            <li> Gives awesome moisture that locks into skin.  Great to use after a peel and routinely at night. A staple serum.</li>
            <li> I do not know if there are long term effects of using this product, but I love it.  It temporarily makes my skin look and feel great.  I have been using it daily for about a week now.  I will definitely buy another bottle when I run out.</li>
            <li> Well, it is suppoused to bring benefits to the skin.....but only if it gets into the skin. This product is not prepared to get in. It&#x27;s thick and stays on and then just dryes in white flakes on the skin even if you do your best to rub it in. Nevertheless it has nice scent and very pleasant to the skin.</li>
            <li> Why is this product is called filler? Good for oily skin. Dry skin may need more moisturizer. Can mix with Ormedic.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes ones skin feel like velvet and it is moisturizing . This is a recent find for me .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before from a spa and this is not the same. It is sticky and thick. I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I just love the way it feels on my skin and the way it makes my skin feel.  It is the perfect combination for my type of dry skin.  Not too drying  and not too moisturizing.  It does a wonderful job on healing any aftermath of a pimple or bump on my face.</li>
            <li> I use this product to hydrate my skin. It seems to help. It dries on the skin quickly so make sure to apply moisturizer immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I&#x27;m looking younger, but my skin is more hydrated.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;What are you using on your skin?&amp;#34; I get this question a lot. I&#x27;ve been using Image Skin Care&#x27;s hyaluronic acid for about a year now and I get a ton of compliments on my skin. I like this product because I put it on my face after I get out of the shower every morning and it gets absorbed immediately. Unlike other products (creams, lotions, etc) this does not run down my face if I start to sweat. Even the 30 year-old girls in my office have pointed out that I have no worry-lines &amp;#34;at my age&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m 42). I think this stuff is the cat&#x27;s meow.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I normally spend twice as much on this product at my local salon. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and have only purchased it from a salon. I decided to but thru Amazon because of the reduced price! Well, you get what you pay for - this product was not like I had purchased in local salons. It was thick and gooey almost like glue which is an indication that the product was old and out dated. I cannot find a date on the item but it was not the same.</li>
            <li> Could see a difference in my skin in less than a week!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I mix it with my vitamin C serum and it has made great difference in my skin. I will definitely order this again and again. Just wish the price was a little lower</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft, and my pores appear much smaller.</li>
            <li> I am trying to rid my house of the top ten toxic chemicals. This rated well (low on the harmful scale). Vital C has some terrible chemicals in some products. I have been using the line for years and loved it. I am done with their products with phosphate, PEG, EDTA. I am so glad I can keep using this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this product and I must say, I really do like it a lot.  You can wear it as a moisturizer prior to applying your makeup and your skin looks just radiant.  I will keep buying this one for sure.</li>
            <li> This helps give me a nice glow. It works well under makeup, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy finish. My skin looks smooth. I use it around my eye area, too and it helps soften fine lines and plump up my skin. I&#x27;ve been using Image products for 10 years now, and I love all of them I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...discovered it in a spa in Vegas (they used it on me during a facial) and Im on my third bottle.  Makes a noticeable difference and leaves my skin very hydrated.  The fluid is like the consistancy of mucous...the aethetician suggested patting on my face (instead of massaging in) because a little goes a long way.  I took her advise and I got hooked!  Its a daily treat for my skin :) Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing.  It completely rids my eyes of puffyness and dark circles in less than a couple of minutes.  I have tried other Hyaluronic serums from other companies and they never worked like the Image product.  I can&#x27;t live with out this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Helps prolong and add to moisturizer to hydrate skin</li>
            <li> Great product but it peels. If it didn&#x27;t peel; it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> This is very lightweight and easy to use.  I like the effect it has on my skin.</li>
            <li> Helps me stay hydrated even here in Utah!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  This is my second bottle of this and I don&#x27;t envision purchasing anything different in the near future!</li>
            <li> Good product and excellent shipping!</li>
