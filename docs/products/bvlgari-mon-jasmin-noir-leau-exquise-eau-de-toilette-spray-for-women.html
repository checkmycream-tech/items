            <li>ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!....</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the lasting clean smelling fragrance, so</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this right before Bvlgari was going to release it while shopping at Macy&#x27;s.</li>

            <li>it is fake,i have had the real one and the packaging was different and no product booklet inside the box.</li>
            <li>The price was the same as in the duty free stores and it arrived far quicker than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed my whole body until it was LITERALLY WET with their product and 20 minutes later I SMELL NOTHING,</li>

            <li> A friend gave me  Bulgari Mon Lasmin Noir L&#x27;eau Exquise last year and I fell in love with the lasting clean smelling fragrance, so I purchased it at the price of $41.99 from the seller of Amazon.Com LLC.....and this one is DEFINITELY A FAKE!  I sprayed my whole body until it was LITERALLY WET with their product and 20 minutes later I SMELL NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!....</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume after getting a sample at the mall!&lt;br /&gt;I loved the smell, it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like every perfume seems to do.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always a bit scared of ordering perfumes online because I don&#x27;t want to get ripped off, but this perfume is legit!&lt;br /&gt;It was in perfect condition and is definitely not watered down or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this fragrance.  I love it.  The price was the same as in the duty free stores and it arrived far quicker than I expected.  Packaging was excellent.  Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this Bvlgari scent their April 2014 Sample sale. I tried the tester but didn&#x27;t really pay attention to it and dropped it in my handbag. When I opened my bag at lunch inwas blown away by the scent.  I went back to the Sample Sale the following morning only to fin they were all sold out of this scent!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a good price.  Still not as good as the Sample Sale but good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say when Bvlgari has their November Sample Sale...I am purchasing as much as I can afford!!!</li>
            <li> Great price-love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Arrived in one piece, got what I paid for in the time expected. Met expectations. Good price. Thanks</li>

            <li> Fabulous ! Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;The only negativity was the smell of the box, smelled a bit like Moth Balls. Other than that , Great!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best perfumes that I have. It&#x27;s a very soft, sweet fragrance of jasmine. This smells luxurious. When I want to feel special, I wear this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
