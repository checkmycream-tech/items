            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>I never used a cream that worked this great.</li>
            <li>But Being someone that has Eczema from Head to toe and many allergies it didn&#x27;t work for me!!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!!</li>
            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT&#x27;S NOT GREASEY AND ABSORBS INTO THE SKIN VERY NICELY.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing!</li>
            <li>ITs why MSM and garlic is popular!</li>
            <li>Its like a miracle cure, honestly!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I have always loved it.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I purchase many of Melaleuca&#x27;s great products and get them for a great value.  </li>
            <li>AND YOU NEED A GOOD LOTION</li>
            <li>Saop is good also.</li>
            <li>This Product is really good.</li>
            <li>Oh well, to be fair</li>
            <li>This product is a good one.</li>
            <li>I am adverse to many of the products under the Melaleuca brand name because years ago it was a MLM (maybe still is), which I joined and after being buried in stuff I was required to purchase as a &amp;#34;dealer&amp;#34; LOL I bailed.</li>
            <li>It is the best lotion that I ever purchased, great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nongreasy, retain more moisture!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Yes I love this lotion!    </li>
            <li>perfect product, thanks!</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;ll have to bite the bullet and buy more once I run out!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>

            <li>This product is amazing.....</li>
            <li>It is amazing and keeps his eczema from breaking out.</li>
            <li>and it was amazing..</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews and heard amazing stories about how it helped others</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like a hospital.  </li>
            <li>It has proven to be the absolute best lotion we&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>Nice, not smelly.</li>
            <li>If you try and purchase through the company they give you a sales pitch and try to get you to join and sell to others (kind of like Amway), don&#x27;t care for that.</li>
            <li>is really nice</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion and worth the price.!</li>
            <li>It has a very light, pleasant scent and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is by far the best there is on the market.</li>
            <li>This lotion is by far the best there is on the market.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that makes my skin stay soft for hours.  </li>
            <li>I rarely take the time to rate a product but need to let people know what a great lotion this is.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be the best so far.</li>
            <li>So far, Renew is the best product for me.  </li>
            <li>Really an incredible product that I&#x27;m very thankful for.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best immediate relief lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>First one lasted 2 years and works great.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love, love this amazing product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very light smell</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very light.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product and we have been using this for our Toddler Daughter since She was couple months old!</li>
            <li>so it wont magically make my hands look and feel like new, but it sure is a good start! :-)</li>
            <li>Smell could be much better.  </li>
            <li>Love to use this product on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>An added benefit is that the whole family loves to use it - it smells great and has a non-greasy texture.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using the moisture cream for many years.</li>
            <li>Great product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I Love Renew Skin Lotion.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works much better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried...and we&#x27;ve tried just about everything.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s no miracle worker</li>
            <li>Still, it is a good product and was worth trying since others have found relief with the product.</li>
            <li>more yucky elbows;)&lt;br /&gt;Non</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>

            <li>It makes my skin feel healthy.</li>

            <li>The fragrance is nice and clean, not over powering.</li>

            <li>RENEW IS FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>greasy and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>My husband and I enjoy using this skin therapy.  </li>
            <li>One year later, my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC STUFF,</li>
            <li>You will enjoy this one..</li>
            <li>This lotion keeps me satin smooth day after day.</li>
            <li>This larger one is great for the bath, bedstand, and my kitchen.</li>
            <li>This Melaleuca product helps with itchy skin and keeps skin reasonably smooth.  </li>
            <li>, you get what you pay for, and now that it&#x27;s available through Amazon</li>
            <li>Not as good as what I got direct  from melaleuca,  </li>
            <li>This product is truelly amazing and as a melaleuca member you can buy it made fresh monthly and delivered right to your door for cheaper than anyone can resell it to you for.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this lotion!I apply it right after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I had received it as a gift originally, so when I ran out I had to find it online.</li>
            <li>This product is beyond amazing and as a Melaleuca member you can buy it with a 30-40% discount, delivered fast right to your door, and earn $100 in free products!!.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Although it arrived frozen solid (unavoidable in our climate), thrilled to be able to get this product without having to be a member.</li>
            <li>Feels nice and light, almost as if I don&#x27;t have any lotion on at all... if it weren&#x27;t for the amazingly soft skin I have after applying it.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it available on Amazon although the shipping cost is high.  </li>
            <li>I love this, it really helps my hands</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell and nourishes my hands and body like no other.  </li>
            <li>Its probably the cheapest most effective natural ingredient one can take internally that does more than anything else.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best lotion I have ever used!!  </li>
            <li>Leaves hands feeling soft and smooth - - better than any hand and body lotion I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty cheap...</li>
            <li>If interested I can help you get it as a member for about $15 for a 20 oz bottle!</li>
            <li>I have been using Renew for a little over a year with great results.  </li>
            <li>Great for my little one who has eczema.</li>
            <li>I had 18 months of chemo which left my skin very dry, this is the best I have found for my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and makes your skin not only feel nourished it feels protected almost like a moisture shield.</li>
            <li>but its worth it, my sister use to sell it</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>It was so worth</li>
            <li>This is the *only* lotion I found that could offer this kind of results.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, it is constantly out of stock because it is so popular.</li>
            <li>Longer lasting than some lotions and creams, although these have also been effective.</li>
            <li>However, the product is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE being a Melaleuca DIrect customer.</li>
            <li>PLUS I am not only saving on my own products</li>
            <li>The renew is nice and thick but goes on nice and is not overly greasy.</li>
            <li>I tried all different kind of cream on his neck, arm, leg.</li>
            <li>The relief it gives him is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin in the world and have struggled finding a product that would do the job.  </li>
            <li>This is good stuff - the tea tree oil in it separates from other products.</li>
            <li>She was right</li>
            <li>I am spot free, and can go out in the sun like a normal person.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff but definitely not worth $46.99.</li>
            <li>I love Renew and love that I can get it within a few days of placing an order.</li>
            <li>The price is not high me because Renew is effective, efficient and productive,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not greasy, Clean fresh scent, Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money, it may not take the eczema away completely, but this has by far showed the most improvement on her skin.</li>
            <li>It can really save the DAY!</li>
            <li>The study indicates that breast tissue of women with breast cancer were 2.6 times more likely to have increased amounts of PAHs attached to their DNA than the breast tissue of women without breast cancer.</li>
            <li>so potent I couldn&#x27;t go out in the sun for an entire summer, even with SPF 50 and a long-sleeved shirt.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;NO MORE red, flaking, bleeding skin.</li>
            <li>The funny thing is I don&#x27;t wear &amp;</li>
            <li>i love the product this is my second time ordering works</li>
            <li>I save money, gas and time by ordering online and getting my products that I absolutely LOVE two days later.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many different products</li>
            <li>Great on problem areas such as dry skin on heels.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong scent when you initially apply it which dissipates as it gets absorbed.</li>
            <li>my skin is definitely a little bit more smooth.</li>
            <li>The best lotion out there for dry skin, unfortunately you normally have to be a member or distributor to buy it, so I was thrilled to see it for sale on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was given this product from a relative and absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>This product is phenomenal, but it really saddens me that people are being ripped off when all they have to do is become a preferred customer with Melaleuca and purchase this same 20 oz bottle for $15.99.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Eczema for a long time and have never been able to find a lotion that does the job, until now.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and update my post after some time with more long term results.</li>
            <li>The price is a little higher than most lotions but we believe it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>When I found out my neice had eczema, I bought the large bottle.</li>
            <li>Both of my children  have eczema, one of them having severe eczema, and we can&#x27;t live without this!!  </li>
            <li>None of them really helped.</li>
            <li>When used before going to bed it is very calming and soothing.  </li>
            <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t helping the dryness.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Much thinner lotion.  </li>
            <li>and this really works.  </li>
            <li>I wash my face GENTLY with Trader Joes Honey Oatmeal bar soap ($1.60 for 2 bars) in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li>I gently pat Renew on my eczema, then all</li>
            <li>also carry it in my purse and gently pat it on throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I had tried everything to help my daughter&#x27;s eczema, eucerin, aquaphor, aveeno, oatmeal baths, the whole works, and nothing made her eczema go away.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and not greasy .</li>
            <li>We needed to have it before she went to camp and the product was delivered so fast.  </li>
            <li>Even cured an unusual skin ailment one winter that a doctor perscribed ointment couldn&#x27;t handle.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on every part of the body, even my face.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>fast response..</li>
            <li>The whole family loves it.</li>
            <li>Penetrates fast, long-lasting relief without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love how much this product sinks into the skin without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>The improvements I have experienced in my skin condition were immediate, constantly improving and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It worked so much better than any other skin lotion product we had used, including those recommeded by our dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>Many other lotions we purchased at a lower price are still sitting on the shelf and to me that makes Melaleuca a smarter purchase.</li>
            <li>This has been more healing than any other  lotion or cream I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great for helping keep skin smooth and comfortable in the dry, cold Wyoming winter weather.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is my favorite because it feels like it&#x27;s really moisturizing when I put it on and has cured my keratosis, but the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite - though it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it&#x27;s just I don&#x27;t like the light fragrance of baby powder - but</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants a high quality hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Renew really works, offers exceptional results especially for those with eczema and very dry skin.</li>
            <li>My 3yr old has pretty severe eczema</li>
            <li>My skin feels like new skin!</li>
            <li>The eczema in my neck has been on and off for several years and I have tried many lotions/creams and several prescription medicines.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion because it is very moisturizing but without any heavy smells</li>
            <li>but I am actually making money by sharing this fantastic direct marketing company with others.</li>
            <li>His eczema is not completely gone, but it is significantly improved.  </li>
            <li>A friend suggested Melaluca&#x27;s Renew and we bought a bottle despite the high price</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing on my excema!&lt;br /&gt;The only other cream that works this</li>
            <li>I have used many similar products over the years with much less success.  </li>
            <li>I also use the lotion in my kids hair, which is very curly and tends to get tangled, and with a little water and a little renew, it is a great detangler.  </li>
            <li>It cured my babies cradle cap in virtually 1 application, after a week it&#x27;s completely gone!!</li>
            <li>Really soft and really soothing.</li>
            <li>So more wasted money for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is NORMAL.</li>
            <li>I apply an extra application on my feet and hands in the winter time right before going to bed.</li>
            <li>WE LIVE IN ARIZONA</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always hesitant to try something new.  </li>
            <li>But the price here on amazing is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>It leaves our hands very soft and after I wash my hands I can feel the lotion still working.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 3 years old now!</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin baby butt soft!</li>
            <li>Now after using this stuff for over a year all the eczema I once had is completely gone!</li>
            <li>you have tried multiple creams and none really does completely fix the problem, give this a go!  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy like some other lotions, and it seems to absorb really quickly.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only lotion we tried that really worked and kept it away.  </li>
            <li>I was so thouroghly surprised with how well it worked that I ordered the 20oz bottle.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and hydrated, almost like it \\&quot;drank up\\&quot; the lotion and it locked into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I wonder how much it would cost if I did find it in the local drugstore.</li>
            <li>but it makes my face feel really soft and never irritated my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I have always purchased it direct from salespeople of the company.  </li>
            <li>I can give you a complete overview of the company and sign you up with a membership for just $1 till 06/17/14.</li>
            <li>However, Renew doesn&#x27;t completely heal my skin even after continuous application.</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended this cream for eczema I developed on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I can give you a complete overview of the company and sign you up with a membership.</li>
            <li>My son has eczema since 6 years old.</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old, and if I keep tRenew on</li>
            <li>It clears up my children&#x27;s skin completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft feeling.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything natural under the sun, and this keeps my skin moist.  </li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised at the results of Melaleuca Intensive Therapy on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and your skin is so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>Prior to using the lotion my son was constantly scratching, now I rarely see him itching.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than some, but totally worth it</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and find this works the better than all the other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>My first bottle of Melaleuca Lotion was given to me by my sister to help my son with his dry skin and rashes.  </li>
            <li>This is the only skin moisturizer I have ever found that is soothing, non-greasy and it also has a subtle clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Have used this for several years and would recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY remedy that has completely relieved my new bouts with eczema on my R and l hands.....</li>
            <li>For six long months, I had an ever growing rash of eczema on both the left and right sides of my body.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was given a large bottle of it and a little goes a long way, but I would like a bottle for my office.</li>
            <li>After a bath I apply just a small amount and my skin feels so smooth for hours.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just like other lotions, but I noticed that while the old red spots weren&#x27;t going away, new ones weren&#x27;t coming in.</li>
            <li>I have grown up and currently live 30 minutes from Melaleuca Corporate.</li>
            <li>Then I gently pat dry and IMMEDIATELY (before my skin dries)</li>
            <li>As someone with dry skin I really appreciate this product.</li>
            <li>I am a pediatrician and have had really dry skin my whole life.</li>
            <li>will last me at least 6months or more.</li>
            <li>This clears up and prevents skin issues like no other... can literally see and feel the difference within 24 hours of using it.  </li>
            <li>I am over 60 years old and this is the only skin lotion product that works on my skin.</li>
            <li>I only have been using this lotion for about a week and her eczema is almost completely gone</li>
            <li>This lotion instantly makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I recently bought eucerine dry skin lotion and really like it</li>
            <li>We live in Arizona where it is so dry</li>
            <li>it is a very soft lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li>I started using this product and she only has one or two very tiny patches left on her skin and her skin is SO soft!</li>
            <li>People with skin issues have two things in common: steroid creams, and a basket full of lotions that suck.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but exactly the same product without having to get membership</li>
            <li>My 7 year old son has always suffered from dry itchy skin in the winter, and we&#x27;ve been through a plethora of lotions trying to control it.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and moist in the dry climate of Colorado.  </li>
            <li>During the summer when the eczema gets too itchy in the inside of my arm and is too irritated I sometimes resort to a little bit of cortizone (much to my homeopathics dismay).  </li>

            <li> GREAT Stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great</li>
            <li> we replace the items we bought from the store with their brand and get a lot of great benefits from them unlike the store bought brands, and have no problem with 35 points in fact we are way over that every month.......</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> SO MUCH LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!!</li>
            <li> Very effective.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT&#x27;S NOT GREASEY AND ABSORBS INTO THE SKIN VERY NICELY.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!</li>
            <li> ITs why MSM and garlic is popular!</li>
            <li> Its like a miracle cure, honestly!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I have always loved it.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I purchase many of Melaleuca&#x27;s great products and get them for a great value.  </li>
            <li> AND YOU NEED A GOOD LOTION</li>
            <li> Saop is good also.</li>
            <li> This Product is really good.</li>
            <li> Oh well, to be fair</li>
            <li> This product is a good one.</li>
            <li> I am adverse to many of the products under the Melaleuca brand name because years ago it was a MLM (maybe still is), which I joined and after being buried in stuff I was required to purchase as a &amp;#34;dealer&amp;#34; LOL I bailed.</li>
            <li> It is the best lotion that I ever purchased, great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nongreasy, retain more moisture!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Yes I love this lotion!    </li>
            <li> perfect product, thanks!</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;ll have to bite the bullet and buy more once I run out!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>

            <li> This product is amazing.....</li>
            <li> It is amazing and keeps his eczema from breaking out.</li>
            <li> and it was amazing..</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and heard amazing stories about how it helped others</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like a hospital.  </li>
            <li> It has proven to be the absolute best lotion we&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> Nice, not smelly.</li>
            <li> If you try and purchase through the company they give you a sales pitch and try to get you to join and sell to others (kind of like Amway), don&#x27;t care for that.</li>
            <li> is really nice</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion and worth the price.!</li>
            <li> It has a very light, pleasant scent and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is by far the best there is on the market.</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far the best there is on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that makes my skin stay soft for hours.  </li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to rate a product but need to let people know what a great lotion this is.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be the best so far.</li>
            <li> So far, Renew is the best product for me.  </li>
            <li> Really an incredible product that I&#x27;m very thankful for.</li>
            <li> but this is by far the best immediate relief lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 2 years and works great.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, love this amazing product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very light smell</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very light.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good product and we have been using this for our Toddler Daughter since She was couple months old!</li>
            <li> so it wont magically make my hands look and feel like new, but it sure is a good start! :-)</li>
            <li> Smell could be much better.  </li>
            <li> Love to use this product on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> An added benefit is that the whole family loves to use it - it smells great and has a non-greasy texture.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the moisture cream for many years.</li>
            <li> Great product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I Love Renew Skin Lotion.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works much better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried...and we&#x27;ve tried just about everything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s no miracle worker</li>
            <li> Still, it is a good product and was worth trying since others have found relief with the product.</li>
            <li> more yucky elbows;)&lt;br /&gt;Non</li>

            <li> Not as good as what I got direct  from melaleuca,  </li>
            <li> This product is truelly amazing and as a melaleuca member you can buy it made fresh monthly and delivered right to your door for cheaper than anyone can resell it to you for.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion!I apply it right after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I had received it as a gift originally, so when I ran out I had to find it online.</li>

            <li> Feels nice and light, almost as if I don&#x27;t have any lotion on at all... if it weren&#x27;t for the amazingly soft skin I have after applying it.</li>

            <li> It has a nice clean smell and nourishes my hands and body like no other.  </li>

            <li> Leaves hands feeling soft and smooth - - better than any hand and body lotion I have ever tried.</li>

            <li> I have been using Renew for a little over a year with great results.  </li>
            <li> Great for my little one who has eczema.</li>
            <li> I had 18 months of chemo which left my skin very dry, this is the best I have found for my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and makes your skin not only feel nourished it feels protected almost like a moisture shield.</li>
            <li> but its worth it, my sister use to sell it</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> It was so worth</li>
            <li> This is the *only* lotion I found that could offer this kind of results.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, it is constantly out of stock because it is so popular.</li>
            <li> Longer lasting than some lotions and creams, although these have also been effective.</li>
            <li> However, the product is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE being a Melaleuca DIrect customer.</li>
            <li> PLUS I am not only saving on my own products</li>
            <li> The renew is nice and thick but goes on nice and is not overly greasy.</li>
            <li> I tried all different kind of cream on his neck, arm, leg.</li>
            <li> The relief it gives him is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin in the world and have struggled finding a product that would do the job.  </li>
            <li> This is good stuff - the tea tree oil in it separates from other products.</li>
            <li> She was right</li>
            <li> I am spot free, and can go out in the sun like a normal person.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff but definitely not worth $46.99.</li>
            <li> I love Renew and love that I can get it within a few days of placing an order.</li>
            <li> The price is not high me because Renew is effective, efficient and productive,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not greasy, Clean fresh scent, Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money, it may not take the eczema away completely, but this has by far showed the most improvement on her skin.</li>
            <li> It can really save the DAY!</li>
            <li> The study indicates that breast tissue of women with breast cancer were 2.6 times more likely to have increased amounts of PAHs attached to their DNA than the breast tissue of women without breast cancer.</li>
            <li> so potent I couldn&#x27;t go out in the sun for an entire summer, even with SPF 50 and a long-sleeved shirt.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NO MORE red, flaking, bleeding skin.</li>
            <li> The funny thing is I don&#x27;t wear &amp;</li>
            <li> i love the product this is my second time ordering works</li>
            <li> I save money, gas and time by ordering online and getting my products that I absolutely LOVE two days later.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many different products</li>
            <li> Great on problem areas such as dry skin on heels.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong scent when you initially apply it which dissipates as it gets absorbed.</li>
            <li> my skin is definitely a little bit more smooth.</li>
            <li> The best lotion out there for dry skin, unfortunately you normally have to be a member or distributor to buy it, so I was thrilled to see it for sale on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was given this product from a relative and absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal, but it really saddens me that people are being ripped off when all they have to do is become a preferred customer with Melaleuca and purchase this same 20 oz bottle for $15.99.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Eczema for a long time and have never been able to find a lotion that does the job, until now.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and update my post after some time with more long term results.</li>
            <li> The price is a little higher than most lotions but we believe it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> When I found out my neice had eczema, I bought the large bottle.</li>
            <li> Both of my children  have eczema, one of them having severe eczema, and we can&#x27;t live without this!!  </li>
            <li> None of them really helped.</li>
            <li> When used before going to bed it is very calming and soothing.  </li>
            <li> but it really wasn&#x27;t helping the dryness.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Much thinner lotion.  </li>
            <li> and this really works.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face GENTLY with Trader Joes Honey Oatmeal bar soap ($1.60 for 2 bars) in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li> I gently pat Renew on my eczema, then all</li>
            <li> also carry it in my purse and gently pat it on throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had tried everything to help my daughter&#x27;s eczema, eucerin, aquaphor, aveeno, oatmeal baths, the whole works, and nothing made her eczema go away.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and not greasy .</li>
            <li> We needed to have it before she went to camp and the product was delivered so fast.  </li>
            <li> Even cured an unusual skin ailment one winter that a doctor perscribed ointment couldn&#x27;t handle.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on every part of the body, even my face.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> fast response..</li>
            <li> The whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> Penetrates fast, long-lasting relief without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love how much this product sinks into the skin without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> The improvements I have experienced in my skin condition were immediate, constantly improving and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It worked so much better than any other skin lotion product we had used, including those recommeded by our dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> Many other lotions we purchased at a lower price are still sitting on the shelf and to me that makes Melaleuca a smarter purchase.</li>
            <li> This has been more healing than any other  lotion or cream I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great for helping keep skin smooth and comfortable in the dry, cold Wyoming winter weather.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is my favorite because it feels like it&#x27;s really moisturizing when I put it on and has cured my keratosis, but the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite - though it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it&#x27;s just I don&#x27;t like the light fragrance of baby powder - but</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants a high quality hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Renew really works, offers exceptional results especially for those with eczema and very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My 3yr old has pretty severe eczema</li>
            <li> My skin feels like new skin!</li>
            <li> The eczema in my neck has been on and off for several years and I have tried many lotions/creams and several prescription medicines.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it is very moisturizing but without any heavy smells</li>
            <li> but I am actually making money by sharing this fantastic direct marketing company with others.</li>
            <li> His eczema is not completely gone, but it is significantly improved.  </li>
            <li> A friend suggested Melaluca&#x27;s Renew and we bought a bottle despite the high price</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing on my excema!&lt;br /&gt;The only other cream that works this</li>
            <li> I have used many similar products over the years with much less success.  </li>
            <li> I also use the lotion in my kids hair, which is very curly and tends to get tangled, and with a little water and a little renew, it is a great detangler.  </li>
            <li> It cured my babies cradle cap in virtually 1 application, after a week it&#x27;s completely gone!!</li>
            <li> Really soft and really soothing.</li>
            <li> So more wasted money for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is NORMAL.</li>
            <li> I apply an extra application on my feet and hands in the winter time right before going to bed.</li>
            <li> WE LIVE IN ARIZONA</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always hesitant to try something new.  </li>
            <li> But the price here on amazing is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> It leaves our hands very soft and after I wash my hands I can feel the lotion still working.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 3 years old now!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin baby butt soft!</li>
            <li> Now after using this stuff for over a year all the eczema I once had is completely gone!</li>
            <li> you have tried multiple creams and none really does completely fix the problem, give this a go!  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy like some other lotions, and it seems to absorb really quickly.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only lotion we tried that really worked and kept it away.  </li>
            <li> I was so thouroghly surprised with how well it worked that I ordered the 20oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and hydrated, almost like it \\&quot;drank up\\&quot; the lotion and it locked into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I wonder how much it would cost if I did find it in the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> but it makes my face feel really soft and never irritated my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I have always purchased it direct from salespeople of the company.  </li>
            <li> I can give you a complete overview of the company and sign you up with a membership for just $1 till 06/17/14.</li>
            <li> However, Renew doesn&#x27;t completely heal my skin even after continuous application.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this cream for eczema I developed on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I can give you a complete overview of the company and sign you up with a membership.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema since 6 years old.</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old, and if I keep tRenew on</li>
            <li> It clears up my children&#x27;s skin completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft feeling.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything natural under the sun, and this keeps my skin moist.  </li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised at the results of Melaleuca Intensive Therapy on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and your skin is so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using the lotion my son was constantly scratching, now I rarely see him itching.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive than some, but totally worth it</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and find this works the better than all the other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> My first bottle of Melaleuca Lotion was given to me by my sister to help my son with his dry skin and rashes.  </li>
            <li> This is the only skin moisturizer I have ever found that is soothing, non-greasy and it also has a subtle clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years and would recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY remedy that has completely relieved my new bouts with eczema on my R and l hands.....</li>
            <li> For six long months, I had an ever growing rash of eczema on both the left and right sides of my body.</li>
            <li> Luckily I was given a large bottle of it and a little goes a long way, but I would like a bottle for my office.</li>
            <li> After a bath I apply just a small amount and my skin feels so smooth for hours.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just like other lotions, but I noticed that while the old red spots weren&#x27;t going away, new ones weren&#x27;t coming in.</li>
            <li> I have grown up and currently live 30 minutes from Melaleuca Corporate.</li>
            <li> Then I gently pat dry and IMMEDIATELY (before my skin dries)</li>
            <li> As someone with dry skin I really appreciate this product.</li>
            <li> I am a pediatrician and have had really dry skin my whole life.</li>
            <li> will last me at least 6months or more.</li>
            <li> This clears up and prevents skin issues like no other... can literally see and feel the difference within 24 hours of using it.  </li>
            <li> I am over 60 years old and this is the only skin lotion product that works on my skin.</li>
            <li> I only have been using this lotion for about a week and her eczema is almost completely gone</li>
            <li> This lotion instantly makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recently bought eucerine dry skin lotion and really like it</li>
            <li> We live in Arizona where it is so dry</li>
            <li> it is a very soft lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li> I started using this product and she only has one or two very tiny patches left on her skin and her skin is SO soft!</li>
            <li> People with skin issues have two things in common: steroid creams, and a basket full of lotions that suck.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but exactly the same product without having to get membership</li>
            <li> My 7 year old son has always suffered from dry itchy skin in the winter, and we&#x27;ve been through a plethora of lotions trying to control it.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and moist in the dry climate of Colorado.  </li>
            <li> During the summer when the eczema gets too itchy in the inside of my arm and is too irritated I sometimes resort to a little bit of cortizone (much to my homeopathics dismay).  </li>
            <li> As far as healing eczema it seems comparable to other eczema lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> , I know this is expensive but it&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle of this at a charity auction just because I really needed some moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love having this larger bottle of Renew on my kitchen sink as I constantly have my hands in and out of water with washing pots and pans or cleaning after cutting poultry, breaking eggs, etc.  </li>
            <li> I spent two years dealing with skin issues diagnosed as ten different things, before I finally discovered a gluten allergy</li>
            <li> If this turns out to me my true cure, I will stand behind it 100% and join the club.</li>
            <li> Apply this stuff to your dry areas within 5 minutes of showering and the moisture will be locked in for the entire day.</li>
            <li> Does not make my hands feel like they are burning when dry from multiple hand-washings.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that works on my skin in the dry rocky mountain winter environment</li>
            <li> I tried it on my feet and heels and although I have tried every foot cream on this earth, this was the only one that almost immediately softened my dry heels.</li>
            <li> It seems like immediately my condition (dry-extremely dry cracked) skin is eliminated and it may be several months before I need apply it again.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE NOT DRY OR ROUGH.</li>
            <li> I have read a lot of negative reviews about the company because they require around a $50 a month order, but personally I have NO PROBLEM at all spending at least that much, sometimes MUCH more just replacing nasty retail products with the pure and environmentally friendly Melaleuca brand.</li>
            <li> The only dry skin therapy you&#x27;ll ever need!</li>
            <li> He works in a freezer warehouse and I have dry feet, we both use this daily and have found that it clears up dry skin in about a week.</li>
            <li> I generally do not use lotions but every once in a while my hands will get dry</li>
            <li> body daily, my skin is moist and much less dry and wrinkled, especially around my upper arms.  </li>
            <li> really well.one complaint</li>
            <li> but they only work minimally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a life long eczema sufferer, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy but keeps skin feeling hydrated for a long time.</li>
            <li> My son has had eczema since he was a few months old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but if it takes away my daughter&#x27;s pain and itching from the eczema, it&#x27;s worth every penny to me!</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders on a variety of skin problems ranging from simple dryness to other irritations like eczema, for example.</li>
            <li> The lotion is expensive, but it has significantly reduced my son&#x27;s itchiness.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I have various dermatitis issues, eczema, and other skin allergies.  </li>
            <li> I have always had severe dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My hands get really dry and cracked in the winter</li>
            <li> TO PREVENT DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It works on dry skin and even helps my eczema.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin or have dry patches, this lotion will work for you.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to ANYONE with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> It does work wonders for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and my skin is always scaly looking dry patches so after exfoliating I moisturize both day and night with this</li>
            <li> If your skin is dry and you have not taken care of it, you might neet to use it</li>
            <li> It has helped my husbands dry hands too.</li>
            <li> but I use it in the winter when it gets so dry out.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry skin ..</li>

            <li> I used this on a facial rash of my sons, that not even hydrocortisone was helping, this got rid of it in less than a day.</li>
            <li> Two months later, the spots were healed, and the dryness of my elbows, heels, and knees was significantly less.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my son who has very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion helps my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My husband has neurapathy in his legs, and they tend to get very dry and scaley.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY dry.</li>
            <li> The only issue i had is that the deliery time took a little longer than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth the $$.    </li>
            <li> One of the few products that I have found that actually works on rosecea.</li>
            <li> The weather in AZ is rough on anyone</li>
            <li> Boy is it expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for a cream but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Weeks of laborious applications of steroid creams covered in wet dressings morning and night did almost nothing to phase it.</li>
            <li> Being that it&#x27;s harder to join Melaleuca the club</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders for my very dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on different products over the past 2 years and never had these results.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other lotions.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried at least a dozen different lotions over the years in various price ranges--aveeno, burt&#x27;s bees, dove, vaseline to name a few.</li>
            <li> Our son has eczema and we have used this for over 8 years along with all the other items they manufacture....</li>
            <li> The larger 20 oz also has an fragrance that the small tube did not.</li>
            <li> the money seeming how you dont need much, a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> AS WELL AND USE IT EVERYDAY TO AVOID DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> I tried an elimination diet hoping to peg down gluten, wheat or other GMO foods, dairy, or some other allergen that would have been the cause of this autoimmune response.</li>
            <li> not right that I had to pay 3xs the price because I wouldn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t join Melaleuca&#x27;s shopping club.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of using Renew his eczema decreased by half and now is gone completely!</li>
            <li> I was recommended this lotion from a friend to use on my 2 year old daughter who has eczema on her creases (anticubital and behind the knee).</li>
            <li> The feel of this lotion is not matched by any other!</li>
            <li> With all my itching due to eczema, my skin tone has become uneven.  </li>
            <li> Previously reviewed.  </li>
            <li> So then I start rolling in the typical brands looking for immediate healing and relief.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the price isn&#x27;t as painful as it first seems.  </li>
            <li> All my friends use this product so there is little opportunity to recommend it to someone.</li>
            <li> A little heavy for summer weather</li>
            <li> If you want this at a cheaper price, or any melaleuca product you may be looking for online, may I suggest you take a few minutes and email me and find out how you can save.</li>

            <li> I do use this everyday</li>
            <li> It is one of the few bottles of lotion that we have squeezed every drop out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I used it everyday.  </li>
            <li> That it has any added fragrance is unfortunate and something that never occurred to me as the case for lotion designed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> IT CAN STILL STING SEVERELY for a few minutes...</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feel</li>
            <li> i use everyday like shampoo and laundry soap.</li>
            <li> With just a few drops of Renew (the size of a penny)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema on my hands my whole life, it&#x27;s so bad that my hands are scarred by it</li>
            <li> Had been provided with a small size by a friend and found that it worked faster than a prescribed ointment in reducing dryness.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND USES JUST A SMALL AMOUNT FOR HIS HANDS, FEET, LEGS AND ARMS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my face a lot too, not sure if I&#x27;m supposed to</li>
            <li> I have received this product in the past as a gift.  </li>
            <li> But terrible price, I can help u buy this for a fraction of this price as an authentic member.</li>
            <li> I bought some small tubes to keep in my purse and for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Pricey, but used in small amounts.</li>
            <li> Without getting too deep into it, a few years ago my eczema really took a turn for the worst.</li>
            <li> In my office, between patients, I wash my hands with the Renew skin cleanser, then I rub a small squirt of Renew lotion on my hands.</li>
            <li> Gradually using it everyday I noticed over courses of months my eczema slowly went away.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they do it</li>
            <li> Heals small cuts on fingers.</li>
            <li> I found a small sample of Renew in my make up bag....</li>
            <li> I keep small tubes in glove box and backpacks.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son who was on Accutane (a very heavy duty acne drug that dries out the skin).</li>
            <li> The only bad thing that I can think of is that it is only a Maleluca product and therefore is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t afford to be a preferred member and have to order at least $60 of product each month.   </li>
            <li> I have been recommending this a lot lately.  </li>
            <li> Oh and the pump sucks, it doesn&#x27;t pump anything out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m REALLY picky about lotions, I HATE</li>
            <li> this much less expensive bottle.  </li>
            <li> this lotion is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it&#x27;s excessively difficult to purchase, as the company itself demands a membership prior to purchase, which just seems like bad business.</li>
            <li> No more cracked fingers, all it takes is one application and they are healed!!</li>
            <li> I saw a doctor who referred me to a dermatologist who referred me to some crap that I had to mis and apply multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> Although a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately For me It didn&#x27;t work that doesn&#x27;t Mean it won&#x27;t work for you!!</li>
            <li> I bought some for my brother who was buying expensive creams for his psoriasis and he no longer needs the expensive medicine cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the lotion was so expensive until I searched for it</li>
            <li> Rashy,bumpy, uncomfortable skin has been banished from my house.  </li>
            <li> After observing my sad state of affairs, a friend in Alaska sent me a sample size of Renew.</li>
            <li> it is too expensive plus the shipping</li>
            <li> but it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive prescription creams and medications and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, both of my kids got it, too.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Much to expensive.</li>
            <li> I tend to dry out terribly in the winter and my fingertips crack and bleed.  </li>
            <li> but the price on amazon is crazy.</li>
            <li> This has a fragrance that in my opinion is unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> Its very expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has DANGEROUS INGREDIENTS!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is a perfect for my hands and feet, I don&#x27;t have allergy. I use only Renew around 2 years, what was recommended  by my doctor ( alternative medicine). The price is not high me because Renew is effective, efficient and productive,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for people which have skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Ala</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing.  I have always had severe dry skin.  This seals and repairs it.  Great for heels and hands.  Especially in the winter.  Smell could be much better.  Kind of smells like a hospital.  Non greasy.</li>
            <li> this lotion is a little expensive. but its worth it, my sister use to sell it, she has moved out of town so I no longer buy from her.  it stays on all day, best lotion ever</li>
            <li> The only dry skin therapy you&#x27;ll ever need! Nongreasy, retain more moisture! I love it! Delivers long-lasting relief from dry, rough or irritate skin.</li>
            <li> We are using this for psoriosis and it helps relieve itchiness. it is a very soft lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li> Had been provided with a small size by a friend and found that it worked faster than a prescribed ointment in reducing dryness.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it never leaves my skin feeling weird, waxy, or fragrancy.    My son had eczema as a baby and this is the only lotion we tried that really worked and kept it away.  I won&#x27;t use any other lotions.  I don&#x27;t have an account with melaleuca because I just don&#x27;t send $60 every month on cleaning items.  I use this lotion every day and a 20oz will last me at least 6months or more.</li>
            <li> Melaleuca renew intensive skin therapy lotion is the best cream for your skin. After a bath I apply just a small amount and my skin feels so smooth for hours. Love to use this product on my legs.  It&#x27;s expensive but worth the $$.    Try it, you will buy it again and again. So happy I can purchase this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old son has always suffered from dry itchy skin in the winter, and we&#x27;ve been through a plethora of lotions trying to control it.  A friend suggested Melaluca&#x27;s Renew and we bought a bottle despite the high price (we purchased it through a local reseller).  It has proven to be the absolute best lotion we&#x27;ve found and we&#x27;ve continued to use it for the last several years.  It has a very light, pleasant scent and goes on easily.  It is not greasy like some other lotions, and it seems to absorb really quickly.  Regular use of Renew has totally conquered our son&#x27;s winter skin issues where others only offered temporary &amp; incomplete relief.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far the best there is on the market. You can&#x27;t find this or any of Melaleuca&#x27;s finest products in any of your grocery stores. If you want this at a cheaper price, or any melaleuca product you may be looking for online, may I suggest you take a few minutes and email me and find out how you can save. Treeofourlives@gmail.com</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Not greasy and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Eczema for a long time and have never been able to find a lotion that does the job, until now. Apply this stuff to your dry areas within 5 minutes of showering and the moisture will be locked in for the entire day. Just a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I am over 60 years old and this is the only skin lotion product that works on my skin. I have had quite a bit of sun damage when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! I had 18 months of chemo which left my skin very dry, this is the best I have found for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Renew for a little over a year with great results.  I have used many similar products over the years with much less success.  The improvements I have experienced in my skin condition were immediate, constantly improving and long lasting. I will be a Renew user for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing... it beats anything on the market for dry skin! Also cure psoriasis on your skin. I bought some for my brother who was buying expensive creams for his psoriasis and he no longer needs the expensive medicine cream. He is hooked and so am I!</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far the best there is on the market. You can&#x27;t find this or any of Melaleuca&#x27;s finest products in any of your grocery stores.

            <li> I bought a small bottle of this at a charity auction just because I really needed some moisturizer. I was so thouroghly surprised with how well it worked that I ordered the 20oz bottle. My hands get really dry and cracked in the winter and I have tried at least a dozen different lotions over the years in various price ranges--aveeno, burt&#x27;s bees, dove, vaseline to name a few. None of them really helped. This winter, with a couple applications of Renew Intensive Skin Therapy Lotion a day, my hands have stayed moisturized and uncracked. If you want lotion that works, but this product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that makes my skin stay soft for hours.  It actually heals instead of just a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that I have found that actually works on rosecea. Pleasnt fragrence. A bottle will last for months. Well worth the price</li>
            <li> Very happy! Best moisturizer out there!</li>
            <li> RENEW IS THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET FOR DRY AND CHAPPED HANDS, FEET, LEGS, ARMS ETC. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. MY HUSBAND IS A DIABETIC AND THIS ONLY SKIN LOTION THAT WORKS FOR MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF. MY HUSBAND&#x27;S FOOT DOCTOR IS AMAZED AT THE CONDITION OF MY HUSBANDS FEET. THEY ARE NOT DRY OR ROUGH. HIS FEET ARE IN WONDERFUL CONDITION. MY HUSBAND USES JUST A SMALL AMOUNT FOR HIS HANDS, FEET, LEGS AND ARMS. RENEW IS FANTASTIC. I LOVE IT AS WELL AND USE IT EVERYDAY TO AVOID DRY SKIN. WE LIVE IN ARIZONA AND YOU NEED A GOOD LOTION TO PREVENT DRY SKIN AND THIS IS THE ONLY LOTION WE USE. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE INCLUDING CHILDREN.</li>
            <li> Yes I love this lotion!    I just can&#x27;t afford to be a preferred member and have to order at least $60 of product each month.   I do use this everyday and I&#x27;m running low.   I would recommend it for every skin type.</li>
            <li> My first bottle of Melaleuca Lotion was given to me by my sister to help my son with his dry skin and rashes.  It worked so much better than any other skin lotion product we had used, including those recommeded by our dermatologist.  An added benefit is that the whole family loves to use it - it smells great and has a non-greasy texture.  When used before going to bed it is very calming and soothing.  The price is a little higher than most lotions but we believe it is worth it.  It is one of the few bottles of lotion that we have squeezed every drop out of the bottle.  Many other lotions we purchased at a lower price are still sitting on the shelf and to me that makes Melaleuca a smarter purchase.</li>
            <li> perfect product, thanks!</li>
            <li> I have grown up and currently live 30 minutes from Melaleuca Corporate. I love, love, love, love this amazing product. I am a member. Members can only refer members. It&#x27;s sort of like Sams Club or Costco. If interested I can help you get it as a member for about $15 for a 20 oz bottle!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the moisture cream for many years. It&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve found for combating dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin so I&#x27;m always hesitant to try something new.  I was using Eucerin but it really wasn&#x27;t helping the dryness.  It just felt like a film of moisture on the surface of my skin.  I also suffer from eczema.  I received the Renew lotion last night and put it on around 9pm immediately after showering.  Applied again around 6 this morning.  It&#x27;s 9am and my skin is no longer itchy and scaly.  With all my itching due to eczema, my skin tone has become uneven.  I&#x27;m hoping that the Renew lotion will also help even out my skin tone by alleviating the itchiness.  My skin feels soft and hydrated, almost like it \\&quot;drank up\\&quot; the lotion and it locked into my skin.  Great product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to rate a product but need to let people know what a great lotion this is.  It has kept my eczema at bay and I have not used the prescription ointment since starting Renew!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have very dry skin and find this works the better than all the other products I have tried.  It moisturizers but does not leave any film or residue on my skin. I keep the travel size containers in my purse, desk, and car.</li>
            <li> I Love Renew Skin Lotion.  My daughter-in-law gave me a bottle of lotion as a gift and I used it everyday.  When I ran out I couldn&#x27;t find it in any local drugstore so I ordered it on-line.  Fast delivery.  I didn&#x27;t realize the lotion was so expensive until I searched for it on-line. I wonder how much it would cost if I did find it in the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Although it arrived frozen solid (unavoidable in our climate), thrilled to be able to get this product without having to be a member.</li>
            <li> I should have read the ingredients listed in the second Q/A.  This has a fragrance that in my opinion is unpleasant.  That it has any added fragrance is unfortunate and something that never occurred to me as the case for lotion designed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Rashy,bumpy, uncomfortable skin has been banished from my house.  This stuff works much better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried...and we&#x27;ve tried just about everything.  A little goes a long way, so the price isn&#x27;t as painful as it first seems.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found something that completely heals my kids&#x27; eczema.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best lotions on the market. It penetrates your skin and keeps it supple all day. I would recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product from Amazon, I received it as a gift. I&#x27;m REALLY picky about lotions, I HATE HATE HATE lotions that leave a greasy feeling or smells (I prefer unscented lotions). I&#x27;ve had eczema on my hands my whole life, it&#x27;s so bad that my hands are scarred by it and kids call me monster hands, so I&#x27;ve been through a LOT of different types of lotions! This seems to be the best so far. Feels nice and light, almost as if I don&#x27;t have any lotion on at all... if it weren&#x27;t for the amazingly soft skin I have after applying it. It even seems to help diminish the appearance of my scars on my hands. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s no miracle worker so it wont magically make my hands look and feel like new, but it sure is a good start! :-) I&#x27;ve used it on my face a lot too, not sure if I&#x27;m supposed to but it makes my face feel really soft and never irritated my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey. Like I said, this was a gift and I&#x27;m pretty cheap... but I think I&#x27;ll have to bite the bullet and buy more once I run out! Luckily I was given a large bottle of it and a little goes a long way, but I would like a bottle for my office.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this lotion from a friend to use on my 2 year old daughter who has eczema on her creases (anticubital and behind the knee). I tried steroid creams and Eucerin cream on her but they only work minimally. I used Renew on her and noticed her skin got smoother within hours. Totally worth the money, it may not take the eczema away completely, but this has by far showed the most improvement on her skin.</li>
            <li> I love Renew and love that I can get it within a few days of placing an order. For me, it is the best lotion. When I found out my neice had eczema, I bought the large bottle. Renew is not a cure for eczema and I found this out with my neice. Still, it is a good product and was worth trying since others have found relief with the product.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Entire family uses this and works on all skin types. My daughter has eczema and this helps.&lt;br /&gt;No more yucky elbows;)&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy and applies smoothly. Doesn&#x27;t feel waxy.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST skin lotion that I have ever used. It works on dry skin and even helps my eczema. My skin feels like velvet after I use it. Even my picky husband likes it!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I think it&#x27;s the best out there.  If you have really dry skin or have dry patches, this lotion will work for you.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased it direct from salespeople of the company.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Both this much less expensive bottle.  Much thinner lotion.  Had to have been watered down.&lt;br /&gt;Not the same at all!</li>
            <li> My husband and I enjoy using this skin therapy.  It leaves our hands very soft and after I wash my hands I can feel the lotion still working.  We have not found a lotion to work as well.  We will buy more when we need it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t relieve severe ITCHING but it does relieve PRICKLINESS from severe dry skin /eczema, etc! It can really save the DAY! BUT WARNING! IT CAN STILL STING SEVERELY for a few minutes...&lt;br /&gt;It has DANGEROUS INGREDIENTS! Isn&#x27;t there something else out there that can do the same w/out the harmful ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is from LIVESTRONG side effects of Petrolatum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum Found In Breast Tumors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A study linking the petrolatum impurity polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs to breast cancer was completed at Columbia University. The study indicates that breast tissue of women with breast cancer were 2.6 times more likely to have increased amounts of PAHs attached to their DNA than the breast tissue of women without breast cancer. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are found in oil, coal and tar deposits as byproducts of fuel burning. Researchers June K.Dunnick, Michael R.Elwell, James Huff and J.Carl Barrett of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC also found that PAHs were found in the mutated genes of test animals with mammary gland cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh there&#x27;s UNPETROLEUM JELLY ! AMazon carries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:...I&#x27;ve discovered how to get to the root of eczema caused from Candida! I&#x27;m all well now, even the insomnia. Its probably the cheapest most effective natural ingredient one can take internally that does more than anything else. ITs why MSM and garlic is popular! And its a precursor to making GLUTATHIONE! The most powerful antioxidant! Email me on my website for more info...</li>
            <li> My 3yr old has pretty severe eczema and I have tried almost every lotion and steroid cream. I only have been using this lotion for about a week and her eczema is almost completely gone and she no longer complains about the itching. It was so worth the money seeming how you dont need much, a little bit goes a very long way. I would recommend this to ANYONE with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> I have been recommending this a lot lately.  This lotion is amazing.  I used this on a facial rash of my sons, that not even hydrocortisone was helping, this got rid of it in less than a day.</li>
            <li> People with skin issues have two things in common: steroid creams, and a basket full of lotions that suck. I spent two years dealing with skin issues diagnosed as ten different things, before I finally discovered a gluten allergy was the root. I used a steroid cream so potent I couldn&#x27;t go out in the sun for an entire summer, even with SPF 50 and a long-sleeved shirt. After observing my sad state of affairs, a friend in Alaska sent me a sample size of Renew. At first I thought it was just like other lotions, but I noticed that while the old red spots weren&#x27;t going away, new ones weren&#x27;t coming in. This was improvement, so I bought a full-sized bottle. Two months later, the spots were healed, and the dryness of my elbows, heels, and knees was significantly less. One year later, my skin looks great. I am spot free, and can go out in the sun like a normal person. The last tube of steroid cream I purchased has lasted 9 months. This is the *only* lotion I found that could offer this kind of results. My one complaint is that it&#x27;s excessively difficult to purchase, as the company itself demands a membership prior to purchase, which just seems like bad business. I&#x27;m grateful to members who share the product on Amazon, as I&#x27;ll never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> our granddaughter was suffering with a rash.  it totally disappeared shortly after starting to use REnew.  it will be a staple in our household forever.</li>
            <li> I love this, it really helps my hands</li>
            <li> Got this for my son who was on Accutane (a very heavy duty acne drug that dries out the skin). It works, but it&#x27;s very expensive. I decided it was part of the treatment, so it was part of the cost.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff - the tea tree oil in it separates from other products. Tea tree oil helps with the incessant itching I get from eczema. I was much more comfortable after one use.  Give it a try, it is constantly out of stock because it is so popular.</li>
            <li> love this !!!! best lotion ever!</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years and would recommend it highly.  Longer lasting than some lotions and creams, although these have also been effective.</li>
            <li> This product is beyond amazing and as a Melaleuca member you can buy it with a 30-40% discount, delivered fast right to your door, and earn $100 in free products!!.&lt;br /&gt; I can give you a complete overview of the company and sign you up with a membership for just $1 till 06/17/14. myriamprobb@hotmail.com</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.....I have found nothing that works better&lt;br /&gt;Just not right that I had to pay 3xs the price because I wouldn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t join Melaleuca&#x27;s shopping club.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my son who has very dry skin. He uses it for his face after his acne treatment.  This lotion is the only one he likes, so I buy it for him.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion!I apply it right after getting out of the shower.My skin feels so smooth and soft.I apply an extra application on my feet and hands in the winter time right before going to bed.It does work wonders for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for my body!</li>
            <li> I was given this product from my mother because so many had raved about it.. Unfortunately For me It didn&#x27;t work that doesn&#x27;t Mean it won&#x27;t work for you!! But Being someone that has Eczema from Head to toe and many allergies it didn&#x27;t work for me!!</li>
            <li> Previously reviewed.  Great product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion helps my very dry skin.  It moisturizes, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells pleasant.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the product and shipping time.</li>
            <li> Great for my little one who has eczema. Been using it since she was an infant. She&#x27;s 3 years old now!</li>
            <li> The eczema in my neck has been on and off for several years and I have tried many lotions/creams and several prescription medicines.  So far, Renew is the best product for me.  I felt the soothing effect almost immediately after I applied it on my eczema and my skin looked significantly better within a couple of days.  However, Renew doesn&#x27;t completely heal my skin even after continuous application.</li>
            <li> This lotion instantly makes your skin feel soft. Great on problem areas such as dry skin on heels. The fragrance is nice and clean, not over powering. It is the best lotion that I ever purchased, great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so wonderful! I had received it as a gift originally, so when I ran out I had to find it online. Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have ever used.  We live in Arizona where it is so dry and this really works.  Saop is good also.</li>
            <li> Does not make my hands feel like they are burning when dry from multiple hand-washings. I can even feel the barrier when I wash my hands!</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC STUFF, THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED</li>
            <li> This helps up skin issues for me that even the steroid creams don&#x27;t.  I won&#x27;t be without it in the future.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. And she loves it. She had rough hands from cleaning houses and this lotion makes her hands soft again.</li>
            <li> Nice, not smelly. Still using it.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!  Literally, CURED.  I wash my face GENTLY with Trader Joes Honey Oatmeal bar soap ($1.60 for 2 bars) in the morning and at night.  Then I gently pat dry and IMMEDIATELY (before my skin dries) I gently pat Renew on my eczema, then all around.&lt;br /&gt;I also carry it in my purse and gently pat it on throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE red, flaking, bleeding skin.</li>
            <li> GREAT Stuff. Our family loves this lotion. We have been using it for several years, and out performs ANYTHING you can buy on the drug store shelve...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a life long eczema sufferer, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and I&#x27;ve noticed the redness already gone.  I&#x27;ll continue using this.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and we have been using this for our Toddler Daughter since She was couple months old! It works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great</li>
            <li> As someone with dry skin I really appreciate this product. It isn&#x27;t greasy but keeps skin feeling hydrated for a long time. It does seem overpriced.</li>
            <li> This Product is really good. i use it for my infant child who has excema skin problems. I see a lot of skin improvement. The only issue i had is that the deliery time took a little longer than expected.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this cream for eczema I developed on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;It apply twice a day and it has helped me so much!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is truelly amazing and as a melaleuca member you can buy it made fresh monthly and delivered right to your door for cheaper than anyone can resell it to you for. kate.melaleuca @gmail.com I can give you a complete overview of the company and sign you up with a membership.</li>
            <li> it is a wonderful item</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and makes your skin not only feel nourished it feels protected almost like a moisture shield. The weather in AZ is rough on anyone but this product does the trick</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have found.  No more cracked fingers, all it takes is one application and they are healed!!</li>
            <li> I swear by this lotion. I only use it on my face.  Its not greasy and moisturizes perfectly. I suffer from eczema and my skin is always scaly looking dry patches so after exfoliating I moisturize both day and night with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes such a transformation with my skin my boyfriend asked why are you putting on makeup to go to sleep. The funny thing is I don&#x27;t wear &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34; I only use eye shadow, lip stick, and mascara.</li>
            <li> This cream is just wonderful if you suffer from dry scaley skin.  My husband has neurapathy in his legs, and they tend to get very dry and scaley. This is the best product we have found for his problem.</li>
            <li> I have received this product in the past as a gift.  I was pleased to find it available on Amazon although the shipping cost is high.  However, the product is well worth the price.  It has a nice clean smell and nourishes my hands and body like no other.  All my friends use this product so there is little opportunity to recommend it to someone.</li>
            <li> great for exezema!  it is the only thing that works for my daughters skin!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product lasts for many hand washes. But terrible price, I can help u buy this for a fraction of this price as an authentic member. Elizabethmom2@live.com</li>
            <li> need to order another</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It was given to me as a gift from my sister-in-law who swore by it with my nephew&#x27;s ezcema problems. I had tried everything to help my daughter&#x27;s eczema, eucerin, aquaphor, aveeno, oatmeal baths, the whole works, and nothing made her eczema go away. This lotion makes her eczema dissapear within 30 minutes of application. I swear by it now. It&#x27;s expensive, but if it takes away my daughter&#x27;s pain and itching from the eczema, it&#x27;s worth every penny to me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had keratosis on the backs of my arms and thighs for decades. I&#x27;ve used almost every single lotion over the counter, and since using this product it&#x27;s made my keratosis disappear. I saw the effects within a week of using this product.  This is the only reason I&#x27;m a member of Melaleuca. This lotion is my favorite because it feels like it&#x27;s really moisturizing when I put it on and has cured my keratosis, but the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite - though it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it&#x27;s just I don&#x27;t like the light fragrance of baby powder - but it&#x27;s a very light smell so it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> My kids react to all creams except this one. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I knew you were the organic Renew lotion. But was not. Although a little disappointed. Moisture is very good... ^^</li>
            <li> I have been using renew for over 10 years. When I went to Jamaica 8 years ago and got 2nd degree burns on my shoulders that actually produced big pockets of pus, I used the Renew and within days my burns were healed and the pain was gone. I love this lotion because it is very moisturizing but without any heavy smells and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feel, it&#x27;s very light.  I also use the lotion in my kids hair, which is very curly and tends to get tangled, and with a little water and a little renew, it is a great detangler.  I don&#x27;t know how or why this seller is selling on amazon as that is against Melaleuca policy, but if you are a Melaleuca member you can get two of the 20 oz for $28 so this is actually a ripoff.</li>
            <li> I like that it has tea tree in it to help with healing.</li>
            <li> i love the product this is my second time ordering works really well.one complaint it is too expensive plus the shipping</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this lotion. It is very hydrating and not greasy . The best thing is you don&#x27;t have to go to one if those home parties to buy it. I am on my third bottle</li>
            <li> I use the renew lotion for my daughter who has eczema. We needed to have it before she went to camp and the product was delivered so fast.  Thank you so much for your great customer service.</li>
            <li> ..but I can&#x27;t get over the price! I paid around $18 this month for TWO bottles of this lotion! I LOVE being a Melaleuca DIrect customer. I save money, gas and time by ordering online and getting my products that I absolutely LOVE two days later. I have read a lot of negative reviews about the company because they require around a $50 a month order, but personally I have NO PROBLEM at all spending at least that much, sometimes MUCH more just replacing nasty retail products with the pure and environmentally friendly Melaleuca brand. PLUS I am not only saving on my own products but I am actually making money by sharing this fantastic direct marketing company with others. It&#x27;s a win/win for me. pplanko@gmail.com</li>
            <li> Our son has eczema and we have used this for over 8 years along with all the other items they manufacture....we replace the items we bought from the store with their brand and get a lot of great benefits from them unlike the store bought brands, and have no problem with 35 points in fact we are way over that every month.......</li>
            <li> I love the renew but it is so expensive. The melaleuca web sit will not let you buy unless you are a member. To be a member you have to be recommended by another melaleuca member. I do not know any. I recently bought eucerine dry skin lotion and really like it so I guess I will continue to use the eucerine. I would buy the renew again if it would drop in price or if I find a member to recommend me. The renew is nice and thick but goes on nice and is not overly greasy. Leaves my skin baby butt soft! Who wouldn&#x27;t want that!</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that works on my skin in the dry rocky mountain winter environment</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product every day and I do not see any difference after a month.  So more wasted money for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  Oh well, to be fair it might work better on someone else&#x27;s DNA.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema since 6 years old. I tried all different kind of cream on his neck, arm, leg. Nothing makes big difference. This is only one I give 5 stars. He used for 3 weeks. Eczema is 90% gone on his neck,</li>
            <li> A little pricey but exactly the same product without having to get membership</li>
            <li> Nothing works for me better than Renew.  I&#x27;ve tried averything.  Will be a user for year to come.  A A</li>
            <li> I used this product then I just did not, don&#x27;t know why.  I came back.  I am 68 years old, and if I keep tRenew on&lt;br /&gt;my body daily, my skin is moist and much less dry and wrinkled, especially around my upper arms.  Will not be&lt;br /&gt;without this product.  If your skin is dry and you have not taken care of it, you might neet to use it two or three&lt;br /&gt;times a day until your skin is nourished.  If you don&#x27;t use it daily, it won&#x27;t work...like anything else.</li>
            <li> I was given this product from a relative and absolutely fell in love with it. There is no odor, no sliminess feeling after  you put it on. This is a great product. I recommend this to anyone that does not like lotion. You will enjoy this one..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and I have tried many different products, I know this is expensive but it&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Great product. It is only lotion that works for my grandsons eczema. It has helped my husbands dry hands too.</li>
            <li> My daughter broke out in a rash at the age of 6 months and ever since has had what doctors have diagnosed as \\&quot;eczema\\&quot;. I started using this product and she only has one or two very tiny patches left on her skin and her skin is SO soft! I started using it too and I love it! A little heavy for summer weather but I use it in the winter when it gets so dry out.</li>
            <li> My son has had eczema since he was a few months old. I have tried expensive prescription creams and medications and nothing worked. After 3 days of using Renew his eczema decreased by half and now is gone completely! It is amazing and keeps his eczema from breaking out. Its like a miracle cure, honestly!</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT IT HELP OUR DAUGHTER&#x27;S SKIN SO MUCH LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product--about the only thing that works for my eczema/dry skin without being greasy and causing allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever!!!! Not greasy, Clean fresh scent, Natural ingredients. Cannot say enough about Melaleuca! Stays on all day can still feel it come off in shower.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!! I am blessed that my sister in law is a member and I order thru her. I have severe dry skin ..to the point that sometimes it cracks and bleeds. This lotion keeps me satin smooth day after day. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love having this larger bottle of Renew on my kitchen sink as I constantly have my hands in and out of water with washing pots and pans or cleaning after cutting poultry, breaking eggs, etc.  I tend to dry out terribly in the winter and my fingertips crack and bleed.  This has been more healing than any other  lotion or cream I&#x27;ve tried.  I bought some small tubes to keep in my purse and for traveling.  This larger one is great for the bath, bedstand, and my kitchen.</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders on a variety of skin problems ranging from simple dryness to other irritations like eczema, for example.</li>
            <li> Is great.&lt;br /&gt;A mi me cambió la piel de mis manos,después de que ninguna crema me funcionaba, funciona al instante, por eso yo la utilizo desde hace casi 6 años.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything and this is the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best lotion I have ever used!!  Even cured an unusual skin ailment one winter that a doctor perscribed ointment couldn&#x27;t handle.  Gentle on every part of the body, even my face. (Would consult dermatologist before using on the face, but works great for me)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now for eczema. It works very well.  But the price here on amazing is ridiculous.  $46.99 for a 20oz bottle?  I get this around the corner from my house from a doctors office for $17.99 for the same size bottle.  This is good stuff but definitely not worth $46.99.</li>
            <li> The feel of this lotion is not matched by any other! Really soft and really soothing. As far as healing eczema it seems comparable to other eczema lotions and creams. But again the feel is superb!</li>
            <li> One of the best lotions we have ever used... A family of 7 who farms and heats with wood, this product has proven to earn our respect. Pricey, but used in small amounts. Very effective.</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders for my very dry skin! Nothing compares to it....but the price on amazon is crazy. I am a Melaleuca preferred customer and i get this for only $15.99 . The min purchase per month is around $50 and i spend it on stuff i use everyday like shampoo and laundry soap. Anyone want to get this way cheaper let me know! jenp823 at hotmail. com</li>
            <li> But it does help make me not feel so itchy and my skin is definitely a little bit more smooth. Still get problematic skin from time to time. Oh and the pump sucks, it doesn&#x27;t pump anything out. Maybe I got a defective one? Been using it for months.</li>
            <li> This product is a good one. It was a much better price than I had been seeing. I like it because of its healing power and moisturizing ability.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM WAS SUGGESTED BY A FRIEND FOR MY DRY SKIN PROBLEM.  I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT&#x27;S NOT GREASEY AND ABSORBS INTO THE SKIN VERY NICELY.  IT HAS STOPPED MY ITCHING PROBLEM ON MY FACE, HANDS AND ARMS.  I ALSO RECOMMENDED IT TO MY FAMILY AS THEIR CHILDREN HAVE EXEMA PROBLEMS.  IT HAS HELPED THEM ALSO.  IT&#x27;S A VERY GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> The 20 oz bottle contents leaves a sticky or oil feel between the fingers that last for quite some time. The 1 oz size did not do this. Had it I would have not ordered the 20 oz size. The larger 20 oz also has an fragrance that the small tube did not. Probably will not order again.</li>
            <li> This lotions leaves me supple and hydrated all over! I use to sell Melaleuca and this was my favorite product.</li>
            <li> This is the only skin moisturizer I have ever found that is soothing, non-greasy and it also has a subtle clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This works great on my Grandsons eczema . After 2 uses you can see such a big difference in his skin and in his itching.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that keeps my eczema at bay. Without getting too deep into it, a few years ago my eczema really took a turn for the worst. It was everywhere. I saw a doctor who referred me to a dermatologist who referred me to some crap that I had to mis and apply multiple times a day. I was miserable until a friend recommended this. I now put this on once after I shower and my skin is NORMAL. No eczema flare ups at all. Really an incredible product that I&#x27;m very thankful for.</li>
            <li> Both of my children  have eczema, one of them having severe eczema, and we can&#x27;t live without this!!  It keeps breakouts at bay and keeps their skin moisturized for 24 hours. Plus, it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> A miracle lotion for eczema..my newborn had eczema with acne..it was so severe and can&#x27;t use hydrocortisone..a family member have me sample lotion..and it was amazing..fast response..I recommend it for people with eczema.</li>
            <li> My son has severe eczema and dry skin.  A friend recommended this lotion.  She said it helped her son with his eczema.  The lotion is expensive, but it has significantly reduced my son&#x27;s itchiness.  Prior to using the lotion my son was constantly scratching, now I rarely see him itching.  The lotion absorbs well and his skin is softer to the touch.  His eczema is not completely gone, but it is significantly improved.  The relief it gives him is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> But here goes. I am a pediatrician and have had really dry skin my whole life. I get eczema splits in my fingers and toes that take several days to heal. It can hurt a lot f the time. Unfortunately, both of my kids got it, too.&lt;br /&gt;But this Renew lotion is way, way better than anything else available. It makes my skin feel healthy. It clears up my children&#x27;s skin completely. In my office, between patients, I wash my hands with the Renew skin cleanser, then I rub a small squirt of Renew lotion on my hands. After 40 or 50 times during the workday, my hands feel great and look great. Boy is it expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 2 years and works great. I bought another a year ago. The whole family loves it. It&#x27;s soft feeling.</li>
            <li> Great product, does a wonderful healing job on psoriasis.  Been using it for years.  Prompt 2 day deliverary.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants a high quality hand moisturizer. I have very dry hands and this is the only lotion I will use.</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal, but it really saddens me that people are being ripped off when all they have to do is become a preferred customer with Melaleuca and purchase this same 20 oz bottle for $15.99.  I purchase many of Melaleuca&#x27;s great products and get them for a great value.  These people should be ashamed of themselves.[[ASIN:B006ZYH4SG Melaleuca Renew Dry Skin Therapy Pack]]</li>
            <li> Excelent product. Softens the skin</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! It cured my babies cradle cap in virtually 1 application, after a week it&#x27;s completely gone!! My skin feels like new skin! I am a preferred Melaleuca customer because all the products are this good! It&#x27;s a no brainer for my family!!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this lotion. He works in a freezer warehouse and I have dry feet, we both use this daily and have found that it clears up dry skin in about a week. The only bad thing that I can think of is that it is only a Maleluca product and therefore is a little expensive. If you try and purchase through the company they give you a sales pitch and try to get you to join and sell to others (kind of like Amway), don&#x27;t care for that. I just wish the price was more affordable.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my friend who is a beauty consultant.  She was right - it is wonderful to your skin.</li>
            <li> I use to have real bad eczema. What my doctor prescribed did help but it would only be temporary. So I looked online for something and came across this. I read a lot of reviews and heard amazing stories about how it helped others so I tried it. Gradually using it everyday I noticed over courses of months my eczema slowly went away. Now after using this stuff for over a year all the eczema I once had is completely gone! I never write reviews but for this I have to. This stuff truly worked and changed my life. Its the only lotion I use now. So to anyone who reads this buy it asap!</li>
            <li> Not as good as what I got direct  from melaleuca,  Much to expensive. I will not order it again this way</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!vary good!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this years ago.  One big bottle lasts me about a year.  You only need to use it every other day. Not sure how they do it but skin stays moist even after showering.</li>
            <li> It has helped my chronic skin problem and smells great.</li>
            <li> I think this is great!  It keeps my skin soft and moist in the dry climate of Colorado.  I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This does the trick!! my daughter has eczema outbreak outs on her back and arms. Aveeno did nothing, she would scratch her back on walls which left bruises and sores. My mother&#x27;s coworker reccommended this. Once I bought it, she was not itching soon after application. I swear by this stuff. She hasn&#x27;t had a break out for a year.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin in the world and have struggled finding a product that would do the job.  I have various dermatitis issues, eczema, and other skin allergies.  This clears up and prevents skin issues like no other... can literally see and feel the difference within 24 hours of using it.  I have been using it for a couple of years now and have no plans of ever switching to anything else.</li>
            <li> The only cream I use and it works very good for my hands! Its very expensive I hope they lower the price :-)</li>
            <li> I have eczema and have found this to be the best lotion for my irritated skin.  I have tried everything natural under the sun, and this keeps my skin moist.  During the summer when the eczema gets too itchy in the inside of my arm and is too irritated I sometimes resort to a little bit of cortizone (much to my homeopathics dismay).  I have been pleasantly surprised at the results of Melaleuca Intensive Therapy on my skin.</li>
            <li> This Melaleuca product helps with itchy skin and keeps skin reasonably smooth.  It does have a strong scent when you initially apply it which dissipates as it gets absorbed.</li>
            <li> ** Buy it cheaper to Melaleuca Manufacture.  No Monthly commiment.  For more info ereyes32@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> I have not found a better lotion. It&#x27;s pricy but it works.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing on my excema!&lt;br /&gt;The only other cream that works this well is steroid cream (which I do NOT want to use long-term).&lt;br /&gt;If, like me, you have tried multiple creams and none really does completely fix the problem, give this a go!  It&#x27;s expensive for a cream but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital and have to wash my hand 10-15 times a day.  My granddaughter did not want to hold my hand because it felt like a cactus. I have spent hundreds of dollars on different products over the past 2 years and never had these results.  It&#x27;s not greasy, it absorbs into the skin and lasts.  This lotion is fabulous! It was recommended to me by a friend and I have recommended to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me and it works well enough. My skin is VERY dry. Non greasy and absorbs well</li>
            <li> For six long months, I had an ever growing rash of eczema on both the left and right sides of my body.Weeks of laborious applications of steroid creams covered in wet dressings morning and night did almost nothing to phase it. I tried an elimination diet hoping to peg down gluten, wheat or other GMO foods, dairy, or some other allergen that would have been the cause of this autoimmune response. All to no avail. Then, someone gave me a sample of this lotion. I got more results in three days than I have in six months! I will continue to use it and update my post after some time with more long term results. If this turns out to me my true cure, I will stand behind it 100% and join the club. Anyone struggling with this embarrassing condition needs to know about this.</li>
            <li> The best lotion out there for dry skin, unfortunately you normally have to be a member or distributor to buy it, so I was thrilled to see it for sale on Amazon.  I read where it also helps with eczema, so hopefully it does, if not, I still love it.  It&#x27;s not greasy and your skin is so soft after using it.  I got it way before they said it would arrive, which was an additional surprise.  It&#x27;s more expensive than some, but totally worth it, you get what you pay for, and now that it&#x27;s available through Amazon I&#x27;ll use it from here on.  I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> is really nice I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Renew really works, offers exceptional results especially for those with eczema and very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for helping keep skin smooth and comfortable in the dry, cold Wyoming winter weather.  We keep bottles in each bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY remedy that has completely relieved my new bouts with eczema on my R and l hands.....for some reason I started gettin deep fissures and dryness on my palms then on the back of my hands these red scabby paper cut-type irritations that wouldn&#x27;t heal. This Magic potion is all I need now. Being that it&#x27;s harder to join Melaleuca the club then it is to get into a Masonic lodge, I am thankful for AMAZON hosting the sale of this product! Ten stars.</li>
            <li> Reduces redness of severe dry skin on hands.  Heals small cuts on fingers. Penetrates fast, long-lasting relief without being greasy.  Hands look better immediately. Leaves hands feeling soft and smooth - - better than any hand and body lotion I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I found a small sample of Renew in my make up bag....where it came from, I have no idea.....I tried it on my feet and heels and although I have tried every foot cream on this earth, this was the only one that almost immediately softened my dry heels.</li>
            <li> The only lotion my husband will use..</li>
            <li> I love how much this product sinks into the skin without making it greasy. It always seems to heal the dryest skin, too. Will continue to purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I am adverse to many of the products under the Melaleuca brand name because years ago it was a MLM (maybe still is), which I joined and after being buried in stuff I was required to purchase as a &amp;#34;dealer&amp;#34; LOL I bailed. However, this lotion is superb!!  I generally do not use lotions but every once in a while my hands will get dry and sometimes I have cracks in the skin (very painful). So then I start rolling in the typical brands looking for immediate healing and relief. Most don&#x27;t affect the condition once it gets out of hand (no pun intended). With just a few drops of Renew (the size of a penny) this lotion goes into the skin easily and disappears without being greasy, oily or taking forever to rub in. It seems like immediately my condition (dry-extremely dry cracked) skin is eliminated and it may be several months before I need apply it again. I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t just &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; products but this is by far the best immediate relief lotion I have ever used. I keep small tubes in glove box and backpacks. In the home I have this larger container. If your a women this could easily be your every day (hour) lotion. As a guy, I just use it when needed but it works. A really excellent product.</li>
            <li> That the only creme work for my daughter ecsima</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion and worth the price.!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I have always loved it.  It is definitely my preference for hand and body lotion/cream.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this cream. It works awesome. Kept my dry Hands over the winter at bay. Also worked great on my feet. I never used a cream that worked this great.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have found for my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  Like that I can find it without finding a dealer.</li>
