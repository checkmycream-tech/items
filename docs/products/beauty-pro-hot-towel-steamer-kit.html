            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it :-)</li>
            <li>Just be creative, and use the tongs!</li>
            <li>The hot towels feel wonderful and makes you relax.</li>
            <li>Great for a hot towel shave but the steaming container is flimsy, and the rubber feet aren&#x27;t always installed.  </li>
            <li>The Beauty Pro Hot towel Steamer looks great but the cover is made of plastic</li>
            <li>The quality is just ok...</li>
            <li>Worked ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The top is plastic and flimsy for starters.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a better deal on here.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>This is really great, it may seem cheap, but for non commercial use, it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li>Look cool, Works great, and is fun to have.</li>
            <li>It makes for a warm clean way to start the day!&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Takes alittle time boiling the water before adding it to the steamer.</li>
            <li>The delivery time was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I rarely use it and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you want to scald your hands and your client&#x27;s face!!</li>
            <li>Steams towels quick and effective.</li>
            <li>That cheap plastic top is not made to withstand electric heat...</li>
            <li>The perfect fit for limited space.</li>
            <li>Will pay a little more to get the best...</li>
            <li>Nice hot towels when you need</li>
            <li>Pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed how the warmer already came equipped with six small towels perfect for facials.</li>
            <li>Also the lid isn&#x27;t secure so its easily knocked over.</li>
            <li>Does not take up a lot of space &amp; heats towels quickly!</li>
            <li>This little steamer works great!</li>
            <li>too cheap</li>
            <li>The plastic is so beyond cheap its like one of those disposable lunch containers.</li>
            <li>I use it for my mobile business and it is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>It works fantastically, quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Thank you to BeautyPro for such a wonderful product and will be buying more BeautyPro Facial Wrap Towels soon.</li>
            <li>Such a great product that I had to come and do a review of the BeautyPro Hot Towel Steamer.  </li>
            <li>You will be lucky if it holds one.</li>
            <li>This is a great compact little machine that does just the job for my clients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, even if it did not arrive defective this thing is not even close to being worth $100.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I haven&#x27;t figured out the proper measurement of water as yet.</li>
            <li>and  could fit more than 6 tiny hand towels...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this steamer it is small and compact yet delivers very nice heated towels.</li>
            <li>You put damp towels in the unit, fill to the line and in 7 minutes you have towels too hot to pick up.</li>
            <li>Towels get extremely hot.</li>
            <li>the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that this tells me I have to submit more words</li>
            <li>I had gone to a spa and the massage therapist always uses hot towels.</li>
            <li>Mine burned up on the first use.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as it should</li>
            <li>Love the BeautyPro Facial Wrap Towels that came in the kit.  </li>
            <li>First off, this item will not hold 6 salon towels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup artist and use it for removal - love the product but tongs weren&#x27;t in the box - not sure why but easy to get</li>
            <li>Towels are hot and ready in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>The size on line was deceiving, it was way to small for us, we need one big enough to steam two 200gr herbal balls, one unit twice that size would probably work great for us, thank you for following up with the sale process, great service, Coco</li>
            <li>I have tried a standard size towel and they work fine</li>
            <li>Works okay but not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and you can only fit three or four into the container.  </li>
            <li>Very compact an unobtrusive for a one-bed operation like mine.</li>
            <li>The towels heat up fast.</li>
            <li>so much I might get another one.</li>
            <li>The beauty pro hot towel steamer doesn&#x27;t even get the towels warm at all, definitely a waste of my money!</li>
            <li>Very light weight, it is basically a cheap plastic container sitting on a hot plate that has a little bowl the diameter of a coffee cup in the middle.  </li>
            <li>Fits nicely in the small space I have.</li>
            <li>fortunately, we did not leave it unattended very long.</li>
            <li>They are long, rectangular face towels,, unusual shape but not impossible to work with.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who gets a massage in your home or if you know reiki and want to add this to your program.</li>
            <li>the towels are a bit too hot when they are ready, but my main issue is that the towels are falling apart and only washed them twice!</li>
            <li>Hahaha plus the towel&amp;#34;s get super hot and there is no way to turn the heat down!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They cool down a bit quickly so I add a little hot water to towels before putting them in the container</li>
            <li>And to fit six towels in it, you would have to wind them up tight.  </li>
            <li>Needs to have a heat control for how hot, not how long it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use and looks very unobtrusive in the treatment room.</li>
            <li>When traveling for facial parties or in home facials its very practical instead of bowls of water and sponges.</li>
            <li>Even reading about the correct measurement, I really thought it was bigger</li>
            <li>but the towels don&#x27;t stay hot very long</li>
            <li>I thought these were full sized towels that I could use for face shaves, these towels aren&#x27;t large enough for a small woman.  </li>
            <li>but it could be larger in the container to use a normal size face towel.</li>
            <li>When you use the steamer you must fold the half width towels in half so that they fit into the steamer container.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does not take long for towels to heat up.</li>
            <li> and there wasn&#x27;t a loose rubber foot/pad included so it wasn&#x27;t installed at the factory.  </li>
            <li> but they are half as wide as a standard hand towel.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and just stick a wet towel in the microwave for 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> ,it really not what it&#x27;s made out to be.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> This product works well and is compact, my only complaint is that it didn&#x60;t com with the tongs that were pictured</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think that the bowl can really handle the heat because if it could it would not have craced or started to peel.</li>
            <li> However it can be a little messy with the water dripping from the lid and the bowl cover.</li>
            <li> Mine cracked the first time I used it, and I think it was because the base doesn&#x27;t sit flat because of one of the feet was missing.  </li>
            <li> and for the price what a waste of money</li>
            <li> A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the extent of all the cracks all over it and in a few areas pieces of the plastic were breaking off and about to fall off the unit.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> The clear plastic is very thin and cracked all over after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> There is very little counter space</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> way to small even for wash cloth to use in massage</li>
            <li> wrong plug for australia and even two different prongs</li>
            <li> so I want a small towel warmer.</li>
            <li> I saw a few negative review.</li>
            <li> The towel warmer arrived well, notihng was broken or missing.</li>
            <li> It is a real waste of money.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it is junk.  </li>
            <li> NO GOOD</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this product and we were so disappointed when the plastic cover totally cracked all over after just the 1st use!</li>
            <li> With disappointment It was missing the tongs and would not heat up.</li>
            <li> This machine is not working I&#x27;m in the middle of my session and doent work how disappointing they should do thorough quality evaluation and assessment before they ship and sell this product !!!</li>
            <li> so cant use an adaptor, not impressed at all</li>
            <li> Sad to say you can&#x27;t buy the bowl seperately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so we continued using it another couple months... until the base stopped working (heating up).</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is a wonderful product and it fits perfectly in my spa.  There is very little counter space and it works perfect!</li>
            <li> This machine is not working I&#x27;m in the middle of my session and doent work how disappointing they should do thorough quality evaluation and assessment before they ship and sell this product !!!and for the price what a waste of money</li>
            <li> It is not the best steamer kit on the market. Overpriced. Will be sending back...The quality is just ok...Will pay a little more to get the best...</li>
            <li> Very nice but you have to pre-wet the towels before you start the process. Just an FYI.</li>
            <li> You put damp towels in the unit, fill to the line and in 7 minutes you have towels too hot to pick up. They are long, rectangular face towels,, unusual shape but not impossible to work with. Just be creative, and use the tongs!</li>
            <li> Worked ok. Comes with towels.</li>
            <li> Needs to have a heat control for how hot, not how long it&#x27;s on. I rarely use it and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you want to scald your hands and your client&#x27;s face!! A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The beauty pro already broke and leaking water. too cheap</li>
            <li> Works okay but not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It doesn&#x27;t look sturdy but it does get the job done. Nice hot towels when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;They cool down a bit quickly so I add a little hot water to towels before putting them in the container&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it :-)</li>
            <li> This product arrived defective.  It did not heat up at all....even after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even if it did not arrive defective this thing is not even close to being worth $100.  The top is plastic and flimsy for starters.  I suppose because it is a specialty item of sorts they can get away with charging that much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get a rice cooker for 1/4 of the price.  It will do the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The perfect fit for limited space. Does not take long for towels to heat up. 30 minutes max. Towels get extremely hot. This product is great.</li>
            <li> works great and is compact.  Fits nicely in the small space I have. the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that this tells me I have to submit more words then I feel necessary.  So how&#x27;s that for filling in the words!</li>
            <li> I purchased this steamer on August 6, 2013 and it&#x27;s already broke!  The timer spinner doesn&#x27;t work, therefore it doesn&#x27;t turn on.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> So I bought this at a hair show because I&#x27;ve always wanted a warmer. This is really great, it may seem cheap, but for non commercial use, it&#x27;s very effective. I paid 80+tax at the show, so it&#x27;s a better deal on here. The towels are nice too, I was impressed with the quality. You might need another set of them....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret buying this at all.</li>
            <li> way to small even for wash cloth to use in massage</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this product and we were so disappointed when the plastic cover totally cracked all over after just the 1st use! That cheap plastic top is not made to withstand electric heat...in fact, we believe it is a fire hazard to have around the home. Couldn&#x27;t believe the extent of all the cracks all over it and in a few areas pieces of the plastic were breaking off and about to fall off the unit. Thank God we caught this and unplugged the unit immediately before any damage occurred to the furniture the unit was stationed on, and that it did not cause a fire in our home...fortunately, we did not leave it unattended very long. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT -- SAVE YOUR MONEY &amp; PUT IT INTO A \\&quot;METAL\\&quot; NOT PLASTIC TOWEL WARMER!!!</li>
            <li> The clear plastic is very thin and cracked all over after just a few uses. I contacted the company and they said they&#x27;d send a replacement, but never did. It still worked even with the cracks so we continued using it another couple months... until the base stopped working (heating up). It&#x27;s now in the landfill.</li>
            <li> This little steamer works great! I use it for my mobile business and it is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> The beauty pro hot towel steamer doesn&#x27;t even get the towels warm at all, definitely a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best portable towel steamers that I have ever used! Towels are hot and ready in 30 minutes. I use this for warming my towels for my facial clients. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space in the room or make a lot of noise :) Great product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I received the towel steamer kit. With disappointment It was missing the tongs and would not heat up. I would not recommend this product. Save yourself some money and use a crock pot!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product. We tried several times to use the warmer and each and every time, it leaked. I even tried to change the towels, how they were rolled and how moist they were but it still caused my counters to be flooded with water. NO GOOD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and use it for removal - love the product but tongs weren&#x27;t in the box - not sure why but easy to get</li>
            <li> Great for a hot towel shave but the steaming container is flimsy, and the rubber feet aren&#x27;t always installed.  Mine cracked the first time I used it, and I think it was because the base doesn&#x27;t sit flat because of one of the feet was missing.  I checked the packaging when I opened it and there wasn&#x27;t a loose rubber foot/pad included so it wasn&#x27;t installed at the factory.  Now I will get to see how good the warranty is.&lt;br /&gt;The steamer is a bit over priced and the towels that come with it are the proper length but they are half as wide as a standard hand towel.  When you use the steamer you must fold the half width towels in half so that they fit into the steamer container.  I have tried a standard size towel and they work fine but you have to fold them in an accordion fold to get the steam to the entire towel and you can only fit three or four into the container.  Not a deal breaker but it could be larger in the container to use a normal size face towel.</li>
            <li> This product works well and is compact, my only complaint is that it didn&#x60;t com with the tongs that were pictured</li>
            <li> wrong plug for australia and even two different prongs so cant use an adaptor, not impressed at all will have to send back waist of time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this item the water runs out before you even turn around!!! Hahaha plus the towel&amp;#34;s get super hot and there is no way to turn the heat down! Just saying</li>
            <li> Steams towels quick and effective. I also enjoyed how the warmer already came equipped with six small towels perfect for facials.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice. Very compact an unobtrusive for a one-bed operation like mine. Can do all the towels needed for a customer.</li>
            <li> It works great...the towels are a bit too hot when they are ready, but my main issue is that the towels are falling apart and only washed them twice!</li>
            <li> This is a great compact little machine that does just the job for my clients. The towels that come with it are good quality and the perfect size for a variety of treatments. It is simple to use and looks very unobtrusive in the treatment room.</li>
            <li> When traveling for facial parties or in home facials its very practical instead of bowls of water and sponges. However it can be a little messy with the water dripping from the lid and the bowl cover. Also the lid isn&#x27;t secure so its easily knocked over. The towels heat up fast. Honestly I haven&#x27;t figured out the proper measurement of water as yet.</li>
            <li> I had gone to a spa and the massage therapist always uses hot towels. The hot towels feel wonderful and makes you relax. I started getting therapists to come to my home so I want a small towel warmer. I saw a few negative review. I bought one anyway. I am glad that I did. It works just as described. I highly recommend this to anyone who gets a massage in your home or if you know reiki and want to add this to your program.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this steamer it is small and compact yet delivers very nice heated towels. I like it so much I might get another one.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it is junk.  Very light weight, it is basically a cheap plastic container sitting on a hot plate that has a little bowl the diameter of a coffee cup in the middle.  Mine burned up on the first use.  And to fit six towels in it, you would have to wind them up tight.  Save your money and just stick a wet towel in the microwave for 2 minutes.  Voila.  Steamed towel.</li>
            <li> I bought this last month (March 2013) and I used it twice and the bowl cracked and started to peel. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think that the bowl can really handle the heat because if it could it would not have craced or started to peel. Sad to say you can&#x27;t buy the bowl seperately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for another steamer.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works exactly as it should</li>
            <li> Pros- Look cool, Works great, and is fun to have. I use it to wash my daycare kids hands in the morning as they come in the morning. It makes for a warm clean way to start the day!&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Takes alittle time boiling the water before adding it to the steamer. (distilling)</li>
            <li> Such a great product that I had to come and do a review of the BeautyPro Hot Towel Steamer.  It works fantastically, quick and easy to use.  Love the BeautyPro Facial Wrap Towels that came in the kit.  I went to do a treatment for a client and she loved it too. Thank you to BeautyPro for such a wonderful product and will be buying more BeautyPro Facial Wrap Towels soon.</li>
            <li> The delivery time was pretty good. The towel warmer arrived well, notihng was broken or missing. However, I was particulary a bit disapointed with the size of it. Even reading about the correct measurement, I really thought it was bigger and  could fit more than 6 tiny hand towels... But it&#x27;s ok. Next time I&#x27;ll get a bigger one for our Nail Salon.</li>
            <li> It is Perfect for my salon! Does not take up a lot of space &amp; heats towels quickly! &amp;#60;3 it!!!</li>
            <li> First off, this item will not hold 6 salon towels. You will be lucky if it holds one. It is quite tiny. The plastic is so beyond cheap its like one of those disposable lunch containers. No joke! Mine came so defective that the lid wont even shut. This is like a total joke. I do not know how anyone could use this item in a salon? I should have listened to the other reviews. Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> The size on line was deceiving, it was way to small for us, we need one big enough to steam two 200gr herbal balls, one unit twice that size would probably work great for us, thank you for following up with the sale process, great service, Coco</li>
            <li> This is a tiny, tiny steamer.  I thought these were full sized towels that I could use for face shaves, these towels aren&#x27;t large enough for a small woman.  Won&#x27;t purchase another.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The Beauty Pro Hot towel Steamer looks great but the cover is made of plastic,it really not what it&#x27;s made out to be.It is a real waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just loved it was just what I wanted thank you for your great service.</li>
            <li> works well but the towels don&#x27;t stay hot very long</li>
