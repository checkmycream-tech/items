            <li>This product works the best for me than any other product,I think I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the old wernets</li>
            <li>Absolute Junk !!!</li>
            <li>Hope someone else finds this tip useful!</li>
            <li>I first got acquainted with Fixodent powder when I went to my dentist and that&#x27;s what he was using.  </li>
            <li>It may be my bridge that prevents a good solid fit, but it is not holding as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li>, I swished my mouth with cool water after using a toothbrush to clean my dentures (while still inserted in my mouth).  </li>
            <li>I can eat anything with this Fixodent powder even with a full set of dentures as I have...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is just the increased levels of zinc (one of the main ingredients that give denture adhesive their grip) causing this, but the tingling abates after about 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The strips that come out kind of remind me of gelatin, they&#x27;re about the same consistency.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed that the water flowing over the edges of the gums of the dentures caused the powder to set up MUCH more quickly than it would have just waiting for my mouth to produce enough saliva to finish moistening the powder to get it to gel and set.  </li>
            <li>Cushion Grip works good to tighten up the denture and seals out food, but has little holding power.&lt;br /&gt;But, this powder should do the holding, and it does, until I eat something, then, it&#x27;s coming out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also discovered that cleaning this product out of dentures can be a bit of a challenge, but what works best for me is running tap water at higher-than-warm, lower-than-scalding-hot temperatures, filling my soaking container, dropping in an overnight soaking tablet and scrubbing with moderately-hot water in the morning will typically remove the adhesive in a single strip each.  </li>
            <li>Nice partial just won&#x27;t stay glued in place.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much, or you will have to pry your dentures out!</li>
            <li>He says it sticks better without gushing out around the back of the denture and has no offensive taste.  </li>
            <li>They are a fabulous company and always deliver early or on time.</li>
            <li>I received the Fixodent and really like it.</li>
            <li>I have a lower partial that will not stay in place more then 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>It still takes some time for the grip to take hold, but once it does, dentures feel very secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(no adhesive I&#x27;ve tried has let me do this, so I can&#x27;t really say this is to the detriment of this product).  </li>
            <li>fast, fast shipping .</li>
            <li>wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered so much.  </li>
            <li>it runs out too fast</li>
            <li>While coffee (and some foods, like chocolate) cause the adhesive to lose its hold, the powder definitely still holds significantly longer than the creams</li>
            <li>I was still learning the whole process and experience with my new dentures.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This was roughly 1 minute after I first applied fresh powder and inserted my dentures into my mouth.  </li>
            <li>very light, fluffy and easy to  apply and not to sticky as my previous powder was.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reading some other reviews on here, I discovered that using warm water helps the powder to take it&#x27;s gel-like form more quickly than cold water does,</li>
            <li>My dentures are a little over a month old, and I know my jaw is still shrinking, but this stuff should have alot better hold</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and as expected.</li>
            <li>When someone makes a product that actually holds like superglue, and can stand up to all foods, they will have a huge following instantly.</li>
            <li>While this product definitely lives up to the \\&quot;Extra Hold\\&quot; portion of its packaging, I still expected a bit more from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely be doing this from now on, as it&#x27;s much faster</li>
            <li>Fixodent holds my upper (only) denture better than any other that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Super PoliGrip and Fixodent products so far - I haven&#x27;t tried Sea Bond, wafers, or anything of that nautre yet, so my experience with various types of adhesives is rather limited.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, clean your dentures, moisten them with a little water over the gums, sprinkle powder, insert dentures into mouth, let set for about 15 seconds, clench teeth together</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that drinking hot liquids seems to have a negative impact on the amount of time this powder actually holds dentures securely in place.  </li>
            <li>: clean your dentures, rinse them, leave them damp, sprinkle powder over the gum areas of the plates, insert and hold for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>It is not the same as I was using but they rarised the price so high I could not afford it anymore.</li>
            <li>(this is important, or your dentures will fall loose when swishing), and swish your mouth withjust enough water to get everything wet.  </li>
            <li>My dentures have soft liners in them, as I&#x27;ve never gone back to get the final reline done since getting complete dentures.  </li>
            <li>They know all these products are weak and will not hold up to any real amount of pressure from real foods, like meat and bread, and vegis.</li>
            <li>accidentally discovered that when I used a little too much powder</li>

            <li> Plus, I still can&#x27;t eat things like sandwhiches without my upper popping down in the back, nor can I eat things like corn on the cob still</li>
            <li> thing I noticed with this powder is that upon initial insertion of the upper and lower plates into my mouth, I notice a very, very slight tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li> no better than the regular fixodent cream</li>
            <li> For me, Fixodent has the strongest hold of any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> $2000.00 down the drain.</li>
            <li> It also bears mentioning I&#x27;ve only had dentures for approximately 7 months now, so I&#x27;m still adapting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> a heavy coffee drinker,</li>
            <li> So, this is another waste of money.</li>
            <li> always purchase this as I have tried every little denture adhesive on the market and the combination of the two is miraculous!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find powder here</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> My husband recently got one denture and absolutely hated all the liquid adhesives.  </li>
            <li> I eat anything I want, including corn on the cob (Silver Queen if I can get it), and have never had any unfortunate accidents.  </li>
            <li> Not as complicated as I thought it was going to</li>

            <li> I have a lower partial that will not stay in place more then 3-4 hours. None of these over the counter products work for me.&lt;br /&gt;This one does not either.

            <li> I&amp;#34;m glad I found this. I wish I could find the powder in the US. I did once and never again. I like the posder better than the rest.</li>
            <li> Thank you for fixodent denture adhesive powder, I like them.</li>
            <li> Hold is excellent. Good as Poligrip</li>

            <li> great seller, always ,,so far things have been good...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market (that I know about) except the liner ones.  Fixodent holds my upper (only) denture better than any other that I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve watched all the commercials and tried out their denture creams and powders.  For me, Fixodent has the strongest hold of any other I&#x27;ve tried.  I eat anything I want, including corn on the cob (Silver Queen if I can get it), and have never had any unfortunate accidents.  Anytime I try something else, I always go back to Fixodent.</li>
            <li> While this product definitely lives up to the \\&quot;Extra Hold\\&quot; portion of its packaging, I still expected a bit more from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used powders before, so this was a learning experience for me.  My dentures have soft liners in them, as I&#x27;ve never gone back to get the final reline done since getting complete dentures.  So finding a product that holds well, considering the pliable nature of the liners, is something of a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Super PoliGrip and Fixodent products so far - I haven&#x27;t tried Sea Bond, wafers, or anything of that nautre yet, so my experience with various types of adhesives is rather limited.  It also bears mentioning I&#x27;ve only had dentures for approximately 7 months now, so I&#x27;m still adapting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the instructions on the box, I realized use of this product is very straightforward: clean your dentures, rinse them, leave them damp, sprinkle powder over the gum areas of the plates, insert and hold for a few seconds.  Not as complicated as I thought it was going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed with this powder is that upon initial insertion of the upper and lower plates into my mouth, I notice a very, very slight tingling sensation.

It still takes some time for the grip to take hold, but once it does, dentures feel very secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker, and I&#x27;ve noticed that drinking hot liquids seems to have a negative impact on the amount of time this powder actually holds dentures securely in place.

The strips that come out kind of remind me of gelatin, they&#x27;re about the same consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and will probably continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***TIP***&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally discovered that when I used a little too much powder and I had to brush the goop out of my mouth off the gums of my dentures, I swished my mouth with cool water after using a toothbrush to clean my dentures (while still inserted in my mouth).  This was roughly 1 minute after I first applied fresh powder and inserted my dentures into my mouth.  I noticed that the water flowing over the edges of the gums of the dentures caused the powder to set up MUCH more quickly than it would have just waiting for my mouth to produce enough saliva to finish moistening the powder to get it to gel and set.  I will definitely be doing this from now on, as it&#x27;s much faster and my dentures don&#x27;t have a chance to shift around and become misaligned before the powder converts to gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, clean your dentures, moisten them with a little water over the gums, sprinkle powder, insert dentures into mouth, let set for about 15 seconds, clench teeth together (this is important, or your dentures will fall loose when swishing), and swish your mouth withjust enough water to get everything wet.  Almost instantaneous set!  Hope someone else finds this tip useful!just enough water to get everything wet.  Almost instantaneous set!  Hope someone else finds this tip useful!</li>
            <li> Yep - use them both at the same time and find it is the greatest hold ever! I can truly go 24 hours with no concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the goopy fixodent, you may get about 12 hours from this. But hey, it does last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will always purchase this as I have tried every little denture adhesive on the market and the combination of the two is miraculous!</li>
            <li> fast, fast shipping . 5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered so much.  the Fixodent red gel is working best for me now.</li>
            <li> Excellent item  Works as expected</li>
            <li> My dentist had me use this while my gums were healing and it was ok,I was still learning the whole process and experience with my new dentures.</li>
            <li> something i have to have, so i buy in bulk. dont like the gooey stuff in tube it runs out too fast</li>
            <li> It is not the same as I was using but they rarised the price so high I could not afford it anymore.</li>
            <li> I hope they don&#x27;t stop making the powder. There was talk that they were going to, but its all I use and hopefully they don&#x27;t. Works good. I can eat anything with this Fixodent powder even with a full set of dentures as I have...It really is good stuff..</li>
            <li> My dentures are a little over a month old, and I know my jaw is still shrinking, but this stuff should have alot better hold then it does. Especially as I also have a layer of Cushion Grip under it, as a liner.Cushion Grip works good to tighten up the denture and seals out food, but has little holding power.&lt;br /&gt;But, this powder should do the holding, and it does, until I eat something, then, it&#x27;s coming out. Well, the bottom does. The top is ok. So, this is another waste of money. I have the tubes of Polident and Fixodent, and these companies are simply stealing money. They know all these products are weak and will not hold up to any real amount of pressure from real foods, like meat and bread, and vegis. It works all day with oatmeal, mashed potatoes, and pudding, but I can gum that stuff without teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If any company ever really gets serious and makes a denture adhesive that actually works all day, with one application, they will be zillionaires overnight. When someone makes a product that actually holds like superglue, and can stand up to all foods, they will have a huge following instantly. Hey Merch, are you listening? Why not add some adhesive to your Cushion Grip?</li>
            <li> very light, fluffy and easy to  apply and not to sticky as my previous powder was.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and as expected.</li>
            <li> Works very good and it seems to last longer than others - - - - - - - - -</li>
            <li> It is hard to find powder here and that is what I prefer instead of the gels so this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> This product works the best for me than any other product,I think I&#x27;ve tried them all. My upper plate stays in place all day at work,no problem,and all night as well if need be.After applying the product and you put them in,take some water to seal the powder.I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do. I keep looking for my teeth to fall out but they haven&#x27;t so I suppose it works. &amp;#60;GRIN&amp;#62; What can I say?</li>
            <li> works for husband every day</li>
            <li> My husband recently got one denture and absolutely hated all the liquid adhesives.  I bought this powder for him to try &amp; now he won&#x27;t use anything else.  He says it sticks better without gushing out around the back of the denture and has no offensive taste.  Good product.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that disappoints...it does not hold properly. I use only their Food Seal Plus and effervescent tablets, though. They are a fabulous company and always deliver early or on time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!</li>
            <li> These are very comfortable!!!</li>
            <li> Thank You Finally I Got the Hold I Was Lookin For</li>
            <li> I first got acquainted with Fixodent powder when I went to my dentist and that&#x27;s what he was using.  I&#x27;ll take the powder over gel anytime.  I couldn&#x27;t find the powder in our local stores so I checked with Amazon and it was there. Great product!</li>
            <li> Just as you would buy at your local store or pharmacy but a fraction of the price. Will buy my product trophy this method from here on out.</li>
