            <li>Smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find Ed Hardy Love on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love it,and was a good price!</li>
            <li>great love it would buy it again</li>
            <li>It a very interesting perfume formula, it has a  gel-oil in it , and in order to use it you have to shake it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I own every ed hardy scent and this one is my one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>(it kind of reminds me of makeup removal product )</li>
            <li>It still appeared new and Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li>Love the perfume, great price, and fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is like a body oil, I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the texture...</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>Glad I checked Amazon now.</li>
            <li>But, the scent is a very-very strong and does not has perfumy scent , more closer to chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and sells for more than  half off of retail.  </li>
            <li>This smells amazing, my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Fresh, fun, and sexy!  </li>
            <li>The price was fabulous.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the gimmick of the shake bottle.</li>
            <li>item wasn&#x27;t shipped that securely....</li>
            <li>Very odd, but whatever, it smells freakin&#x27; delicious!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not a fan of EH clothes, but I love sweet, gourmand, fruity perfumes, which EH scents very much apply to.)</li>
            <li>By far one of my favorite fruity summer fragrances!  </li>
            <li>It is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>This softly sweet scent smells of apple, jasmine, freesia, vanilla, and blackberry with a hint of musk.  </li>
            <li>I would like to be honored a full refund.</li>
            <li>But that being said, I still very much like it, and it&#x27;s easy and unoffensive to wear.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and I got some free samples and coupons though.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li>This is absolute OIL, greasy spray!</li>
            <li>I love this Cologne and the fact that I spent $15 less for a Mych Bigger Bottle than at the store was priceless</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This product is NOTHING like the real Ed Hardy Perfume.</li>
            <li>Pink at the top and clear at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Smells terrific if you like the sweeter, playful, fun type scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got average longevity and potency (not as good as Love &amp; Luck or Skull and Roses which last all day for me- and not as weak Ed Hardy for her, Hearts and Daggers, or Born Wild.)</li>
            <li>Pretty generic.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing more than a horrible knock off, when I first sprayed it on besides it being OIL, it smelled OK, after about 10 mintues the smell is completely gone.</li>
            <li>Very oily and scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>

            <li> Love the perfume, great price, and fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find Ed Hardy Love on Amazon. The price was fabulous. The smaller size locally was twice the price. I love the fragrance. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, my new favorite. It is light and fresh. It is like a body oil, I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it,and was a good price!</li>
            <li> I own every ed hardy scent and this one is my one of my favorites. Great spring/summer scent!</li>
            <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li> great love it would buy it again</li>
            <li> Not the same perfume at the mall. The smell wasn&#x27;t as strong, it was very weak. Also there was two different colors. Pink at the top and clear at the bottom. Weird. It&#x27;s supposed to be all pink and dissociated.</li>
            <li> I am a perfume addict, and have all the Ed Hardy scents for women. (I&#x27;m not a fan of EH clothes, but I love sweet, gourmand, fruity perfumes, which EH scents very much apply to.) This perfume is in the middle of EH scents, in my opinion. It&#x27;s got average longevity and potency (not as good as Love &amp; Luck or Skull and Roses which last all day for me- and not as weak Ed Hardy for her, Hearts and Daggers, or Born Wild.) The scent is a basic musky, strawberry, juicy fruit smell. Pretty generic. But that being said, I still very much like it, and it&#x27;s easy and unoffensive to wear. I enjoy the gimmick of the shake bottle. Cute.&lt;br /&gt;My item wasn&#x27;t shipped that securely.... Just the bottle in the EH package thrown in a box. I don&#x27;t think the bottle leaked, but the volume of liquid was lower than I expect from EH in these 3.4 bottles. It still appeared new and Amazon had the best price. So I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this scent or the fact that it looks greasy when you spray it on your skin. It smells really weird and I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on it. Delivery was fast and I got some free samples and coupons though.</li>
            <li> Very oily and scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Love the texture...it&#x27;s not the usual perfumy-type spray. Much better. Seems to be a thicker, sparkly type mist/.spray. Hard to explain. Smells terrific if you like the sweeter, playful, fun type scents. Amazon has a great price!!!  Just saw it today in a department store for $55.00 and I could use a 25% off coupon. However, it was not in stock. Glad I checked Amazon now. It&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> By far one of my favorite fruity summer fragrances!  This softly sweet scent smells of apple, jasmine, freesia, vanilla, and blackberry with a hint of musk.  Fresh, fun, and sexy!  The bottle instructs shaking before spraying.  The perfume looks like a shot of Pepto floating in a glass of vodka.  Very odd, but whatever, it smells freakin&#x27; delicious!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Only downside is it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li> Ed hardy is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> I love this Cologne and the fact that I spent $15 less for a Mych Bigger Bottle than at the store was priceless</li>
            <li> I received this perfume, last week. It a very interesting perfume formula, it has a  gel-oil in it , and in order to use it you have to shake it (it kind of reminds me of makeup removal product ) But, the scent is a very-very strong and does not has perfumy scent , more closer to chemical smell. Also, even after you shake the bottle very well, it still sprays the very thick liquidâ€¦ Not satisfied with it at all, I never seen perfume that would come in this type of formula. I was about to return the item, but at the time of processing a return I was notified it cannot be shipped back because of flammable item. It does not make any sense, item was shipped to me with no problem, but it cannot be shipped back.  Why, was I not notified at the time of purchase that this is a final sale ? I would like to be honored a full refund.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and sells for more than  half off of retail.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This product is NOTHING like the real Ed Hardy Perfume. This is absolute OIL, greasy spray! I have writtin Ed Hardy to let them know about this product being sold &amp;#34; customercare@edhardyshop.com &amp;#34;. This product is nothing more than a horrible knock off, when I first sprayed it on besides it being OIL, it smelled OK, after about 10 mintues the smell is completely gone. SAD SAD SAD, Very pathetic those companies are out there to take advantage of consumers. If the price sounds too good to be true, IT IS!!!!</li>
