            <li> I see no difference and the cream seems to be old too.</li>
            <li> SCAM!  DO NOT BUY!  I ONLY GAVE 1 STAR BECAUSE I HAD TO!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product</li>
            <li> I was allergic to it so all the money I paid went down the toilet</li>
            <li> Does not do any more than what I was using before, but paid a lot less for.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to actually TALK to customer services. No return policy listed. I am not happy with this product and would not recommend anyone buying it. Spend your money wisely and purchase something else!</li>
            <li> work&#x27;s great also looking younger</li>
            <li> I wish I had researched this prior to falling for the $4.95 shipping on a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34;.  The product is very reminiscent of Noxema only it&#x27;s a little waxier.  It did nothing for me and then I was charged $89.00.  It&#x27;s sister product, Revit a eye, made my skin under my eye dry - it was awful!  This is a scam as I&#x27;m sure all the other products out there that say, try it for shipping and handling only!  Scam, Scam, Scam!!!</li>
            <li> it is an absolute abuse!!!!!!!!!they are robbers!!!!!! no way to return the product!!!! its a scammm!!!!!</li>
            <li> These folks are total scammers.  I have never dealt with a more deceitful bunch.  Make sure you read ALL the fine print.  If your product is good, you don&#x27;t have to deceive people.</li>
            <li> WORST PRODUCT I  HAVE EVERY USED!!!!! Eye cream burns the skin around the eyes and the facial cream leaves skin DRY. What a scam!!! I fell for the &amp;#34;Free Trial Offer&amp;#34; and was charged $89.00 for each product!!!! I called them and yelled as loud as I could, but that did no good!!! I just have to face the fact that I was totally scammed. DON&#x27;T ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> SCAM!!!!!!!!! Don&#x27;t buy this garbage!!  Had a horrible reaction...made me look OLDER not younger and then the company charged me after I cancelled it....  Shame on Dr Oz for recommending it!</li>
            <li> Really liked this, but I cannot find it anywhere</li>
            <li> beau derma is not what it says it is.  the trial jar that you pay shipping for is actually the product  a super small jar that lasts under two week it comes with no instructions ... and unless you cancel you will be billed 89.98 monthly.....it is a scam stay away  Im sorry I got suckered into it Ishould know better than to believe all the hype  my bad but it does not have to be yours  so open your eyes ladies....</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels on my face and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout!</li>
            <li> I like it. I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> In about 5 days you start to see mild change on your facial skin. Looks healthier. Less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the reseller, but Beua Derma is a total scam. I purchased a sample size, somehow I&#x27;m enrolled in a monthly program at 90/bucks a month.  Could only cancel by paying 50pct off the 90 dollar regular price.</li>
            <li> This is a Scam. The fine print says they will charge you $89.00 after you pay the $4.95 shipping for FREE sample. And it is just cheap cream!!</li>
            <li> Item is too small and too expensive. The effects are not excellent for the price</li>
            <li> Well I thought the price was a bargain considering that real product is $90.- well I have used the real product- this one looked, felt and smell like ponds cold cream- now it is just taking up space in my cabinet</li>
            <li> product has no box  no ingredients listed , you get a flimsy colorful flier that anybody can print it out ... Lol and you are stuck with a monthly charge of only 49,99$ !!!! Surprise its a subscription.... Try to cancel and can be done for only 49.99$!!!! Gotta love those Californians.... Stay away from them you would be better using Vaseline... at least you know what you put on your skin ...</li>
