            <li> To me this smells a lot like baby powder especially when first applied. It gets a little better once you&#x27;ve been wearing it for awhile but I probably won&#x27;t be wearing it very often... I guess that&#x27;s what I get for buying a perfume I&#x27;ve never worn before</li>
            <li> I like it for my purse just right for a splash on the way to work</li>

            <li> I love the perfume, but the mini bottle is a pain to operate. The cap is stuck and I have to dab the perfume instead of spraying it which is a pain.</li>
