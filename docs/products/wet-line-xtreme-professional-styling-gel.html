    <ol>
            <li>One of the best hair gels i had tried.</li>
            <li>I love this gel!!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>very excellent product!!</li>
            <li>I love this gel!!!</li>
            <li>The hold is very good though.</li>
            <li>Incredible holding power, lasts all day and comes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After i still experienced continuous thinning and immediately quit the product.</li>
            <li>Great styling gel with holding power.</li>
            <li>It is a thicker gel and does a great job holding my 3C curls in place.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>The gel had a good hold</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand!</li>
            <li>but how the defintion looked before making it a bun has a nice appearance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THIS gel defined my curls nicely, gave me the xtra hold that I NEED</li>
            <li>These properties allow for ethanol to be an effective (and drying) penetration enhancer.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell and has a very strong hold.</li>
            <li>They all still latch on to the hair and plasticize it, and in many cases work against moisture as they are not moisturizers, but plasticizing emollients and moisturizing agents that need to work in conjunction with water in order to be effective in hydration.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very light.</li>
            <li>I like this gel better than Eco styler for curl definition</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>keep my options open of where I purchase it for the best price.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for curling creme products to define and hold my curls for a good 3 days worth.</li>
            <li>and YES it lasts me a good 3 days before my hair wash day!&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair with great shine, hold and definition.</li>
            <li>also like to use a leave-in conditioner  and a smoothing creme for more moisture and frizz control before then the xtreme wetline gel as my styler.</li>
            <li>I will elaborate on why this is what this gel does</li>
            <li>source is reliable despite being on yahoo answers, as it was answered by a top contributor in the chemistry section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are also many proven reports that TEA is an irritant, and has been linked to cancer.</li>
            <li>Many people also claim this is a \\&quot;Protein</li>

            <li>Many people also claim this is a \\&quot;Protein</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this gel it doesn&#x27;t make my hair come out</li>
            <li>and it defines my curls better than any there gel</li>
            <li>I might have to buy more when i run out because i use a lot...</li>
            <li>also love how easily it&#x27;s washed out,</li>
            <li>I came upon the WET LINE XTREME GEL and read MANY great reviews on it!</li>
            <li>Many People recommened it as a protein free gel.</li>
            <li>Its great on natural hair.</li>
            <li>Great curl definition when no other product worked on my combo 3C/4A hair.</li>
            <li>product markets itself as being alcohol free, when it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>product markets itself as being alcohol free, when it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, has a great smell, holds your hair down.  </li>
            <li>I like the curl definition that I get from using this wet line gel which is great.</li>
            <li>, the top 5 ingredients contain tea, which means it is the top 5 most active ingredients in the gel formulation, whether the sodium hydroxide is at 5% concentration or not.</li>

            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s an ok gel!</li>
            <li>Would recommend this gel to anyone who wants a protein free gel that keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Ethanolamine is an organic compound that is naturally found in coconut oil and is a primary amine and primary alcohol\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;EzineArticles(dot)com/6884068</li>
            <li>much proves it.</li>
            <li>much proves it.</li>
            <li>slicks your hair back nicely.</li>
            <li>Favorite gel so far for a budget</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty good with doing wash and go hairstyles using my own homemade flaxseed gel (which has a  soft hold), but I was looking for something that would hold and define my curls a little stronger.  </li>
            <li>swell hairs as much as 10 times the original size; may dissolve hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>swell hairs as much as 10 times the original size; may dissolve hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>It comes from coconut, so it must not be denatured right?</li>
            <li>The ingredient right after it, polyacrylate acid, meant to make up for the fact</li>
            <li>The ingredient right after it, polyacrylate acid, meant to make up for the fact</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on day 3 right now</li>
            <li>The dilution in water is the exact reason the compound is formed.</li>
            <li>The dilution in water is the exact reason the compound is formed.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying the Xtreme styling gel.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever seen my curls so defined.</li>
            <li>I let air dry or diffuse for more volume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is the only one (and their dark version with the stronger hold) that smooths my coarse curly hair wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it took me a very long time to notice what was in this product that was directly agitating what I assumed to be my protein sensitivity, since they marketed themselves as protein free and alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a light moisturizer spray on your hair (maybe African Pride - that&#x27;s what I do) to keep your tresses softer, healthier and moisturized).  </li>
            <li>It flakes if you use too much.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really does.</li>
            <li>I really do like this gel and because I do not use too much of it</li>
            <li>My hair be crunchy and kind of stiff.</li>
            <li>Yes it can dry crunchy depending how much you use, but I easily scruch the crunch out by smoothing on some hair serum or olive oil.</li>
            <li>It is EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE as other Sodium Hydroxide relaxers however much more mild due to the percentage of active ingredient.</li>

            <li>While I was in search of products to use as a replacement, I ran across Wet line gel, which claimed to be alcohol free, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and they still look pretty much the same as day 1.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far my #1 hair styling product and works wonders for me!</li>
            <li>form the exact same compound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>form the exact same compound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>next time I washed, I found my hair really easy to detangle after it was wet.  </li>
            <li>The fact that this is a clear gel means it was heated, and therefore denatured.</li>
            <li>These gels wouldn&#x27;t be this clear if they didn&#x27;t contain denatured alcohol.</li>
            <li>Once heated, that is when it forms a clear, gel consistency.</li>
            <li>This is where these products holding abilities and clear consistency come</li>
            <li>Natural curly hair, medium texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The alcohol does have a natural resistance to turning into salt and ammonia, however.</li>
            <li>Very drying and in 3rd ingredient.</li>
            <li>The low lye relaxer gently loosens the bonds for increased manageability, while maintaining some level of texture in the hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Works well on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I think there are places where you can buy it cheaper, I just haven&#x27;t found it near me</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have protein makes this an excellent product since I hate the crunch.  </li>
            <li>I have used MANY curl defining cremes but none would give me the hold to tame my frizz and last me 3 days.</li>
            <li>gel has great hold and leaves my hair soft to the touch, opposed to the usual hard cast that gels are known for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I explained last week in The 5 Most Common Mistakes</li>
            <li>A major beauty chain sells it on line too.  </li>
            <li>It did come wrapped well and arrived quicker than the major beauty chain deliveries.</li>
            <li>more watery consistency, slightly opalescent, slightly cloudy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw several natural hair tutorials on youtube that suggested using it.</li>
            <li>Mine came to me cracked the top had broken during shipment</li>
            <li>My husband loves this gel because its super hold and because it does not leave white residue, its the beat hel we have tried, and weve tried a few already..</li>
            <li>It really defines my hair and pairs well with other products without leaving a film.  </li>
            <li>My hair was crunchy the first couple of days but with daily lotion and JBCO, it was softer in a few days.</li>
            <li>I needed a new alternative and Wetline Extreme Gel is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband loves this gel because its super hold and because it does not leave white residue, its the beat hel we have tried, and weve tried a few already..</li>
            <li> Great curl definition when no other product worked on my combo 3C/4A hair. My hair was crunchy the first couple of days but with daily lotion and JBCO, it was softer in a few days.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair gels i had tried.</li>
            <li> I like the curl definition that I get from using this wet line gel which is great. I do wash n gos, so I like how my hair last for days! However, I don&#x27;t like how dry and hard my hair gets when after using the gel. My hair be crunchy and kind of stiff. Overall, it&#x27;s an ok gel!</li>
            <li> I like this gel better than Eco styler for curl definition</li>
            <li> I love this gel!!!!!!!!!!  It is the only one (and their dark version with the stronger hold) that smooths my coarse curly hair wonderfully.  I recommend using a light moisturizer spray on your hair (maybe African Pride - that&#x27;s what I do) to keep your tresses softer, healthier and moisturized).  I will forever by this gel... I love it!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my options open of where I purchase it for the best price. A major beauty chain sells it on line too.  It did come wrapped well and arrived quicker than the major beauty chain deliveries.</li>
            <li> This was the first gel i tried out, it dried my hair so bad, i used la looks sports gel instead and didn&#x27;t cause that effect at all. Natural curly hair, medium texture. Sometimes caused flaking too. The hold is very good though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Eco Styler Gel but since they gave decided to make all their gels 10s I needed a new alternative and Wetline Extreme Gel is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine, the hold and the fact it doesn&#x27;t have protein makes this an excellent product since I hate the crunch.  I&#x27;m using the maximum hold and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like a brick.  I tend to use this when I want to have my hair in a bun and slicking my edges down.  I haven&#x27;t used it for curl defining but how the defintion looked before making it a bun has a nice appearance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick curly frizzy hair. I have been looking for curling creme products to define and hold my curls for a good 3 days worth. I like to wash my hair every 3 days. I have used MANY curl defining cremes but none would give me the hold to tame my frizz and last me 3 days. I came upon the WET LINE XTREME GEL and read MANY great reviews on it! I used to use gel back in my days but tried to steer away from it to cremes, but cremes do not give me the look and hold my hair needs. So back to gel&#x27;s it is! THIS gel defined my curls nicely, gave me the xtra hold that I NEED and YES it lasts me a good 3 days before my hair wash day!&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair with great shine, hold and definition. Yes it can dry crunchy depending how much you use, but I easily scruch the crunch out by smoothing on some hair serum or olive oil. The texture of the gel is thick and smells like green apples..which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I also like to use a leave-in conditioner  and a smoothing creme for more moisture and frizz control before then the xtreme wetline gel as my styler. I let air dry or diffuse for more volume.&lt;br /&gt;I HOPE they NEVER discontinue this gel. It&#x27;s by far my #1 hair styling product and works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, has a great smell, holds your hair down.  It flakes if you use too much.</li>

I have previously posted my previous negative experiences with ecostyler gel causing me baldspots, due to my protien sensitivity, in my low porosity type 4 hair. While I was in search of products to use as a replacement, I ran across Wet line gel, which claimed to be alcohol free, and moisturizing. Many People recommened it as a protein free gel. After i still experienced continuous thinning and immediately quit the product. I was aware my hair hated proteins, due to the brittle crunchy feeling I got when I used them. But something wasn&#x27;t right. My hair was thinning and I wasn&#x27;t seeing hair coming out, just like with the Ecostyler gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it took me a very long time to notice what was in this product that was directly agitating what I assumed to be my protein sensitivity, since they marketed themselves as protein free and alcohol free. I had the gut feeling it was triethanolamine, which was proven to be an irritant, but was unable to find specific testimony, so I was more or less speculating maybe it had something to do with the alkaline ph at the time. But in the end it remained a mystery that closed the book on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recently looked at the chemical structure of triethanolamine and did some thorough research. I discovered a few shocking things about the ingredients in this product, and how they work together: triethanolamine and polyacrylate acid.  I will order my points from bad to worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WE ALREADY KNOW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;carcinogens-and-toxic-chemicals(DOT)blogspot(DOT)com/2012/11/triethanolamine-toxic-chemical-in(DOT)html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ewg(dot)org/skindeep/ingredient/706639/TRIETHANOLAMINE/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are told this is a moderate irritant, and has been shown to be a human skin toxin or allergent, and expected to cause non-reproductive organ toxicity, and STUDIES SHOW has been linked to cancer. These have all been brushed off as moderate concerns though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine is a surficant. Yes it is a water soluble surficant. So are proteins, and some watersoluable silicones. Proteins in gel act as water soluble surficants. Coconut oil is a water soluable surficant. They all still latch on to the hair and plasticize it, and in many cases work against moisture as they are not moisturizers, but plasticizing emollients and moisturizing agents that need to work in conjunction with water in order to be effective in hydration.  But you are still leaving this on your hair for a substantial amount of time, and depending on your hair type and sensitivities, Use Caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, look at the word, triETHANOLamine. Ethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethanol is a drying alcohol. If any of you are reporting dryness and brittleness, this is what is affecting you, it isn&#x27;t random.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Ethanolamine is an organic compound that is naturally found in coconut oil and is a primary amine and primary alcohol\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;EzineArticles(dot)com/6884068&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;As I explained last week in The 5 Most Common Mistakes Even Skin Experts Make, it is well-established that ethanol can reduce water content via a form of water loss known as transepidermal water loss (TEWL) (1), lipid content via extraction and dissolution (2), and protein content via denaturation (3). These properties allow for ethanol to be an effective (and drying) penetration enhancer.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Ethanol in itself isn&#x27;t harmful. It&#x27;s the DRYING effect that can lead to other problems.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;futurederm(dot)com/2012/04/19/is-ethanol-in-skin-care-products-safe/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STILL NOT CONVINCED??? Why is this ethanol actually drying? For an ethanol to be drying to the hair it must:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. extract and dissolute lipids. What are lipids? Fatty ACIDS. I will elaborate on why this is what this gel does later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2. be denatured. You may claim the ethanol in triethanolamine is not denatured. It comes from coconut, so it must not be denatured right? False. The fact that this is a clear gel means it was heated, and therefore denatured. These gels wouldn&#x27;t be this clear if they didn&#x27;t contain denatured alcohol. Below is a scientific study that shows the effect of denaturzation on the viscosity of protein systems. Note it also says some things about NaOH, which this product contains. No matter the amount of NaOH, it will always denature the protein systems in water based substances once heated. Once heated, that is when it forms a clear, gel consistency. This is where these products holding abilities and clear consistency come from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;europepmc(dot)org/articles/PMC2141169/pdf/341(dot)pdf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIRD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Triethanolamine is an aminoalcohol. Neutralize acids to form SALTS plus water in exothermic reactions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;chemicalbook(dot)com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB9852620(dot)htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The triethanolamine NEUTRALIZES fatty acids, adjusts and buffers the pH, and SOLUBILISES oils and other ingredients that are not completely soluble in water. Some common products in which triethanolamine is found are liquid laundry detergents, dishwashing liquids, general cleaners, hand cleaners, polishes, metalworking fluids, paints, shaving cream and printing inks\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;TEA is a fairly strong base: a 1% solution has a pH of approximately 10\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;en(dot)wikipedia(dot)org/wiki/Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;phs 10-14. depilatory. swell hairs as much as 10 times the original size; may dissolve hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;images116(dot)fotki(dot)com/v715/photos/9/3265899/12913134/dissolveproof-vi(dot)jpg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because TEA is the 3rd ingredient in this gel and has a ph of 10, Polyacrylate acid was used to balance the ph and neutralize TEA, and TEA make Polyacrylate acid water soluble. Unfortunately the combination of the two forms a drying effect on the hair-- it turns into SALT, aka Sodium Hydroxide, aka NaOH which is also water soluble, btw.&lt;br /&gt;answers(dot)yahoo(dot)com/question/index?qid&#x3D;20080324143837AAcJ1Im&lt;br /&gt;this source is reliable despite being on yahoo answers, as it was answered by a top contributor in the chemistry section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also the main dissolving agent in lye relaxers. Lye&#x3D; NaOH&#x3D; Salt&#x3D;Sodium Hydroxide. Ethanolamine is also a form of ammonia.&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Triethanolamine is produced from the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;en(dot)wikipedia(dot)org/wiki/Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alcohol does have a natural resistance to turning into salt and ammonia, however. BUT ONLY when oil is added to the formulation as a base. It needs to be oil based. Gel is water based, including this one. Salt is already drying, let alone putting the main ingredient used in relaxers in your product.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It is ethanolamine&#x27;s primary alcohol characteristic that makes it possible to be suspended in a soy Oil base as neither sodium carbonate (a primary salt) or ammonia (a primary base) will dilute with oil.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;EzineArticles(dot)com/6884068&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION. Very drying and in 3rd ingredient. The ingredient right after it, polyacrylate acid, meant to make up for the fact TEA had a depilatory ph of 10 that dissolves hair, formsa SALT compound called NaOH, aka lye or sodium hydroxide, commonly used as an agent to break bonds in the protein of the hair in hair relaxers. There are also many proven reports that TEA is an irritant, and has been linked to cancer. Hmmm.. Just like lye relaxers. This is the case with ALL acids. This is just how triETHANOLamine reacts with acid. AND YOU CAN&#x27;T PUT tEa in a hair product, with out adding some form of acidic compound to bring the ph down to a non-depilatory level.&lt;br /&gt;LET ME REPEAT THIS IN THE MOST SUMMED UP BLATANT WAY POSSIBLE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. LYE relaxers, which active ingredient is SODIUM HYDROXIDE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Relaxers have been linked to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. THIS water based gel has ingredients, TRIETHANOLAMINE and POLYACRYLATE ACID which together, (unless formulated in an oil base, which this gel \\&quot;WETLINE\\&quot; is NOT, it&#x27;s a water based gel, the first ingredient is water) form the exact same compound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. This gel has ingredients that forms a compound--&gt; Sodium Hydroxide, Lye, NaOH, SALT. Whatever you want to call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Studies about Triethanolamine, already show \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; cancer link. Where is the cancer link coming from? Sodium Hydroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the top 5 ingredients contain tea, which means it is the top 5 most active ingredients in the gel formulation, whether the sodium hydroxide is at 5% concentration or not. The dilution in water is the exact reason the compound is formed. Compare to low lye relaxers, which still break bonds of hair diluted Sodium Hydroxide to 2.5%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;A Low Lye RELAXER has the LOWEST CONCENTRATION of sodium hydroxide which is less than 2.5%. It is EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE as other Sodium Hydroxide relaxers however much more mild due to the percentage of active ingredient. The low lye relaxer gently loosens the bonds for increased manageability, while maintaining some level of texture in the hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;designessentials(dot)com/professional/science-of-hair/types-of-relaxers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pretty much proves it. Note there is a review on here where someone gave ECOSTYLER GEL 1 star saying it makes their hair act like a relaxer, a few years ago. Everyone thumbed them down, but in  the end they were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product markets itself as being alcohol free, when it isn&#x27;t. Moisturizing, when it isn&#x27;t. Many people also claim this is a \\&quot;Protein Free\\&quot; styling gel. For you protein sensitive&#x60;s, It has panthenol, which absorbs into the hair cortex similar to ethanol and plasticizes it, leaving a gummy waxy build up after awhile that causes dryness similar to protein and coconut oil can. Hope I helped you guys. NONE of you are crazy. and now you know which ingredient to avoid. i now use kinky curly curling custard. NO TEA, No Protein, NO BALD SPOTS EVER AGAIN.ishes, metalworking fluids, paints, shaving cream and printing inks\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;TEA is a fairly strong base: a 1% solution has a pH of approximately 10\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;en(dot)wikipedia(dot)org/wiki/Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;phs 10-14. depilatory. swell hairs as much as 10 times the original size; may dissolve hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;images116(dot)fotki(dot)com/v715/photos/9/3265899/12913134/dissolveproof-vi(dot)jpg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because TEA is the 3rd ingredient in this gel and has a ph of 10, Polyacrylate acid was used to balance the ph and neutralize TEA, and TEA make Polyacrylate acid water soluble. Unfortunately the combination of the two forms a drying effect on the hair-- it turns into SALT, aka Sodium Hydroxide, aka NaOH which is also water soluble, btw.&lt;br /&gt;answers(dot)yahoo(dot)com/question/index?qid&#x3D;20080324143837AAcJ1Im&lt;br /&gt;this source is reliable despite being on yahoo answers, as it was answered by a top contributor in the chemistry section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also the main dissolving agent in lye relaxers. Lye&#x3D; NaOH&#x3D; Salt&#x3D;Sodium Hydroxide. Ethanolamine is also a form of ammonia.&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Triethanolamine is produced from the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;en(dot)wikipedia(dot)org/wiki/Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alcohol does have a natural resistance to turning into salt and ammonia, however. BUT ONLY when oil is added to the formulation as a base. It needs to be oil based. Gel is water based, including this one. Salt is already drying, let alone putting the main ingredient used in relaxers in your product.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It is ethanolamine&#x27;s primary alcohol characteristic that makes it possible to be suspended in a soy Oil base as neither sodium carbonate (a primary salt) or ammonia (a primary base) will dilute with oil.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;EzineArticles(dot)com/6884068&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION. Very drying and in 3rd ingredient. The ingredient right after it, polyacrylate acid, meant to make up for the fact TEA had a depilatory ph of 10 that dissolves hair, formsa SALT compound called NaOH, aka lye or sodium hydroxide, commonly used as an agent to break bonds in the protein of the hair in hair relaxers. There are also many proven reports that TEA is an irritant, and has been linked to cancer. Hmmm.. Just like lye relaxers. This is the case with ALL acids. This is just how triETHANOLamine reacts with acid. AND YOU CAN&#x27;T PUT tEa in a hair product, with out adding some form of acidic compound to bring the ph down to a non-depilatory level.&lt;br /&gt;LET ME REPEAT THIS IN THE MOST SUMMED UP BLATANT WAY POSSIBLE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. LYE relaxers, which active ingredient is SODIUM HYDROXIDE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Relaxers have been linked to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. THIS water based gel has ingredients, TRIETHANOLAMINE and POLYACRYLATE ACID which together, (unless formulated in an oil base, which this gel \\&quot;WETLINE\\&quot; is NOT, it&#x27;s a water based gel, the first ingredient is water) form the exact same compound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. This gel has ingredients that forms a compound--&gt; Sodium Hydroxide, Lye, NaOH, SALT. Whatever you want to call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Studies about Triethanolamine, already show \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; cancer link. Where is the cancer link coming from? Sodium Hydroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the top 5 ingredients contain tea, which means it is the top 5 most active ingredients in the gel formulation, whether the sodium hydroxide is at 5% concentration or not. The dilution in water is the exact reason the compound is formed. Compare to low lye relaxers, which still break bonds of hair diluted Sodium Hydroxide to 2.5%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;A Low Lye RELAXER has the LOWEST CONCENTRATION of sodium hydroxide which is less than 2.5%. It is EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE as other Sodium Hydroxide relaxers however much more mild due to the percentage of active ingredient. The low lye relaxer gently loosens the bonds for increased manageability, while maintaining some level of texture in the hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;designessentials(dot)com/professional/science-of-hair/types-of-relaxers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pretty much proves it. Note there is a review on here where someone gave ECOSTYLER GEL 1 star saying it makes their hair act like a relaxer, a few years ago. Everyone thumbed them down, but in  the end they were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product markets itself as being alcohol free, when it isn&#x27;t. Moisturizing, when it isn&#x27;t. Many people also claim this is a \\&quot;Protein Free\\&quot; styling gel. For you protein sensitive&#x60;s, It has panthenol, which absorbs into the hair cortex similar to ethanol and plasticizes it, leaving a gummy waxy build up after awhile that causes dryness similar to protein and coconut oil can. Hope I helped you guys. NONE of you are crazy. and now you know which ingredient to avoid. i now use kinky curly curling custard. NO TEA, No Protein, NO BALD SPOTS EVER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Purchased on a whim with low expectations but i&#x27;m glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;I have 3c/4a hair for reference.&lt;br /&gt;This gel has great hold and leaves my hair soft to the touch, opposed to the usual hard cast that gels are known for.&lt;br /&gt;I also love how easily it&#x27;s washed out, a few mins of conditioning generally does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of scent, it smells like generic soap, which i can&#x27;t say i&#x27;m crazy about but it&#x27;s acceptable considering that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> Like how it makes my hair look shiny when dry.</li>
            <li> Great styling gel with holding power.</li>
            <li> I love this brand! Doesn&#x27;t flake like other gels. Doesn&#x27;t smell and has a very strong hold.</li>
            <li> very excellent product!! highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Incredible holding power, lasts all day and comes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my everyday gel before moving to the states. It&#x27;s near impossible to find here.Thank you amazon!!!</li>
            <li> It works. It really does. I use it to style my daughter and my hair to slick it down. Your hair is there in place until you wash it..Fantastic!!! Would recommend this gel to anyone who wants a protein free gel that keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really defines my hair and pairs well with other products without leaving a film.  My only problem is that is does leave the hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> The gel had a good hold but it left my hair very dry and I only used a little bit.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after looking at videos on Youtube. This gel worked like they said, but you just have to be careful not to use too much or your hair will get very stiff. First after washing and conditioning my hair, I use an oil-based gel, then applied eco styler gel, then add a little bit, about a nickle size amount of the Wet Line Xtreme Professional Styling Gel, and that kept it from getting stiff and hard. I really do like this gel and because I do not use too much of it it will last longer. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this gel!!! Works well on my natural hair. Mine came to me cracked the top had broken during shipment but the company sent me a small one to replace what was lost. I will be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> You get a ton of gel for a low price and it works sooo well! It is a thicker gel and does a great job holding my 3C curls in place.</li>
            <li> Feels heavy on my hair</li>
            <li> Do all that it said it would do</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about extreme. Its great on natural hair. slicks your hair back nicely. You can mix it with activator gel so you can&#x27;t get the white residue when it dries on your hair</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying the Xtreme styling gel.  I have shoulder length type 4 hair with lots of fairly tight coils.  I saw several natural hair tutorials on youtube that suggested using it. I&#x27;m pretty good with doing wash and go hairstyles using my own homemade flaxseed gel (which has a  soft hold), but I was looking for something that would hold and define my curls a little stronger.  This was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to my wet hair immediately after washing it and applying leave-in conditioner. I smoothed gel over each curl. Then I partially air dried and partially dried with a diffuser on low.  This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever seen my curls so defined. The curls stayed even after sleeping on them for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people wrote that their hair was very dry with this. I didn&#x27;t notice dryness. However, I did deep condition before I used it and I also used it with a leave-in conditioner. (I use watered down Tresemme naturals.)  I also didn&#x27;t notice any flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I washed, I found my hair really easy to detangle after it was wet.  I think that it&#x27;s because the ends of my hair had been controlled and didn&#x27;t have a chance to tangle too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It takes quite a bit longer to dry than flaxseed gel.&lt;br /&gt;- When it dries, the gel feels a little crunchy, but just squeezing my dry hair got rid of the crunch. (Using less gel might help to reduce the crunch too.)&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a bit expensive on Amazon. I think there are places where you can buy it cheaper, I just haven&#x27;t found it near me yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Curls stayed defined for days. I&#x27;m on day 3 right now and they still look pretty much the same as day 1. (I do sleep in a satin cap.)&lt;br /&gt;- No drying alcohols&lt;br /&gt;- The scent is very light.</li>
            <li> Favorite gel so far for a budget, I have thick straight hair too</li>
            <li> I love this gel it doesn&#x27;t make my hair come out and it defines my curls better than any there gel</li>
            <li> Good product.  I use it all the time.  I might have to buy more when i run out because i use a lot...</li>
