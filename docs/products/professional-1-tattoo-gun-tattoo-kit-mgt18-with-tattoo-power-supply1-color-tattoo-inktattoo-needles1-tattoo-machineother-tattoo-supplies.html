            <li>I love this item</li>
            <li>It is a good starter kit, but over heats with bigger tattoos, power box shorted out but they mailed me a nee one with no problems, very nice people, i would recomend this kit</li>
            <li>A warning to first time tattooer&#x27;s this machine comes with no directions of any kind so you will need to figure out how to set it up on your own.</li>
            <li>everythinv else is fine as well</li>
            <li>it is smooth</li>
            <li>Also please for my own sake don&#x27;t use the tattoo ink that comes with the machine on yourself it is perfect for praticeing (on fake skin or fruit)</li>
            <li>so far I highly prefer to have my own kit because of prices of tattoos .</li>

            <li>The reason I gave three is if u r going to buy this spit the extra money out to but a diff foot switch mine does not work its not a bad kit for price but foot switch</li>
            <li>This kit is good but they sent me orange ink instead of black kinda hard to tattoo with just orange ink</li>

            <li> it is okay for a starter kit.</li>
            <li> The power supply went out on me and never worked again.</li>
            <li> Its not bad for the price the foot peddle is a lil weak u can&#x27;t b rough with it but the gun works great n everythinv else is fine as well</li>
            <li> It was great....  thankz</li>
            <li> I really like my gun. Run 2 tattoos it is smooth will order another one</li>
            <li> machine is fine but the ink sucks had no problem other than the ink sucks terribly just doesnt mix well with skin I guess am going to try and find some better ink maybe</li>
            <li> This kit is good but they sent me orange ink instead of black kinda hard to tattoo with just orange ink</li>
            <li> It is a good starter kit, but over heats with bigger tattoos, power box shorted out but they mailed me a nee one with no problems, very nice people, i would recomend this kit</li>
            <li> i recieved my machine today it arived on time and had everything in it it all works great but the coil looked burnt when i got it but after cleaning it it all worked fantastic awsome for beginer artist it could use a book of how to set up</li>
            <li> The reason I gave three is if u r going to buy this spit the extra money out to but a diff foot switch mine does not work its not a bad kit for price but foot switch sucks</li>
            <li> The machine came within 4 days of me buying it. But the foot petal is very small and over heats very easyily. A warning to first time tattooer&#x27;s this machine comes with no directions of any kind so you will need to figure out how to set it up on your own. Also please for my own sake don&#x27;t use the tattoo ink that comes with the machine on yourself it is perfect for praticeing (on fake skin or fruit) but i&#x27;ve never heard of the brand and something tells me it&#x27;s bad ink. Other wise it&#x27;s a perfect machine for beginners.</li>
            <li> Its doing good so far I highly prefer to have my own kit because of prices of tattoos . I love this item</li>
            <li> Does what is intended.</li>
            <li> When i got this it had a few problems. Including screws being stripped and i was not able to use it.</li>
            <li> excellent just got it and is nice five star well packaged also</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to function out of the box. Good price for the contents though.</li>
