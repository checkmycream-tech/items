            <li>Have fpound that this enable a good clean Shave</li>
            <li>Perfect fit; shaver is like new!</li>
            <li>and my shave was very smooth.</li>
            <li>The screen and cutters was a good fit and worked fine.</li>
            <li>This was very pricey but works great.</li>
            <li>OK price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this, but be sure of the correct numbers, etc.</li>
            <li>Love Remington shaving products.</li>
            <li>I bought a bunch of them, since I&#x27;ll need them anyway, to spread the shipping costs across many units.</li>
            <li>So I end up buy 3 more.</li>
            <li>razor and screen are fantastic!</li>
            <li>This was more hassle and took more effort</li>
            <li>I LOVE them both</li>
            <li>Who would have thought replacing these things was important!</li>
            <li>I was thinking ok 2 days .</li>
            <li>The replacements will more than triple the life of the razor.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with this item, shipping was prompt also</li>
            <li>The order was right and everyone did a great job getting the merchandize filled and delivered.  </li>
            <li>These replacement parts are as good in quality, fit &amp; function as the original screens &amp; cutters that came with the shaver.  </li>
            <li>The new screen and cutters work great</li>
            <li>The SP-282 is sized better for a smoother more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Very happy with such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I had hoped the replacements would give a more comfortable shave than the originals,</li>
            <li>Great replacement for my old razor screens and blades.  </li>
            <li>good quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li>they feel better than the original ones.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy selection on web look-up, rapid arrival.</li>
            <li>The order arrived on time and the product is fine</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>EVERY THING IS WORKING FINE</li>
            <li>The shipping and packing was fine, no problem.</li>
            <li>But, if you want a smooth shave, without irritated skin, I strongly suggest you remove the Intercept Cutter.</li>
            <li>I just prefer Remington shavers, guess I&#x27;m brand loyal!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it worked fine and fit fine.</li>
            <li>Fit the razor just fine.</li>
            <li>They worked great and left him with a smooth face.</li>
            <li>Now his skin is smooth and comfortable again.</li>
            <li>It came on time, it fit, it worked, and when they wear out I will do this again.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and care for.</li>
            <li>Fit and work well.</li>
            <li>They fit my razor.</li>
            <li>The Intercept cutter was confirmed as the source of irritation..</li>
            <li>while option two will close the &#x27;hole&#x27; and prevent any dust from falling out, the clicking sound of the now non-spring loaded Intercept Cutter was a noise I didn&#x27;t need to listen to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fit the razor as specified</li>
            <li>They have to be ordered with the heads and the old heads are still good when the screens wear out</li>
            <li>I then compared the SPF-300 Intercept Cutter with my old shaver, an M2830 - a really good shaver.</li>
            <li>Exactly the right product fit I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>but the screens wear out fast!!!</li>
            <li>I like the shaver parts because they fit like the original.</li>
            <li>They fit just like the original equipment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe that&#x27;s sentimental, but I get a nice shave and am reminded of a great man.</li>
            <li>Bought this original replacements for readiness.</li>
            <li>The original blades lasted 18 months.  </li>
            <li>It fits the specified shavers and works just like the original ones.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery , and product was as detailed .</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to others who want to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Hard to find in stores, and it is great to have our shaver working again!</li>
            <li>these are really cool.  </li>
            <li>It cuts OK, just very noisy.</li>
            <li>If it was good enough for gramps for all of his life, it&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li>The replacement screen and cutter for my Remingto F5 (4900) came quickly and worked well for one shave</li>
            <li>Bring back the SP-282 size AND configuration on a &amp;#34;Pivot and Flex&amp;#34; shaver and you will have a potential &#x27;best buy&#x27; electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the part and especially my Remington shavers.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; cutters do not cut any better than the old ones!</li>
            <li>They are an exact match and original equipment.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few months now, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>If you own the Remington shaver, you need to keep a spare as the screens are fragile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and effective so if you like the razor</li>
            <li>Handily, the screens are already mounted on a duplicate shaving head, so all you have to do is twist and remove the blades, press on the new ones, and put on the new head with screens.</li>
            <li>The shaver head on the original razor was much quieter.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to find the right replacement foil/cutting block.</li>
            <li>this was priced right and delivered to my door within two days</li>
            <li>The price is right and the shipping prompt.</li>
            <li>Comes right to the door.</li>
            <li>The other end came apart more easily.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband needed for his shaver.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find a replacement at any local retail outlet.</li>
            <li>Took awhile to arrive but consistent with seller disclosure.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Finally, I was able to locate these replacement parts for my Remington F5 Interceptor (F-5800).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This is my first replacement for my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>This is the exact product recommended by Remington.</li>
            <li>He gave me my first shave with a Remington micro screen shaver.</li>
            <li>They do exactly their job</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wish I had just purchased a whole new razor for a little more.  </li>
            <li>I had been pleased with the razor&#x27;s performance, but as with any foil razor, drop it a few too many times and you will need a new foil, at the risk of otherwise scratching the hell out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to install in razor, shaves clean and smooth but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>With the SPF-300 replacement heads you get a shave comparable to that of a new shaver fresh out the box.</li>
            <li>but the Foil is so very fragile that it is easy to break and before you know it cuts all over.  </li>
            <li>Yes, because the whole assembly is included in the kit, it was a very easy install and the product functions extremely well.</li>
            <li>Work fine, should last longer.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>All I really needed was the screen for my shaver...</li>
            <li>then my shaver became very noisey and sounded as if the blades were rubbing against the screen.  </li>
            <li>Fast Ship  </li>
            <li>Also, the intercept cutter on the SPF-300 was much wider than on the SP-282.</li>
            <li>Very affordable for a closer shave and to extend the life of your razor.</li>
            <li>Also, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This set is very noisy.</li>
            <li>I now receive a very close and convienant shave whenever and wherever I want.</li>
            <li>Have not used it to much yet</li>
            <li>Men shavers who have this Remington model know the replacement part needs to be attached as a WHOLE unit.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Works very go no complaint........</li>
            <li>This is the first replacement since I purchased this shaver, and the black was touted as being better.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this razor better than any other brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I put on the new foils and blades, and it really was like a whole new razor...</li>
            <li>While the product works (I get a decent shave)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 and never thought I&#x27;d be able to get a close shave other than the old fashion way, but this Remington does.</li>
            <li>not that it wasn&#x27;t still doing well after almost a year, but the new &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; really made it work like it was new again.  </li>
            <li>I replaced old blades and this set was very shape</li>
            <li>They both shave great and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type.</li>
            <li>For a few dollars more, I could have&lt;br /&gt;bought</li>
            <li>you are &#x27;handy&#x27; and can use a small screwdriver, I suggest you experiment on an old assembly first and then on your current foil head.</li>
            <li>Specifically, the SPF-300 didn&#x27;t press down as easily as the SP-280.</li>
            <li>Cant beat that new blade shave feeling.  </li>
            <li>Makes razor like new.</li>
            <li>and I had to spend $50 to get a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to shave with my new product.</li>
            <li>The new cutters are giving me a shave that is like new again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have just bought a new shaver in a time pinch because the replacement kit costs about as much as a completely new shaver.  </li>
            <li>another new one.</li>
            <li>At any rate the new replacement fits my shaver by just snapping in a new assembly, and not having to disassemble the foils from the plastic head.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Gouging&amp;#34; taken to a new level.</li>
            <li>Complete 3 piece assembly to get your shaver working like brand new again!  </li>
            <li>With daily shaves, frequent shaver cleanings, I received a year&#x27;s worth of use before changing.</li>
            <li>I replaced my existing Remington F5-5800 with exactly the same new model &amp; then purahased this screen cutters to hold my existing razor as a spare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given him Braun and other more expensive shavers and this is his favorite!</li>
            <li>Due to the many and varied types razors, replacement heads/screens, I recommend Amazon for acquisition of such needs.</li>
            <li>snaps into place and works well--never had problem with screen like with others--need to find just the cutters, old screen like new</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and expected product in box</li>
            <li>Love this one order them all the time because it&#x27;s so hard to find them in the store.</li>
            <li>I bought a replacement for my year old foil and cutters.</li>
            <li>I used my OLD foil assembly as a test</li>
            <li>These replacement screen and blades probably won&#x27;t last much longer.</li>
            <li>Working well; so far, no nicks.  </li>
            <li>My old screens had started getting holes in them and scratching my face.  </li>
            <li>They are a direct replacement for the old F5800 shaver blades.</li>
            <li>to Remington: the SPF-300 vs. the SP282 1) has the foils too far apart, 2) has springs that are too stiff for the Intercept cutter, 3) cannot stretch and keep skin smooth because the distance between foils is too far apart.</li>
            <li>parts are a direct replacement, installing brought shaver back up to usefulness (one original screen had cracked, other was worn).</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find them at my local Wal-Mart so bought them on Amazon for a decent price.</li>
            <li>had really waited too long to replace the old ones.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, but was not the black screen as pictured.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to receive new blades as well at no extra price</li>
            <li>It would have been much easier to do that but felt a little guilty putting a good shaver in the landfill and getting new.  </li>
            <li>Now that I knew it could be done without damaging the foil assembly, I repeated the same for my new SPF-300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these screens and cutters for the last 2-3 years and with each new set they are getting duller and duller.</li>
            <li>The shaver work very well, have not open the extra screens yet.</li>
            <li>The only part I didn&#x27;t like was the price but other than that it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Will order less now from Amazon because the sales tax issue makes them less competitive on much more items</li>
            <li>Delivery time was good as usual but too bad those Remington shaving screens don&#x27;t last more than 4 or 5 months</li>
            <li>Was all I  expected and works very well.</li>
            <li>The center of the screen pops up on one side causing the shaver to be very noisy and inefficient.</li>
            <li>Worth the price,  even though not cheap.</li>
            <li>The screens &amp; cutters arrived via Amazon&#x27;s usual quick delivery process.  </li>
            <li>but I got the right ones and he was so estatic because it was not  easy finding them in any store.</li>
            <li>The price is a little higher than what I think it should be, but,  what can you do.....</li>
            <li>but the rotary does a little better job on my heavy beard (STRICTLY PERSONAL PREFERENCE).</li>

            <li> Still the good shave overrides the problem</li>
            <li> Never as good as those that come with the razor at purchase.</li>

            <li> Just what I needed and the price was good</li>
            <li> good product at a god price</li>

            <li> IT IS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE SHAVER I OWN.</li>
            <li> HONEST ABE</li>

            <li> Thanks amazon for the incredible service.</li>
            <li> I had another Remington razor that I liked better than this one, but maybe I was just spoiled by that one.</li>
            <li> This was the exact fit and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to swap heads and cutters!</li>
            <li> Have fpound that this enable a good clean Shave</li>
            <li> Perfect fit; shaver is like new!</li>
            <li> and my shave was very smooth.</li>
            <li> The screen and cutters was a good fit and worked fine.</li>
            <li> This was very pricey but works great.</li>
            <li> OK price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this, but be sure of the correct numbers, etc.</li>
            <li> Love Remington shaving products.</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of them, since I&#x27;ll need them anyway, to spread the shipping costs across many units.</li>
            <li> So I end up buy 3 more.</li>
            <li> razor and screen are fantastic!</li>
            <li> This was more hassle and took more effort</li>
            <li> I LOVE them both</li>
            <li> Who would have thought replacing these things was important!</li>
            <li> I was thinking ok 2 days .</li>
            <li> The replacements will more than triple the life of the razor.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this item, shipping was prompt also</li>
            <li> The order was right and everyone did a great job getting the merchandize filled and delivered.  </li>
            <li> These replacement parts are as good in quality, fit &amp; function as the original screens &amp; cutters that came with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> The new screen and cutters work great</li>
            <li> The SP-282 is sized better for a smoother more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Very happy with such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I had hoped the replacements would give a more comfortable shave than the originals,</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my old razor screens and blades.  </li>
            <li> good quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li> they feel better than the original ones.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy selection on web look-up, rapid arrival.</li>
            <li> The order arrived on time and the product is fine</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> EVERY THING IS WORKING FINE</li>
            <li> The shipping and packing was fine, no problem.</li>
            <li> But, if you want a smooth shave, without irritated skin, I strongly suggest you remove the Intercept Cutter.</li>
            <li> I just prefer Remington shavers, guess I&#x27;m brand loyal!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, it worked fine and fit fine.</li>
            <li> Fit the razor just fine.</li>
            <li> They worked great and left him with a smooth face.</li>
            <li> Now his skin is smooth and comfortable again.</li>
            <li> It came on time, it fit, it worked, and when they wear out I will do this again.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and care for.</li>
            <li> Fit and work well.</li>
            <li> They fit my razor.</li>
            <li> The Intercept cutter was confirmed as the source of irritation..</li>
            <li> while option two will close the &#x27;hole&#x27; and prevent any dust from falling out, the clicking sound of the now non-spring loaded Intercept Cutter was a noise I didn&#x27;t need to listen to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fit the razor as specified</li>
            <li> They have to be ordered with the heads and the old heads are still good when the screens wear out</li>
            <li> I then compared the SPF-300 Intercept Cutter with my old shaver, an M2830 - a really good shaver.</li>
            <li> Exactly the right product fit I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> but the screens wear out fast!!!</li>
            <li> I like the shaver parts because they fit like the original.</li>
            <li> They fit just like the original equipment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe that&#x27;s sentimental, but I get a nice shave and am reminded of a great man.</li>
            <li> Bought this original replacements for readiness.</li>
            <li> The original blades lasted 18 months.  </li>
            <li> It fits the specified shavers and works just like the original ones.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery , and product was as detailed .</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to others who want to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, and it is great to have our shaver working again!</li>
            <li> these are really cool.  </li>
            <li> It cuts OK, just very noisy.</li>
            <li> If it was good enough for gramps for all of his life, it&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li> The replacement screen and cutter for my Remingto F5 (4900) came quickly and worked well for one shave</li>
            <li> Bring back the SP-282 size AND configuration on a &amp;#34;Pivot and Flex&amp;#34; shaver and you will have a potential &#x27;best buy&#x27; electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the part and especially my Remington shavers.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; cutters do not cut any better than the old ones!</li>
            <li> They are an exact match and original equipment.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> If you own the Remington shaver, you need to keep a spare as the screens are fragile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and effective so if you like the razor</li>
            <li> Handily, the screens are already mounted on a duplicate shaving head, so all you have to do is twist and remove the blades, press on the new ones, and put on the new head with screens.</li>
            <li> The shaver head on the original razor was much quieter.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to find the right replacement foil/cutting block.</li>
            <li> this was priced right and delivered to my door within two days</li>
            <li> The price is right and the shipping prompt.</li>
            <li> Comes right to the door.</li>
            <li> The other end came apart more easily.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed for his shaver.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find a replacement at any local retail outlet.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to arrive but consistent with seller disclosure.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Finally, I was able to locate these replacement parts for my Remington F5 Interceptor (F-5800).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This is my first replacement for my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the exact product recommended by Remington.</li>
            <li> He gave me my first shave with a Remington micro screen shaver.</li>
            <li> They do exactly their job</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wish I had just purchased a whole new razor for a little more.  </li>
            <li> I had been pleased with the razor&#x27;s performance, but as with any foil razor, drop it a few too many times and you will need a new foil, at the risk of otherwise scratching the hell out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to install in razor, shaves clean and smooth but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> With the SPF-300 replacement heads you get a shave comparable to that of a new shaver fresh out the box.</li>
            <li> but the Foil is so very fragile that it is easy to break and before you know it cuts all over.  </li>
            <li> Yes, because the whole assembly is included in the kit, it was a very easy install and the product functions extremely well.</li>
            <li> Work fine, should last longer.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> All I really needed was the screen for my shaver...</li>
            <li> then my shaver became very noisey and sounded as if the blades were rubbing against the screen.  </li>
            <li> Fast Ship  </li>
            <li> Also, the intercept cutter on the SPF-300 was much wider than on the SP-282.</li>
            <li> Very affordable for a closer shave and to extend the life of your razor.</li>
            <li> Also, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This set is very noisy.</li>
            <li> I now receive a very close and convienant shave whenever and wherever I want.</li>
            <li> Have not used it to much yet</li>
            <li> Men shavers who have this Remington model know the replacement part needs to be attached as a WHOLE unit.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Works very go no complaint........</li>
            <li> This is the first replacement since I purchased this shaver, and the black was touted as being better.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this razor better than any other brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I put on the new foils and blades, and it really was like a whole new razor...</li>
            <li> While the product works (I get a decent shave)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 and never thought I&#x27;d be able to get a close shave other than the old fashion way, but this Remington does.</li>
            <li> not that it wasn&#x27;t still doing well after almost a year, but the new &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; really made it work like it was new again.  </li>
            <li> I replaced old blades and this set was very shape</li>
            <li> They both shave great and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type.</li>
            <li> For a few dollars more, I could have&lt;br /&gt;bought</li>
            <li> you are &#x27;handy&#x27; and can use a small screwdriver, I suggest you experiment on an old assembly first and then on your current foil head.</li>
            <li> Specifically, the SPF-300 didn&#x27;t press down as easily as the SP-280.</li>
            <li> Cant beat that new blade shave feeling.  </li>
            <li> Makes razor like new.</li>
            <li> and I had to spend $50 to get a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to shave with my new product.</li>
            <li> The new cutters are giving me a shave that is like new again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have just bought a new shaver in a time pinch because the replacement kit costs about as much as a completely new shaver.  </li>
            <li> another new one.</li>
            <li> At any rate the new replacement fits my shaver by just snapping in a new assembly, and not having to disassemble the foils from the plastic head.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Gouging&amp;#34; taken to a new level.</li>
            <li> Complete 3 piece assembly to get your shaver working like brand new again!  </li>
            <li> With daily shaves, frequent shaver cleanings, I received a year&#x27;s worth of use before changing.</li>
            <li> I replaced my existing Remington F5-5800 with exactly the same new model &amp; then purahased this screen cutters to hold my existing razor as a spare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given him Braun and other more expensive shavers and this is his favorite!</li>
            <li> Due to the many and varied types razors, replacement heads/screens, I recommend Amazon for acquisition of such needs.</li>
            <li> snaps into place and works well--never had problem with screen like with others--need to find just the cutters, old screen like new</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and expected product in box</li>
            <li> Love this one order them all the time because it&#x27;s so hard to find them in the store.</li>
            <li> I bought a replacement for my year old foil and cutters.</li>
            <li> I used my OLD foil assembly as a test</li>
            <li> These replacement screen and blades probably won&#x27;t last much longer.</li>
            <li> Working well; so far, no nicks.  </li>
            <li> My old screens had started getting holes in them and scratching my face.  </li>
            <li> They are a direct replacement for the old F5800 shaver blades.</li>
            <li> to Remington: the SPF-300 vs. the SP282 1) has the foils too far apart, 2) has springs that are too stiff for the Intercept cutter, 3) cannot stretch and keep skin smooth because the distance between foils is too far apart.</li>
            <li> parts are a direct replacement, installing brought shaver back up to usefulness (one original screen had cracked, other was worn).</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find them at my local Wal-Mart so bought them on Amazon for a decent price.</li>
            <li> had really waited too long to replace the old ones.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, but was not the black screen as pictured.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to receive new blades as well at no extra price</li>
            <li> It would have been much easier to do that but felt a little guilty putting a good shaver in the landfill and getting new.  </li>
            <li> Now that I knew it could be done without damaging the foil assembly, I repeated the same for my new SPF-300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these screens and cutters for the last 2-3 years and with each new set they are getting duller and duller.</li>
            <li> The shaver work very well, have not open the extra screens yet.</li>
            <li> The only part I didn&#x27;t like was the price but other than that it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Will order less now from Amazon because the sales tax issue makes them less competitive on much more items</li>
            <li> Delivery time was good as usual but too bad those Remington shaving screens don&#x27;t last more than 4 or 5 months</li>
            <li> Was all I  expected and works very well.</li>
            <li> The center of the screen pops up on one side causing the shaver to be very noisy and inefficient.</li>
            <li> Worth the price,  even though not cheap.</li>
            <li> The screens &amp; cutters arrived via Amazon&#x27;s usual quick delivery process.  </li>
            <li> but I got the right ones and he was so estatic because it was not  easy finding them in any store.</li>
            <li> The price is a little higher than what I think it should be, but,  what can you do.....</li>
            <li> but the rotary does a little better job on my heavy beard (STRICTLY PERSONAL PREFERENCE).</li>
            <li> Looked the part up here on Amazon and the cost with shipping is less than $10.00 of buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> THE HEADS FOR THE REMINGTON LAST QUITE A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> It was broken when i took it out of the packaging i had to take the foil screens out and place them on thr older razor head.one of the new foil screens already ripped.</li>
            <li> I got weary of replacing the whole razor each time it got dull.</li>
            <li> I missed the expected ship date of 10  to 14 days later .</li>
            <li> not  a very good cutting set or Remington is not so good</li>
            <li> Be careful not to loose the tiny springs at each end.</li>
            <li> the noise is disturbing and not at all like the original blades and screen.  </li>
            <li> but I thought every little bit would help and already have two other rotary triple blade razors that also need heads but have the old ni-cad batteries and do not hold a charge that long.  </li>
            <li> The item has also continued to work well after various uses during the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> I suspect they were reconditioned and not new.</li>
            <li> The original black screen did not last as long as my previous shaver foil screens, and scratched my face worse than ever when a tear appeared in it, this may be why they seemingly did away with the black.</li>
            <li> An additional liability with the Remington 300 system is that somewhere around the fourth week, the screens become fragile, and a small hole develops.  </li>
            <li> This unit has all the parts needed to refurbish the cutter including the center cutter bar .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these a few times and keep coming back!</li>
            <li> Performed as expected.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to write about for the spare screens and cutters I purchased because I&#x27;ve had no need yet to use them.</li>
            <li> A shame they couldn&#x27;t just sell the foils by themselves for less, but at least it was cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li> The edges of the exposed screen are nearly as sharp as a razor blade.  </li>
            <li> Part  of  it  was  broke , I  use  part  from  my  other  to make it work .  </li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard and use it daily</li>
            <li> Now I can enjoy using my razor again without the nicks caused by a bad screen.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any of the black screens in being sold anywhere.</li>
            <li> From package to shaver less than two minutes.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive compared to the cost of new.  </li>
            <li> Bought the shaver at Little China (Walmart) for $39.99 and worked well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with how quickly the blades lose their edge.  </li>
            <li> If you are not paying attention, you find yourself bleeding from the raw edges of the hole in the screen.</li>
            <li> And, I like to eat ice cream in the raw</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> If I buy a new replacement screen and blades for $24.00-$28.00 every 12-15 days, I might as well pay go back to Gillette and pay their outrageous prices for razor blades.  </li>
            <li> But, too expensive; almost price of a new shaver which itself is to expensive.</li>
            <li> but after 4 or 5 weeks can feel it getting dull and pulling whiskers.</li>
            <li> At least I saving money by purchasing these from Amazon.</li>
            <li> the ones I was using were starting to shave badly and irritate my face.</li>
            <li> Not a good thing.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that replacement products such as these make my very expensive razor less than a satisfactory machine.</li>
            <li> Am not happy wth the way they cut.</li>
            <li> I am not happy about the cost of any of the electric shaver blade kits.  </li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Very expensive to replace every month or two.</li>
            <li> This crap is drastically overpriced, across the board</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> replacement part, unit work well</li>
            <li> Perfect fit , great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shaver blade.&lt;br /&gt;It works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s turned my life around (not).</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and expected product in box</li>
            <li> Cant beat that new blade shave feeling.  Had to buy these cause the ones I was using were starting to shave badly and irritate my face. Couldn&#x27;t find them at my local Wal-Mart so bought them on Amazon for a decent price.</li>
            <li> This was very pricey but works great.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet but I&#x27;m sure he will be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The items I ordered was received the next day.  The order was right and everyone did a great job getting the merchandize filled and delivered.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I received the kit as described and it worked great. I replaced old blades and this set was very shape and my shave was very smooth.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to find the right replacement foil/cutting block. This item does what it is supposed on the correct electric razor. OK price. Seller excellent. I would recommend this, but be sure of the correct numbers, etc. when ordering replacements.</li>
            <li> Was all I  expected and works very well.</li>
            <li> Exactly the right product fit I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with how quickly the blades lose their edge.  In a week to ten days, the cutters are pulling at my face.  If I buy a new replacement screen and blades for $24.00-$28.00 every 12-15 days, I might as well pay go back to Gillette and pay their outrageous prices for razor blades.  An additional liability with the Remington 300 system is that somewhere around the fourth week, the screens become fragile, and a small hole develops.  The edges of the exposed screen are nearly as sharp as a razor blade.  If you are not paying attention, you find yourself bleeding from the raw edges of the hole in the screen.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed for his shaver. Now his skin is smooth and comfortable again.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and now the shaver works like new.  Worth the price,  even though not cheap.Like the close shave now</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  Love Remington shaving products.</li>
            <li> snaps into place and works well--never had problem with screen like with others--need to find just the cutters, old screen like new</li>
            <li> Great fit for my shaver and good price.</li>
            <li> All I really needed was the screen for my shaver...but you can only buy the screens in a package with the cutters...which increases the cost.</li>
            <li> The replacement screen and cutter for my Remingto F5 (4900) came quickly and worked well for one shave then my shaver became very noisey and sounded as if the blades were rubbing against the screen.  I reversed the blades (which work both ways) and the same noise.  I looked over the blades and cover with a magnifying glass and could find no rub markes.  While the product works (I get a decent shave) the noise is disturbing and not at all like the original blades and screen.  I am disappointed that replacement products such as these make my very expensive razor less than a satisfactory machine.</li>
            <li> i was very pleased with my purchase. I have not been able to find a replacement at any local retail outlet. this was priced right and delivered to my door within two days</li>
            <li> Good product, good price  Fast Ship  As advertised</li>
            <li> Delivery time was good as usual but too bad those Remington shaving screens don&#x27;t last more than 4 or 5 months and then you can&#x27;t order them by themselves. They have to be ordered with the heads and the old heads are still good when the screens wear out</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and as described in the advertizement.</li>
            <li> It came on time, it fit, it worked, and when they wear out I will do this again.</li>
            <li> as described....work well...</li>
            <li> Screen &amp; Cutter is working at 100% Frank A Trombino</li>
            <li> Fit my shaver perfectly! Easy to clean and care for.</li>
            <li> it fits perfect works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to arrive but consistent with seller disclosure. Fit and work well.</li>
            <li> Factory replacement blades and screen. Makes razor like new.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, good delivery</li>
            <li> I keep buying these things.  Must be good.</li>
            <li> Everything was grrreat!</li>
            <li> They fit my razor. They work</li>
            <li> these are really cool.  they feel better than the original ones.</li>
            <li> I bought a replacement for my year old foil and cutters. I had hoped the replacements would give a more comfortable shave than the originals, No such luck! I then compared the SPF-300 Intercept Cutter with my old shaver, an M2830 - a really good shaver. I noticed the intercept cutter on the SPF-300 felt stiffer than on the SP-282. Specifically, the SPF-300 didn&#x27;t press down as easily as the SP-280. Also, the intercept cutter on the SPF-300 was much wider than on the SP-282. So I went &#x27;outside the box&#x27; and eliminated the intercept cutter on the SPF-300! I used my OLD foil assembly as a test and I depressed the tab on one end of the intercept cutter and lifted it up and out of the foil assembly. The other end came apart more easily. Voila!! Be careful not to loose the tiny springs at each end. I then used the foil assembly without the Intercept Cutter and I got a shave without that &amp;#34;razor burn&amp;#34; feeling. The Intercept cutter was confirmed as the source of irritation.. Now that I knew it could be done without damaging the foil assembly, I repeated the same for my new SPF-300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is not what we wanted when we bought an Electric Razor that uses the SPF-300. But, if you want a smooth shave, without irritated skin, I strongly suggest you remove the Intercept Cutter. You have two options: 1) use the shaver without the Intercept cutter or, 2) replace the Intercept cutter WITHOUT the springs. The former could leave some shaver dust in your sink (I haven&#x27;t noticed this though) while option two will close the &#x27;hole&#x27; and prevent any dust from falling out, the clicking sound of the now non-spring loaded Intercept Cutter was a noise I didn&#x27;t need to listen to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are &#x27;handy&#x27; and can use a small screwdriver, I suggest you experiment on an old assembly first and then on your current foil head. I think you will appreciate the smoother shave. You will still need to make multiple passes but, that was always the case with an electric shaver. BTW, I have been shaving with electric shavers since 1967. I know shavers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to Remington: the SPF-300 vs. the SP282 1) has the foils too far apart, 2) has springs that are too stiff for the Intercept cutter, 3) cannot stretch and keep skin smooth because the distance between foils is too far apart. The SP-282 is sized better for a smoother more comfortable shave. Bring back the SP-282 size AND configuration on a &amp;#34;Pivot and Flex&amp;#34; shaver and you will have a potential &#x27;best buy&#x27; electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Overpriced.  Honestly, I wish I had just purchased a whole new razor for a little more.  My battery quit about 2 months later and I had to spend $50 to get a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it worked fine and fit fine.</li>
            <li> Replaced worn cutters and screen! The cutters make a difference in the quality of the shave, since they wear out in about 6-8 months of use!  Very easy to replace on the 5800!</li>
            <li> This is cheaper on Amazon then at the local market this. Very affordable for a closer shave and to extend the life of your razor.</li>
            <li> Good product, Husband likes these.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband and he was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The screens &amp; cutters arrived via Amazon&#x27;s usual quick delivery process.  These replacement parts are as good in quality, fit &amp; function as the original screens &amp; cutters that came with the shaver.  Another &amp;#34;bullseye&amp;#34; by Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a standard replacement part, from Remington, so it works.  I could not find it in town, so buying via Amazon was a great relief.  I bought a bunch of them, since I&#x27;ll need them anyway, to spread the shipping costs across many units.</li>
            <li> Yes, because the whole assembly is included in the kit, it was a very easy install and the product functions extremely well.</li>
            <li> The order arrived on time and the product is fine</li>
            <li> As advertised and on time!</li>
            <li> The SPF-300 was a perfect replacement for my F4900.&lt;br /&gt;like brand new again. Easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;Would order it again.</li>
            <li> I accidentally lost one of my blades, so I ordered these as replacements. They work as they should, and I use them weekly.</li>
            <li> I likeThe razor it&#x27;s really good but the screens wear out fast!!! and they are not  ap at all  cheap !!!</li>
            <li> Great price! They arrived promptly! Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Fit my razor perfectly</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described. Also, fast shipping. I like to shave with my new product. And, I like to eat ice cream in the raw</li>
            <li> My husband said it&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s had. I&#x27;ve given him Braun and other more expensive shavers and this is his favorite!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband I had no idea what I was looking for but I got the right ones and he was so estatic because it was not  easy finding them in any store. So I end up buy 3 more. Thanks amazon for the incredible service. ❤️☺️</li>
            <li> My husband liked this shaver so well, he had me order another one, just in case they discontinued it. Also bought extra heads.</li>
            <li> The new cutters are giving me a shave that is like new again.&lt;br /&gt;I had really waited too long to replace the old ones.</li>
            <li> It was broken when i took it out of the packaging i had to take the foil screens out and place them on thr older razor head.one of the new foil screens already ripped.</li>
            <li> The shaver head on the original razor was much quieter. This set is very noisy. It cuts OK, just very noisy. Dale</li>
            <li> Finally, I was able to locate these replacement parts for my Remington F5 Interceptor (F-5800).&lt;br /&gt;The razor and screen are fantastic!</li>
            <li> As advertised, perfect replacement for the original that came on the razor.</li>
            <li> The items were exactly what I was looking for and function perfectly.  Due to the many and varied types razors, replacement heads/screens, I recommend Amazon for acquisition of such needs.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver parts because they fit like the original. The price is right and the shipping prompt. I will order again when I need another set.</li>
            <li> This is my second or third replacement screen set for my shaver.  They work good for me for a while.  I am not happy about the cost of any of the electric shaver blade kits.  I have just bought a new shaver in a time pinch because the replacement kit costs about as much as a completely new shaver.  At least I saving money by purchasing these from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Too noisy in my shaver.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Works fine.</li>
            <li> Fit the razor just fine.Have not used the blades yet.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! have not used them yet because its not time to replace them yet</li>
            <li> The center of the screen pops up on one side causing the shaver to be very noisy and inefficient. For a few dollars more, I could have&lt;br /&gt;bought another new one. These replacement screen and blades probably won&#x27;t last much longer.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this razor better than any other brand. He says it gets a closer shave but has to replace the screens every so ofter. I am using one also &amp; like the smoothness of my legs.</li>
            <li> Only place in the world to purchase this item-Amazon</li>
            <li> Received on-time and as promised.</li>
            <li> Working well; so far, no nicks.  Cuts well and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> IT IS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE SHAVER I OWN.</li>
            <li> This is my first replacement for my first electric shaver. I&#x27;m 67 and never thought I&#x27;d be able to get a close shave other than the old fashion way, but this Remington does. I now receive a very close and convienant shave whenever and wherever I want. With daily shaves, frequent shaver cleanings, I received a year&#x27;s worth of use before changing. However, I&#x27;m going to start a six month part replacement schedule. Great product, fair price.</li>
            <li> Works very go no complaint........</li>
            <li> My old screens had started getting holes in them and scratching my face.  This was the exact fit and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Have not used it to much yet so don&#x27;t have a fair report to give a good evaluation at this time</li>
            <li> Recommend to any one who owns a shaver that requires this style of shaver head. Only place that I can locate this item in our locale.</li>
            <li> great and recommended</li>
            <li> parts are a direct replacement, installing brought shaver back up to usefulness (one original screen had cracked, other was worn).</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who accidently lost it in the garbage. He uses it often. The only part I didn&#x27;t like was the price but other than that it is worth it. I would recommend this to others who want to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Arrived at the time specified and was of good quality</li>
            <li> Worked well as a replacement blade.</li>
            <li> Easy to install in razor, shaves clean and smooth but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. I have a very heavy beard and use it daily but after 4 or 5 weeks can feel it getting dull and pulling whiskers. Very expensive to replace every month or two.</li>
            <li> Great!  Hard to find in stores, and it is great to have our shaver working again!</li>
            <li> Great that my husband was able to get a replacement screen.  They worked great and left him with a smooth face.</li>
            <li> Cutters arrived timely and as advertised.  Proper screen and cutter for my shaver.  No problems.</li>
            <li> My husband bought the razor at Wal-Mart, but they don&#x27;t sell the replacement heads. These are the ones made for his razor, super smooth shave and love the auto-ship!!!!</li>
            <li> The shaver work very well, have not open the extra screens yet.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. Now I can enjoy using my razor again without the nicks caused by a bad screen.</li>
            <li> works just like it should.</li>
            <li> Yeah baby, look like a baby&#x27;s clean...butt. But, too expensive; almost price of a new shaver which itself is to expensive. Humans with greed; go figure.</li>
            <li> Too expensive compared to the cost of new.  Bought the shaver at Little China (Walmart) for $39.99 and worked well and no complaints but went to Walmart for replacement blades ( These) and could not find any.  Looked the part up here on Amazon and the cost with shipping is less than $10.00 of buying a new shaver.  It would have been much easier to do that but felt a little guilty putting a good shaver in the landfill and getting new.  This was more hassle and took more effort but I thought every little bit would help and already have two other rotary triple blade razors that also need heads but have the old ni-cad batteries and do not hold a charge that long.  I use these as back ups and when traveling.  All in all good service from Amazon.  Will order less now from Amazon because the sales tax issue makes them less competitive on much more items</li>
            <li> I had another Remington razor that I liked better than this one, but maybe I was just spoiled by that one.</li>
            <li> good quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li> THE HEADS FOR THE REMINGTON LAST QUITE A LONG TIME BUT IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP A REPLACEMENT AROUND.  ONE NICE THING IS THE HEADS ARE VERY EASY TO REPLACE.</li>
            <li> Replace your cutter and screens ever 6 mos and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to receive new blades as well at no extra price</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; cutters do not cut any better than the old ones! I suspect they were reconditioned and not new. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Bought this original replacements for readiness. Pricey, but no choice.</li>
            <li> Item is great and got speedy delivery service.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great they worked perfectly. And good timely shipping.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat a Remington shave! I have 2 Remington shavers, an R5 rotary model and an F5 foil model. I alternate each ones use from time to time for the sake of variety.  I LOVE them both but the rotary does a little better job on my heavy beard (STRICTLY PERSONAL PREFERENCE). They both shave great and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type. I buy my replacement &amp;#34;Heads &amp; Cutters&amp;#34; 2 at a time just to have an ample supply on hand. With the SPF-300 replacement heads you get a shave comparable to that of a new shaver fresh out the box. I am very satisfied with the part and especially my Remington shavers.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note. Yes, I have used Norelco &amp; Braun and they work well. I just prefer Remington shavers, guess I&#x27;m brand loyal!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit; shaver is like new!</li>
            <li> The new shaving head fit the shaver perfectly and work great!</li>
            <li> Yet another quality product.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; good delivery.</li>
            <li> fit the razor as specified</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and in very good condition.  The item has also continued to work well after various uses during the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the exact product recommended by Remington. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought replacing these things was important! I switched out my 1.5 hear screens and cutters and my face doesn&#x27;t get hacked up. Should have been an obvious thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Remington since my grandfather introduced me to the brand. He gave me my first shave with a Remington micro screen shaver. I gave him one of his final shaves when he was in the hospital after his stroke, using a Remington micro screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that&#x27;s sentimental, but I get a nice shave and am reminded of a great man. If it was good enough for gramps for all of his life, it&#x27;s good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is also a good idea to change out the screens and cutters!</li>
            <li> Best Price On Replacement Cutter!</li>
            <li> Love this one order them all the time because it&#x27;s so hard to find them in the store.</li>
            <li> Great replacement parts. They fit just like the original equipment. The price is a little higher than what I think it should be, but,  what can you do.....</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, but was not the black screen as pictured. This is the first replacement since I purchased this shaver, and the black was touted as being better. I have not seen any of the black screens in being sold anywhere. The original black screen did not last as long as my previous shaver foil screens, and scratched my face worse than ever when a tear appeared in it, this may be why they seemingly did away with the black. At any rate the new replacement fits my shaver by just snapping in a new assembly, and not having to disassemble the foils from the plastic head.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item before and never had a problem but now I will hesitate to order again as the item we received came in parts and pieces.  Men shavers who have this Remington model know the replacement part needs to be attached as a WHOLE unit. My husband chose to MacGyver his razor with the multiple attachment parts instead of have me return in.  Just heads up to you folks who order in future.</li>
            <li> Have fpound that this enable a good clean Shave but the Foil is so very fragile that it is easy to break and before you know it cuts all over.  Still the good shave overrides the problem</li>
            <li> Same quality product that you get in the stores but you save money and time by ordering through Amazon. Also, by buying 2, it&#x27;ll save you another trip to the store or having to reorder.</li>
            <li> Part  of  it  was  broke , I  use  part  from  my  other  to make it work .  The  sheens was broke  I would have send it back  but  my face need  shaving.</li>
            <li> This unit has all the parts needed to refurbish the cutter including the center cutter bar . was simple to swap the parts  .  Shipping was a little slow thru Amazon. When I selected Amazon Prime I was thinking ok 2 days . I missed the expected ship date of 10  to 14 days later . got it in 10</li>
            <li> Price and delivery are great. If you own the Remington shaver, you need to keep a spare as the screens are fragile.</li>
            <li> EVERY THING IS WORKING FINE</li>
            <li> Standard replacement head, works like the one that came with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, works great.</li>
            <li> I replaced my existing Remington F5-5800 with exactly the same new model &amp; then purahased this screen cutters to hold my existing razor as a spare. A great and inexpensive shaver.</li>
            <li> Very happy with such a smooth shave. Availability of replacement cutter/screen is key to satisfaction after purchase of a shaver. Easy selection on web look-up, rapid arrival. You&#x27;re the greatest!</li>
            <li> What can I say.  It works on the shaver we already have.</li>
            <li> This crap is drastically overpriced, across the board mind you, not just this vendor. Laser f&#x27;n surgery is cheaper than two years supply of these razor heads. &amp;#34;Gouging&amp;#34; taken to a new level.</li>
            <li> I am thrifty. The original blades lasted 18 months.  These were a cinch to install and now I will change every 6 months.</li>
            <li> not  a very good cutting set or Remington is not so good</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will be year before I need to use them.</li>
            <li> From package to shaver less than two minutes.  Doing this for an elderly gentleman....i&#x27;m a girl.  Never done this before.  Very happy that the Remington is user friendly.  Will not hesitate next time.</li>
            <li> I had been pleased with the razor&#x27;s performance, but as with any foil razor, drop it a few too many times and you will need a new foil, at the risk of otherwise scratching the hell out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I put on the new foils and blades, and it really was like a whole new razor...not that it wasn&#x27;t still doing well after almost a year, but the new &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; really made it work like it was new again.  A shame they couldn&#x27;t just sell the foils by themselves for less, but at least it was cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li> Another great product.  Quality Remington replacement.  Complete 3 piece assembly to get your shaver working like brand new again!  I&#x27;ve ordered these a few times and keep coming back!</li>
            <li> Never as good as those that come with the razor at purchase.</li>
            <li> Works as it should.  Great price.</li>
            <li> The replacements will more than triple the life of the razor. I got weary of replacing the whole razor each time it got dull.</li>
            <li> Performed as expected.</li>
            <li> I looked all over trying to find replacement heads for my shaver and found them on Amazon.  They are an exact match and original equipment.  I have been using it for a few months now, and it works great.  I will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to swap heads and cutters!</li>
            <li> For replacement screens and cutters this product works. It&#x27;s simple and effective so if you like the razor you&#x27;ll need these to replace your worn cutters.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my razor. Price was a bit steep, though.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement blades for my shaver.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and the price was good</li>
            <li> It was cheaper than the store and it was a perfect match</li>
            <li> I was at a loss without my Remington razor to keep my &amp;#34;ABE&amp;#34; beard trimmed and shaped. The new screen and cutters work great and it was a good HONEST price.  I would recommend this to anyone needing to &amp;#34;renew&amp;#34; their shaver. HONEST ABE</li>
            <li> My dad had looked EVERYWHERE took me 5 second to order it an about days to get it.. he was super pleased with it!!!</li>
            <li> Remington SPF-300: Screens and Cutters The shipping and packing was fine, no problem. The screen and cutters was a good fit and worked fine.</li>
            <li> They are a direct replacement for the old F5800 shaver blades.</li>
            <li> They do exactly their job and I am very happy I was able to find them here when I couldn&#x27;t get replacements in the store</li>
            <li> good product at a god price</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my old razor screens and blades.  Handily, the screens are already mounted on a duplicate shaving head, so all you have to do is twist and remove the blades, press on the new ones, and put on the new head with screens.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this item, shipping was prompt also</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Work fine, should last longer.</li>
            <li> is nice to have a handy source for the shaver head.  Comes right to the door.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to write about for the spare screens and cutters I purchased because I&#x27;ve had no need yet to use them. However, I have no doubt my comments below for the shaver also will apply to the replacement parts I purchased to keep my shaver percolating in accordance with my finest expectations.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. Works like its supposed to</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> It fits the specified shavers and works just like the original ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these screens and cutters for the last 2-3 years and with each new set they are getting duller and duller. Not a good thing.</li>
