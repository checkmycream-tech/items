            <li> The product overall is a good case for fake eyelashes, but a I specifically ordered this because it was plain.</li>
            <li> It looked like the plastic package it came in was open and closed with tape</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected,</li>
            <li> It keeps them dry and shaped.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is that my adhesive does not fit</li>
            <li> not very practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small and doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
            <li> A gift for my make-up obsessed sister, she wears false lashes everyday, she was very excited and seems to use this case every night...</li>
            <li> other reviews said it q as juat compartments but mine was just as shown!</li>
            <li> This looks identical to House of Lashes for less (if you count their shipping)</li>
            <li> Instead of what was advertised I received what seemed to be identical but when opening it, the inside had three little compartments.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of my time and money</li>
            <li> My mom loves it and she isn&#x27;t evwn half as obsessed with makeup as I am.</li>
            <li> Also, this thing is ridiculously large!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it looked a little dirty</li>
            <li> Well mine was broken</li>
            <li> It arrived with the bow broken in two.</li>
            <li> It came to me broken and all scratched up and was cracked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not appreciate false</li>
            <li> Received my package from them in a timely manner but was disappointed when I received an accessory case instead of a false eye lashes case.</li>
            <li> Received this today and I am disappointed because it is not what was pictured and what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> just received my lash case but was disappointed it wasn&#x27;t the one in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> This is very convenient for storing lashes. It keeps them dry and shaped.  It looks cheap, but it is cheap so I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought but serves the purpose, I guess.</li>
            <li> Well mine was broken so I sent it back. But returning it was easy so that&#x27;s awesome! It looked cute though !</li>
            <li> A gift for my make-up obsessed sister, she wears false lashes everyday, she was very excited and seems to use this case every night...overall I&#x27;d say this was a successful gift!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Eyelashes have no way of sticking to the container to stay in place.</li>
            <li> This keeps all of my false eyelashes neat clean and all in one spot! And such an adorable case!! In love with this product!</li>
            <li> I brought this under my brother account and it was horribe. It arrived with the bow broken in two. The case was cracked and you can see all the scratches on it. Never again. It dosent even deserve to have a star. Waste of my time and money</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. It looked like the plastic package it came in was open and closed with tape and it looked a little dirty so had to rub it down with alcohol just to make sure it was clean, but other than that I&#x27;m happy with it. Only real reason I got it was because it freaks out my boyfriend to see the real human hair lashes in the bathroom lol</li>
            <li> Oh my! This is the cutest thing ever. My mom loves it and she isn&#x27;t evwn half as obsessed with makeup as I am. I was a bit worries about the previous reviews but rest assured mine came in one piece and it came fast! The three little lash compartments are the best mine had them I know other reviews said it q as juat compartments but mine was just as shown!</li>
            <li> This looks identical to House of Lashes for less (if you count their shipping) the only thing is that my adhesive does not fit but that&#x27;s not a problem. It&#x27;s the Duo adhesive, it&#x27;s a bit big but my lashes fit perfectly anyway. I recommended this product! It also came very fast.</li>
            <li> Great invention I just think it&#x27;s overpriced and too bulky for holding lashes. As big as it was I thought. Maybe more than 3 pairs it could hold.</li>
            <li> Super cute! Perfect size! It&#x27;s really great having one case to hold my diff pairs. Smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s the perfect size. Not too big, not too small and doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
            <li> Very cute and convenient way for storing my fake lashes and I received it before it&#x27;s delivery estimate however my case had some scratches on the back that weren&#x27;t noticeable at first glance. It&#x27;s also lightweight and appears fragile so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend having it crammed with a whole bunch of things or dropping it. Overall, I like it and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and it is perfect, it&#x27;s a nice size and fits right in your purse if you need to carry it around. It looks exactly like it does in the picture also which is nice! It&#x27;s very durable and so cute.</li>
            <li> I love it very sturdy perfect fit for my lash can&#x27;t fit the adhesive though but pretty</li>
            <li> It came fairly quickly for coming all the way from Japan! It is a very cute and nice case and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> SO CUTE! Good quality!</li>
            <li> Cute nice small size for false eyelashes.  Will fit in purse. Durable.</li>
            <li> Horrible! It came to me broken and all scratched up and was cracked. Never again! No stars should even be allowed!</li>
            <li> Received this today and I am disappointed because it is not what was pictured and what I was expecting. The product had a very similar cover with writing on it which I do not care for. The inside compartment is as shown. I can&#x27;t decide yet if I will be keeping or returning this item. The product overall is a good case for fake eyelashes, but a I specifically ordered this because it was plain.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews- this is my first.&lt;br /&gt;I just received my lash case but was disappointed it wasn&#x27;t the one in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The outer case looks the same but once I opened it, it just had 3 separate compartments but not specifically for the lashes as it shows in the pictures. The case is made of cheap plastic and I can see already that it&#x27;ll break easily and in matter of time.&lt;br /&gt;I gave two stars b/c I guess I can still use it and travel with it. But the lashes will probably stick together in the case,which I was trying to avoid by getting this case.&lt;br /&gt;Do not appreciate false advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I received my case within a week its super cute alot of ppl have it on ig and it cost them more it closes great and does not open if you throw it in your purse plus its super great quality and it came exactly like in the picture .. Thank you to the seller you are really professional in your shipments</li>
            <li> So cute! Holds my false eyelashes perfectly.  Everyone who sees it asks where I got it :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!!!! Big enough for my eyelashes since I wear different styles when going out and super cute. Will definitely recommend to friends and pageant sisters. A must have for any girl!</li>
            <li> I love it,super cute and perfect size,it was actually bigger than expected! Also came on time,I really loved that (:</li>
            <li> looks so cute on my vanity</li>
            <li> Received my package from them in a timely manner but was disappointed when I received an accessory case instead of a false eye lashes case. Instead of what was advertised I received what seemed to be identical but when opening it, the inside had three little compartments. I can still use it for what I wanted, but didn&#x27;t receive what I was supposed to. I&#x27;m assuming it was a mistake since most reviews seem positive.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch. Really needed a place to store my lashes. When I remove them from original packahing I just throw it away, so glad I found this case.</li>
            <li> I love the colors/design, but its not very practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m surprised but the eyelashes don&#x27;t actually stay in the designated areas (not something I thought about, but definitely something that I should have! Also, this thing is ridiculously large!&lt;br /&gt;Still, it will make a nice addition to my vanity!</li>
