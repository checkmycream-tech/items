            <li>This is a good buy.</li>
            <li>quality was extremely good...</li>
            <li>It would be good for a costume party, maybe, but not for every day use.</li>
            <li>Super happy customer!!</li>
            <li>I added some golden wefts and it is the perfect wig for Sailor Venus!  </li>
            <li>It is thicker then most but doesn&#x27;t have a great feel to it.</li>
            <li>Actually kind of surprising.</li>
            <li>Really good wig for the price, but it falls off very easily.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this wig!</li>
            <li>I love this wig!</li>
            <li>I bought more then one color!</li>
            <li>I originally got this wig because it looks beautiful</li>
            <li>Great length, color and fit.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Nice wig for Cosplay</li>
            <li>The quality of this wig is surprisingly nice for the price.</li>
            <li>but it has a nice length.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-fits nicely and stays on with a wig cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wig would never lie nicely like the picture shows.</li>
            <li>, the seller responded very quickly that it indeed came with one, however, there was not one in the box, but even still, i&#x27;m very happy that after hours pf contemplation on which wig would be my first ever online bought wig i chose this one,</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at the quality of this wig very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>First thing I&#x27;d like to mention is that COSPLAY INSHOP has great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t exactly matter I have decided to keep the wig because of the great quality.</li>
            <li>Very good quality,just like real hair, and stayed nice and almost tangle free all day :)  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very cheap</li>
            <li>The strands kind of come off too easy.</li>
            <li>A quick comb with a wide-tooth comb and they are good to go.</li>
            <li>It is also kind of easy to see the mesh around the top of the head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve felt better wigs, but I needed it for a costume.</li>
            <li>This wig was just okay.  </li>
            <li>Love it and will order more.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Went to a costume party dressed as Penny from the Big Bang Theory!&lt;br /&gt;The wig was perfect!</li>
            <li>I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>you want a wig either just for fun, or for an occasion, this is a good wig to choose.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but the thing I don&#x27;t like is that it makes it looks like you have a mushroom head layer on the top of your head where the bangs are....</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>Fantastic quality hair!</li>
            <li>quality is great, not too shiny like many budget wigs, looks and feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed wearing it for Halloween</li>
            <li>Top of this looks like someone butchered it....</li>
            <li>It looks like its hair is thinning on top.</li>
            <li>It shows the wefts throughout the top of the wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks ok if you wear a hat or bandanna over the crown.  </li>
            <li>but I still love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li>Love this wig.</li>
            <li>Love this wig.</li>
            <li>But overall very awesome!</li>
            <li>cute would recommend.</li>
            <li>She has a lot of hair and most wigs won&#x27;t go over her hair and stay on.  </li>
            <li>: Wearing a hat makes this wig a lot more</li>
            <li>I am going to be buying more colors because I do quite like it.</li>
            <li>Got it more as a gag</li>
            <li>This wig is surprisingly real, very soft, beautiful color, and really top quality.</li>
            <li>This wig comes in a great color and the fibers are not ridiculously shinny</li>
            <li>when i took it out of the packaging, the curls were very profound and the color was beautiful.</li>
            <li>It was nice and full and allowed for a versatile look.</li>
            <li>Super bummed as it seemed like a nice wig.</li>
            <li>very full.</li>
            <li>2 weeks early looks great.</li>
            <li>The wig was longer than expected, which is great!</li>
            <li>So I just got this wig the other day and am impressed by the quality of this wig!</li>
            <li>It came very quickly too.</li>
            <li>It is easy to comb and style.</li>
            <li>Also, does not tangle easily at all, even after I teased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair knots easily.</li>
            <li>I was amazed by the great quality I got for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li>It gets matted easily but store it well</li>
            <li>easily</li>
            <li>I would have liked but the length and quality of the wig really does make up for that!</li>
            <li>Othrr than that love the length and coor was true to the picture.</li>
            <li>Very full towards the bottom with a nice flow to it, not bone straight.</li>
            <li>It looks fine in pictures, but flash photos make it look shiny.</li>
            <li>I straightened bits with my flatiron on 250F just fine.</li>
            <li>Color was accurate.</li>
            <li>I purchased the wig in \\&quot;light blonde\\&quot; color, but the wig is not \\&quot;light blonde\\</li>
            <li>and it really holds its shape nicely.  </li>
            <li>worth more than they charge</li>
            <li>The wig is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It also shipped really fast to my house which I really liked.</li>
            <li>It was more white, but the quality was good.</li>
            <li>To remedy this, I just cut them in a cute, arched, straight bang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its an okay wig, for the price I am not going to complain</li>
            <li>We were able to braid it and it served its purpose, but it looked pretty cheap and tangled quite easily.</li>
            <li>I could never wear it, you could see right through the top.</li>
            <li>The bangs are long, so I just flipped them lol.</li>
            <li>Bought it for a Luna Lovegood costume and had so much fun wearing it!</li>
            <li>have good cheap stuff) above the ear tabs and at the nape of the wig just to secure it into place...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good length for a wig, and it looks pretty realistic when it&#x27;s on, so that&#x27;s a pro.</li>
            <li>Thick, curls are nicely placed and it fits great</li>
            <li>its definitely yellow in color but for the price it was great and made the costume a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture but was longer than I&#x27;d originally thought and slightly wavier than the picture which works great for my applejacks cosplay!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get them to easily sit right and ended up having to cut them to keep them out of my eyes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good for costumes and such</li>
            <li>for the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>It looks wonderful and is easy to put on and wear, however, take a little extra care when combing it out, it shreds easily.</li>
            <li>You simply can&#x27;t get better for this cheap price!</li>
            <li>I recommend this if you want a cheap wig with amazing  color and human hair like texture</li>
            <li>and it is SUPER quality.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The wig looks nice enough, but it doesn&#x27;t fit me right.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty, though, and it feels and looks pretty real; I just wish it fit better, and when I try to pull it into a ponytail, the mesh underneath shows a lot.  </li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s just the wig, but overall it is a pretty good wig for $15.</li>
            <li>pretty good wig overall.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed as a cosplay item!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge difference from natural light.</li>
            <li>I ordered the light blond and ended up getting a wig that is very strawberry blond and almost auburn.</li>
            <li>This wig is amazing, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Not as blonde as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>This wig is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>The color is more platinum blonde instead of light.</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s expected take good care of it</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for fun.</li>
            <li>So much fun to wear</li>
            <li>The shipping took some time, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>There are lots of different kinds on the market, but I chose a nice liquidy mascara type.</li>
            <li>The wig came pretty quickly (for shipping from China).</li>
            <li>Item was as described and priced right.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s somewhat of the right size.</li>
            <li>This wig came right when it said it would</li>
            <li>it was just right.</li>
            <li>Again, for the price can&#x27;t really complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased and definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li>The color it exactly the same in the picture, and it feel really nice.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use to cover specific spots.</li>
            <li>are my more major complaints:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved how this wig (I got the light blonde color), had a natural shine which could have fooled people into thinking it was my real hair if I had a hat</li>
            <li>Pretty fun wig to wear.</li>
            <li>The hair is very soft, easy to brush, and cut to look exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li>Very realistic looking!</li>
            <li>This wig is overall very nice and similar to the picture.</li>
            <li>They may claim that it &amp;#34;fits most head sizes&amp;#34;, but it wouldn&#x27;t fit my fairly average sized head (I measured).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like it for my first cosplay wig.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s real hair!</li>
            <li>when it says heat resistant, it really does means resistant!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cute, but just wish you couldn&#x27;t see the hair net underneath, you can tell its a wig.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast too!</li>
            <li>So much hair!</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased another wig as back up after this one took over a month to ship!</li>
            <li>definitely not Elsa from Frozen, more like her sister.</li>
            <li>, exactly what I was expecting for an 8 dollar wig.</li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full and thick and good quality.  </li>
            <li>The bangs don&#x27;t really look like the picture, and I purchased the very light blonde one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full and soft!</li>
            <li>The blonde shade is exactly the same and the length is good.</li>
            <li>and it came with a wig net for your hair which was a nice and unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li>While I love the hair quality and texture (it feels real), this is a costume quality wig that when worn does show the wig cap construction (tracks) beneath in the back.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see your hair around the edges of the front).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle part, or side parts on either side is pretty much what you can do.</li>
            <li>Other than the bangs, it was very easy to cut and style as I needed it.</li>
            <li>You have to be very particular with how you part it, or else the wig cap will show through.</li>
            <li>SUPER SOFT.</li>
            <li>Super thin on the top and got tangled SO easily.</li>
            <li>If you move the hair a certain way you can see the cap underneath.</li>
            <li>I tried using a large barrel curling iron to add a bit of volume to the bangs...</li>
            <li>I do not have a large head and there isn&#x27;t any stretching going on.</li>
            <li>Even though I am practically going to dismember this wig, It was fun to wear around and felt natural too!</li>
            <li>If you wear some kind of hat with it though it can easily cover it up or you can possibly add a few wefts between the gaps.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Feels real and isn&#x27;t super thin like most cheap wigs.</li>
            <li>that the light blonde is VERY light platinum or ash blonde, nearly white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>color is a little more yellow than pictured, but is okay.</li>
            <li>However, I ordered light blonde</li>
            <li>I ordered the light blonde.</li>
            <li>Does this look light blonde!?</li>
            <li>The only problems I have with this wig are that it sheds a lot, and the cap didn&#x27;t quite fit my head.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t cover my hairline very well.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use a pony tail or a bun, because it creates too much of a bump.</li>
            <li>Looks very wig-y...</li>
            <li>I just ran my fingers through it and it was ready to use.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really look like the pictures.</li>
            <li>Kept turning it hotter and hotter, never did make much of any difference at all.</li>
            <li>so she doesn&#x27;t wear it much)</li>
            <li>I was GENTLE with handling it</li>
            <li>The wig was hideous and it went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li>Wife tells me it feels like real hair and very well made.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this wig.</li>
            <li>Looks real.</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig in light blonde.</li>
            <li>It fit me but if wanted to pull the wig hair up in a ponytail or such my hairline would be exposed.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>hair is very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>all the color selections, they appear very fun,vibrant and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be the light blonde color, but the one I received is orange-y?</li>
            <li>and it is a cheap way to figure out if I like being blonde</li>
            <li>(bought the light blonde wig).</li>
            <li>It also sheds quite a bit and isn&#x27;t very heat resistant.</li>
            <li>Bangs are thick, good color.</li>
            <li>For a fifteen dollar wig it looks very real and very natural.</li>
            <li>Not really complaining, it was inconvenient but a nice sign of good quality!</li>
            <li>The wig was very nice and soft &amp; it came in at least a week.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, it can a month early!</li>
            <li>Its a very nice, pale blonde as the picture show.</li>
            <li>I love wigs and have several of them, however, this is the first blonde one I have purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li>The synthetic fibers don&#x27;t tangle like other wigs, and can be styled pretty easily.</li>
            <li>and so I can&#x27;t clip it unless I am okay with getting head aches, and when i first put it on, quite a few fibers started falling out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It&#x27;s not very full at the top.. if you try to re-position the hair or part it in another way, you will see the hair net.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was packaged nicely on arrival, with an included wig cap (usually sold for around $1-$2 USD), which was also individually wrapped in its original wrapping.</li>
            <li>I would recommend It to people if they are looking for a cheap long wig that can get the job done.</li>
            <li>This is closer to an orangey gold blonde but the hair itself is nice enough for an 8 year old to play hair dresser with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is true to color and actually seems a bit longer than the picture.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty please with it so far.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly but was a yellow-y color and shiny and obviously synthetic hair... very tangled and not at all realistic looking.</li>
            <li>There is a large bald spot right next to the bangs.</li>
            <li>Nothing too realistic</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have enough time and patience to get all your hair into it, because it really does take like thirty minutes to put on if your hair is long.</li>
            <li>Also, this doesn&#x27;t come with a wig cap, which is kind of standard if you&#x27;ve purchased other decent quality wigs.</li>
            <li>If you were considering this wig for Halloween, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>have a couple of high quality synthetic wigs (Lacefronts, Arda brand)</li>
            <li>fibers are soft, although you might find them a tad shiny in certain lighting.</li>
            <li>, I naturally have dark hair and these hairs are quite obviously, very light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-i noticed that the more you touch/stroke/brush it, it gets a little frizzy, out of place and won&#x27;t return to its normal state.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, it&#x27;s not thin at all.</li>
            <li>It was much thinner and does not style nearly as well.</li>
            <li>far, everyone has flipped out and can&#x27;t believe I got my hair to lighten so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a slightly darker color than what is shown but really amazing quality especially for a $10 wig.</li>
            <li>I tried adjusting it different ways, but I can&#x27;t get it to look right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I would like to curl the ends a little more (it&#x27;s losing some of its natural wave)</li>
            <li>I ordered mine for a cosplay that&#x27;s a way off, thankfully, so I can order a new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, very long, like cover boobies long, just so you know haha and thick which is good for covering hair in the back if you naturally have long/thick hair which I do.</li>
            <li>If this is costume wear, &amp; u have thick hair- either don&#x27;t get this or get a really good hair net because your hair will show.</li>
            <li>It is very soft</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always very useful to have a couple of simple wigs for cosplays with simple hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; and the hair looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>This is a definite recommendation and it came exactly on time.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying as long as it&#x27;s for a costume or show and</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a pretty solid wig for the price.</li>
            <li>I have other wigs all made by different people, this being the most inexpensive one</li>
            <li>It was a little more thin than I Was expecting and was shedding a lot, but I can&#x27;t complain To much since I did get it pretty cheap, its really soft too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a not wig for people who are super serious cosplayers/costumers, but really nice for people who are starting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as full as other wigs I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>quality- the wefts are rather obvious and a bit widely spaced right at the top of the head, a nude wig cap under it and very careful styling helped.</li>
            <li>also used the same grey cover-up in a light blonde shade on the roots of the wig to make it look a little more natural.</li>
            <li>The wig came in a hair net(good sign), and then it was placed inside a plastic bag which in turn was put in a large yellow shipping envelope.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the top is a little see-through.</li>
            <li>VERY platinum blonde.</li>
            <li>It feels like human and it curls very well.</li>
            <li>not everyday wear.</li>
            <li>is that i contacted the seller directly after i ordered and asked if the wig came with a wig cap</li>
            <li>the hair was soft and didn&#x27;t tangle easily.&lt;br /&gt;However ...</li>
            <li>Complete ripoff.</li>
            <li>Used this for an adult Elsa costume.</li>
            <li>We had no trouble getting this wig on</li>
            <li>It almost definitely will not pass as real hair.:/</li>
            <li>I got the wig in blonde for a few assorted cosplays and I really love it a lot, the bangs need to be trimmed a bit</li>
            <li>This is a nice mid-range wig that isn&#x27;t too thin.</li>
            <li>hair strands are quite thick but the hair feels a lot better than the wings you find around</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very shiny and super blonde, might need to lighten my black brows for the costume.</li>
            <li>I was told that I wouldn&#x27;t get this wig until a few days before Halloween, but it came very early in October instead, so I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly it was sent to me.</li>
            <li>Not obvious from the front, really only if someone was taller than me looking down at top of my head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably more comfortable if you have a tiny little round head, but I guess mine is big, so</li>
            <li>Also the edging on the edge under the bangs is rather thick and obvious, when styling bangs to the side had to do some creative styling to make it not show.</li>
            <li>This weak is definitely a lot of fun and is worth what you pay for it</li>
            <li>and it was hard to fit on my head.</li>
            <li>I was actually quite surprised with the quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sheds; Not really bad or annoyingly but more than normal wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, if it came in dark brunette I would buy another right away for my next cosplay!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other wigs for events, n they all feel n look real</li>
            <li>The wig cap simply does not have enough hair attached to conceal it completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun that I had to wear it for a little bit!</li>
            <li>I had a lot of loose strands falling out of the wig, and the wig didn&#x27;t sit flat on my head because of the bump my real hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can&#x27;t do high ponytails (not that I expected to, but...</li>
            <li>only other problem I have is that my hair is quite long on its own, and I had a hard time finding a way of putting it up inside of the wig.</li>
            <li>good wig but colour was straw like and not at all as white blonde as in photo, bit disappointing.</li>
            <li>Because of this, the tracks tend to show through when moved a certain way, but some slight teasing and hairspray helps</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather pointy on the top of my head until I work on flattening it down, and it&#x27;s hard to get it to stay on, even with a wig cap.  </li>
            <li>since it&#x27;s a wig head, it might be shorter because real people&#x27;s heads are slightly</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> quality was extremely good...</li>
            <li> It would be good for a costume party, maybe, but not for every day use.</li>
            <li> Super happy customer!!</li>
            <li> I added some golden wefts and it is the perfect wig for Sailor Venus!  </li>
            <li> It is thicker then most but doesn&#x27;t have a great feel to it.</li>
            <li> Actually kind of surprising.</li>
            <li> Really good wig for the price, but it falls off very easily.</li>

            <li> Great length, color and fit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Nice wig for Cosplay</li>
            <li> The quality of this wig is surprisingly nice for the price.</li>
            <li> but it has a nice length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-fits nicely and stays on with a wig cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wig would never lie nicely like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> , the seller responded very quickly that it indeed came with one, however, there was not one in the box, but even still, i&#x27;m very happy that after hours pf contemplation on which wig would be my first ever online bought wig i chose this one,</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at the quality of this wig very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> First thing I&#x27;d like to mention is that COSPLAY INSHOP has great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t exactly matter I have decided to keep the wig because of the great quality.</li>
            <li> Very good quality,just like real hair, and stayed nice and almost tangle free all day :)  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very cheap</li>
            <li> The strands kind of come off too easy.</li>
            <li> A quick comb with a wide-tooth comb and they are good to go.</li>
            <li> It is also kind of easy to see the mesh around the top of the head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt better wigs, but I needed it for a costume.</li>
            <li> This wig was just okay.  </li>
            <li> Love it and will order more.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Went to a costume party dressed as Penny from the Big Bang Theory!&lt;br /&gt;The wig was perfect!</li>
            <li> I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> you want a wig either just for fun, or for an occasion, this is a good wig to choose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> but the thing I don&#x27;t like is that it makes it looks like you have a mushroom head layer on the top of your head where the bangs are....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality hair!</li>
            <li> quality is great, not too shiny like many budget wigs, looks and feels like real hair.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed wearing it for Halloween</li>
            <li> Top of this looks like someone butchered it....</li>
            <li> It looks like its hair is thinning on top.</li>
            <li> It shows the wefts throughout the top of the wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks ok if you wear a hat or bandanna over the crown.  </li>
            <li> but I still love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li> Love this wig.</li>
            <li> Love this wig.</li>
            <li> But overall very awesome!</li>
            <li> cute would recommend.</li>
            <li> She has a lot of hair and most wigs won&#x27;t go over her hair and stay on.  </li>
            <li> : Wearing a hat makes this wig a lot more</li>
            <li> I am going to be buying more colors because I do quite like it.</li>
            <li> Got it more as a gag</li>
            <li> This wig is surprisingly real, very soft, beautiful color, and really top quality.</li>
            <li> This wig comes in a great color and the fibers are not ridiculously shinny</li>
            <li> when i took it out of the packaging, the curls were very profound and the color was beautiful.</li>
            <li> It was nice and full and allowed for a versatile look.</li>
            <li> Super bummed as it seemed like a nice wig.</li>
            <li> very full.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks early looks great.</li>
            <li> The wig was longer than expected, which is great!</li>
            <li> So I just got this wig the other day and am impressed by the quality of this wig!</li>
            <li> It came very quickly too.</li>
            <li> It is easy to comb and style.</li>
            <li> Also, does not tangle easily at all, even after I teased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair knots easily.</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the great quality I got for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li> It gets matted easily but store it well</li>
            <li> easily</li>
            <li> I would have liked but the length and quality of the wig really does make up for that!</li>
            <li> Othrr than that love the length and coor was true to the picture.</li>
            <li> Very full towards the bottom with a nice flow to it, not bone straight.</li>
            <li> It looks fine in pictures, but flash photos make it look shiny.</li>
            <li> I straightened bits with my flatiron on 250F just fine.</li>
            <li> Color was accurate.</li>
            <li> I purchased the wig in \\&quot;light blonde\\&quot; color, but the wig is not \\&quot;light blonde\\</li>
            <li> and it really holds its shape nicely.  </li>
            <li> worth more than they charge</li>
            <li> The wig is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It also shipped really fast to my house which I really liked.</li>
            <li> It was more white, but the quality was good.</li>
            <li> To remedy this, I just cut them in a cute, arched, straight bang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its an okay wig, for the price I am not going to complain</li>
            <li> We were able to braid it and it served its purpose, but it looked pretty cheap and tangled quite easily.</li>
            <li> I could never wear it, you could see right through the top.</li>
            <li> The bangs are long, so I just flipped them lol.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a Luna Lovegood costume and had so much fun wearing it!</li>
            <li> have good cheap stuff) above the ear tabs and at the nape of the wig just to secure it into place...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good length for a wig, and it looks pretty realistic when it&#x27;s on, so that&#x27;s a pro.</li>
            <li> Thick, curls are nicely placed and it fits great</li>
            <li> its definitely yellow in color but for the price it was great and made the costume a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture but was longer than I&#x27;d originally thought and slightly wavier than the picture which works great for my applejacks cosplay!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get them to easily sit right and ended up having to cut them to keep them out of my eyes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good for costumes and such</li>
            <li> for the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> It looks wonderful and is easy to put on and wear, however, take a little extra care when combing it out, it shreds easily.</li>
            <li> You simply can&#x27;t get better for this cheap price!</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you want a cheap wig with amazing  color and human hair like texture</li>
            <li> and it is SUPER quality.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The wig looks nice enough, but it doesn&#x27;t fit me right.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty, though, and it feels and looks pretty real; I just wish it fit better, and when I try to pull it into a ponytail, the mesh underneath shows a lot.  </li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s just the wig, but overall it is a pretty good wig for $15.</li>
            <li> pretty good wig overall.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed as a cosplay item!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge difference from natural light.</li>
            <li> I ordered the light blond and ended up getting a wig that is very strawberry blond and almost auburn.</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Not as blonde as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> This wig is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> The color is more platinum blonde instead of light.</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s expected take good care of it</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for fun.</li>
            <li> So much fun to wear</li>
            <li> The shipping took some time, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> There are lots of different kinds on the market, but I chose a nice liquidy mascara type.</li>
            <li> The wig came pretty quickly (for shipping from China).</li>
            <li> Item was as described and priced right.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s somewhat of the right size.</li>
            <li> This wig came right when it said it would</li>
            <li> it was just right.</li>
            <li> Again, for the price can&#x27;t really complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased and definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> The color it exactly the same in the picture, and it feel really nice.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use to cover specific spots.</li>
            <li> are my more major complaints:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved how this wig (I got the light blonde color), had a natural shine which could have fooled people into thinking it was my real hair if I had a hat</li>
            <li> Pretty fun wig to wear.</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft, easy to brush, and cut to look exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li> Very realistic looking!</li>
            <li> This wig is overall very nice and similar to the picture.</li>
            <li> They may claim that it &amp;#34;fits most head sizes&amp;#34;, but it wouldn&#x27;t fit my fairly average sized head (I measured).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like it for my first cosplay wig.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s real hair!</li>
            <li> when it says heat resistant, it really does means resistant!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute, but just wish you couldn&#x27;t see the hair net underneath, you can tell its a wig.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast too!</li>
            <li> So much hair!</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased another wig as back up after this one took over a month to ship!</li>
            <li> definitely not Elsa from Frozen, more like her sister.</li>
            <li> , exactly what I was expecting for an 8 dollar wig.</li>
            <li> just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full and thick and good quality.  </li>
            <li> The bangs don&#x27;t really look like the picture, and I purchased the very light blonde one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full and soft!</li>
            <li> The blonde shade is exactly the same and the length is good.</li>
            <li> and it came with a wig net for your hair which was a nice and unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li> While I love the hair quality and texture (it feels real), this is a costume quality wig that when worn does show the wig cap construction (tracks) beneath in the back.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see your hair around the edges of the front).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle part, or side parts on either side is pretty much what you can do.</li>
            <li> Other than the bangs, it was very easy to cut and style as I needed it.</li>
            <li> You have to be very particular with how you part it, or else the wig cap will show through.</li>
            <li> SUPER SOFT.</li>
            <li> Super thin on the top and got tangled SO easily.</li>
            <li> If you move the hair a certain way you can see the cap underneath.</li>
            <li> I tried using a large barrel curling iron to add a bit of volume to the bangs...</li>
            <li> I do not have a large head and there isn&#x27;t any stretching going on.</li>
            <li> Even though I am practically going to dismember this wig, It was fun to wear around and felt natural too!</li>
            <li> If you wear some kind of hat with it though it can easily cover it up or you can possibly add a few wefts between the gaps.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Feels real and isn&#x27;t super thin like most cheap wigs.</li>
            <li> that the light blonde is VERY light platinum or ash blonde, nearly white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> color is a little more yellow than pictured, but is okay.</li>
            <li> However, I ordered light blonde</li>
            <li> I ordered the light blonde.</li>
            <li> Does this look light blonde!?</li>
            <li> The only problems I have with this wig are that it sheds a lot, and the cap didn&#x27;t quite fit my head.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t cover my hairline very well.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use a pony tail or a bun, because it creates too much of a bump.</li>
            <li> Looks very wig-y...</li>
            <li> I just ran my fingers through it and it was ready to use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really look like the pictures.</li>
            <li> Kept turning it hotter and hotter, never did make much of any difference at all.</li>
            <li> so she doesn&#x27;t wear it much)</li>
            <li> I was GENTLE with handling it</li>
            <li> The wig was hideous and it went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> Wife tells me it feels like real hair and very well made.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> but I really like this wig.</li>
            <li> Looks real.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig in light blonde.</li>
            <li> It fit me but if wanted to pull the wig hair up in a ponytail or such my hairline would be exposed.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> hair is very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> all the color selections, they appear very fun,vibrant and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be the light blonde color, but the one I received is orange-y?</li>
            <li> and it is a cheap way to figure out if I like being blonde</li>
            <li> (bought the light blonde wig).</li>
            <li> It also sheds quite a bit and isn&#x27;t very heat resistant.</li>
            <li> Bangs are thick, good color.</li>
            <li> For a fifteen dollar wig it looks very real and very natural.</li>
            <li> Not really complaining, it was inconvenient but a nice sign of good quality!</li>
            <li> The wig was very nice and soft &amp; it came in at least a week.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, it can a month early!</li>
            <li> Its a very nice, pale blonde as the picture show.</li>
            <li> I love wigs and have several of them, however, this is the first blonde one I have purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li> The synthetic fibers don&#x27;t tangle like other wigs, and can be styled pretty easily.</li>
            <li> and so I can&#x27;t clip it unless I am okay with getting head aches, and when i first put it on, quite a few fibers started falling out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s not very full at the top.. if you try to re-position the hair or part it in another way, you will see the hair net.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was packaged nicely on arrival, with an included wig cap (usually sold for around $1-$2 USD), which was also individually wrapped in its original wrapping.</li>
            <li> I would recommend It to people if they are looking for a cheap long wig that can get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is closer to an orangey gold blonde but the hair itself is nice enough for an 8 year old to play hair dresser with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is true to color and actually seems a bit longer than the picture.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty please with it so far.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly but was a yellow-y color and shiny and obviously synthetic hair... very tangled and not at all realistic looking.</li>
            <li> There is a large bald spot right next to the bangs.</li>
            <li> Nothing too realistic</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have enough time and patience to get all your hair into it, because it really does take like thirty minutes to put on if your hair is long.</li>
            <li> Also, this doesn&#x27;t come with a wig cap, which is kind of standard if you&#x27;ve purchased other decent quality wigs.</li>
            <li> If you were considering this wig for Halloween, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> have a couple of high quality synthetic wigs (Lacefronts, Arda brand)</li>
            <li> fibers are soft, although you might find them a tad shiny in certain lighting.</li>
            <li> , I naturally have dark hair and these hairs are quite obviously, very light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-i noticed that the more you touch/stroke/brush it, it gets a little frizzy, out of place and won&#x27;t return to its normal state.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft, it&#x27;s not thin at all.</li>
            <li> It was much thinner and does not style nearly as well.</li>
            <li> far, everyone has flipped out and can&#x27;t believe I got my hair to lighten so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slightly darker color than what is shown but really amazing quality especially for a $10 wig.</li>
            <li> I tried adjusting it different ways, but I can&#x27;t get it to look right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I would like to curl the ends a little more (it&#x27;s losing some of its natural wave)</li>
            <li> I ordered mine for a cosplay that&#x27;s a way off, thankfully, so I can order a new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, very long, like cover boobies long, just so you know haha and thick which is good for covering hair in the back if you naturally have long/thick hair which I do.</li>
            <li> If this is costume wear, &amp; u have thick hair- either don&#x27;t get this or get a really good hair net because your hair will show.</li>
            <li> It is very soft</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always very useful to have a couple of simple wigs for cosplays with simple hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; and the hair looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> This is a definite recommendation and it came exactly on time.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying as long as it&#x27;s for a costume or show and</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a pretty solid wig for the price.</li>
            <li> I have other wigs all made by different people, this being the most inexpensive one</li>
            <li> It was a little more thin than I Was expecting and was shedding a lot, but I can&#x27;t complain To much since I did get it pretty cheap, its really soft too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a not wig for people who are super serious cosplayers/costumers, but really nice for people who are starting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as full as other wigs I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> quality- the wefts are rather obvious and a bit widely spaced right at the top of the head, a nude wig cap under it and very careful styling helped.</li>
            <li> also used the same grey cover-up in a light blonde shade on the roots of the wig to make it look a little more natural.</li>
            <li> The wig came in a hair net(good sign), and then it was placed inside a plastic bag which in turn was put in a large yellow shipping envelope.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the top is a little see-through.</li>
            <li> VERY platinum blonde.</li>
            <li> It feels like human and it curls very well.</li>
            <li> not everyday wear.</li>
            <li> is that i contacted the seller directly after i ordered and asked if the wig came with a wig cap</li>
            <li> the hair was soft and didn&#x27;t tangle easily.&lt;br /&gt;However ...</li>
            <li> Complete ripoff.</li>
            <li> Used this for an adult Elsa costume.</li>
            <li> We had no trouble getting this wig on</li>
            <li> It almost definitely will not pass as real hair.:/</li>
            <li> I got the wig in blonde for a few assorted cosplays and I really love it a lot, the bangs need to be trimmed a bit</li>
            <li> This is a nice mid-range wig that isn&#x27;t too thin.</li>
            <li> hair strands are quite thick but the hair feels a lot better than the wings you find around</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very shiny and super blonde, might need to lighten my black brows for the costume.</li>
            <li> I was told that I wouldn&#x27;t get this wig until a few days before Halloween, but it came very early in October instead, so I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly it was sent to me.</li>
            <li> Not obvious from the front, really only if someone was taller than me looking down at top of my head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably more comfortable if you have a tiny little round head, but I guess mine is big, so</li>
            <li> Also the edging on the edge under the bangs is rather thick and obvious, when styling bangs to the side had to do some creative styling to make it not show.</li>
            <li> This weak is definitely a lot of fun and is worth what you pay for it</li>
            <li> and it was hard to fit on my head.</li>
            <li> I was actually quite surprised with the quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> sheds; Not really bad or annoyingly but more than normal wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, if it came in dark brunette I would buy another right away for my next cosplay!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other wigs for events, n they all feel n look real</li>
            <li> The wig cap simply does not have enough hair attached to conceal it completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun that I had to wear it for a little bit!</li>
            <li> I had a lot of loose strands falling out of the wig, and the wig didn&#x27;t sit flat on my head because of the bump my real hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t do high ponytails (not that I expected to, but...</li>
            <li> only other problem I have is that my hair is quite long on its own, and I had a hard time finding a way of putting it up inside of the wig.</li>
            <li> good wig but colour was straw like and not at all as white blonde as in photo, bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Because of this, the tracks tend to show through when moved a certain way, but some slight teasing and hairspray helps</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather pointy on the top of my head until I work on flattening it down, and it&#x27;s hard to get it to stay on, even with a wig cap.  </li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s a wig head, it might be shorter because real people&#x27;s heads are slightly</li>
            <li> no effect until the very hottest setting made a very slight bit of curl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an elastic band with hooks in the back, but no combs - so it was secure on my head with a wig cap but without a cap, it slips just a bit (nothing dramatic like falling off your head</li>
            <li> In regards to the brown one, while the blonde wig I purchased previously was very luscious and thick, the brown one left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong color wig, I ordered this in light blonde and got a red wig.</li>
            <li> I know this wig will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I put my wig cap on, I applied a dark blonde root cover to the edges that still poked out (above my ears and a little in the very front.)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even shed out of the package, and only had a stubborn little knot which was quickly fixed.</li>
            <li> top looked a little thin</li>
            <li> A little dry shampoo will dull the artificial shine but it looks and fits wonderful</li>
            <li> but I doubt it will last very long at the rate of which the hair falls out..</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see such amazing quality because it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> i tried it on about 3 times so far for 1 minute or less</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t know how to take care of long wigs, how to put on long wigs properly</li>
            <li> Came quickly but extremely thin.</li>
            <li> When it finally came in, the wig was not a light blonde but almost red auburn copper blonde...</li>
            <li> Fits an adult head but was purchased for a little girl.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for mannequin for work, the texture and fullness of this hair is great although I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the coloring.</li>
            <li> The bangs are pretty difficult to convince to do anything other than fall straight down your face, but with enough heat and hairspray they finally complied a bit.</li>
            <li> If not styled properly, you can see the weft, but its not much of an issue.</li>
            <li> the bangs are too long for my face.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, though, the bangs are long</li>
            <li> Not natural looking</li>
            <li> started at a cautious low temperature not really trusting it not to melt...</li>
            <li> It does have its patchy areas in the back, but nothing too extreme.</li>
            <li> Will definitely by this in other colors.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely consider some other colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> couple tips if you have dark hair and want to wear this specific color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty, but thin.</li>
            <li> If I kept the hair down, and covering the back and side of my head, you couldn&#x27;t see my hair underneath.  </li>
            <li> The wig is much more yellow looking than the picture shows, it looks like a really fake color, and it is really small, I have a average size head</li>
            <li> I mean, it functions as a wig and all, but the color doesn&#x27;t look like a normal hair</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you have dark hair and get a blonde one.</li>
            <li> So if you have dark hair like me, even with a blonde wig cap it can be difficult to completely cover all of your natural hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Comes with a net and a little gift too.</li>
            <li> Little frizzy at the ends but even regular hair does</li>
            <li> a ton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are a little different than pictured, they aren&#x27;t quite as side swept, and when i tried to part them like the picture, the tracks showed.</li>
            <li> Money well spent in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> The color and quality of the fibers are really nice, but the wig net shows terribly at the part on the blonde.</li>
            <li> it of course sheds a bit and gets a few tangles, but for the price, it&#x27;s a total deal!</li>
            <li> Also, it barely hits past your shoulders.</li>
            <li> The color is just as described and it is soft, but the hair is too thin around the back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice enough looking wig, but the hair is quite bit thin and you can definitely see the base around the front of the wig, and if you try to pull the bangs back or style them.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is its thin and is a little tight but other then that I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so I have thick dark natural hair and this wig did not come with a wig cap</li>
            <li> The wig looks like it has bangs, but it must be longer strands tucked and pinned to the other side.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with anything for your hair to go into (other than the wig itself).</li>
            <li> and it goes past my bra line I plan on using this as a make shift Edward Elric wig the only problem</li>
            <li> but Im not really certain how!</li>
            <li> Terrible color but great for my little sister to practice hair styling on!</li>
            <li> ONLY complaint</li>
            <li> If the wind blows, chances are anyone standing behind you will clearly see the tracks.</li>
            <li> The bangs are down to my chin.</li>
            <li> the wind here gets crazy and that has kept it from blowing right off</li>
            <li> So if you leave them slightly split</li>
            <li> It started to come apart slightly when I was fixing it</li>
            <li> If you use a black one, it will show through.</li>
            <li> I do not have a terrible issue with shedding, I kind of expected it since it&#x27;s a long wig, but it&#x27;s hardly even mild.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bangs are extremely long and the wig is hard to fashion.</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time, but I was a little let down to see how it was packaged.</li>
            <li> The color is a little lighter than the picture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too shiny</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that it sheds like a cat!</li>
            <li> and i can tell it&#x27;s getting a little frizzy and static-y at the ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding the part in the hair.</li>
            <li> but if you need a cheep wig to keep you covered for a few days</li>
            <li> When your wig looks like it needs a hair transplant, you know you wasted your money.</li>
            <li> i ordered this to wear to a convention in a few months, so i can&#x27;t tell you how it wears for hours on end, but i will say this</li>
            <li> Poorly constructed wig with VERY short pieces of hair up in the front.</li>
            <li> The down side is that it is really small</li>
            <li> , i have very thick black hair, and when i put this wig on, there was none of the black hair showing, it was not thin, nor was it too fake looking.</li>
            <li> Bought this wig as part of a Halloween costume and found it to be difficult to use in comparison to other wigs I&#x27;ve purchased for the same reason.</li>
            <li> I also dusted it with some powder and hairspray to dull down</li>
            <li> Super annoying...</li>
            <li> The bangs are a bit heavy and hard to work with, but all in all it contrasts well with my steampunk costume.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting it to be so small.  </li>
            <li> This color is disgusting and the wig is cheap!</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t put heat on it, so I&#x27;m not sure about curling it or</li>
            <li> I wish I could make a exchange, sadly it seems the seller only allows returns.</li>
            <li> Was too small.</li>
            <li> The thickness is not incredible, but just thick enough so that the tracks do not show when resting on both my shoulders.</li>
            <li> When I tried to brush it from being kept in the bag the hair just started falling out. :/</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m afraid it will turn into a bigger mess before the halloween event i&#x27;m attending, so maybe i will pass.</li>
            <li> VERY stiff.</li>
            <li> fake-looking and hard</li>
            <li> It is wavy, &amp; you will have to adjust the bangs to your style which is a bit hard.</li>
            <li> A little thin but served the purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick with lots of hair on each weft.</li>
            <li> and I have thick hair underneath.</li>
            <li> Resistant&lt;br /&gt;~Long and thick</li>
            <li> I have thick hair .</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that it is, of course, not top-tier quality, but to expect that for under $40 would be ridiculous.</li>
            <li> so it looks a little fake.</li>
            <li> It is an ugly shiny yellow and the cap shows through.</li>
            <li> USELESS WASTE OF MONEY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Run your fingers threw it and hair comes out like crazy.. also hard to tame.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thin and itchy.</li>
            <li> but when I put it on, you couldn&#x27;t see the thin parts (my hair is</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with how it fits on my head, as I am only using the hair wefts to glue onto another foam base wig.</li>
            <li> The wig base cap thing a majig is a bit smaller than  </li>
            <li> It was so thin</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> It is, however, on the thin side.</li>
            <li> mean, I know there are dyes and all, but this color screams fake), and it looks fake.</li>
            <li> now it looks silly because it looks too thin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t return it unfortunately</li>
            <li> However, it was still somewhat uncomfortable for me.  </li>
            <li> Came to wrong address</li>
            <li> &amp; it was a weird adjustment.</li>
            <li> The wig is very thin.</li>
            <li> The wig was very thin.</li>
            <li> The bangs are bulky and an awkward length.</li>
            <li> and this one was a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Because they are so inexpensive, I never worry about them getting dirty.</li>
            <li> They are obviously artificial, but since I use them to display my handmade wares, I don&#x27;t care about that.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed product, furthermore the wig arrives way past its delivery date.</li>
            <li> Wig hairline is very fake looking.  </li>
            <li> Very fake looking-- like straw</li>
            <li> It was a bad choice to spend my money on.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed, but the wig will serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for my Harley Quinn costume, I was afraid the wig wouldn&#x27;t come until after Halloween, but it came after a week of ordering it, and before Halloween!</li>
            <li> Too bad they&#x27;ll never know!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> dont waist money on it very disappointed</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Just terrible</li>
            <li> Looks awful and might make the wig unwearable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst, but it&#x27;s not the best.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> believable.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting insane quality for $10, but it works for what I got it for.</li>

            <li> That was the ugliest wig I ever saw I threw it in the trash</li>
            <li> The wig is same as the photo.  It&#x27;s full and thick and good quality.  Comes with a net and a little gift too. I would buy another color too from the same seller.  It came very quickly too.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and very easy to style. Almost a platinum blonde tone.</li>
            <li> I purchased the wig in \\&quot;light blonde\\&quot; color, but the wig is not \\&quot;light blonde\\&quot; it is color yellow instead, like Sponge Bob yellow color, totally different front the picture model showed and the seller description of the wig&#x27;s color. Very disappointed product, furthermore the wig arrives way past its delivery date. It took 4 weeks to arrive from China.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt better wigs, but I needed it for a costume. It&#x27;s really thin and itchy.</li>
            <li> This wig is thin and cheap, so you are getting what you pay for. You have to be very particular with how you part it, or else the wig cap will show through. After wearing it for one day it began shedding everywhere!</li>
            <li> color is a little more yellow than pictured, but is okay. length is perfect. came with a wig net cap. can&#x27;t wait to use it for cosplay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: used it for cosplay. Can&#x27;t return it unfortunately but there wasn&#x27;t enough hair to cover the back so I have to go buy another one now for the next event.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Only came to my shoulders. It is an ugly shiny yellow and the cap shows through.</li>
            <li> This wig was just okay.  It was inexpensive, so while the quality was only so-so, that&#x27;s what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my more major complaints:&lt;br /&gt;- I was not expecting it to be so small.  They may claim that it &amp;#34;fits most head sizes&amp;#34;, but it wouldn&#x27;t fit my fairly average sized head (I measured).  If I kept the hair down, and covering the back and side of my head, you couldn&#x27;t see my hair underneath.  However, it was still somewhat uncomfortable for me.  In the end I had to return it and look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;- The bangs are also shorter than they appear in the picture.</li>
            <li> For starters, you get what you paid for. Overall, I like the length and the texture of the hair. However, I ordered light blonde and I got sent blonde, which is a deep gold and not what I needed whatsoever. I had trouble finding the part in the hair. The wig looks like it has bangs, but it must be longer strands tucked and pinned to the other side. The wig only serves me well in the sense that my costume requires a hat (thank GOD).</li>
            <li> This wig is surprisingly real, very soft, beautiful color, and really top quality. True to color!!!!! Love it and will order more.</li>
            <li> I ordered the light blonde. Does this look light blonde!? No! This color is disgusting and the wig is cheap! I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> This wig is so much better than I was expecting! It&#x27;s thick with lots of hair on each weft. You simply can&#x27;t get better for this cheap price! 5/5 Stars</li>
            <li> Item was as described and priced right.</li>
            <li> Bought this wig as part of a Halloween costume and found it to be difficult to use in comparison to other wigs I&#x27;ve purchased for the same reason. The bangs are bulky and an awkward length. I couldn&#x27;t get them to easily sit right and ended up having to cut them to keep them out of my eyes. Also, this doesn&#x27;t come with a wig cap, which is kind of standard if you&#x27;ve purchased other decent quality wigs. Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this wig! Keep in mind that it is, of course, not top-tier quality, but to expect that for under $40 would be ridiculous. This is a nice mid-range wig that isn&#x27;t too thin. It does have its patchy areas in the back, but nothing too extreme. The hair is very soft, easy to brush, and cut to look exactly like the picture shown. The color also matches. It was packaged nicely on arrival, with an included wig cap (usually sold for around $1-$2 USD), which was also individually wrapped in its original wrapping. I&#x27;m definitely happy with this purchase and will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Came to wrong address</li>
            <li> First thing I&#x27;d like to mention is that COSPLAY INSHOP has great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They responded back to my messages promptly and shipped out my order right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute wig, not the best quality, but the quality was pretty darn good for the price! I loved how this wig (I got the light blonde color), had a natural shine which could have fooled people into thinking it was my real hair if I had a hat on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely reorder from them again for future cosplay needs!</li>
            <li> Went to a costume party dressed as Penny from the Big Bang Theory!&lt;br /&gt;The wig was perfect! Very easy to wear!</li>
            <li> Terrible color but great for my little sister to practice hair styling on! That was the only intention so if you were looking for a platinum blonde wig, this is not it. This is closer to an orangey gold blonde but the hair itself is nice enough for an 8 year old to play hair dresser with.</li>
            <li> worked perfect for Alice in Wonderland wig.  even trimmed it and still looked great</li>
            <li> The wig is much more yellow looking than the picture shows, it looks like a really fake color, and it is really small, I have a average size head and it was hard to fit on my head.</li>
            <li> It got tangled instantly!</li>
            <li> Not as blonde as I would have liked.  It was more white, but the quality was good.</li>
            <li> It is very soft I got it 2 weeks early looks great. Only downside is its thin and is a little tight but other then that I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This wig is pretty cool. Money well spent in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at the quality of this wig very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> The wig came pretty quickly (for shipping from China). I received it about 6-7 days after placing my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is true to color and actually seems a bit longer than the picture. It came to my bust - I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8.&lt;br /&gt;(I figured since it&#x27;s a wig head, it might be shorter because real people&#x27;s heads are slightly bigger.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an elastic band with hooks in the back, but no combs - so it was secure on my head with a wig cap but without a cap, it slips just a bit (nothing dramatic like falling off your head lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top looked a little thin but when I put it on, you couldn&#x27;t see the thin parts (my hair is dark).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sheds; Not really bad or annoyingly but more than normal wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t do high ponytails (not that I expected to, but... just in case someone wanted to know. You&#x27;ll see your hair around the edges of the front).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle part, or side parts on either side is pretty much what you can do. The bangs are long, so I just flipped them lol. The wig looks JUST LIKE the picture - It has those waves at throughout the wig (I&#x27;m scared to style it or ruin it, I haven&#x27;t put heat on it, so I&#x27;m not sure about curling it or straightening)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uhm, I never owed a cosplay wig before now... so I can&#x27;t compare it. It looks fine in pictures, but flash photos make it look shiny. It&#x27;s a huge difference from natural light. Actually kind of surprising. I&#x27;m not bothered by it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it for my first cosplay wig. I plan on wearing it to Katsucon. Maybe cosplay or just for raves.</li>
            <li> The wig was longer than expected, which is great! It didn&#x27;t even shed out of the package, and only had a stubborn little knot which was quickly fixed. I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with how it fits on my head, as I am only using the hair wefts to glue onto another foam base wig. Even though I am practically going to dismember this wig, It was fun to wear around and felt natural too! If you&#x27;re looking for a great affordable wig this would be it.</li>
            <li> The color is just as described and it is soft, but the hair is too thin around the back.</li>
            <li> I love this wig! I am puerto rican so I have thick dark natural hair and this wig did not come with a wig cap but thankfully I already had one. This wig is absolutely perfect. I am in love with it. The color is a little lighter than the picture but I figured it would be - it&#x27;s an ash blonde in actuality. It&#x27;s so soft, it&#x27;s not thin at all. You can&#x27;t see my wig cap under it at all. I love it. I want to order the rest of the colors now. This is a definite recommendation and it came exactly on time. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Bought for a fionna cosplay. If not styled properly, you can see the weft, but its not much of an issue.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i needed. it&#x27;s somewhat of the right size. the bangs are too long for my face. nothing i can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wig with lots of real-looking hair. It is easy to comb and style. I was shocked to see such amazing quality because it was so inexpensive. I plan to order another one in a different color for next year&#x27;s Comiccon.</li>
            <li> I was told that I wouldn&#x27;t get this wig until a few days before Halloween, but it came very early in October instead, so I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly it was sent to me. It&#x27;s a good length for a wig, and it looks pretty realistic when it&#x27;s on, so that&#x27;s a pro. The only problems I have with this wig are that it sheds a lot, and the cap didn&#x27;t quite fit my head. It&#x27;s probably more comfortable if you have a tiny little round head, but I guess mine is big, so it didn&#x27;t cover my hairline very well. Thankfully, though, the bangs are long so they disguised my hair well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other problem I have is that my hair is quite long on its own, and I had a hard time finding a way of putting it up inside of the wig. It doesn&#x27;t come with anything for your hair to go into (other than the wig itself). I had a lot of loose strands falling out of the wig, and the wig didn&#x27;t sit flat on my head because of the bump my real hair created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a wig either just for fun, or for an occasion, this is a good wig to choose. Just make sure you have enough time and patience to get all your hair into it, because it really does take like thirty minutes to put on if your hair is long. You can&#x27;t use a pony tail or a bun, because it creates too much of a bump. You have to be creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> VERY platinum blonde. VERY stiff. Looks very wig-y... The bangs are down to my chin. I was very disappointed when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> This wig looks nothing like whats pictured. It was a bad choice to spend my money on. Just terrible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful wig. The only problem is the top is a little see-through. If you move the hair a certain way you can see the cap underneath. However, I kept it styled just like in the picture and it looks wonderful. Very full towards the bottom with a nice flow to it, not bone straight.</li>
            <li> This wig came right when it said it would and it was already perfectly curled when I took it out of the packaging. I didnt need to brush it or untangle it I just ran my fingers through it and it was ready to use. I love it so much, very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> So I just got this wig the other day and am impressed by the quality of this wig! For a fifteen dollar wig it looks very real and very natural. You can get away with it, by fooling everyone it&#x27;s real hair! The only problem is the bangs! They don&#x27;t really look like the pictures. If I push the bangs all the way to the side you can see my hair underneath. So if you leave them slightly split it&#x27;s okay but the thing I don&#x27;t like is that it makes it looks like you have a mushroom head layer on the top of your head where the bangs are....So the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this wig are the bangs. The bangs don&#x27;t really look like the picture, and I purchased the very light blonde one. They don&#x27;t push all the way to the side, &amp; if they did, this wig would&#x27;ve been perfect.</li>
            <li> Very yellow. Not natural looking</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best but it&#x27;s ok... It&#x27;s not as full as other wigs I&#x27;ve bought. The strands kind of come off too easy. It&#x27;s a little too shiny so it looks a little fake. I&#x27;ve bought other wigs for events, n they all feel n look real and this one was a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Very good quality,just like real hair, and stayed nice and almost tangle free all day :)  I know this wig will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality hair! The cap construction, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the light blonde is VERY light platinum or ash blonde, nearly white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair quality is great, not too shiny like many budget wigs, looks and feels like real hair. Other than the bangs, it was very easy to cut and style as I needed it. The bangs are pretty difficult to convince to do anything other than fall straight down your face, but with enough heat and hairspray they finally complied a bit. Speaking of- when it says heat resistant, it really does means resistant! I tried using a large barrel curling iron to add a bit of volume to the bangs... started at a cautious low temperature not really trusting it not to melt... no effect until the very hottest setting made a very slight bit of curl. Kept turning it hotter and hotter, never did make much of any difference at all. I suspect it would have to be boil set. Not really complaining, it was inconvenient but a nice sign of good quality! Also, does not tangle easily at all, even after I teased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction quality- the wefts are rather obvious and a bit widely spaced right at the top of the head, a nude wig cap under it and very careful styling helped. Not obvious from the front, really only if someone was taller than me looking down at top of my head. Also the edging on the edge under the bangs is rather thick and obvious, when styling bangs to the side had to do some creative styling to make it not show. Again, for the price can&#x27;t really complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased and definitely would buy again. In fact, if it came in dark brunette I would buy another right away for my next cosplay!</li>
            <li> Really good wig for the price, but it falls off very easily. I enjoyed wearing it for Halloween and it came with a wig net for your hair which was a nice and unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I should have not gone by the images shown by the seller. The color is more platinum blonde instead of light. I wish I could make a exchange, sadly it seems the seller only allows returns. The wig, however, does the job. The synthetic fibers don&#x27;t tangle like other wigs, and can be styled pretty easily.</li>
            <li> The wig base cap thing a majig is a bit smaller than  I would have liked but the length and quality of the wig really does make up for that! I got the wig in blonde for a few assorted cosplays and I really love it a lot, the bangs need to be trimmed a bit but thats not skin off my teeth. I may purchase this wig again in another colour if my wallet condones it! I would show pictures of the blonde but Im not really certain how! Its a very nice, pale blonde as the picture show. I added some golden wefts and it is the perfect wig for Sailor Venus!  Edit: In regards to the brown one, while the blonde wig I purchased previously was very luscious and thick, the brown one left much to be desired. It was much thinner and does not style nearly as well. I am a bit disappointed, but the wig will serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> Not the best wig. But great for its price! I nought this as a gift to see if the person would like wigs (got it during summer time so she doesn&#x27;t wear it much) but if you need a cheep wig to keep you covered for a few days it&#x27;s nice. Tangles up at the ends but, it&#x27;s expected take good care of it and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> Definitely looks like a synthetic wig and has orange coloration. Not what I expected at all. Hopefully I can change the color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t opened the package until yesterday and as I was going to try it on, the hair started falling and did not stop!!&lt;br /&gt;  I was GENTLE with handling it and it does not matter. USELESS WASTE OF MONEY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  DO not buy!!!</li>
            <li> does not look nothing like picture but you get what u pay for huh...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute, but just wish you couldn&#x27;t see the hair net underneath, you can tell its a wig. Run your fingers threw it and hair comes out like crazy.. also hard to tame.</li>
            <li> Top of this looks like someone butchered it....dont waist money on it very disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for fun. It is the dumbest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen. It looks like its hair is thinning on top. You can see the netting underneath, and there isn&#x27;t enough hair to comb over &amp; cover it. When your wig looks like it needs a hair transplant, you know you wasted your money.</li>
            <li> Was too small. Biggest dissapointment of my life</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to be</li>
            <li> It started to come apart slightly when I was fixing it but its alright overall</li>
            <li> The wig was very nice and soft &amp; it came in at least a week. It shows the wefts throughout the top of the wig.&lt;br /&gt;By the third time I wore it, it became very tangled and messy. I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t know how to take care of long wigs, how to put on long wigs properly or it&#x27;s just the wig, but overall it is a pretty good wig for $15.</li>
            <li> There is a large bald spot right next to the bangs. Looks awful and might make the wig unwearable. Bangs are extremely long and the wig is hard to fashion. It is thicker then most but doesn&#x27;t have a great feel to it. Color was accurate.</li>
            <li> Wig hairline is very fake looking.  Looks ok if you wear a hat or bandanna over the crown.  Hair knots easily.</li>
            <li> Junk junk junk junk...go spend 10 dollars at a Halloween shop!!!</li>
            <li> I just got it and am extremely happy with it I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and it goes past my bra line I plan on using this as a make shift Edward Elric wig the only problem is it could have been thicker but I still love it I recommend this if you want a cheap wig with amazing  color and human hair like texture</li>
            <li> this wig will make any girl or boy go gaga over the wearer.</li>
            <li> Sheds ALOT!!!!! It&#x27;s cute but I doubt it will last very long at the rate of which the hair falls out.. Super annoying...</li>
            <li> SUPER SOFT. Little frizzy at the ends but even regular hair does that!!!~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this for elsa and it is SUPER quality.</li>
            <li> The color and quality of the fibers are really nice, but the wig net shows terribly at the part on the blonde. I tried adjusting it different ways, but I can&#x27;t get it to look right. I do not have a large head and there isn&#x27;t any stretching going on. For the price, that&#x27;s unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Pretty fun wig to wear. It was nice and full and allowed for a versatile look.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong color wig, I ordered this in light blonde and got a red wig. It was so thin I could never wear it, you could see right through the top. The wig was hideous and it went straight in the trash. I will never purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It feels like human and it curls very well. It takes time to figure out how to curl it. Just look up tutorials. It straightens perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the great quality I got for such a cheap price! It looks exactly like the picture but was longer than I&#x27;d originally thought and slightly wavier than the picture which works great for my applejacks cosplay! Definitely worth buying as long as it&#x27;s for a costume or show and not everyday wear. Super happy customer!! Shipped fast too!</li>
            <li> this product is beautiful! i ordered this to wear to a convention in a few months, so i can&#x27;t tell you how it wears for hours on end, but i will say this, i have very thick black hair, and when i put this wig on, there was none of the black hair showing, it was not thin, nor was it too fake looking. when i took it out of the packaging, the curls were very profound and the color was beautiful. it of course sheds a bit and gets a few tangles, but for the price, it&#x27;s a total deal! i say if you;re like me and you&#x27;re going to wear this once or twice for a cosplay or a convention, definitely go for this wig!&lt;br /&gt;the ONLY complaint i have about this purchase is that i contacted the seller directly after i ordered and asked if the wig came with a wig cap, the seller responded very quickly that it indeed came with one, however, there was not one in the box, but even still, i&#x27;m very happy that after hours pf contemplation on which wig would be my first ever online bought wig i chose this one, and i&#x27;m very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> Awesome for the price! Feels real and isn&#x27;t super thin like most cheap wigs. I bought more then one color!</li>
            <li> So much fun to wear and it really holds its shape nicely.  A great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed as a cosplay item!</li>
            <li> Wife tells me it feels like real hair and very well made.</li>
            <li> Great quality for price.  Fast shipping.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Really good quality for the price, would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very realistic looking! Bought it for a Luna Lovegood costume and had so much fun wearing it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The wig is very thin.</li>
            <li> Love this wig. This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> The wig looks nice enough, but it doesn&#x27;t fit me right.  It&#x27;s rather pointy on the top of my head until I work on flattening it down, and it&#x27;s hard to get it to stay on, even with a wig cap.  It&#x27;s a bit small and pops off pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty, though, and it feels and looks pretty real; I just wish it fit better, and when I try to pull it into a ponytail, the mesh underneath shows a lot.  I can make it work if I must, but I think I might order a different wig.</li>
            <li> Nice wig for Cosplay it tangles just like any wig does but I really like this wig. Netting shows in the back</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a very simple &amp; low-key cosplay, and hapily, this wig worked out for me! If you were considering this wig for Halloween, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The fibers are soft, although you might find them a tad shiny in certain lighting. The thickness is not incredible, but just thick enough so that the tracks do not show when resting on both my shoulders. I do not have a terrible issue with shedding, I kind of expected it since it&#x27;s a long wig, but it&#x27;s hardly even mild.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a not wig for people who are super serious cosplayers/costumers, but really nice for people who are starting out.&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of high quality synthetic wigs (Lacefronts, Arda brand) and it&#x27;s always very useful to have a couple of simple wigs for cosplays with simple hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;For the price listed, it&#x27;s a definate steal!</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig! The quality of this wig is surprisingly nice for the price. The shipping took some time, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Love this wig. Looks real. Only complaint I have is that it sheds like a cat! So much hair! But overall very awesome!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full and soft! A little dry shampoo will dull the artificial shine but it looks and fits wonderful and I have thick hair underneath.</li>
            <li> Thick, curls are nicely placed and it fits great</li>
            <li> Fits an adult head but was purchased for a little girl. Comes with adjustable hooks on the inside. I plan to put an Frozen Elsa braid in it before I give it as a Christmas gift. It&#x27;s so fun that I had to wear it for a little bit!</li>
            <li> Not great. Super thin on the top and got tangled SO easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig. Nothing too realistic but it has a nice length. It gets matted easily but store it well and it&#x27;s good for costumes and such</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst, but it&#x27;s not the best.&lt;br /&gt;Very fake-looking and hard to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Great length, color and fit. Arrived quickly. However, as soon as I removed the wig from the packaging it was all squished and a ton of hair was falling out as soon as I picked it up. Super bummed as it seemed like a nice wig. now it looks silly because it looks too thin. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig in light blonde. It&#x27;s a slightly darker color than what is shown but really amazing quality especially for a $10 wig. I haven&#x27;t tried taking heat to it yet but I&#x27;m pretty please with it so far. Will definitely by this in other colors.</li>
            <li> I was actually quite surprised with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;The quality was extremely good...the hair was soft and didn&#x27;t tangle easily.&lt;br /&gt;However ...the wig cap was a bit smaller. It fit me but if wanted to pull the wig hair up in a ponytail or such my hairline would be exposed.&lt;br /&gt;A pretty good wig overall.</li>
            <li> happy with purchase.  wig will go great with my alice &amp; wonderland costume</li>
            <li> I never even got it. Complete ripoff. I would like someone to message me now about this because If I got this I wont be getting my wig.</li>
            <li> The wig was very thin. Came quickly but extremely thin. When I tried to brush it from being kept in the bag the hair just started falling out. :/</li>
            <li> I use these wigs for display of hats in my seasonal shop. Because they are so inexpensive, I never worry about them getting dirty. A quick comb with a wide-tooth comb and they are good to go. They are obviously artificial, but since I use them to display my handmade wares, I don&#x27;t care about that.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Cute&lt;br /&gt;~Heat Resistant&lt;br /&gt;~Long and thick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~tangles easily&lt;br /&gt;~You can see the net if you wear it up&lt;br /&gt;~Hard to brush</li>
            <li> Very good product for price.. A little thin but served the purpose. Great touch for my Barbie look I was going for.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased another wig as back up after this one took over a month to ship! When it finally came in, the wig was not a light blonde but almost red auburn copper blonde...definitely not Elsa from Frozen, more like her sister.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig in blonde to go with my barbie costume for halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;-the color, length, and wave at the bottom of the hair is as pictured!&lt;br /&gt;-the hair is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;-fits nicely and stays on with a wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;-love all the color selections, they appear very fun,vibrant and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-i noticed that the more you touch/stroke/brush it, it gets a little frizzy, out of place and won&#x27;t return to its normal state. i tried it on about 3 times so far for 1 minute or less and i can tell it&#x27;s getting a little frizzy and static-y at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s not very full at the top.. if you try to re-position the hair or part it in another way, you will see the hair net.&lt;br /&gt;-I would like to curl the ends a little more (it&#x27;s losing some of its natural wave) but i&#x27;m afraid it will turn into a bigger mess before the halloween event i&#x27;m attending, so maybe i will pass.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly but was a yellow-y color and shiny and obviously synthetic hair... very tangled and not at all realistic looking.</li>
            <li> Awesome! It&#x27;s cute, very long, like cover boobies long, just so you know haha and thick which is good for covering hair in the back if you naturally have long/thick hair which I do. I got this wig for my Harley Quinn costume, I was afraid the wig wouldn&#x27;t come until after Halloween, but it came after a week of ordering it, and before Halloween! It&#x27;s very shiny and super blonde, might need to lighten my black brows for the costume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty, but thin. I have thick hair .&amp; it was a weird adjustment. Also, it barely hits past your shoulders. It is wavy, &amp; you will have to adjust the bangs to your style which is a bit hard. If this is costume wear, &amp; u have thick hair- either don&#x27;t get this or get a really good hair net because your hair will show.</li>
            <li> Used this for an adult Elsa costume. Poorly constructed wig with VERY short pieces of hair up in the front. Wig would never lie nicely like the picture shows. We were able to braid it and it served its purpose, but it looked pretty cheap and tangled quite easily. Would not recommend or purchase again.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, it can a month early! It was a little more thin than I Was expecting and was shedding a lot, but I can&#x27;t complain To much since I did get it pretty cheap, its really soft too. All in all I like it I would recommend It to people if they are looking for a cheap long wig that can get the job done.</li>
            <li> This wig comes in a great color and the fibers are not ridiculously shinny, exactly what I was expecting for an 8 dollar wig.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not at all the color in the picture. It was practically brown.</li>
            <li> This weak is definitely a lot of fun and is worth what you pay for it</li>
            <li> The bangs are a bit heavy and hard to work with, but all in all it contrasts well with my steampunk costume.</li>
            <li> very full. meaning no bald spots, because ive gotten wigs with bald spots. cute would recommend. worth more than they charge</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the quality of this wig for the price.  My daughter wore it for Halloween.  She has a lot of hair and most wigs won&#x27;t go over her hair and stay on.  We had no trouble getting this wig on and it looked great!</li>
            <li> It looks wonderful and is easy to put on and wear, however, take a little extra care when combing it out, it shreds easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine for a cosplay that&#x27;s a way off, thankfully, so I can order a new one. It was supposed to be the light blonde color, but the one I received is orange-y? I think it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;regular blonde&amp;#34; maybe?</li>
            <li> Wig cap shows . Othrr than that love the length and coor was true to the picture. Would not buy again</li>
            <li> I love wigs and have several of them, however, this is the first blonde one I have purchased from amazon. The package arrived on time, but I was a little let down to see how it was packaged. The wig came in a hair net(good sign), and then it was placed inside a plastic bag which in turn was put in a large yellow shipping envelope. Although I would have preferred to come in a box as opposed to an envelope, the wig came in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I naturally have dark hair and these hairs are quite obviously, very light. Because of this, the tracks tend to show through when moved a certain way, but some slight teasing and hairspray helps a ton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are a little different than pictured, they aren&#x27;t quite as side swept, and when i tried to part them like the picture, the tracks showed. To remedy this, I just cut them in a cute, arched, straight bang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its an okay wig, for the price I am not going to complain and I would definitely consider some other colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple tips if you have dark hair and want to wear this specific color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTRAL color wig cap! If you use a black one, it will show through. I picked up a 2 pack of nude color caps at sally&#x27;s for about 3 dollars and they are some of the best wig caps I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I put my wig cap on, I applied a dark blonde root cover to the edges that still poked out (above my ears and a little in the very front.) There are lots of different kinds on the market, but I chose a nice liquidy mascara type. Its very easy to use to cover specific spots. Again, Sally&#x27;s has this if its something you want to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To finish off my custom modding, I sewed some nude color clips from sally&#x27;s(they have good cheap stuff) above the ear tabs and at the nape of the wig just to secure it into place...the wind here gets crazy and that has kept it from blowing right off my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the same grey cover-up in a light blonde shade on the roots of the wig to make it look a little more natural. I also dusted it with some powder and hairspray to dull down some of the wiggy shine it had.&lt;br /&gt;So far, everyone has flipped out and can&#x27;t believe I got my hair to lighten so much. Too bad they&#x27;ll never know! All in all, this is a pretty solid wig for the price. Just be careful if you have dark hair and get a blonde one.</li>
            <li> Very fake looking-- like straw</li>
            <li> My daughter said it was perfect.</li>
            <li> good wig but colour was straw like and not at all as white blonde as in photo, bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> The color of the wig is nothing close to the actual product i ordered and the texture is completely different.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for mannequin for work, the texture and fullness of this hair is great although I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the coloring. I ordered the light blond and ended up getting a wig that is very strawberry blond and almost auburn. Since I had only preferred blond but color doesn&#x27;t exactly matter I have decided to keep the wig because of the great quality.</li>
            <li> (Back story) I originally got this wig because it looks beautiful and it is a cheap way to figure out if I like being blonde (bought the light blonde wig). I have other wigs all made by different people, this being the most inexpensive one and it does show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(About the wig) The mesh that the hair is attached to does show by the part in the bangs quite noticeably. It is also kind of easy to see the mesh around the top of the head. If you wear some kind of hat with it though it can easily cover it up or you can possibly add a few wefts between the gaps.&lt;br /&gt;The hair strands are quite thick but the hair feels a lot better than the wings you find around Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The color is spot on.&lt;br /&gt;Soft&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can see the wig base&lt;br /&gt;A bit heavy&lt;br /&gt;Hair strands are thick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Wearing a hat makes this wig a lot more believable.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting insane quality for $10, but it works for what I got it for. I am going to be buying more colors because I do quite like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice enough looking wig, but the hair is quite bit thin and you can definitely see the base around the front of the wig, and if you try to pull the bangs back or style them.  Still for the price and what I wanted to use it for (a 1 day cosplay) it was just right.</li>
            <li> Got it more as a gag but it does not look like picture, it&#x27;s very cheap but I guess what I should expect for the price.</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing, especially for the price.  I can&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; and the hair looks very natural.  I bought three to try on different hair colors, but I would consider wearing this out.  It was packaged great, with air pouches, plastic, and netting.  It also came with a wig cap, which I&#x27;m thankful for.  I&#x27;d definitely buy again, and probably will soon.</li>
            <li> Bangs are thick, good color. Shows up well on camera</li>
            <li> Great quality wig.  No need to buy from sellers with inflated prices.  I straightened bits with my flatiron on 250F just fine.</li>
            <li> its definitely yellow in color but for the price it was great and made the costume a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> Came as honey blonde instead of bleach blonde but it&#x27;s still works, I like it just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Still, great wig for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend, he seemed to like it.</li>
            <li> I have worn daily hair pieces and extensions for two decades. While I love the hair quality and texture (it feels real), this is a costume quality wig that when worn does show the wig cap construction (tracks) beneath in the back. If the wind blows, chances are anyone standing behind you will clearly see the tracks. Wearing a hat does not help as the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; parts and moves as you do, and shows the cap underneath. The wig cap simply does not have enough hair attached to conceal it completely. The wig is comfortable to wear. For the price, I am happy with it as a costume wig.</li>
            <li> Very fast and great quality!</li>
            <li> This wig is overall very nice and similar to the picture. The blonde shade is exactly the same and the length is good. It is, however, on the thin side. So if you have dark hair like me, even with a blonde wig cap it can be difficult to completely cover all of your natural hair and scalp. It also sheds quite a bit and isn&#x27;t very heat resistant.</li>
            <li> The color it exactly the same in the picture, and it feel really nice. It also shipped really fast to my house which I really liked. The down side is that it is really small and so I can&#x27;t clip it unless I am okay with getting head aches, and when i first put it on, quite a few fibers started falling out.</li>
            <li> I mean, it functions as a wig and all, but the color doesn&#x27;t look like a normal hair color(I mean, I know there are dyes and all, but this color screams fake), and it looks fake. It would be good for a costume party, maybe, but not for every day use. It almost definitely will not pass as real hair.:/</li>
            <li> matched perfect thank you</li>
    </ol>
