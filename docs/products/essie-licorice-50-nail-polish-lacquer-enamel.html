            <li>On the bright side, one coat does a suitable job, and two coats does a near perfect one.</li>
            <li>I was&#x27;t sure it was going to be a real one but its the best nail polish I&#x27;ve gotten on this site!</li>
            <li>It applies very nicely in two coats for full coverage.</li>

            <li>love it!I also purchased the matte topcoat and this combo</li>
            <li>I love how there is no under tones in it</li>
            <li>perfect color, essie nail polish is top rated out of tons of other nailpolishes, I definately suggest you buy this.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast, price was good.  </li>
            <li>And cleans up easily if you&#x27;re not an expert.</li>
            <li>The color is the perfect shade of black if that makes any sense to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I have used it multiple times and definitely am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It lasts long with a good top coat (Seche Vite) &amp; doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>think everyone should own one black polish but there are so many!</li>
            <li>Really shiny, I just love.</li>
            <li>Very solid black, just perfect after applying a top coat.</li>
            <li>Beautiful black great coverage not too runny or thick.</li>
            <li>Great shiny black polish, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great black polish, very shiny</li>
            <li>I was hoping that since it&#x27;s Essie, it wouldn&#x27;t chip so quickly, but it started chipping within the first day and a half :&amp;#60; I would recommend two coats and a sturdy top coat!</li>
            <li>Paired with Seche Vite top coat and its piano key shiny!</li>
            <li>I used 2 coats and got a really solid full on black with a great sheen.</li>
            <li>It finishes really shiny</li>
            <li>Very shmazy, it&#x27;s THE bomb digity of all nail polish.</li>
            <li>&amp; I am a real person Fyi</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>My favorite black nail polish!</li>
            <li>Love this black!</li>
            <li>Especially once you get into the weeds of there being many SHADES of black..</li>
            <li>black cool nail polish</li>
            <li>Usually one layer is enough for me, good to go in 2-3 minutes it lasts for 3 days if used with a good base coat</li>
            <li>Color was nice and thick, and stayed on for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can ever go wrong with a good black polish on well-manicured nails.  </li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t crack of rub off, also it likes long walks on the beach</li>
            <li> I have very long nails</li>
            <li> I needed a good black to not only be my base color but accent as well for any designs I wanted to do.</li>
            <li> There is not a shade of green, purple, red, blue, or any other color..</li>
            <li> This is a SOLID black..</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a solid black, no Shades.. this is the color to get.</li>
            <li> Not black with a tint of green or black with a tint of brown.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, but dense enough that you only need one coat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and applied two coats over a base, and a top coat.  </li>
            <li> This color is EXACTLY black.</li>
            <li> You need to use two coats so It looks as black as it foes in the bottle.</li>
            <li> this is the blackest black you can buy.</li>
            <li> Perfectly black.</li>
            <li> I wanted a solid hard black and you get it with this Essie !</li>
            <li> You have to like black!</li>
            <li> JUST BLACK!</li>
            <li> In the NOT good way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin.</li>

            <li> love it!I also purchased the matte topcoat and this combo is killer! It looks really elegant! You have to like black!</li>
            <li> This review is for the Essie Licorice Nail Polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think everyone should own one black polish but there are so many! Especially once you get into the weeds of there being many SHADES of black.. This is a SOLID black.. There is not a shade of green, purple, red, blue, or any other color.. So if you are looking for a solid black, no Shades.. this is the color to get.</li>
            <li> Beautiful black great coverage not too runny or thick. The great quality you expect from Essie.  And cleans up easily if you&#x27;re not an expert.</li>
            <li> Receive it on time haven&#x27;t used it yet, but hope to soon, I been what&#x27;d and black cool nail polish now I have it</li>
            <li> Comes off easily!! ...In the NOT good way. Even with a topcoat, which is just special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you plan on layering the heck out of it, expect it to scratch off the minute you take your eyes off of your fingers. On the bright side, one coat does a suitable job, and two coats does a near perfect one.</li>
            <li> This color is EXACTLY black. Not black with a tint of green or black with a tint of brown. JUST BLACK! Essie is a wonderful brand. It lasts long with a good top coat (Seche Vite) &amp; doesn&#x27;t chip. The only problem I have, is the brush. It&#x27;s very thin. I have very long nails so it takes forever to cover the entire nail with the tiny brush. Other than that, I love this nail polish. If you&#x27;re considering this product, go ahead &amp; buy it!</li>
            <li> Definitely a good color, &amp; type of brand. Essie is amazing to give for girl presents.</li>
            <li> love essie products! I needed a good black to not only be my base color but accent as well for any designs I wanted to do. Am happy with this product</li>

            <li> Great formula. Not too thick, but dense enough that you only need one coat. I still apply two coats, but it does cover well with just one.</li>
