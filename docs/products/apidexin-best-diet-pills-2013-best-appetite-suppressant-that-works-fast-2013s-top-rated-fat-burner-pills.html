            <li>I&#x27;m not SKINNY, but I&#x27;m not fat, I feel good and the appetite control is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great results but</li>
            <li>Not so great.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will still be effective!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think I may have been more hungry than without taking it.</li>
            <li>the side effects made me want to stop taking the product more than wanting to keep my weight.</li>
            <li>Apidexin did that and more.</li>
            <li>I go on an elliptical machine 20-40 min a day and try to eat healthy for the most part.</li>
            <li>I eat healthy, gave up ALL sweets and still nothing.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure how I feel about this pill.</li>
            <li>before breakfast then one more pill 30 min. before lunch.</li>
            <li>Ok, fine.</li>
            <li>I have lost, steadily a pound every day or so, and feel pretty good!</li>
            <li>First day, took one in the morning, felt pretty good most of the day.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fit in 6 mths ago.</li>
            <li>but here this, With diet and exercise and a considerable amount, means lots of sweat and good cardio.</li>
            <li>I have gained weight because I was fairly underweight, however, I am able to eat just enough that I can be healthy but still much thinner than I was before the eating disorder.</li>
            <li>With the original formula I lost 13 pounds in 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>So far they are okay but will know for sure after about a month</li>
            <li>First you have to understand I was never overweight</li>
            <li>I suspect the first 5 lbs were water weight</li>
            <li>you really can&#x27;t find any!</li>
            <li>I am a physically active person with a hearty appetite (I do love those carbs!)</li>
            <li>But, when I hit a certain age -- passed 40 -- my body changed.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Really like the product, gonna try a couple others to see</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any difference in it after I took the whole bottle</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>Slowly, my metabolism changed, my energy changed, I had more energy to walk (I get in 40 mins of walking a day at the office), and I can fit into clothes</li>
            <li>Buy ECA extreme itworks much better n cheaper than apidexin</li>
            <li>Not only are they good for energy, but I&#x27;m down 5 pounds from just the 1 week.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve dropped to 135.</li>
            <li>All the things I&#x27;ve done to stay reasonably well -- sensible eating, following the Blood Type Diet plan -- kept me from gaining weight.</li>
            <li>please, do not waste your time or money on this product.</li>
            <li>I tried it for one week and did not loose one pound.</li>
            <li>I think it helps you eat slightly less, but not by much.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a long time.</li>
            <li> *** doesn&#x27;t work and as long as you keep taking them</li>
            <li> The side effects ended up being far worse than I had anticipated and made it difficult to function, to be perfectly honest.</li>
            <li> Last year I got down to 108 lbs on a different diet pill that of course became banned by the FDA</li>
            <li> I would take one pill a before breakfast with my other daily vitamins, and it seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I am now going to my local weight loss center who gives prescription weightloss pills for $30 a month, so maybe check in on yours!</li>
            <li> For the passed year, I&#x27;ve used Apidexin -- half the daily dose.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t lose a single lb!</li>
            <li> you can loose a pound a day and every day!</li>
            <li> Came in the mail like it said it would, but took a bit longer then expected to arrive.</li>
            <li> I had recently lost my car and had started eating out of boredom, and also had become lazy and unmotivated.</li>
            <li> My plan is to go back to doing just one at a time no more than twice a day and see how that works.</li>
            <li> when i started and 4 months i was down to 197</li>
            <li> but then again I was only able to stick with those horrible side effects for a week.</li>
            <li> and just a little bit of a spare tire thing going on.</li>
            <li> It curbed my appetite, gave me a little boost, AND helped me firm up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work at all, don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I re-ordered and didn&#x27;t notice the ingredient changes until a few weeks into using it</li>
            <li> Kept doing the one pill before meals thing for a few days, then decided to up it to two.</li>
            <li> This continued for a few days, until about a day or two after I stopped taking them.</li>
            <li> even if I don&#x27;t take it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I did not work for me at all waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I ran and worked out everyday, nothing.</li>
            <li> This product curbs my appetite like no other, so I don&#x27;t end up snacking when bored or studying.</li>
            <li> very sad, just finished using the whole bottle</li>
            <li> Needed to lose 10 lbs and even continued my usual walking routine .</li>
            <li> , I had a hard time concentrating in school</li>
            <li> Is hard to find diet pills, this pill works as longest you make effort also.</li>
            <li> and then they were forced to change their ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was so jittery and anxious and fidgety!</li>
            <li> No very impressed at all.</li>
            <li> , I was getting sloppy, or \\&quot;soft\\&quot; if you will.</li>
            <li> and i was constantly cold.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me :-(</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with the product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> So far they are okay but will know for sure after about a month</li>
            <li> Did nothing at all.  Took like it said, but nothing at all happened.  Came in the mail like it said it would, but took a bit longer then expected to arrive.</li>
            <li> I lost 7lb in five weeks with a proper diet. I had vegetables and fish; no dairy products, and lots of water.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. In fact, I think I may have been more hungry than without taking it.</li>
            <li> very sad, just finished using the whole bottle and it did not work.  I did what I was supposed to do and nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m conflicted with this pill. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and about 140 lbs and I took it to lose weight to get in shape for the summer. The problem was not that I didn&#x27;t lose the weight, I lost almost 30 lbs. What I didn&#x27;t like was that it made me jittery at times, I had a hard time concentrating in school and i was constantly cold. Great results but the side effects made me want to stop taking the product more than wanting to keep my weight. I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Is hard to find diet pills, this pill works as longest you make effort also. It helps control your appetite which it was what i was looking for! I don&#x27;t need pill to make me nervous! This pill does not make you nervous, or sweaty, it just perfect! you can loose a pound a day and every day!</li>
            <li> I not at all impressed with this.  I have been taken it for two weeks know.  I have not notice any change in my energy or lose any weight.  I take two in the morning and one before lunch.  I also do crossfit on the side four days a week.  I think I may have lost 2 lbs and maybe a inch in waist.  No very impressed at all.</li>
            <li> works awesome, health eating and good exercise taking this i was 243 when i started and 4 months i was down to 197 but here this, With diet and exercise and a considerable amount, means lots of sweat and good cardio. Really like the product, gonna try a couple others to see but deff gonna order again!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work at all, don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. Buy ECA extreme itworks much better n cheaper than apidexin</li>
            <li> First you have to understand I was never overweight, I was getting sloppy, or \\&quot;soft\\&quot; if you will. I had recently lost my car and had started eating out of boredom, and also had become lazy and unmotivated. So, I wanted a pill to kill that boredom eating and kick start my day. Apidexin did that and more. I would take one pill a before breakfast with my other daily vitamins, and it seemed to do the trick. No jittery feeling! No uneasy stomach! It curbed my appetite, gave me a little boost, AND helped me firm up. I started on my morning juicing routine again and picked up my squats and lunges. So it wasn&#x27;t a cure all, but it did do what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 27, 5&#x27;4\\&quot; 125 Athletic build</li>
            <li> Apidexin is a very good Product &amp; I will Recommended To Everyone I Know, And have them do the Same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fat, I&#x27;m 23, 5 foot 7 and weighed 145 lbs when I decided to try this.  I am a physically active person with a hearty appetite (I do love those carbs!) and just a little bit of a spare tire thing going on. I also gained 10 lbs with a 5 lb fluctuation in the last year and was hoping to get back to that. Anyway, I ordered this and it came about 10 days ago. I used it with the 72 hour cleanse. This product curbs my appetite like no other, so I don&#x27;t end up snacking when bored or studying. I have lost, steadily a pound every day or so, and feel pretty good! So far I&#x27;ve dropped to 135. I suspect the first 5 lbs were water weight but I haven&#x27;t gotten below 138 I&#x27;m a long time. I&#x27;m pretty happy with this. I go on an elliptical machine 20-40 min a day and try to eat healthy for the most part. Of you do your part, this seems to do its part.</li>
            <li> Apidexin actually saved me from my bulimia. Since I started taking it, my appetite has been surpressed, therefore I have no desire to binge on food, which means I neither have the desire to throw up. I have gained weight because I was fairly underweight, however, I am able to eat just enough that I can be healthy but still much thinner than I was before the eating disorder. So basically, my BMI was 24, with the disorder it was 16, and now it remains at 19.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help me at all, and I drank nothing but water (tons of it) and worked out 5-6 days a week (cardio) I eat healthy, gave up ALL sweets and still nothing. I recommend everybody not to waist their time and money..if you don&#x27;t believe me look it up online, try to find videos and pictures of weight loss customers...you really can&#x27;t find any! Trust me I searched! Im 5&#x27;2, weigh 147 I had twins 5 months ago so im trying to get back to 120! I am now going to my local weight loss center who gives prescription weightloss pills for $30 a month, so maybe check in on yours! Hope I helped!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me :-(</li>
            <li> Not quite sure how I feel about this pill. I started taking one pill 30 min. before breakfast then one more pill 30 min. before lunch. I think it helps you eat slightly less, but not by much. Today I decided to try two pills before breakfast and two before lunch.  Hopefully this will make a difference. Haven&#x27;t lost any weight yet. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;1 and 125lbs. Last year I got down to 108 lbs on a different diet pill that of course became banned by the FDA and then they were forced to change their ingredients. I tried them again but not the same, therefore I am trying to find another diet pill that will keep me from munching.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula.....it now doesn&#x27;t work.  With the original formula I lost 13 pounds in 4 weeks.  I re-ordered and didn&#x27;t notice the ingredient changes until a few weeks into using it and no weight was coming off.  Called the company and they have no explanation.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Took about a week longer to arrive than estimated. Ok, fine. First day, took one in the morning, felt pretty good most of the day. Great! Kept doing the one pill before meals thing for a few days, then decided to up it to two. Not so great. I was so jittery and anxious and fidgety! I had a couple panic attacks and freakouts. This continued for a few days, until about a day or two after I stopped taking them. In the end, I had to balance my desire to lose weight with my desire to stay sane, and stopped taking them altogether. The side effects ended up being far worse than I had anticipated and made it difficult to function, to be perfectly honest. My plan is to go back to doing just one at a time no more than twice a day and see how that works. Hopefully it will still be effective! I didn&#x27;t notice any weight loss yet but then again I was only able to stick with those horrible side effects for a week.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference in it after I took the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not struggled with my weight. I ride my bike and walk a lot; I don&#x27;t go to the gym. But, when I hit a certain age -- passed 40 -- my body changed. All the things I&#x27;ve done to stay reasonably well -- sensible eating, following the Blood Type Diet plan -- kept me from gaining weight. For the passed year, I&#x27;ve used Apidexin -- half the daily dose. Slowly, my metabolism changed, my energy changed, I had more energy to walk (I get in 40 mins of walking a day at the office), and I can fit into clothes I couldn&#x27;t fit in 6 mths ago. I&#x27;m not SKINNY, but I&#x27;m not fat, I feel good and the appetite control is perfect. No light-headedness, no cravings -- even if I don&#x27;t take it for a few days.</li>
            <li> they sent me aBidexin!! The wrong bottle!! But i decided they seem like the pills are the same as aPidexin so i made no big deal about it .. BIG MISTAKE!!!! and this s*** doesn&#x27;t work and as long as you keep taking them you will never ever sleep DO NOT BUY ABIDEXIN</li>
            <li> Worked well for me.  I went to the gym 3 times last week for 45 min each time.  Counted my calories and stayed below 1500 each day.... supplemented with these pills.  Not only are they good for energy, but I&#x27;m down 5 pounds from just the 1 week.</li>
            <li> Not so good makes you jittery!</li>
            <li> I gained 5 pounds!!!!!!!!!!!!! yes, it helps with appetite suppressant, but, you still gain weight. It makes you swell up even with water pills, you still swell up and gain weight. oh, and the 450 mg on the bottle? no, I got 360 mg. not what I paid for. please, do not waste your time or money on this product. I am very unhappy with the product.</li>
            <li> I did not work for me at all waste of money. I was getting headache so I stop it just not working</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 128lbs and all I wanted to do was drop 3-5lbs. I ran and worked out everyday, nothing.</li>
            <li> These diet pills did curb my appetite.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t lose a single lb! Instead I bloated up like a fish from head to toe! Do not take!</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing.  I tried it for one week and did not loose one pound.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for me does not work</li>
            <li> It did not work for me. Needed to lose 10 lbs and even continued my usual walking routine .</li>
            <li> why does this say Apinexin Not Abidexin people are being fooled by this it&#x27;s Abidexin NOT APINEXIN. LOOK BEFORE YOU BUY.</li>
