            <li>I am not a crazy make up person, so I am not picky when it comes to brushes.</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>and it serves it&#x27;s purpose as well as a higher priced brush.</li>
            <li>the shipment was fast, and the product is exactly who they show it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Looooooving my new blush brush!</li>

            <li>Ok, i bought this brush, because i&#x27;m a brush junkie, and out of the dozens of brushes i have, the blush brushes i have are just a bit different, and some times I feel a brush with a certain cut, not matter how similar it is to the others have, that the slight difference will make all the difference, and with this brush I see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and coverage of your blush goes on evenly.  </li>
            <li>Was surprised with the quality</li>
            <li>The only reason why i did not give it 5 stars is because when i received it i thought the package looked old and used.</li>

            <li> The only reason why i did not give it 5 stars is because when i received it i thought the package looked old and used.</li>
            <li> The brush sheds heavily and, the bristles are prickly and no where close to soft.</li>
            <li> would definitely going to buy other brush for my kit.</li>
            <li> i like a larger blush brush and this one came flat from the packaging i haven&#x27;t been able to round it out.  :(</li>
            <li> brush does have cheaper feeling bristles to it, and does shed, but for the price, that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little rough.</li>
            <li> I have already washed it a couple times and it&#x27;s gotten softer but it&#x27;s still a little rough.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would replace a brush that sheds - sorry to say it does the same thing.</li>
            <li> Did not give it five stars because the handle is too long and makes it difficult to carry it in a small make up bag like the one I use in my purse.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used worse.</li>
            <li> Considering the price I was skeptical on how the brush would be, I should have listened to my gut and skipped it.</li>
