            <li>It is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>It works, and is probably a very handy size for carrying about in a purse.  </li>
            <li>my nails peel have dropped dramatically and i can get very nice square nails.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>The glass nail files are the best you can get and they leave the nail very smooth after being filed.</li>
            <li>8 of them give them to friends and they come with a nice case!~</li>
            <li>So impressed I bought two more for my sister and daughter.</li>
            <li>It is better for my nails, yet it does a great job!  </li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very nice!</li>
            <li>I think this is a great buy and very nice quality file - I even got a free mini glass file included in the order which is a great bonus!</li>
            <li>This is the best file for fingernails, just rinse with water to clean, so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>file is one of the good guys.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I needed a good nail file and the reviews looked really good.  </li>
            <li>These are good quality files.  </li>
            <li>Good file.</li>
            <li>It had a lot of good reviews, so I checked them out, just to see what the fuss was about.</li>
            <li>but that is because these are the good files.</li>
            <li>I bought some for others, and they loved this as well.</li>
            <li>It also is not as good as my mothers which has a finer bite.</li>
            <li>I think is as good as you can ask for when it comes to a nail file.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried OPI, Sephora, Sally Beauty, and Revlon&#x27;s products - none of them are as good as this one.</li>
            <li>AND it even comes in a plastic case (I know, this is not earth-shattering, but it means it won&#x27;t break in my purse like its beloved</li>
            <li>Not as good.  </li>
            <li>Use it all the time, good quality, like the protective case it came in to prevent it from shattering when dropped.</li>
            <li>is a good size to carry in purse</li>
            <li>But they work good on your nails.</li>
            <li>Good quality of material.</li>
            <li>This one is excellent and like the case, since dropping my first one broke it!!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, would buy again.</li>
            <li>Makes a great gift since most people have never seen one.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and am gifting them to friends and they are very appreciative.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>I love mine!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite gift to give my friends and family!</li>
            <li>and so they are holding up better and growing longer without splitting than I can ever remember them growing before!</li>
            <li>Love the case!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love them!~</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li>love these files!  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!  </li>
            <li>Love this nail file!</li>
            <li>I love this glass nail file!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Seriously, I love this file!  </li>
            <li>This is a excellent file, the color is pretty too.</li>
            <li>I love this nail file for my purse!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This nail file is amazing</li>
            <li>File does a great job of keeping nails neat and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Well, I thought it would be helpful to people to write my own experience.  </li>
            <li>Nice case and well designed.</li>
            <li>This thing IS really effective.</li>
            <li>The case is a nice addition - I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally breaking the file when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a nice gift for family and friends.</li>
            <li>These are the best crystal nail files.......the real deal.  </li>
            <li>It is nice not to have to be concerned about filing in one direction.  </li>
            <li>The two I just bought from Amazon by Sassella, (one for me and one for my daughter) are really, really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice carry case.</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous and I like that there is no name brand on it like many of the others.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the reviews and I am so thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>Great quality, easy on the eye, washable and very easy on your nails.</li>
            <li>I carry mine with me all the time for a quick nail repair and they do the job beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY pleased, and will buy more for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is a fine product at a good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all from paper to stone, but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This is the best nail file for natural nails, period.  </li>
            <li>is by far the best nail file I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so wonderful that my 11 year old granddaughter talked me out of it</li>
            <li>I also really loved that the instructions that came with the file said it can be cleaned with soap and water and a light scrub brush (like a nail brush.)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t settle for cheap emery boards or metal files because it&#x27;s not all good for your nails.</li>
            <li>I also have made the mistake of buying some of the cheap glass files because I could find crystal glass file (and the first time I didn&#x27;t realize the difference), and will do my best to never make that mistake again.</li>
            <li>The nail file has a great feel, and it looks cool too :)</li>
            <li>Not only does it do a great job, it&#x27;s really beautiful to look at.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fine grain</li>
            <li>I love love love it!</li>
            <li>Over all a very nice file and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is attractive, comes with a sturdy protective plastic case and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Arrived right away in very nice packaging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They sent me another one for free to assure my satisfaction, and let me tell you, I am VERY satisfied.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very smooth finish to my nails, unlike emery boards or the metal type of nail file.  </li>
            <li>They provide a very smooth nail.</li>
            <li>And on top of how great is works, it is pretty, too.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wash, and I always store it in the handy case, too.</li>
            <li>This one is good quality and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the carrying case.</li>
            <li>it comes in a case and will fit nicely in a purse</li>
            <li>I love crystal glass nail files, to me</li>
            <li>the are the best files out there, they last forever.</li>
            <li>So make sure you buy a crystal glass file and not just a glass nail file.</li>
            <li>but once you get used to it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Also love the case,keeps the file safe in my purse.</li>
            <li>Be sure to purchase a crystal glass nail file that&#x27;s been made in the Czech Republic.  </li>
            <li>I love this nail file</li>
            <li>It is better than all but one</li>
            <li>The Zeva file that I like better has a case that opens on one end and to me that seems preferable.</li>
            <li>This file is a definite win!</li>
            <li>Albeit the lack of color options, I&#x27;m satisfied with it, my nails are coming out firmer</li>
            <li>and I love it.     </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a healthy alternative to an abrasive nail file...</li>
            <li>But metal is so much more effective!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It used to take me ~5 minutes to file my nails, but it&#x27;s more like 2 minutes with this.</li>
            <li>Much better than using an emery board.  </li>
            <li>I love my crystal file.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any file getting better than this.</li>
            <li>I prefer glass nail files much more than any others</li>
            <li>When I purchased this I think I bought three - wish I&#x27;d bought more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>Most nail files make my nails chip and split.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unusual looking but works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this nail file for about three months now and my nails are in better shape than they&#x27;ve ever been.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m growing my nails longer than I have ever been able to before because they haven&#x27;t been breaking on me.  </li>
            <li>This one is better.</li>
            <li>file only in one direction for the best, smoothest results.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it :)</li>
            <li>but like that it has a case to keep it safe.</li>
            <li>Love this file -</li>
            <li>There are cheaper files out there, but I haven&#x27;t been able to compare.</li>
            <li>I have used Diamond Deb files for many years.</li>
            <li>Love that it is ground on both sides</li>
            <li>Really top quality and if you keep it in its case, it will not break.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love...</li>
            <li>and I will buy more for my friends.</li>
            <li>so be sure not to bend it.  </li>
            <li>Love this Nail file.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order more.  </li>
            <li>Files nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this file, bought one in Czeck Republic and broke it..</li>
            <li>the girls and i love this...if you&#x27;ve never had one or tried these, do so.  </li>
            <li>The individual carrying case is perfect for my purse.  </li>
            <li>Love this nail file.  </li>
            <li>we both love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and wouldn&#x27;t change my choice.</li>
            <li>I love that</li>
            <li>No snagging or peeling, in fact, your nail edges are as smooth as glass!</li>
            <li>It works even better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>I like filing with this better than emory boards because it is quicker anyway.  </li>
            <li>i guess this is better for your nails</li>
            <li>so i try to use it more than the others.</li>
            <li>I purchased this file and within weeks (along with sturdy top and bottom coats) noticed an improvement in the strength of my nails.  </li>
            <li>And smoothly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering a couple more</li>
            <li>I love using it and have purchased more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>I love that this doesn&#x27;t wear out, all I have to do is rinse it now and then.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more files.</li>
            <li>She mentioned &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; files as being much better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tend to get my nails done at salons very often, so I figured this might be a good investment for doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this file.  </li>
            <li>I just feel it is better for my nails.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok for now.</li>
            <li>me pleased.</li>
            <li>So if your in search of a genuine crystal nail file, this is it!</li>
            <li>My nails feel so healthy</li>
            <li>Love this thing, have it with me all the time.</li>
            <li>I love these glass nail files.  </li>
            <li>I love having a cse</li>
            <li>Having this file in my purse has saved my nails so many times.</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY satisfied with the service and product.</li>
            <li>All it comes with a free handy case to put it in so it won&#x27;t get damage.</li>

            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love this nail file.  </li>
            <li>This file is PERFECT, it is great to keep with me on the go, and works well without that rough feel of sandpaper, leaving my nails nice and smooth, without taking too much in one pass.</li>
            <li>i paired with gift with opi nail envy to help her nails become more healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>In any case, that may have been for the best, because I love this nail file so much more than that other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very smooth but not too fine.</li>
            <li>if I didn&#x27;t lose it :) I would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This file is still going strong after 17 months and has paid for itself many times over.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s so easy that I do it more often.</li>
            <li>Filing is quick and easy, and your nails have a nice, even finish.  </li>
            <li>Bought another one in my local retail store and it wasn&#x27;t very good at all.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought a brand name crystal file, so I can&#x27;t say for sure if this is as high quality, but from what I&#x27;ve read about them, it seems to be just as good.    </li>
            <li>I love how perfectly smooth my nails are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it as my primary files and love it.</li>
            <li>Ideally, I would like it to last me for months.</li>
            <li>Love the smooth finish they give my brittle&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans easily.</li>
            <li>Received the items very quickly.</li>
            <li>I had some concerns about some of the reviews that said this nail file can break easily.</li>
            <li>its so easy to use too.  </li>
            <li>The file is easily cleaned as well.  </li>
            <li>Colors make it easy to find in your purse or drawer.  </li>
            <li>have had no problems with clogging as the file is easily wiped or rinsed to remove nail dust.</li>
            <li>break easily</li>
            <li>I have brittle nails that peel and break easily.</li>
            <li>Easy on the nails.  </li>
            <li>They break easy because they are glass.</li>
            <li>The case is a bonus &amp; makes them easy to find.</li>
            <li>Definitely not worth docking a star from a truly excellent product.</li>
            <li>After you file your nails, rinse it off and it&#x27;s as good as new.  </li>
            <li>and it is as good as new.</li>
            <li>So smooth and easy to use on your nails.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>and it fits in my purse fine</li>
            <li>It is very pretty on top of everything else.</li>
            <li>It will definitely take time to file strong nails, but they will feel great when the job is done.</li>
            <li>The edge is very smooth and gives my guitar a warm, lush tone to it.  </li>
            <li>but I imagine there may be some cheap imitations that don&#x27;t work (as well as over-priced ones).  </li>
            <li>The nail file leaves a really smooth edge</li>
            <li>(the sounds are louder when I roll my fingertips on a desk), and the file is easy to clean, coming with a case as well.</li>
            <li>Does not rip nails but files smoothly.</li>
            <li>And I still can&#x27;t believe something that feels this smooth (unlike my super-rough metal file) works so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The crystal file results in smooth nails that do not split at the edges.</li>
            <li>It leaves the nail edge extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few of these, and this is the one I like best.</li>
            <li>You can go in both directions and it leaves a smooth edge on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is the best glass file I have ever bought, and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>Nothing makes my nails feel as smooth and snag free as this file.</li>
            <li>I chose this model because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I got these as gifts for my female bridal party and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>and you will enjoy them.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>so I have them available all the time.</li>
            <li>Great product, My only regret is not buying it sooner, arrived on time.</li>
            <li>It works fast leaving a nice edge.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, carrying case holds up well.</li>
            <li>and my nails are so smooth.  </li>
            <li>The price&lt;br /&gt;was fantastic.</li>
            <li>and this is gentle enough to feel wonderful, but it gets the job done</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome, gentle on my nails, and is supposed to last forever.</li>
            <li>I bought the cheap ones and really regretted it!!!  </li>
            <li>Which I will do right after typing this review. :)</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected, it&#x27;s the best nail file I have ever bought!</li>
            <li>There are a lot of cheaply made glass nail files out there where the abrasive part wears off in no time, but a true crystal glass file should never do this.</li>
            <li>They are perfect small gifts and are always well received.</li>
            <li>This is the first crystal file I&#x27;ve tried and I love it.</li>
            <li>Price was higher than most.</li>
            <li>It is an unique item.</li>
            <li>Its also very easy to wash it off and make it look like new!</li>
            <li>After using my purchase at home, and getting the most amazing results, I knew I had to buy several as gifts - but not at beauty supply prices.  </li>
            <li>The glass file doesn&#x27;t just compress the jagged nail edges like some of the others, it shears them away cleanly.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, nice price and the file makes my wife smile when she looks at her nails.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, it files and shapes my nails leaving clean edges.  </li>
            <li>They file my nails quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>In the case are also direction on how it&#x27;s use and how to clean it.</li>
            <li>well manufactured, light weight, strong material, easy to clean, comes with a case, and very aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quick, doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive when using, leaves a clean and smooth edge, and makes shaping a breeze.</li>
            <li>They were right!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get dull and works perfectly just as described!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love, I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>a good thing I didn&#x27;t make a bet with anyone, because I would have lost that bet instantly.</li>
            <li>so I doubt it&#x27;ll be of much concern to many or anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I intend on buying 16 more as I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Likes to item so much purchased three more for friends.  </li>
            <li>Great quality crystal, not sprayed on roughness, clearly the glass itself is etched, which means it will never dull</li>
            <li>It is also easy to control, as it responds to pressure very well and used lightly will contour and polish ridges.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and think it is as good as my previous one.  </li>
            <li>It rinses easily under water, is pretty sturdy, and comes in a plastic sleeve in a plastic tube.</li>
            <li>The pointy end is sharp and great for getting under the nails.</li>
            <li>Trying to fine another file like the first one.</li>
            <li>They quickly shape your nails without tearing them.  </li>
            <li>With the help of some people on online forums, I&#x27;ve been able to better take care of my nails in terms of shape, durability, and overall health so that I can play fingerstyle with nails.  </li>
            <li>*quickly</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and with no damage, even though it is glass.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about sixs months now and cannot be more satisfied, is the same grit now as it was when I received it.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty, too.</li>
            <li>This file is very fine and great for my weak nails.  </li>
            <li>The glass nail file from New Zealand was better qualtiy.</li>
            <li>Not being a person who messes with their nails much, I wanted an easy no fuss solution for when my nails chipped or broke.  </li>
            <li>Though I have strategically placed others around my environment, I can depend on this one to do an effective job at smoothing tiny to large snags quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>It works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess like those inexpensive emery board nail files.</li>
            <li>This file shaves off nail so gently and quickly!</li>
            <li>I should say up front that this is the only &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; file I have ever used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The real benefit of this file over the others is how smooth the end result is.</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble at all, and love how my nails look.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>This file is worth it</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>This glass file does the job and though I have only had it for a couple of weeks, it seems to be holding its own.</li>
            <li>This was well worth the $$</li>
            <li>I play fingerstyle acoustic guitar and cut nails very short to avoid catching on adjacent strings.</li>
            <li>That said, it does do what I wanted and it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This files very effectively but isn&#x27;t too harsh either.  </li>
            <li>The late order surprisingly arrived in time for the party!</li>
            <li>Other than that, they file good and dont ever run out like reg emery boards</li>
            <li>Right size and works like a nail file should.</li>
            <li>and I contacted them willing to pay for a another for I have several friends that own the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They break very easy only problem with it.</li>
            <li>I have ordered these before and gotten less than perfect quality, but this one seems to be a \\&quot;good\\&quot; one that will last without loosing it&#x27;s filing ability.</li>
            <li>They are great to carry in my bag but are not top quality.</li>
            <li>So good at taking down nails that I don&#x27;t need nail clipper anymore.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t receive the second nail file bonus gift that some have mentioned, but the file I did get is an impressive little thing.</li>
            <li>so I especially appriciate how gentle as well as effective they are.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping....</li>
            <li>Directions included and works better than the one I paid a few dollars more for at a gift shop.</li>
            <li>and they actually grow longer now since I&#x27;m able to care for them right when I need to.</li>
            <li>And the shipping was very fast.     </li>
            <li>This is very important, as in my home, it&#x27;s only a matter of time until it will fall/ get knocked to the floor and shatter.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>These files leave the edges of my nails so smooth that I don&#x27;t even have to worry about the old \\&quot;file in one direction</li>
            <li>I fell in love with glass nail files when I had the opportunity to test one out at a local beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>At first I wrote a glowing review</li>
            <li>Like being able to wash them, especially if someone else happens to pick mine up to use it, which to me is like someone using my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The double carrying case makes it safe to carry in my purse and pull out when ever I need.</li>
            <li>It actually helps me think better, if that makes any sense whatsoever.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem I had with the file is that while first using it, I noticed it to be rather smelly, like fermented foods.</li>
            <li>Guarantee you&#x27;ll like it ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this file for a very short time, but already love it.</li>
            <li>and this is the first file that hasn&#x27;t shredded them to pieces when I&#x27;ve tried to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fingerstyle guitarist who has recently gotten more into nail care.  </li>
            <li>This nail file is exactly what you would expect.  </li>
            <li>Since I first discovered glass nail files, I will not use anything else.  </li>
            <li>files pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky with my nails though</li>
            <li>right up until I went to dust the nail powder off on my nightgown, hit a button on said nightgown, and a large chunk broke</li>
            <li>I love that I will have this forever and not have to go back to using emery boards.</li>
            <li>And really pretty.</li>
            <li>I lost my first one, and replaced it with another.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to buy these because of the price and whether or not it would not cause splintering.</li>
            <li>&#x27;it&#x27;s a crystal file&#x27; specs, but they&#x27;re sadly not.</li>
            <li>the best nail fail</li>
            <li>It still files just as well as it did when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>This file seems to last; so I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>I am a nail file fan and will even admit to having purchased a $60 nail file that I thought would be my last nail file -- I&#x27;m pretty sure my cat knocked that one into a garbage can.</li>
            <li>I first bought a glass nail file at an art store in Provincetown.  </li>
            <li>broke edge after the first fall on the floor...</li>
            <li>Been reading about these, and I&#x27;m glad I finally purchases this!</li>
            <li>Much better than the traditional files.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>purchased first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I was looking for and seems to be alot better quality than one I bought in a local store.</li>
            <li>did I say long lasting, strong, and nice case to keep in your purse.  </li>
            <li>This is the one I always keep in my purse; since the plastic case is colorful and larger it&#x27;s easy to find.</li>
            <li>They come each in its own little protective carrying  case and the file is so pretty and colorful.</li>
            <li>Fantastic and no regrets about going back for more.</li>
            <li>I have very strong nails, and it does not really reduce them as fast as others have stated, but does leave the edge very smooth which is a definite plus.  </li>
            <li>I seriously love it, but there&#x27;s only so much you can say about a nail file in a review.</li>
            <li>I love them so much I ordered several -- one for the car, my purse, the bathroom, kitchen, and my husband.</li>
            <li>This file is fast and very gentle on your nails.</li>
            <li>The case is nice, but it&#x27;s a little short for the plastic sheath the file comes in, bends the top.  </li>
            <li>Cheap models (and even one not-so-cheap that rhymes with Enron) seem to have a coating over the \\&quot;crystal\\&quot; that quickly wears off on the edges of the file, resulting in an attempt to file your nails with smooth glass (not very effective as you might imagine).  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re much easier on nails than any other kind of file.  </li>
            <li>This file never becomes dull, it comes in a great case, and files my nails better than any other file I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Our Church is having a large Spring Fling in March.</li>
            <li>It is too soon to be certain about that.  </li>
            <li>It certainly will protect the file though.</li>
            <li>It took a hard dive to the floor one day, but I&#x27;m glad I could easily replace it with this one.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few others, but the case and size of this one are my favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not over the moon with the color choice, but it&#x27;s so effective, I look right past that.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on nails yet works better than other files.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It is so gentle on my fingernails, yet strong enough to file my toenails.  </li>
            <li>I find this file makes it unnecessary to cut the nails, just file them - smooth, quick, efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had been using a diamond file with &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;shaping&amp;#34; grits, but this works better than either side.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very high quality for their price.  </li>
            <li>This was so nice, I just ordered a pair for my little wife.</li>
            <li>I bought these with some trepidation, not really trusting the claims made about glass nail files, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>but i can grow them a lot longer now because this file is so gentle.</li>
            <li>Be careful which you purchase as some are coarser, meant more for a pedicure style although I prefer to use the finer one on all of my nails.</li>
            <li>After much research I replaced the one I dropped with this which is also finer.</li>
            <li>and this is a very breakable file.  </li>
            <li>So after that whole situation, I came on here to find a quality file.</li>
            <li>This file works very well and has really prevented nail breakage of any sort.</li>
            <li>Incredibly fast shipping even close to the holidays.  </li>
            <li>Gave them out as gifts and were very well received.</li>
            <li>I think it is very durable.</li>
            <li>This one is no different, it gives a smooth finish to your cut nails</li>
            <li>I ordered 6 of these as gifts and the shipping on them went up a whole $1.</li>
            <li>It shapes my nails very well without cracking or splitting them.</li>
            <li>It arrived packaged very well and in a very timely manner also.</li>
            <li>File\\&quot; and thought, \\&quot;really?</li>
            <li>Be careful not to remove more nail than you intend until you get used to this file.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I never could get my nails completely smooth and snag-free with regular metal files or emery boards.  </li>
            <li>This nail file really lives up to its name</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of these files (I even bought another one as a gift).</li>
            <li>I sometimes can gently file the surface of the nail, if needed.</li>
            <li>Some had poor reviews, but I found this one with great reviews and decided to give it a try, and I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my nails are much sharper.</li>
            <li>The service and shipment was fast also.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well....</li>
            <li>, that is a real plus.</li>
            <li>Will even rough up the nail to polish it better.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sturdy, so don&#x27;t worry that they&#x27;re glass.</li>
            <li>I really like this glass file.  </li>
            <li>The price was very competitive with the others offered.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and have ordered additional ones for gifts to friends.  </li>
            <li>Once I am ready to purchase another filer I will buy this one again.</li>
            <li>They are very aggressive files though, not like drugstore or beauty supply products.  </li>
            <li>i havent really seen her without it since.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended glass nail files and finding these with the carrying case was a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>You have to be more careful with it</li>
            <li>My nails feel so much smoother using this one.  </li>
            <li>I get smooth nails without needing all different types of files with varying coarseness .  </li>
            <li>I really wanted a crystal nail file after watching pinksofoxy&#x27;s nail routine on youtube.</li>
            <li>Compare to the metal nail file I used, this makes my nails very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this nail file I have never had a glass file before I really like this file.</li>
            <li>it makes it much easier to carry the file wit me.</li>
            <li>LOVE this nail file and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is fastidious about their natural nails.</li>
            <li>They are extremely fine and file down quickly.  </li>
            <li>It really is pretty good, and I do feel that the nails are much much smoother than regular files, so I would imagine that in the long-term they would lead to a lot less damage to the nails.</li>
            <li>I purchased this file a year and a half ago, and I love it as much as ever!</li>
            <li>However, a bit of soap and water fixed that right up.</li>
            <li>Works super well--takes your nails down to the bed in seconds if you&#x27;re not paying attention--and leaves incredibly smooth edges.</li>
            <li>There was a general theme of \\&quot;It&#x27;s super effective!\\&quot;, so I figured why not?</li>
            <li>My nails got so long and strong because one, I kept them polished and two,</li>
            <li>Works better than other nail products.  </li>
            <li>I do like this file more than any other.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone its a worth wild investment.</li>
            <li>like the length of 5.5\\&quot; -- not too long, not too short, it&#x27;s Goldilocks and the substantial case is nice as well.  </li>
            <li>Love it, it works really well for my thin nails that split easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually going to try to buy another of these RIGHT NOW!</li>
            <li>Way better than your average nail file.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get dull, doesn&#x27;t chew up my nails, and it&#x27;s easy to clean when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>and its still like brand new even though i use it very often.</li>
            <li>works better and smoother than any file I have previously use.</li>
            <li>these glass files really do a much better job than any emery board or file that I&#x27;ve previously tried.  </li>
            <li>The surface of the cheaper file barely filed my nails (it took a long time to make any headway) and what it was able to file was ragged.</li>
            <li>The grit is gentle and works very well on my natural nail.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, the price is decent and it works.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, the seller sent a second nail file as a bonus gift ^.^</li>
            <li>So obviously I did a quick search on Amazon and stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li>and so is more fragile than  a metal file, but it cleans with water and shows no signs of becoming dull.</li>
            <li>highly recommended....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these files.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>this file is cute and comes in a little case which i never use.</li>
            <li>It cleans really easily, although I prefer to rinse it off every other use, since it does get sort of clogged up with nail dust.    </li>
            <li>it files my nails nice and does not get dull.</li>
            <li>Files smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave rough edges.  </li>
            <li>As a male, I have a weird idiosyncrasy in plucking the hairs on my hand, so I&#x27;ve developed a habit of having perfectly trimmed nails to aid the process.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I am going to buy a few more for gifts.</li>
            <li>I had trouble keeping track of them and wasn&#x27;t overly pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Double sided; nice plastic carrying case; actually two; one inside and one outside.</li>
            <li>I bought this after finding out crystal files are more gentle on nails; My nails have been growing so fast lately</li>
            <li>I bought this file because my daughter had one and loved it, and I was tired of buying nail files all the time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Update: I ordered a second one and it&#x27;s a far cry from the first one, a piece of junk!</li>
            <li>It is fine but works fast with few strokes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m careful with it, have had my original one for three years, no chips, no breaks, no dulling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I got this glass file, I would purchase new sandpaper-type emery boards every couple months from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>After no luck with finding another Miss Manicure, I went about looking at these new glass files.</li>
            <li>However my nails haven&#x27;t splintered after four months of use and the file is still like new.</li>
            <li>Still like new.</li>
            <li>It comes in a plastic sleeve inside a hard plastic case, which makes it very easy to locate and also protects it.  </li>
            <li>You just rinse it to clean it and you can even use it on callouses after bathing while the callouses are still wet.</li>
            <li>When I went back to buy more, the store has closed.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty fragile nails</li>
            <li>It is silly to be so enthusiastic about a nail file - I need a life!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly know how to describe it, but of all the files I&#x27;ve had of all types, this is the only one I will ever buy again.</li>
            <li>so treat it as such ;-)</li>
            <li>It takes your nails down effectively with minimal friction.  </li>
            <li>go slow and easy as you can cut too much nail</li>
            <li>Case is large enough for file, in its sleeve &amp; (my additions) a cuticle stick, nail clippers, &amp; a nail-clipper-style cuticle nippers.</li>
            <li>other is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to give me the smoothness I was able to achieve with my other file; as in after inspecting them, I find a spot or two that just won&#x27;t curve and smooth out, so I use my other file to even out the corner.</li>
            <li>I never knew I could clean my previous file.</li>
            <li>My nail edges are much smoother after using this nail file compared to traditional \\&quot;cardboard\\&quot; type nail files and there are no \\&quot;worn</li>
            <li>So to the total shipping was $3.19, a real bargain I think.</li>
            <li>Boy will she be surprised when they arrive.</li>
            <li>So far this file has lost none of it&#x27;s Crystal &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; - it does not scratch off.</li>
            <li>This works at least as well and is even better for finishing.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s much gentler on my nails, giving me a smoother file.</li>
            <li>I definitely won’t be going back to using regular cheap nail files.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually made out of real crystals/glass.</li>
            <li>This file was much rougher and did not do the same job.  </li>
            <li>This one was just like OPI&#x27;s glass file only OPI&#x27;s comes in a plastic tube while this one is colorful and comes in a sleeve just like Revlon&#x27;s AND also another larger purple plastic tube case.</li>
            <li>Much much better than the metal file my mom gave me a few years back.</li>
            <li>It is quick, long lasting...</li>
            <li>comes in a vinyl sleeve that is a bit of a poor fit inside the also-included plastic carrying case (which I found to be a little too large for easy purse carrying--I just use the vinyl sleeve when I&#x27;m on the go).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave that little residue strip of nail that&#x27;s still attached after filing, it just shaves it off clean (along with some dust that&#x27;s unavoidable of course).</li>
            <li>I enjoy how long crystal nail files last, but as someone who tends to lose things, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on something I&#x27;m likely to lose.</li>
            <li>Files the nails down precisely and quickly, and I feel it is less abrasive than traditional emery boards.</li>
            <li>This is like no other orindary file!</li>
            <li>The file is attractive, at least half the price of most other crystal files, and comes with a hard plastic case as well as the soft plastic sheath.    </li>
            <li>After I use it, I just rinse it and let it air dry, then put it right back into its case.</li>
            <li>These files work very well and don&#x27;t wear out or dull up right away like the metal ones and</li>
            <li>No rough edges either!</li>
            <li>This little file does the job and is so pretty, to boot!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical to try a glass one, but boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>While I try very hard to make sure I won&#x27;t drop or break this one, I think the case would help if someone did drop it.</li>
            <li>I cannot really describe what a weird feeling it is to use this file, but I enjoy the results too much to switch back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and makes my nails very smooth.</li>
            <li>Planning to order a few more to keep in my purse and at my desk and other areas</li>
            <li>little beauty has texture on both sides, regular and extra fine.</li>
            <li>Leaves nails smooth and works well without having to press hard.</li>
            <li>I think the product is a little pricey compared to the competition, and I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s worth the full $10 (with shipping).</li>
            <li>This file gives the impression of being very fragile and slows me down a little as I frequently rearrange my grip on it so as to be more cautious, but I like the results.  </li>
            <li>Use the protective case and do not expose it to unusual abuse and it will last as long as you do.</li>
            <li>This one barely does the job.</li>
            <li>It did break the first time I dropped it, but if you&#x27;re careful, this nail file can last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>The colors are super cute and the case isn&#x27;t bad..</li>
            <li>They last a long time, and yet it is gentle enough that I&#x27;ll even use it on the cuticles on the sides of my finger tips/nails.</li>
            <li>I take a star away because mine fits inside the case in such a way that the case barely closes, leaving me concerned it may fall out one day and break.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a few of them a couple of years ago, when I first learned about crystal/glass nail files.</li>
            <li>hands down the Very Best.......real nails file...bought</li>
            <li>because they were down so fast after a short while.</li>
            <li>The last one I purchased was exactly the opposite - too thick and it never really had much grit at all.</li>
            <li>A little thinner than another one I owned (lost not broken)</li>
            <li>I purchased the files for gifts because I had bought some in the past and like mine very much.  </li>
            <li>So good!&lt;br /&gt;One got lost, the other (finally) broke in half when I jammed my wallet around trying to fit stuff into a bag for the plane.</li>

            <li> It is a great product and all my friends were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> It works, and is probably a very handy size for carrying about in a purse.  </li>
            <li> my nails peel have dropped dramatically and i can get very nice square nails.</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> The glass nail files are the best you can get and they leave the nail very smooth after being filed.</li>
            <li> 8 of them give them to friends and they come with a nice case!~</li>
            <li> So impressed I bought two more for my sister and daughter.</li>
            <li> It is better for my nails, yet it does a great job!  </li>
            <li> and I am thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very nice!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great buy and very nice quality file - I even got a free mini glass file included in the order which is a great bonus!</li>
            <li> This is the best file for fingernails, just rinse with water to clean, so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> file is one of the good guys.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I needed a good nail file and the reviews looked really good.  </li>
            <li> These are good quality files.  </li>
            <li> Good file.</li>
            <li> It had a lot of good reviews, so I checked them out, just to see what the fuss was about.</li>
            <li> but that is because these are the good files.</li>
            <li> I bought some for others, and they loved this as well.</li>
            <li> It also is not as good as my mothers which has a finer bite.</li>
            <li> I think is as good as you can ask for when it comes to a nail file.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried OPI, Sephora, Sally Beauty, and Revlon&#x27;s products - none of them are as good as this one.</li>
            <li> AND it even comes in a plastic case (I know, this is not earth-shattering, but it means it won&#x27;t break in my purse like its beloved</li>
            <li> Not as good.  </li>
            <li> Use it all the time, good quality, like the protective case it came in to prevent it from shattering when dropped.</li>
            <li> is a good size to carry in purse</li>
            <li> But they work good on your nails.</li>
            <li> Good quality of material.</li>
            <li> This one is excellent and like the case, since dropping my first one broke it!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Makes a great gift since most people have never seen one.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and am gifting them to friends and they are very appreciative.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> I love mine!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite gift to give my friends and family!</li>
            <li> and so they are holding up better and growing longer without splitting than I can ever remember them growing before!</li>
            <li> Love the case!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love them!~</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>

            <li> Well, I thought it would be helpful to people to write my own experience.  </li>
            <li> Nice case and well designed.</li>
            <li> This thing IS really effective.</li>
            <li> The case is a nice addition - I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally breaking the file when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li> I think this would be a nice gift for family and friends.</li>
            <li> These are the best crystal nail files.......the real deal.  </li>
            <li> It is nice not to have to be concerned about filing in one direction.  </li>
            <li> The two I just bought from Amazon by Sassella, (one for me and one for my daughter) are really, really nice.</li>
            <li> Nice carry case.</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous and I like that there is no name brand on it like many of the others.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and I am so thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> Great quality, easy on the eye, washable and very easy on your nails.</li>
            <li> I carry mine with me all the time for a quick nail repair and they do the job beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY pleased, and will buy more for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is a fine product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all from paper to stone, but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> This is the best nail file for natural nails, period.  </li>
            <li> is by far the best nail file I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so wonderful that my 11 year old granddaughter talked me out of it</li>
            <li> I also really loved that the instructions that came with the file said it can be cleaned with soap and water and a light scrub brush (like a nail brush.)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t settle for cheap emery boards or metal files because it&#x27;s not all good for your nails.</li>
            <li> I also have made the mistake of buying some of the cheap glass files because I could find crystal glass file (and the first time I didn&#x27;t realize the difference), and will do my best to never make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> The nail file has a great feel, and it looks cool too :)</li>
            <li> Not only does it do a great job, it&#x27;s really beautiful to look at.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very fine grain</li>
            <li> I love love love it!</li>
            <li> Over all a very nice file and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is attractive, comes with a sturdy protective plastic case and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Arrived right away in very nice packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They sent me another one for free to assure my satisfaction, and let me tell you, I am VERY satisfied.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very smooth finish to my nails, unlike emery boards or the metal type of nail file.  </li>
            <li> They provide a very smooth nail.</li>
            <li> And on top of how great is works, it is pretty, too.  </li>
            <li> Easy to wash, and I always store it in the handy case, too.</li>
            <li> This one is good quality and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the carrying case.</li>
            <li> it comes in a case and will fit nicely in a purse</li>
            <li> I love crystal glass nail files, to me</li>
            <li> the are the best files out there, they last forever.</li>
            <li> So make sure you buy a crystal glass file and not just a glass nail file.</li>
            <li> but once you get used to it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Also love the case,keeps the file safe in my purse.</li>
            <li> Be sure to purchase a crystal glass nail file that&#x27;s been made in the Czech Republic.  </li>
            <li> I love this nail file</li>
            <li> It is better than all but one</li>
            <li> The Zeva file that I like better has a case that opens on one end and to me that seems preferable.</li>
            <li> This file is a definite win!</li>
            <li> Albeit the lack of color options, I&#x27;m satisfied with it, my nails are coming out firmer</li>
            <li> and I love it.     </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a healthy alternative to an abrasive nail file...</li>
            <li> But metal is so much more effective!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It used to take me ~5 minutes to file my nails, but it&#x27;s more like 2 minutes with this.</li>
            <li> Much better than using an emery board.  </li>
            <li> I love my crystal file.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any file getting better than this.</li>
            <li> I prefer glass nail files much more than any others</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I think I bought three - wish I&#x27;d bought more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Most nail files make my nails chip and split.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unusual looking but works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nail file for about three months now and my nails are in better shape than they&#x27;ve ever been.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing my nails longer than I have ever been able to before because they haven&#x27;t been breaking on me.  </li>
            <li> This one is better.</li>
            <li> file only in one direction for the best, smoothest results.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it :)</li>
            <li> but like that it has a case to keep it safe.</li>
            <li> Love this file -</li>
            <li> There are cheaper files out there, but I haven&#x27;t been able to compare.</li>
            <li> I have used Diamond Deb files for many years.</li>
            <li> Love that it is ground on both sides</li>
            <li> Really top quality and if you keep it in its case, it will not break.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love...</li>
            <li> and I will buy more for my friends.</li>
            <li> so be sure not to bend it.  </li>
            <li> Love this Nail file.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order more.  </li>
            <li> Files nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this file, bought one in Czeck Republic and broke it..</li>
            <li> the girls and i love this...if you&#x27;ve never had one or tried these, do so.  </li>
            <li> The individual carrying case is perfect for my purse.  </li>
            <li> Love this nail file.  </li>
            <li> we both love it.</li>
            <li> I love it and wouldn&#x27;t change my choice.</li>
            <li> I love that</li>
            <li> No snagging or peeling, in fact, your nail edges are as smooth as glass!</li>
            <li> It works even better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> I like filing with this better than emory boards because it is quicker anyway.  </li>
            <li> i guess this is better for your nails</li>
            <li> so i try to use it more than the others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this file and within weeks (along with sturdy top and bottom coats) noticed an improvement in the strength of my nails.  </li>
            <li> And smoothly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering a couple more</li>
            <li> I love using it and have purchased more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t wear out, all I have to do is rinse it now and then.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more files.</li>
            <li> She mentioned &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; files as being much better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to get my nails done at salons very often, so I figured this might be a good investment for doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this file.  </li>
            <li> I just feel it is better for my nails.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok for now.</li>
            <li> me pleased.</li>
            <li> So if your in search of a genuine crystal nail file, this is it!</li>
            <li> My nails feel so healthy</li>
            <li> Love this thing, have it with me all the time.</li>
            <li> I love these glass nail files.  </li>
            <li> I love having a cse</li>
            <li> Having this file in my purse has saved my nails so many times.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY satisfied with the service and product.</li>
            <li> All it comes with a free handy case to put it in so it won&#x27;t get damage.</li>
            <li> I love this file.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love this nail file.  </li>
            <li> This file is PERFECT, it is great to keep with me on the go, and works well without that rough feel of sandpaper, leaving my nails nice and smooth, without taking too much in one pass.</li>
            <li> i paired with gift with opi nail envy to help her nails become more healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> In any case, that may have been for the best, because I love this nail file so much more than that other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very smooth but not too fine.</li>
            <li> if I didn&#x27;t lose it :) I would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This file is still going strong after 17 months and has paid for itself many times over.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s so easy that I do it more often.</li>
            <li> Filing is quick and easy, and your nails have a nice, even finish.  </li>
            <li> Bought another one in my local retail store and it wasn&#x27;t very good at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a brand name crystal file, so I can&#x27;t say for sure if this is as high quality, but from what I&#x27;ve read about them, it seems to be just as good.    </li>
            <li> I love how perfectly smooth my nails are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as my primary files and love it.</li>
            <li> Ideally, I would like it to last me for months.</li>
            <li> Love the smooth finish they give my brittle&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans easily.</li>
            <li> Received the items very quickly.</li>
            <li> I had some concerns about some of the reviews that said this nail file can break easily.</li>
            <li> its so easy to use too.  </li>
            <li> The file is easily cleaned as well.  </li>
            <li> Colors make it easy to find in your purse or drawer.  </li>
            <li> have had no problems with clogging as the file is easily wiped or rinsed to remove nail dust.</li>
            <li> break easily</li>
            <li> I have brittle nails that peel and break easily.</li>
            <li> Easy on the nails.  </li>
            <li> They break easy because they are glass.</li>
            <li> The case is a bonus &amp; makes them easy to find.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth docking a star from a truly excellent product.</li>
            <li> After you file your nails, rinse it off and it&#x27;s as good as new.  </li>
            <li> and it is as good as new.</li>
            <li> So smooth and easy to use on your nails.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> and it fits in my purse fine</li>
            <li> It is very pretty on top of everything else.</li>
            <li> It will definitely take time to file strong nails, but they will feel great when the job is done.</li>
            <li> The edge is very smooth and gives my guitar a warm, lush tone to it.  </li>
            <li> but I imagine there may be some cheap imitations that don&#x27;t work (as well as over-priced ones).  </li>
            <li> The nail file leaves a really smooth edge</li>
            <li> (the sounds are louder when I roll my fingertips on a desk), and the file is easy to clean, coming with a case as well.</li>
            <li> Does not rip nails but files smoothly.</li>
            <li> And I still can&#x27;t believe something that feels this smooth (unlike my super-rough metal file) works so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The crystal file results in smooth nails that do not split at the edges.</li>
            <li> It leaves the nail edge extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these, and this is the one I like best.</li>
            <li> You can go in both directions and it leaves a smooth edge on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is the best glass file I have ever bought, and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> Nothing makes my nails feel as smooth and snag free as this file.</li>
            <li> I chose this model because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I got these as gifts for my female bridal party and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> and you will enjoy them.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> so I have them available all the time.</li>
            <li> Great product, My only regret is not buying it sooner, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It works fast leaving a nice edge.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, carrying case holds up well.</li>
            <li> and my nails are so smooth.  </li>
            <li> The price&lt;br /&gt;was fantastic.</li>
            <li> and this is gentle enough to feel wonderful, but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, gentle on my nails, and is supposed to last forever.</li>
            <li> I bought the cheap ones and really regretted it!!!  </li>
            <li> Which I will do right after typing this review. :)</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected, it&#x27;s the best nail file I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of cheaply made glass nail files out there where the abrasive part wears off in no time, but a true crystal glass file should never do this.</li>
            <li> They are perfect small gifts and are always well received.</li>
            <li> This is the first crystal file I&#x27;ve tried and I love it.</li>
            <li> Price was higher than most.</li>
            <li> It is an unique item.</li>
            <li> Its also very easy to wash it off and make it look like new!</li>
            <li> After using my purchase at home, and getting the most amazing results, I knew I had to buy several as gifts - but not at beauty supply prices.  </li>
            <li> The glass file doesn&#x27;t just compress the jagged nail edges like some of the others, it shears them away cleanly.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, nice price and the file makes my wife smile when she looks at her nails.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, it files and shapes my nails leaving clean edges.  </li>
            <li> They file my nails quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> In the case are also direction on how it&#x27;s use and how to clean it.</li>
            <li> well manufactured, light weight, strong material, easy to clean, comes with a case, and very aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quick, doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive when using, leaves a clean and smooth edge, and makes shaping a breeze.</li>
            <li> They were right!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get dull and works perfectly just as described!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love, I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> a good thing I didn&#x27;t make a bet with anyone, because I would have lost that bet instantly.</li>
            <li> so I doubt it&#x27;ll be of much concern to many or anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I intend on buying 16 more as I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Likes to item so much purchased three more for friends.  </li>
            <li> Great quality crystal, not sprayed on roughness, clearly the glass itself is etched, which means it will never dull</li>
            <li> It is also easy to control, as it responds to pressure very well and used lightly will contour and polish ridges.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and think it is as good as my previous one.  </li>
            <li> It rinses easily under water, is pretty sturdy, and comes in a plastic sleeve in a plastic tube.</li>
            <li> The pointy end is sharp and great for getting under the nails.</li>
            <li> Trying to fine another file like the first one.</li>
            <li> They quickly shape your nails without tearing them.  </li>
            <li> With the help of some people on online forums, I&#x27;ve been able to better take care of my nails in terms of shape, durability, and overall health so that I can play fingerstyle with nails.  </li>
            <li> *quickly</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and with no damage, even though it is glass.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about sixs months now and cannot be more satisfied, is the same grit now as it was when I received it.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> They are very pretty, too.</li>
            <li> This file is very fine and great for my weak nails.  </li>
            <li> The glass nail file from New Zealand was better qualtiy.</li>
            <li> Not being a person who messes with their nails much, I wanted an easy no fuss solution for when my nails chipped or broke.  </li>
            <li> Though I have strategically placed others around my environment, I can depend on this one to do an effective job at smoothing tiny to large snags quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> It works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess like those inexpensive emery board nail files.</li>
            <li> This file shaves off nail so gently and quickly!</li>
            <li> I should say up front that this is the only &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; file I have ever used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The real benefit of this file over the others is how smooth the end result is.</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble at all, and love how my nails look.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This file is worth it</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> This glass file does the job and though I have only had it for a couple of weeks, it seems to be holding its own.</li>
            <li> This was well worth the $$</li>
            <li> I play fingerstyle acoustic guitar and cut nails very short to avoid catching on adjacent strings.</li>
            <li> That said, it does do what I wanted and it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This files very effectively but isn&#x27;t too harsh either.  </li>
            <li> The late order surprisingly arrived in time for the party!</li>
            <li> Other than that, they file good and dont ever run out like reg emery boards</li>
            <li> Right size and works like a nail file should.</li>
            <li> and I contacted them willing to pay for a another for I have several friends that own the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They break very easy only problem with it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these before and gotten less than perfect quality, but this one seems to be a \\&quot;good\\&quot; one that will last without loosing it&#x27;s filing ability.</li>
            <li> They are great to carry in my bag but are not top quality.</li>
            <li> So good at taking down nails that I don&#x27;t need nail clipper anymore.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t receive the second nail file bonus gift that some have mentioned, but the file I did get is an impressive little thing.</li>
            <li> so I especially appriciate how gentle as well as effective they are.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping....</li>
            <li> Directions included and works better than the one I paid a few dollars more for at a gift shop.</li>
            <li> and they actually grow longer now since I&#x27;m able to care for them right when I need to.</li>
            <li> And the shipping was very fast.     </li>
            <li> This is very important, as in my home, it&#x27;s only a matter of time until it will fall/ get knocked to the floor and shatter.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> These files leave the edges of my nails so smooth that I don&#x27;t even have to worry about the old \\&quot;file in one direction</li>
            <li> I fell in love with glass nail files when I had the opportunity to test one out at a local beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> At first I wrote a glowing review</li>
            <li> Like being able to wash them, especially if someone else happens to pick mine up to use it, which to me is like someone using my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The double carrying case makes it safe to carry in my purse and pull out when ever I need.</li>
            <li> It actually helps me think better, if that makes any sense whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I had with the file is that while first using it, I noticed it to be rather smelly, like fermented foods.</li>
            <li> Guarantee you&#x27;ll like it ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this file for a very short time, but already love it.</li>
            <li> and this is the first file that hasn&#x27;t shredded them to pieces when I&#x27;ve tried to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fingerstyle guitarist who has recently gotten more into nail care.  </li>
            <li> This nail file is exactly what you would expect.  </li>
            <li> Since I first discovered glass nail files, I will not use anything else.  </li>
            <li> files pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky with my nails though</li>
            <li> right up until I went to dust the nail powder off on my nightgown, hit a button on said nightgown, and a large chunk broke</li>
            <li> I love that I will have this forever and not have to go back to using emery boards.</li>
            <li> And really pretty.</li>
            <li> I lost my first one, and replaced it with another.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to buy these because of the price and whether or not it would not cause splintering.</li>
            <li> &#x27;it&#x27;s a crystal file&#x27; specs, but they&#x27;re sadly not.</li>
            <li> the best nail fail</li>
            <li> It still files just as well as it did when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> This file seems to last; so I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> I am a nail file fan and will even admit to having purchased a $60 nail file that I thought would be my last nail file -- I&#x27;m pretty sure my cat knocked that one into a garbage can.</li>
            <li> I first bought a glass nail file at an art store in Provincetown.  </li>
            <li> broke edge after the first fall on the floor...</li>
            <li> Been reading about these, and I&#x27;m glad I finally purchases this!</li>
            <li> Much better than the traditional files.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> purchased first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I was looking for and seems to be alot better quality than one I bought in a local store.</li>
            <li> did I say long lasting, strong, and nice case to keep in your purse.  </li>
            <li> This is the one I always keep in my purse; since the plastic case is colorful and larger it&#x27;s easy to find.</li>
            <li> They come each in its own little protective carrying  case and the file is so pretty and colorful.</li>
            <li> Fantastic and no regrets about going back for more.</li>
            <li> I have very strong nails, and it does not really reduce them as fast as others have stated, but does leave the edge very smooth which is a definite plus.  </li>
            <li> I seriously love it, but there&#x27;s only so much you can say about a nail file in a review.</li>
            <li> I love them so much I ordered several -- one for the car, my purse, the bathroom, kitchen, and my husband.</li>
            <li> This file is fast and very gentle on your nails.</li>
            <li> The case is nice, but it&#x27;s a little short for the plastic sheath the file comes in, bends the top.  </li>
            <li> Cheap models (and even one not-so-cheap that rhymes with Enron) seem to have a coating over the \\&quot;crystal\\&quot; that quickly wears off on the edges of the file, resulting in an attempt to file your nails with smooth glass (not very effective as you might imagine).  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re much easier on nails than any other kind of file.  </li>
            <li> This file never becomes dull, it comes in a great case, and files my nails better than any other file I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Our Church is having a large Spring Fling in March.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to be certain about that.  </li>
            <li> It certainly will protect the file though.</li>
            <li> It took a hard dive to the floor one day, but I&#x27;m glad I could easily replace it with this one.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few others, but the case and size of this one are my favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not over the moon with the color choice, but it&#x27;s so effective, I look right past that.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on nails yet works better than other files.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> It is so gentle on my fingernails, yet strong enough to file my toenails.  </li>
            <li> I find this file makes it unnecessary to cut the nails, just file them - smooth, quick, efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had been using a diamond file with &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;shaping&amp;#34; grits, but this works better than either side.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very high quality for their price.  </li>
            <li> This was so nice, I just ordered a pair for my little wife.</li>
            <li> I bought these with some trepidation, not really trusting the claims made about glass nail files, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> but i can grow them a lot longer now because this file is so gentle.</li>
            <li> Be careful which you purchase as some are coarser, meant more for a pedicure style although I prefer to use the finer one on all of my nails.</li>
            <li> After much research I replaced the one I dropped with this which is also finer.</li>
            <li> and this is a very breakable file.  </li>
            <li> So after that whole situation, I came on here to find a quality file.</li>
            <li> This file works very well and has really prevented nail breakage of any sort.</li>
            <li> Incredibly fast shipping even close to the holidays.  </li>
            <li> Gave them out as gifts and were very well received.</li>
            <li> I think it is very durable.</li>
            <li> This one is no different, it gives a smooth finish to your cut nails</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 of these as gifts and the shipping on them went up a whole $1.</li>
            <li> It shapes my nails very well without cracking or splitting them.</li>
            <li> It arrived packaged very well and in a very timely manner also.</li>
            <li> File\\&quot; and thought, \\&quot;really?</li>
            <li> Be careful not to remove more nail than you intend until you get used to this file.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I never could get my nails completely smooth and snag-free with regular metal files or emery boards.  </li>
            <li> This nail file really lives up to its name</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of these files (I even bought another one as a gift).</li>
            <li> I sometimes can gently file the surface of the nail, if needed.</li>
            <li> Some had poor reviews, but I found this one with great reviews and decided to give it a try, and I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my nails are much sharper.</li>
            <li> The service and shipment was fast also.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well....</li>
            <li> , that is a real plus.</li>
            <li> Will even rough up the nail to polish it better.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sturdy, so don&#x27;t worry that they&#x27;re glass.</li>
            <li> I really like this glass file.  </li>
            <li> The price was very competitive with the others offered.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and have ordered additional ones for gifts to friends.  </li>
            <li> Once I am ready to purchase another filer I will buy this one again.</li>
            <li> They are very aggressive files though, not like drugstore or beauty supply products.  </li>
            <li> i havent really seen her without it since.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended glass nail files and finding these with the carrying case was a real bargain.  </li>
            <li> You have to be more careful with it</li>
            <li> My nails feel so much smoother using this one.  </li>
            <li> I get smooth nails without needing all different types of files with varying coarseness .  </li>
            <li> I really wanted a crystal nail file after watching pinksofoxy&#x27;s nail routine on youtube.</li>
            <li> Compare to the metal nail file I used, this makes my nails very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this nail file I have never had a glass file before I really like this file.</li>
            <li> it makes it much easier to carry the file wit me.</li>
            <li> LOVE this nail file and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is fastidious about their natural nails.</li>
            <li> They are extremely fine and file down quickly.  </li>
            <li> It really is pretty good, and I do feel that the nails are much much smoother than regular files, so I would imagine that in the long-term they would lead to a lot less damage to the nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased this file a year and a half ago, and I love it as much as ever!</li>
            <li> However, a bit of soap and water fixed that right up.</li>
            <li> Works super well--takes your nails down to the bed in seconds if you&#x27;re not paying attention--and leaves incredibly smooth edges.</li>
            <li> There was a general theme of \\&quot;It&#x27;s super effective!\\&quot;, so I figured why not?</li>
            <li> My nails got so long and strong because one, I kept them polished and two,</li>
            <li> Works better than other nail products.  </li>
            <li> I do like this file more than any other.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone its a worth wild investment.</li>
            <li> like the length of 5.5\\&quot; -- not too long, not too short, it&#x27;s Goldilocks and the substantial case is nice as well.  </li>
            <li> Love it, it works really well for my thin nails that split easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually going to try to buy another of these RIGHT NOW!</li>
            <li> Way better than your average nail file.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get dull, doesn&#x27;t chew up my nails, and it&#x27;s easy to clean when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> and its still like brand new even though i use it very often.</li>
            <li> works better and smoother than any file I have previously use.</li>
            <li> these glass files really do a much better job than any emery board or file that I&#x27;ve previously tried.  </li>
            <li> The surface of the cheaper file barely filed my nails (it took a long time to make any headway) and what it was able to file was ragged.</li>
            <li> The grit is gentle and works very well on my natural nail.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, the price is decent and it works.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, the seller sent a second nail file as a bonus gift ^.^</li>
            <li> So obviously I did a quick search on Amazon and stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li> and so is more fragile than  a metal file, but it cleans with water and shows no signs of becoming dull.</li>
            <li> highly recommended....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these files.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this file is cute and comes in a little case which i never use.</li>
            <li> It cleans really easily, although I prefer to rinse it off every other use, since it does get sort of clogged up with nail dust.    </li>
            <li> it files my nails nice and does not get dull.</li>
            <li> Files smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave rough edges.  </li>
            <li> As a male, I have a weird idiosyncrasy in plucking the hairs on my hand, so I&#x27;ve developed a habit of having perfectly trimmed nails to aid the process.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I am going to buy a few more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I had trouble keeping track of them and wasn&#x27;t overly pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Double sided; nice plastic carrying case; actually two; one inside and one outside.</li>
            <li> I bought this after finding out crystal files are more gentle on nails; My nails have been growing so fast lately</li>
            <li> I bought this file because my daughter had one and loved it, and I was tired of buying nail files all the time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Update: I ordered a second one and it&#x27;s a far cry from the first one, a piece of junk!</li>
            <li> It is fine but works fast with few strokes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful with it, have had my original one for three years, no chips, no breaks, no dulling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I got this glass file, I would purchase new sandpaper-type emery boards every couple months from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> After no luck with finding another Miss Manicure, I went about looking at these new glass files.</li>
            <li> However my nails haven&#x27;t splintered after four months of use and the file is still like new.</li>
            <li> Still like new.</li>
            <li> It comes in a plastic sleeve inside a hard plastic case, which makes it very easy to locate and also protects it.  </li>
            <li> You just rinse it to clean it and you can even use it on callouses after bathing while the callouses are still wet.</li>
            <li> When I went back to buy more, the store has closed.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty fragile nails</li>
            <li> It is silly to be so enthusiastic about a nail file - I need a life!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly know how to describe it, but of all the files I&#x27;ve had of all types, this is the only one I will ever buy again.</li>
            <li> so treat it as such ;-)</li>
            <li> It takes your nails down effectively with minimal friction.  </li>
            <li> go slow and easy as you can cut too much nail</li>
            <li> Case is large enough for file, in its sleeve &amp; (my additions) a cuticle stick, nail clippers, &amp; a nail-clipper-style cuticle nippers.</li>
            <li> other is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to give me the smoothness I was able to achieve with my other file; as in after inspecting them, I find a spot or two that just won&#x27;t curve and smooth out, so I use my other file to even out the corner.</li>
            <li> I never knew I could clean my previous file.</li>
            <li> My nail edges are much smoother after using this nail file compared to traditional \\&quot;cardboard\\&quot; type nail files and there are no \\&quot;worn</li>
            <li> So to the total shipping was $3.19, a real bargain I think.</li>
            <li> Boy will she be surprised when they arrive.</li>
            <li> So far this file has lost none of it&#x27;s Crystal &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; - it does not scratch off.</li>
            <li> This works at least as well and is even better for finishing.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s much gentler on my nails, giving me a smoother file.</li>
            <li> I definitely won’t be going back to using regular cheap nail files.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually made out of real crystals/glass.</li>
            <li> This file was much rougher and did not do the same job.  </li>
            <li> This one was just like OPI&#x27;s glass file only OPI&#x27;s comes in a plastic tube while this one is colorful and comes in a sleeve just like Revlon&#x27;s AND also another larger purple plastic tube case.</li>
            <li> Much much better than the metal file my mom gave me a few years back.</li>
            <li> It is quick, long lasting...</li>
            <li> comes in a vinyl sleeve that is a bit of a poor fit inside the also-included plastic carrying case (which I found to be a little too large for easy purse carrying--I just use the vinyl sleeve when I&#x27;m on the go).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave that little residue strip of nail that&#x27;s still attached after filing, it just shaves it off clean (along with some dust that&#x27;s unavoidable of course).</li>
            <li> I enjoy how long crystal nail files last, but as someone who tends to lose things, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on something I&#x27;m likely to lose.</li>
            <li> Files the nails down precisely and quickly, and I feel it is less abrasive than traditional emery boards.</li>
            <li> This is like no other orindary file!</li>
            <li> The file is attractive, at least half the price of most other crystal files, and comes with a hard plastic case as well as the soft plastic sheath.    </li>
            <li> After I use it, I just rinse it and let it air dry, then put it right back into its case.</li>
            <li> These files work very well and don&#x27;t wear out or dull up right away like the metal ones and</li>
            <li> No rough edges either!</li>
            <li> This little file does the job and is so pretty, to boot!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try a glass one, but boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> While I try very hard to make sure I won&#x27;t drop or break this one, I think the case would help if someone did drop it.</li>
            <li> I cannot really describe what a weird feeling it is to use this file, but I enjoy the results too much to switch back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and makes my nails very smooth.</li>
            <li> Planning to order a few more to keep in my purse and at my desk and other areas</li>
            <li> little beauty has texture on both sides, regular and extra fine.</li>
            <li> Leaves nails smooth and works well without having to press hard.</li>
            <li> I think the product is a little pricey compared to the competition, and I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s worth the full $10 (with shipping).</li>
            <li> This file gives the impression of being very fragile and slows me down a little as I frequently rearrange my grip on it so as to be more cautious, but I like the results.  </li>
            <li> Use the protective case and do not expose it to unusual abuse and it will last as long as you do.</li>
            <li> This one barely does the job.</li>
            <li> It did break the first time I dropped it, but if you&#x27;re careful, this nail file can last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> The colors are super cute and the case isn&#x27;t bad..</li>
            <li> They last a long time, and yet it is gentle enough that I&#x27;ll even use it on the cuticles on the sides of my finger tips/nails.</li>
            <li> I take a star away because mine fits inside the case in such a way that the case barely closes, leaving me concerned it may fall out one day and break.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a few of them a couple of years ago, when I first learned about crystal/glass nail files.</li>
            <li> hands down the Very Best.......real nails file...bought</li>
            <li> because they were down so fast after a short while.</li>
            <li> The last one I purchased was exactly the opposite - too thick and it never really had much grit at all.</li>
            <li> A little thinner than another one I owned (lost not broken)</li>
            <li> I purchased the files for gifts because I had bought some in the past and like mine very much.  </li>
            <li> So good!&lt;br /&gt;One got lost, the other (finally) broke in half when I jammed my wallet around trying to fit stuff into a bag for the plane.</li>
            <li> when i use a normal file i get down to it quicker.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thin enough to clean under the nail and the file surface stays gritty.</li>
            <li> They do seems to be lasting so far and not wearing out like other &#x27;crystal&#x27; files I have.</li>
            <li> I particularly like this crystal nail file because it comes in a hard plastic case in addition to the soft plastic file cover.  </li>
            <li> Though since using this, it&#x27;s decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I noted that another reviewer stated to be careful as this file can really take the length of your nails down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it doesn&#x27;t file aggressively, it is still sufficiently abrasive to pare down nails without clipping, but I prefer to clip first and do less filing</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Lasted me for a long time and probably would last until now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Miss Manicure nail file for over 6 years, the long metal one, and finally it&#x27;s come to its end.</li>
            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> It should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Though it is easily fixed with just going in one direction (I&#x27;ve read this usually happens if your nails aren&#x27;t thick enough to stand the file going back and forth, so I didn&#x27;t take much off in the rating for this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never liked filing my nails, but this file makes the job so incredibly fast</li>
            <li> it is the only one I have used for the past year on natural &amp; gel nails.</li>
            <li> i still cant grow them really really long</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m astonished that I lived this long without having one of these files.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that with long term use I can prevent splits and breakage (as the description claims) of my nails.</li>
            <li> It files without leaving any rough edges and files in only a couple passes.</li>
            <li> This crystal file lasts forever, doesn&#x27;t have the same rough texture as an emory board</li>
            <li> I had it in and the other one I left somewhere.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without knowing about files like this one!</li>
            <li> One or two broke in very different periods of time, due to me being careless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I no longer have that left over piece of nail on the edges like other nail files.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe a little file packs such a big punch.</li>
            <li> I have very long nails</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single broken/split nail.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the file since it is not completely flat, but slightly curved.  </li>
            <li> it takes a while to actually file my nails down to the size i want with this one.</li>
            <li> The only drawback of this file is that the feeling of drawing it across the edge of my nails sets my teeth slightly on edge.</li>
            <li> After more than a year it finally broke! :(</li>
            <li> and and I can&#x27;t go back to the previous trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had to trim my nails the last month and a half</li>
            <li> The information mailer included with the file and case says it was designed to be less fragile than it appears.  </li>
            <li> there were some way to temper the glass to make them less fragile, I&#x27;d give them 10 stars</li>
            <li> It looks as though it couldn&#x27;t file a broken nail, but its looks are deceptive; given just a little pressure it will quickly file a nail to meet the break.</li>
            <li> I realize it&#x27;s glass but definitely expected it to be much less fragile.</li>
            <li> It is a little different than the one I had before</li>
            <li> Over the years I have had a few of these types of files and the only reason I have had to buy a new one is because one I broke in half when I accidentally sat on the small purse</li>
            <li> shocked at how much I love this nail file.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a bit of a fanatic for growing out my natural nails and keeping them manicured (painted or not)</li>
            <li> The rough file surface is not just a coating like that of some other glass files.  </li>
            <li> I was previously using Revlon emery boards, but the grain was not a permanent part of the boards, so I went through them like crazy, and they didn&#x27;t give me a smooth edge.  </li>
            <li> Works great,just as it was discribed.the file bed is cut into the glass,not glued on as it is with some other files I have tried.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviewers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> one piece even flew up onto the table after the file fell on tile--it could have cut someone, so obviously these are not something small children should come into contact with.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these nail files after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I concur with the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Just rinse it when nail residue builds up, though it still works extremely well without rinsing.  </li>
            <li> Someone mentioned in the other comments that they&#x27;ve noticed an improved nail growth since using this glass file, and I&#x27;ll say I have too.</li>
            <li> /flaked off the side leaving sharp edges.</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other glass files that lasted for years.  </li>
            <li> It goes well with the other products.</li>
            <li> I just wish there were other colors ...</li>
            <li> Other glass files are not as sharp.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull at your nails like other nail files</li>
            <li> Once you use it, you won&#x27;t want to use any other.</li>
            <li> It takes me longe longer to file my nails with a cheap old metal file and emery boards are nothing but a big pieace of crap !</li>
            <li> My husbend won&#x27;t use any other file either.</li>
            <li> I have bought other glass files, and they only had texture on one side, and only had a thin plastic sheath to protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin enough to get under even short nails.</li>
            <li> That other file has a lifetime warranty that isn&#x27;t really necessary unless you break it - this file will never go dull.  </li>
            <li> I keep this little guy in my purse (in the case) and use it whenever I&#x27;m antsy or notice my nails are rough.</li>
            <li> It never gets dull, so unless I break it I have the last nail file I&#x27;ll ever have to buy!</li>
            <li> They shatter into quite a few pieces, btw, so be careful--</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere for a replacement crystal file for my old broken one.</li>
            <li> Previously, I was a flesh only player, and I&#x27;ve tried a few times in the past with playing with nails, but it&#x27;s never worked out.  </li>
            <li> The glass surface is indeed etched, not coated, so it doesn&#x27;t wear down with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;File</li>
            <li> Using down strokes at an angle on the nail edge will solve the problem.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t bear down on the nail using it -</li>
            <li> This nail file works well, and lives up to its reputation for not wearing down.</li>
            <li> I have ridges on my nails and just file them down as I do my nails.  </li>
            <li> This file is sharp!  </li>
            <li> I have had difficulty with other files in the past that cause rough edges that split.</li>
            <li> , I just spend 15-20 min once ever week or week and a half filing them down and cleaning them up.  </li>
            <li> My 90 yr old mother was having trouble with her tough nails splitting and snagging.</li>
            <li> comes as pictured and it helps my nails with  less chipping....</li>
            <li> I overheard one of my coworkers discussing nail files, and the fact that regular emery boards most people use are terrible for your nails.</li>
            <li> but it takes less time to file your nails in the shape that you perfare.</li>
            <li> I have to be gentle to avoid cutting down my finger nails rather than just smoothing off sharp edges after using clippers.</li>
            <li> These became dull and pretty much useless after just a few months.</li>
            <li> I play classical guitar with weak nails</li>
            <li> : it comes with a little protective case and carrying case, so you can choose how bulky/protected you&#x27;d like it to</li>
            <li> but it can still grind your nail down to nothing if you aren&#x27;t watching what you&#x27;re doing!    </li>
            <li> just be careful and place it somewhere where it won&#x27;t fall and break!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this file for a few months and have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> it takes a few times to get used to it</li>
            <li> I have accumulated a few in the meantime and believe me there is a GINORMOUS difference between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i think ive had it for a few years now</li>
            <li> Years ago I discovered the diamond file and thought I would never use another until someone gave me a glass file set a few years ago</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Note: using the file can feel a bit like running your nails across a blackboard (though there&#x27;s no sound, thankfully).</li>
            <li> What a mistake and waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was delivered within a few days.</li>
            <li> Bought this one to replace one just like it which went missing.</li>
            <li> I had a glass file that I&#x27;ve misplaced.</li>
            <li> somehow, I seemed to have misplaced it.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the nail file does not last long although they say it will last forever..  </li>
            <li> Bought it a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought quite a few of them and gave them as stocking stuffers for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I broke this file due to carelessness, and I bought a different brand.  </li>
            <li> The file isn&#x27;t too coarse, but it still gets the job done quickly without boring you to tears.</li>
            <li> For now I am seriously using a sizable shard from what&#x27;s left of my broken file.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These files are stronger than I thought they would be too; for the past three months I&#x27;ve kept one rattling around in my purse for emergencies</li>
            <li> So when my Revlon trimmer broke and my wife didn&#x27;t have any extras, I decided to go my usual route of researching and purchasing a replacement product: Amazon.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t buy crystal file for years, thought was pointless expense.</li>
            <li> if not better.</li>
            <li> I got tired of continuously buying disposable nail files, so I bought this glass file and two other metal files.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Leaves nail edges rough, heavy and too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was also looking for a hard case to protect it.</li>
            <li> Vinyl sleeve &amp; hard plastic case included.</li>
            <li> The file comes in a slim flexible plastic holder which is then shipped in a hard plastic oval case.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it breaks when you drop it on a hard floor because I&#x27;m trying not to.</li>
            <li> The file comes with a hard plastic case to keep it protected.</li>
            <li> It comes with a cover in a hard plastic case so it does not break.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has the plastic sheath as well as a hard plastic case.  </li>
            <li> file is glass, so it will reportedly break, but I keep mine in its plastic sleeve within a hard plastic case, and I have not had a problem (</li>
            <li> lasts forever, if you do not drop it hard, and can be rinsed off when looking chalky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But...don&#x27;t drop it on a hard surface, it might break.</li>
            <li> It also feels awkward getting it in and out of the case since the case joins together in the middle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that they&#x27;re delicate, but being careful can turn a $6 purchase into a lifetime investment.  </li>
            <li> At least until I break it somehow, or it goes permanently \\&quot;missing\\&quot; while my nieces are over for a visit.    </li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend uses it on his thick nails, and it hasn&#x27;t dulled a bit.</li>
            <li> No more losing files!</li>
            <li> only very small complaint, that I&#x27;ve read happens to some but not everyone, is that when filing back and forth, one way it will make this nasty grinding feeling on my nail, like nails on a chalkboard!</li>
            <li> It seriously has the texture of a chalkboard.  </li>
            <li> These things are serious files.  </li>
            <li> If I go for a professional manicure, I bring this, as I hate for anything else to be used on me.  </li>
            <li> Never gets dull, just rinse it off and keep using it!  </li>
            <li> if you have weak nails</li>
            <li> but my nails were always so brittle so this one or that one would chip or the layers would split and flake off leaving weak spots.  </li>
            <li> My nails are thin, weak, and flaky.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get broken.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m amazed that it hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> She would be heart broken.</li>
            <li> I like the case because I can keep it on my side table and use it whenever I&#x27;m watching TV without fear of it getting lost or broken.</li>
            <li> I had broken the file (just the end)</li>
            <li> Emory boards make me nauseated, and they just seem to shred the layers in my nails and make them weaker.</li>
            <li> files\\&quot; which was not in my lexicon of fake nails.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with it, but this damned thing has lost</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> while it lasts forever it feels weird to use</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the grit eventually wears off of those, making filing take longer and longer.</li>
            <li> Once you purchase this product, you will never go back to those horrible cardboard emery boards again!</li>
            <li> My nails are typically very thin and brittle, and break often.</li>
            <li> Would be impossible on very hard nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used metal files (usually Revlon) because I hate the feel of emery boards</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like it, because it looks like plastic, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it, because it feels like sand blasted glass.</li>
            <li> I am tired of the stupid files sold at Walgreens that are made of cardboard or whatever the flimsy material is.</li>
            <li> boy, am I sorry!</li>
            <li> (Sorry Mom!)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of this file.  </li>
            <li> lasted just 1 week for me :(</li>
            <li> And I hate emery boards.</li>
            <li> This is one bad ass nail file!!!</li>
            <li> My nails are prone to flaking and breaking, especially in cold weather.  </li>
            <li> I have horribly brittle and flimsy finger nails, despite all sorts of vitamins, moisturizing, etc., and during the winter they break and peel like nothing else.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, I promise!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Way better than your average nail file. Does a great job at filing nails without damaging them. Love the carrying case.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of class nail files before, and I thought they might be a gimmick, but it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money, so thought I would give it a try. It really is pretty good, and I do feel that the nails are much much smoother than regular files, so I would imagine that in the long-term they would lead to a lot less damage to the nails.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes in a case and will fit nicely in a purse so it doesn&#x27;t get broken.  The glass nail files are the best you can get and they leave the nail very smooth after being filed.</li>
            <li> I love crystal glass nail files, to me the are the best files out there, they last forever. There are a lot of cheaply made glass nail files out there where the abrasive part wears off in no time, but a true crystal glass file should never do this. So make sure you buy a crystal glass file and not just a glass nail file. I&#x27;ve had this file for a few months and have had no issues with it. Over the years I have had a few of these types of files and the only reason I have had to buy a new one is because one I broke in half when I accidentally sat on the small purse I had it in and the other one I left somewhere. I also have made the mistake of buying some of the cheap glass files because I could find crystal glass file (and the first time I didn&#x27;t realize the difference), and will do my best to never make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> this file is great. it takes a few times to get used to it, it&#x27;s a bit different than an emory board. but once you get used to it you&#x27;ll love it. you nails will stop peeling and splitting and you can go both directions and it won&#x27;t damage your nails. they last for ever too.</li>
            <li> I bought these with some trepidation, not really trusting the claims made about glass nail files, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. These are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is never the slightest ragged edge on my nails now. These files leave the edges of my nails so smooth that I don&#x27;t even have to worry about the old \\&quot;file in one direction only\\&quot; rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These files are stronger than I thought they would be too; for the past three months I&#x27;ve kept one rattling around in my purse for emergencies and I&#x27;m amazed that it hasn&#x27;t broken yet. I&#x27;m VERY pleased, and will buy more for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12/14/10&lt;br /&gt;I bought a set of a different brand of glass file (cheaper) and boy, am I sorry! The surface of the cheaper file barely filed my nails (it took a long time to make any headway) and what it was able to file was ragged. I&#x27;m buying another Sassella file tonight!</li>
            <li> I was researching nail care (after taking my acrylic nails off two months ago--aaack what a keratin disaster), I read somewhere about something called \\&quot;crystal nail files\\&quot; which was not in my lexicon of fake nails.  I have accumulated a few in the meantime and believe me there is a GINORMOUS difference between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This file is one of the good guys.  This file appears to be \\&quot;etched\\&quot; providing the filing experience.  Cheap models (and even one not-so-cheap that rhymes with Enron) seem to have a coating over the \\&quot;crystal\\&quot; that quickly wears off on the edges of the file, resulting in an attempt to file your nails with smooth glass (not very effective as you might imagine).  You can even see it--clear on the edge and white in the middle.  THIS nail file DOES NOT DO THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the length of 5.5\\&quot; -- not too long, not too short, it&#x27;s Goldilocks and the substantial case is nice as well.  This is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; file. Though I have strategically placed others around my environment, I can depend on this one to do an effective job at smoothing tiny to large snags quickly and easily.  As others have mentioned, watch what you are doing or you can take medium length nails to short in no time.  I&#x27;d recommend this file without reservation.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this file.Works great,just as it was discribed.the file bed is cut into the glass,not glued on as it is with some other files I have tried.Also love the case,keeps the file safe in my purse.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with glass nail files when I had the opportunity to test one out at a local beauty supply store.  Without the test I would never have parted with the rather steep price at the beauty supply store.  After using my purchase at home, and getting the most amazing results, I knew I had to buy several as gifts - but not at beauty supply prices.  I researched the different brands on Amazon and settled on this one.  The late order surprisingly arrived in time for the party! I wish I had discovered this item years ago.  My toe nails have not been in this great shape for years.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, a crystal glass nail file is the only way to go.  My nail edges are much smoother after using this nail file compared to traditional \\&quot;cardboard\\&quot; type nail files and there are no \\&quot;worn areas\\&quot; after using.  Simply rinse the file and it looks like it hasn&#x27;t been used.  I particularly like this crystal nail file because it comes in a hard plastic case in addition to the soft plastic file cover.  Be sure to purchase a crystal glass nail file that&#x27;s been made in the Czech Republic.  The rough file surface is not just a coating like that of some other glass files.  It&#x27;s a permanent part of the file.</li>
            <li> After I saw one of these great nail files, I ordered a bunch of them for Christmas presents for friends and relatives.  They quickly shape your nails without tearing them.  I have rather frail nails so I especially appriciate how gentle as well as effective they are.</li>
            <li> my nails always peeled and split. i still cant grow them really really long but i can grow them a lot longer now because this file is so gentle. i think ive had it for a few years now and its still like brand new even though i use it very often. if you have weak nails this file is a must.</li>
            <li> Love this product and am gifting them to friends and they are very appreciative.  Arrived right away in very nice packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a glass file just like this one before.  It took a hard dive to the floor one day, but I&#x27;m glad I could easily replace it with this one.  I am sold on the glass file and will never go back to regular files.  After you file your nails, rinse it off and it&#x27;s as good as new.  It files great and never wears out.  I don&#x27;t know how one glass file compares with another but I imagine there may be some cheap imitations that don&#x27;t work (as well as over-priced ones).  But this one (as sold by sassella spa) works for me.</li>
            <li> Oh boo!  At first I wrote a glowing review but it&#x27;s been 2 weeks and my file is.. glass!  Ahahaha.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with it, but this damned thing has lost it&#x27;s grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I used it quite industrially, but damn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering the opi next time.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviewers on Amazon. The nail file leaves a really smooth edge and I&#x27;m astonished that I lived this long without having one of these files. It cleans really easily, although I prefer to rinse it off every other use, since it does get sort of clogged up with nail dust.    The only drawback of this file is that the feeling of drawing it across the edge of my nails sets my teeth slightly on edge. Does it affect anyone else? I end up not drawing it back and forth, but file in one direction only to minimize the vibrations. I cannot really describe what a weird feeling it is to use this file, but I enjoy the results too much to switch back.</li>
            <li> After more than a year it finally broke! :( It was totally my fault for dropping it though! I love this nail file it is the only one I have used for the past year on natural &amp; gel nails. I love it! Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all from paper to stone, but this is by far the best.  The glass file doesn&#x27;t just compress the jagged nail edges like some of the others, it shears them away cleanly.</li>
            <li> i play classical guitar...this is the best file i ever had...highly recommended....it does not tear up my nails and preps for finnishing</li>
            <li> Years ago I discovered the diamond file and thought I would never use another until someone gave me a glass file set a few years ago--don&#x27;t know what will ever get me to switch from these. Be careful which you purchase as some are coarser, meant more for a pedicure style although I prefer to use the finer one on all of my nails. Like being able to wash them, especially if someone else happens to pick mine up to use it, which to me is like someone using my toothbrush. Yuck. After much research I replaced the one I dropped with this which is also finer. They shatter into quite a few pieces, btw, so be careful--one piece even flew up onto the table after the file fell on tile--it could have cut someone, so obviously these are not something small children should come into contact with.</li>
            <li> perfect! works better and smoother than any file I have previously use.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It is better than all but one file I&#x27;ve ever used.  I take a star away because mine fits inside the case in such a way that the case barely closes, leaving me concerned it may fall out one day and break.  It also feels awkward getting it in and out of the case since the case joins together in the middle and this is a very breakable file.  The Zeva file that I like better has a case that opens on one end and to me that seems preferable.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 8/31/12: Am now on my THIRD one of these. So good!&lt;br /&gt;One got lost, the other (finally) broke in half when I jammed my wallet around trying to fit stuff into a bag for the plane. They lasted me about a year each. Fantastic and no regrets about going back for more. If only my iPhone were this durable.&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t receive the second nail file bonus gift that some have mentioned, but the file I did get is an impressive little thing. Works super well--takes your nails down to the bed in seconds if you&#x27;re not paying attention--and leaves incredibly smooth edges. Cleans easily. The pointy end is sharp and great for getting under the nails. The glass surface is indeed etched, not coated, so it doesn&#x27;t wear down with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;File comes in a vinyl sleeve that is a bit of a poor fit inside the also-included plastic carrying case (which I found to be a little too large for easy purse carrying--I just use the vinyl sleeve when I&#x27;m on the go).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great crystal file! I think I&#x27;m done buying them for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note: using the file can feel a bit like running your nails across a blackboard (though there&#x27;s no sound, thankfully). Using down strokes at an angle on the nail edge will solve the problem.</li>
            <li> I was one of those people that bought the Revlon glass file at the drugstore after hearing about glass files. What a mistake and waste of money. So after that whole situation, I came on here to find a quality file. This one was just like OPI&#x27;s glass file only OPI&#x27;s comes in a plastic tube while this one is colorful and comes in a sleeve just like Revlon&#x27;s AND also another larger purple plastic tube case. This is the one I always keep in my purse; since the plastic case is colorful and larger it&#x27;s easy to find. They are both the same length. This file works very well and has really prevented nail breakage of any sort.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without knowing about files like this one! The double carrying case makes it safe to carry in my purse and pull out when ever I need. No more losing files! And it works PERFECTLY.  I love love love it! I have very long nails and they actually grow longer now since I&#x27;m able to care for them right when I need to. I love how perfectly smooth my nails are. This file is a definite win!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected, it&#x27;s the best nail file I have ever bought! I highly recommend it to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Update: I ordered a second one and it&#x27;s a far cry from the first one, a piece of junk!</li>
            <li> Incredibly fast shipping even close to the holidays.  Product is the equivalent of another crystal file I had purchased at 3+ times the cost.  That other file has a lifetime warranty that isn&#x27;t really necessary unless you break it - this file will never go dull.  Gave them out as gifts and were very well received.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what brand this was when I bought it, so I couldn&#x27;t pick the colors. As a male, I have a weird idiosyncrasy in plucking the hairs on my hand, so I&#x27;ve developed a habit of having perfectly trimmed nails to aid the process.&lt;br /&gt;But where my habit ceases, I&#x27;ve grown quite fond of having my nails neatly trimmed. It actually helps me think better, if that makes any sense whatsoever. So when my Revlon trimmer broke and my wife didn&#x27;t have any extras, I decided to go my usual route of researching and purchasing a replacement product: Amazon. This filer was the highest rated product, and, having not heard of glass filers before, I thought to try it out. A month later and and I can&#x27;t go back to the previous trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, I had to buy a filer because the highest rated trimmers didn&#x27;t come with any built in, but now I&#x27;d recommend this one over any built-in one. Albeit the lack of color options, I&#x27;m satisfied with it, my nails are coming out firmer (the sounds are louder when I roll my fingertips on a desk), and the file is easy to clean, coming with a case as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I needed a good nail file and the reviews looked really good.  Well, I thought it would be helpful to people to write my own experience.  This nail file feels like nails against a chalkboard.  It makes me shudder, just the thought of using it.  It seriously has the texture of a chalkboard.  Yikes.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> This is one bad ass nail file!!! I love it!! Best nail file ever!!! I actually should&#x27;ve ordered two. Which I will do right after typing this review. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these nail files after reading other reviews.  I concur with the other reviewers.  These are good quality files.  I was also looking for a hard case to protect it. Very happy with purchase.  It was delivered within a few days.</li>
            <li> I purchased the files for gifts because I had bought some in the past and like mine very much.  I carry mine with me all the time for a quick nail repair and they do the job beautifully.  They come each in its own little protective carrying  case and the file is so pretty and colorful. They are perfect small gifts and are always well received.</li>
            <li> Arrived 3 days ahead of estimated delivery window; I received 1 file, as ordered (some reviewers stated they received a \\&quot;bonus\\&quot; file; I did not). Vinyl sleeve &amp; hard plastic case included. Case is large enough for file, in its sleeve &amp; (my additions) a cuticle stick, nail clippers, &amp; a nail-clipper-style cuticle nippers. LOVE!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a brand name crystal file, so I can&#x27;t say for sure if this is as high quality, but from what I&#x27;ve read about them, it seems to be just as good.    The file is attractive, at least half the price of most other crystal files, and comes with a hard plastic case as well as the soft plastic sheath.    The biggest problem I had with the file is that while first using it, I noticed it to be rather smelly, like fermented foods. However, a bit of soap and water fixed that right up.</li>
            <li> Great file. Bought this one to replace one just like it which went missing. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I love mine! It never gets dull, so unless I break it I have the last nail file I&#x27;ll ever have to buy! I am always doing my nails, so this was a great purchase for me. Guarantee you&#x27;ll like it ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this file for a very short time, but already love it. The file seems like it would be fragile, since its glass/crystal, but after getting use to the weight of it I think it is very durable. As it is glass/crystal I wouldn&#x27;t bear down on the nail using it - but you shouldn&#x27;t do that when your filing anyway. The grit is gentle and works very well on my natural nail. I didn&#x27;t need to keep filing the same spot over and over again to get the shape I wanted to. I am hoping that with long term use I can prevent splits and breakage (as the description claims) of my nails. I would recommend this product, the price is decent and it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a glass nail file before and they are great. This one is no different, it gives a smooth finish to your cut nails and I love it.     I ordered 6 of these as gifts and the shipping on them went up a whole $1. So to the total shipping was $3.19, a real bargain I think. And the shipping was very fast.     The file comes in a slim flexible plastic holder which is then shipped in a hard plastic oval case. They all arrived unbroken and I would guess the case will protect well in daily use.     All in all I think this is a fine product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this crystal file.  Never gets dull, just rinse it off and keep using it!  This would make a great stocking stuffer or teacher gift.</li>
            <li> The glass nail file from New Zealand was better qualtiy. This one barely does the job. Would be impossible on very hard nails.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping....these are great nail files...i&#x27;lll buy from them again. This is my favorite gift to give my friends and family!</li>
            <li> This is the best nail file I have ever used. It shapes my nails very well without cracking or splitting them. No rough edges either! It arrived packaged very well and in a very timely manner also.</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail today and I&#x27;m in love, I highly recommend it!  If you&#x27;re looking for a healthy alternative to an abrasive nail file...this is it.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one I have bought. These are wonderful. Treat yourself to one of these if you have never used</li>
            <li> I keep this little guy in my purse (in the case) and use it whenever I&#x27;m antsy or notice my nails are rough. I have pretty fragile nails and this is the first file that hasn&#x27;t shredded them to pieces when I&#x27;ve tried to use it. My nails have smoother edges and so they are holding up better and growing longer without splitting than I can ever remember them growing before!</li>
            <li> My 90 yr old mother was having trouble with her tough nails splitting and snagging. These do the trick. I like &#x27;em too.</li>
            <li> Good file. Does not rip nails but files smoothly. Nice case and well designed. Would recommend. It should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This file is very fine and great for my weak nails.  It will definitely take time to file strong nails, but they will feel great when the job is done.</li>
            <li> Should you buy it: Definitely. Do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It files well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Word on the street is that it&#x27;s fragile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit it... I saw \\&quot;Crystal Nail File\\&quot; and thought, \\&quot;really? But metal is so much more effective!\\&quot; It had a lot of good reviews, so I checked them out, just to see what the fuss was about. There was a general theme of \\&quot;It&#x27;s super effective!\\&quot;, so I figured why not? It&#x27;s only $7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t make a bet with anyone, because I would have lost that bet instantly. This thing IS really effective. It doesn&#x27;t look like it, because it looks like plastic, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it, because it feels like sand blasted glass. But you start filing at your nails... and you can instantly tell that this is a quality product. It used to take me ~5 minutes to file my nails, but it&#x27;s more like 2 minutes with this. And I still can&#x27;t believe something that feels this smooth (unlike my super-rough metal file) works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it will occasionally snag on one of my nails. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything, it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not expecting it since I file my nails as a fidget and it totally throws off my focus. Definitely not worth docking a star from a truly excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is the first crystal file I&#x27;ve tried and I love it. Doesn&#x27;t get dull, doesn&#x27;t chew up my nails, and it&#x27;s easy to clean when I&#x27;m done. The case is a nice addition - I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally breaking the file when I&#x27;m not using it. Very satisfied, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of a glass nail file before finding this on Amazon.  I like the feel of the file since it is not completely flat, but slightly curved.  My nails are prone to flaking and breaking, especially in cold weather.  This file has improved nail growth by preserving the nails as they are maintained.  It takes your nails down effectively with minimal friction.  Be careful not to remove more nail than you intend until you get used to this file.</li>
            <li> I like this glass nail file. It&#x27;s thin and makes my nails very smooth. I&#x27;m so happy that I have it!</li>
            <li> Love the case!  The last file I had like this broke in my purse because I didn&#x27;t have a case.  Received the items very quickly.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Much better than using an emery board.  Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love my crystal file.  I never could get my nails completely smooth and snag-free with regular metal files or emery boards.  This little file does the job and is so pretty, to boot!</li>
            <li> That was one of the best nail file I ever used. Lasted me for a long time and probably would last until now if I didn&#x27;t lose it :) I would strongly recommend it. You wont regret about this investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fingerstyle guitarist who has recently gotten more into nail care.  Previously, I was a flesh only player, and I&#x27;ve tried a few times in the past with playing with nails, but it&#x27;s never worked out.  With the help of some people on online forums, I&#x27;ve been able to better take care of my nails in terms of shape, durability, and overall health so that I can play fingerstyle with nails.  I was recommended a glass nail file.  I was previously using Revlon emery boards, but the grain was not a permanent part of the boards, so I went through them like crazy, and they didn&#x27;t give me a smooth edge.  These crystal glass nail files are supposed to last a lifetime, and I believe it.  They&#x27;re very high quality for their price.  They are extremely fine and file down quickly.  The edge is very smooth and gives my guitar a warm, lush tone to it.  I highly recommend these files.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that they&#x27;re delicate, but being careful can turn a $6 purchase into a lifetime investment.  I will say that I bought three of these just in case I break one or two.  :)  I don&#x27;t see any file getting better than this.</li>
            <li> Great quality, easy on the eye, washable and very easy on your nails. It is glass, so it can break if dropped, but it comes with a plastic case to put it away in.</li>
            <li> This nail file really lives up to its name I would highly recommend this to anyone its a worth wild investment.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get dull and works perfectly just as described! I seriously love it, but there&#x27;s only so much you can say about a nail file in a review. Just buy this and you&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> This nail file is exactly what you would expect.  It is durable and does the job.  I prefer glass nail files much more than any others</li>
            <li> The Sassella Crystal Glass nail file is wonderful. I will never use a flimsy metal file again. The crystal file results in smooth nails that do not split at the edges. I have had difficulty with other files in the past that cause rough edges that split. No longer!     The crystal file is well manufactured, light weight, strong material, easy to clean, comes with a case, and very aesthetically pleasing. This file is even supposed to last a lifetime, we shall see.    I am going to buy a few more for gifts. Great value.</li>
            <li> It is silly to be so enthusiastic about a nail file - I need a life! But I have never had a file like this. It is fine but works fast with few strokes. It leaves the nail edge extremely smooth. I don&#x27;t exactly know how to describe it, but of all the files I&#x27;ve had of all types, this is the only one I will ever buy again. When I purchased this I think I bought three - wish I&#x27;d bought more to give as gifts. Just perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these, and this is the one I like best. The last one I bought I threw away. This one I had for a year or two until I lost it and then I bought the one I threw away regrettably, and will replace that with another of these. I hope they&#x27;re still available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thin enough to clean under the nail and the file surface stays gritty. The last one I purchased was exactly the opposite - too thick and it never really had much grit at all. I&#x27;m actually going to try to buy another of these RIGHT NOW!</li>
            <li> wonderful nail file! does a great job! Most nail files make my nails chip and split. This one does NOT. I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of these files (I even bought another one as a gift). Files the nails down precisely and quickly, and I feel it is less abrasive than traditional emery boards. I sometimes can gently file the surface of the nail, if needed. Easy to wash, and I always store it in the handy case, too. I think the product is a little pricey compared to the competition, and I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s worth the full $10 (with shipping).</li>
            <li> hands down the Very Best.......real nails file...bought 8 of them give them to friends and they come with a nice case!~ It&#x27;s unusual looking but works great and I love them!~</li>
            <li> This was so nice, I just ordered a pair for my little wife. Boy will she be surprised when they arrive.</li>
            <li> I have used emery boards for years.  I had trouble keeping track of them and wasn&#x27;t overly pleased with the results.  I had some concerns about some of the reviews that said this nail file can break easily. I have had no trouble at all, and love how my nails look.  It comes in a plastic sleeve inside a hard plastic case, which makes it very easy to locate and also protects it.  It leaves a very smooth finish to my nails, unlike emery boards or the metal type of nail file.  I will never go back to emery boards.  Just rinse it when nail residue builds up, though it still works extremely well without rinsing.  And on top of how great is works, it is pretty, too.  I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> Since I first discovered glass nail files, I will not use anything else.  I have also discovered that the quality can vary greatly between manufacturers.  This nail file is definitely a quality item!</li>
            <li> Affordable price for a quality product! Crystal nail files are more expensive than regular files, but do not break or crack your nails. Well worth the money.  This particular brand is less expensive than most crystal files.</li>
            <li> Awesome file! Leaves nails smooth and works well without having to press hard. The colors are super cute and the case isn&#x27;t bad.. And it was on my doorstep in 3 days. I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> i am impressed with the quality of the glass nail file and the quickness they were sent to me.  Have recommended to my friends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nail file for about three months now and my nails are in better shape than they&#x27;ve ever been.  I&#x27;ve always been a bit of a fanatic for growing out my natural nails and keeping them manicured (painted or not) but my nails were always so brittle so this one or that one would chip or the layers would split and flake off leaving weak spots.  Since I got into the habit of using this glass file, I haven&#x27;t had any chips or layer splitting! I&#x27;m growing my nails longer than I have ever been able to before because they haven&#x27;t been breaking on me.  I haven&#x27;t even had to trim my nails the last month and a half, I just spend 15-20 min once ever week or week and a half filing them down and cleaning them up.  LOVE this nail file and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is fastidious about their natural nails.</li>
            <li> The glass file seems to help strengthen the nails and prevents them from chipping. I had a glass file that I&#x27;ve misplaced. This one is better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this file a year and a half ago, and I love it as much as ever! The file doesn&#x27;t cause nail splitting or breaking, even if you can&#x27;t resist using that back-and-forth motion that you know isn&#x27;t great for your nails but just gets the job done so *quickly*. (Hint: file only in one direction for the best, smoothest results.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I got this glass file, I would purchase new sandpaper-type emery boards every couple months from the drugstore. (Never again - ugh!) This file is still going strong after 17 months and has paid for itself many times over. Even my boyfriend uses it on his thick nails, and it hasn&#x27;t dulled a bit. Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Miss Manicure nail file for over 6 years, the long metal one, and finally it&#x27;s come to its end. After no luck with finding another Miss Manicure, I went about looking at these new glass files. Some had poor reviews, but I found this one with great reviews and decided to give it a try, and I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It files pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t leave that little residue strip of nail that&#x27;s still attached after filing, it just shaves it off clean (along with some dust that&#x27;s unavoidable of course). I&#x27;ve noticed my nails are much sharper. Someone mentioned in the other comments that they&#x27;ve noticed an improved nail growth since using this glass file, and I&#x27;ll say I have too. My nails are typically very thin and brittle, and break often. Though since using this, it&#x27;s decreased significantly. One or two broke in very different periods of time, due to me being careless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only very small complaint, that I&#x27;ve read happens to some but not everyone, is that when filing back and forth, one way it will make this nasty grinding feeling on my nail, like nails on a chalkboard! Though it is easily fixed with just going in one direction (I&#x27;ve read this usually happens if your nails aren&#x27;t thick enough to stand the file going back and forth, so I didn&#x27;t take much off in the rating for this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to give me the smoothness I was able to achieve with my other file; as in after inspecting them, I find a spot or two that just won&#x27;t curve and smooth out, so I use my other file to even out the corner. I&#x27;m pretty picky with my nails though so I doubt it&#x27;ll be of much concern to many or anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5, one star taken for the two reasons combined. Great file and I love it :)</li>
            <li> This nail file comes in a nice protective case, and is the best nail file I&#x27;ve ever used! I bought one for home, and one for the office. I think this would be a nice gift for family and friends.</li>
            <li> This file never becomes dull, it comes in a great case, and files my nails better than any other file I have ever owned. It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> These are the best crystal nail files.......the real deal.  You can go in both directions and it leaves a smooth edge on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I love these files!  The service and shipment was fast also.  I am picky what I use on my finger nails and these didn&#x27;t disappoint me.&lt;br /&gt;Just go slow and easy as you can cut too much nail but that is because these are the good files.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  I use it almost in a daily basis.  its so easy to use too.  great product!</li>
            <li> A little thinner than another one I owned (lost not broken) but like that it has a case to keep it safe.</li>
            <li> Our Church is having a large Spring Fling in March. I do 3 tables and this is part of my Thank You gifts for the 24 ladies that will be a my tables. I intend on buying 16 more as I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Love this file - I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking it with the carrying case, and just keep it in my bag at all times. I bought some for others, and they loved this as well. There are cheaper files out there, but I haven&#x27;t been able to compare. So far this file has lost none of it&#x27;s Crystal &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; - it does not scratch off.</li>
            <li> I have used Diamond Deb files for many years. This works at least as well and is even better for finishing. It looks as though it couldn&#x27;t file a broken nail, but its looks are deceptive; given just a little pressure it will quickly file a nail to meet the break. It is also easy to control, as it responds to pressure very well and used lightly will contour and polish ridges. It is glass and so is more fragile than  a metal file, but it cleans with water and shows no signs of becoming dull. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever owned and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great size and travel case for traveling in my cosmetic bag</li>
            <li> It worked really well.... right up until I went to dust the nail powder off on my nightgown, hit a button on said nightgown, and a large chunk broke/flaked off the side leaving sharp edges. I realize it&#x27;s glass but definitely expected it to be much less fragile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as my primary files and love it. They do seems to be lasting so far and not wearing out like other &#x27;crystal&#x27; files I have.</li>
            <li> My file is in  it&#x27;s case and with me all the time. It is the best glass file I have ever bought, and I have tried quite a few. Love that it is ground on both sides, that is a real plus. I take it with me when I get my nails done and have them use it. Nothing makes my nails feel as smooth and snag free as this file. I will never buy any other. I am going to buy these as gifts for my friends. Really top quality and if you keep it in its case, it will not break.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love...did I say Love this nail file!!!  Nothing has beat the crystal glass nail file.  It is quick, long lasting...did I say long lasting, strong, and nice case to keep in your purse.  I bought a set for me and my friend and we are both impressed!!  We will use nothing else!</li>
            <li> comes as pictured and it helps my nails with  less chipping.... just be careful and place it somewhere where it won&#x27;t fall and break!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten a longer file.  It works, and is probably a very handy size for carrying about in a purse.  At home though I would prefer one that is longer.  It also is not as good as my mothers which has a finer bite.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to emory boards -- wish I&#x27;d found out about glass files years ago.  Filing is quick and easy, and your nails have a nice, even finish.  The file is easily cleaned as well.  I don&#x27;t know if it breaks when you drop it on a hard floor because I&#x27;m trying not to.</li>
            <li> This file is worth it and it works like a pro. Worth the price and I will buy more for my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this nail file! Best I&#x27;ve ever owned. I was skeptical to try a glass one, but boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> This is such a neat item.  Perfect for your purse or drawer.  Seems to last forever.  Not flexible so be sure not to bend it.  Colors make it easy to find in your purse or drawer.  Makes a great gift since most people have never seen one.  Will even rough up the nail to polish it better.  A must have for me!</li>
            <li> Love this Nail file. So smooth and easy to use on your nails. Will never use anything else. Nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of this file.  I&#x27;ve owned other glass files that lasted for years.  These became dull and pretty much useless after just a few months.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this I wonder how I ever lived without it before I discovered crystal nail files. I&#x27;ve been using this one for about a month now and it&#x27;s wonderful. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I enjoy how long crystal nail files last, but as someone who tends to lose things, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on something I&#x27;m likely to lose. I chose this model because it was cheap. It did break the first time I dropped it, but if you&#x27;re careful, this nail file can last a lifetime. Lucky for me, the seller sent a second nail file as a bonus gift ^.^</li>
            <li> It comes in a convenient holder so you don&#x27;t risk breaking the file. This is my go to file now. I&#x27;m thinking of buying one to keep in my purse also.</li>
            <li> I have used one of these files for years but accidentally stepped on it and it broke in two.  I searched online for a similar file and came across this one from Sassella.  I am pleased with this product and think it is as good as my previous one.  Crystal glass files are the best and never wear out.</li>
            <li> I love this glass nail file! I bought this after finding out crystal files are more gentle on nails; My nails have been growing so fast lately and I&#x27;ve always had problems with them peeling. I think this is a great buy and very nice quality file - I even got a free mini glass file included in the order which is a great bonus! I love that I will have this forever and not have to go back to using emery boards.</li>
            <li> I got these as gifts for my female bridal party and they&#x27;re great. They&#x27;re very sturdy, so don&#x27;t worry that they&#x27;re glass. They last a long time, and yet it is gentle enough that I&#x27;ll even use it on the cuticles on the sides of my finger tips/nails. They provide a very smooth nail.</li>
            <li> I really like this glass file.  It does not shred my nails.  The file comes with a hard plastic case to keep it protected.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail. Double sided; nice plastic carrying case; actually two; one inside and one outside. Directions included and works better than the one I paid a few dollars more for at a gift shop.I&#x27;m going to order more.  Great gift.</li>
            <li> Works better than other nail products.  The colors are all great. The tub keeps the file protected, from misuse. It goes well with the other products.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> while it lasts forever it feels weird to use</li>
            <li> Love it, it works really well for my thin nails that split easily. Files nice and smooth. So impressed I bought two more for my sister and daughter. Great price for the quality. And really pretty.</li>
            <li> This file gives the impression of being very fragile and slows me down a little as I frequently rearrange my grip on it so as to be more cautious, but I like the results.  The information mailer included with the file and case says it was designed to be less fragile than it appears.  It is too soon to be certain about that.  I have very strong nails, and it does not really reduce them as fast as others have stated, but does leave the edge very smooth which is a definite plus.  It is nice not to have to be concerned about filing in one direction.  It is very pretty on top of everything else.</li>
            <li> Love this file, bought one in Czeck Republic and broke it.. This is the best file for fingernails, just rinse with water to clean, so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> the girls and i love this...if you&#x27;ve never had one or tried these, do so.  even for someone who hates to file their nails or hates the feeling of a regular file, this does the trick and stays &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; forever</li>
            <li> No issues with this item at all -which I think is as good as you can ask for when it comes to a nail file.</li>
            <li> Awesome nail file. I bought a glass nail file on vacation in San Fransisco. somehow, I seemed to have misplaced it. Bought another one in my local retail store and it wasn&#x27;t very good at all. The two I just bought from Amazon by Sassella, (one for me and one for my daughter) are really, really nice. Planning to order a few more to keep in my purse and at my desk and other areas I spend time.  Very smooth but not too fine.</li>
            <li> I do like this file more than any other.  It is better for my nails, yet it does a great job!  I lost my first one, and replaced it with another.</li>
            <li> I should say up front that this is the only &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; file I have ever used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but it&#x27;s just amazing. I have horribly brittle and flimsy finger nails, despite all sorts of vitamins, moisturizing, etc., and during the winter they break and peel like nothing else. Since I started using this (about 2 months now) I haven&#x27;t had a single broken/split nail. It&#x27;s super quick, doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive when using, leaves a clean and smooth edge, and makes shaping a breeze. My sisters/mom/girlfriends who have tried it all want it. It rinses easily under water, is pretty sturdy, and comes in a plastic sleeve in a plastic tube. I just wish there were other colors ...</li>
            <li> I bought 5 of these for Christmas gifts for my friends.  Everyone, including me, just loved it!  The glass nail file does not tear your nails, and you can even file back and forth without any damage.  The individual carrying case is perfect for my purse.  The price was very competitive with the others offered.  It&#x27;s a great compliment to any girl&#x27;s purse.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered this file to try one made of glass since a lot of people recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time, well packaged. It comes with a cover in a hard plastic case so it does not break.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, just remember it IS fragile so treat it as such ;-)</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have ordered additional ones for gifts to friends.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering a 2nd one for my purse.  these glass files really do a much better job than any emery board or file that I&#x27;ve previously tried.  I used to avoid filing my nails but now it&#x27;s so easy that I do it more often.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my daughter-in-law.  She loves it, so I&#x27;ll probably get her another one when this breaks, which I hope it doesn&#x27;t.  She would be heart broken.</li>
            <li> Much much better than the metal file my mom gave me a few years back. (Sorry Mom!) And I hate emery boards. This glass file is the way to go. It&#x27;s a very fine grain but it can still grind your nail down to nothing if you aren&#x27;t watching what you&#x27;re doing!    Rinse after each use and give it a wash with soap and a brush once in a while and I believe this thing could last forever. At least until I break it somehow, or it goes permanently \\&quot;missing\\&quot; while my nieces are over for a visit.    Over all a very nice file and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to buy these because of the price and whether or not it would not cause splintering. However my nails haven&#x27;t splintered after four months of use and the file is still like new. So I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> Love this nail file.  Very gentle on nails yet works better than other files.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced.  Ended up giving it away, and just ordered another one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I used this on my hand, toes and husband nails. we both love it. It does sharpen our nails and if I&#x27;m not care I file my nail to the point it seems like I cut it lol.. I love it and wouldn&#x27;t change my choice. Once I am ready to purchase another filer I will buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Leaves nail edges rough, heavy and too expensive.</li>
            <li> These are everything they say they are.  I would definitely buy them for friends and family.  They are very aggressive files though, not like drugstore or beauty supply products.  These things are serious files.  They take of quite a bit at a time, so just be prepared for that and you will enjoy them.  I love that because I don&#x27;t like taking the time it takes to file my nails.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail file for natural nails, period.  No snagging or peeling, in fact, your nail edges are as smooth as glass!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and with no damage, even though it is glass. I have ordered these before and gotten less than perfect quality, but this one seems to be a \\&quot;good\\&quot; one that will last without loosing it&#x27;s filing ability. I like the case because I can keep it on my side table and use it whenever I&#x27;m watching TV without fear of it getting lost or broken.</li>
            <li> I bought this file because my daughter had one and loved it, and I was tired of buying nail files all the time. It works even better than I imagined. It files without leaving any rough edges and files in only a couple passes. The case keeps it protected in my purse so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere for a replacement crystal file for my old broken one. I&#x27;ve tried OPI, Sephora, Sally Beauty, and Revlon&#x27;s products - none of them are as good as this one. This one is actually glass, and actually ground glass instead of glass with grit glued on. When you wash it, it is scratchier again. Both sides are grained - one smoother, one rougher. It&#x27;s thin enough to get under even short nails. AND it even comes in a plastic case (I know, this is not earth-shattering, but it means it won&#x27;t break in my purse like its beloved predecessor.)&lt;br /&gt;It seems like all these features should be the basic &#x27;it&#x27;s a crystal file&#x27; specs, but they&#x27;re sadly not.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST nail file I have ever used. I have bought other glass files, and they only had texture on one side, and only had a thin plastic sheath to protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little beauty has texture on both sides, regular and extra fine. It has the plastic sheath as well as a hard plastic case.  This is very important, as in my home, it&#x27;s only a matter of time until it will fall/ get knocked to the floor and shatter.  Because of this, and to save shipping, I order these 2 at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It files, shapes and smooths my nails perfectly.  I will NEVER use an emery board or metal file again. This file is fast and very gentle on your nails. If I go for a professional manicure, I bring this, as I hate for anything else to be used on me.  It&#x27;s that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there were some way to temper the glass to make them less fragile, I&#x27;d give them 10 stars</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best nail fail I&#x27;ve ever had.  Does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> I bought this almost a year ago and it has saved me money and payed for itself.  I no longer have to buy disposable emory boards because I have this permanent nail file.  I waited almost a year to write this review because I wanted to see if it would last.  It still files just as well as it did when I first got it.  I don&#x27;t see any wear and tear on the filing surface, and I expect this to last for years to come from what I have seen.  I like filing with this better than emory boards because it is quicker anyway.  I just wash it off at the end and it is as good as new.</li>
            <li> I got tired of continuously buying disposable nail files, so I bought this glass file and two other metal files.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best nail file I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it doesn&#x27;t file aggressively, it is still sufficiently abrasive to pare down nails without clipping, but I prefer to clip first and do less filing after.&lt;br /&gt;The real benefit of this file over the others is how smooth the end result is. It leaves nails with a silky, snag-free edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This file is glass, so it will reportedly break, but I keep mine in its plastic sleeve within a hard plastic case, and I have not had a problem (although I have never dropped it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problems with clogging as the file is easily wiped or rinsed to remove nail dust.</li>
            <li> it comes with a case and i like the colors. it takes a while to actually file my nails down to the size i want with this one. when i use a normal file i get down to it quicker. i guess this is better for your nails so i try to use it more than the others.</li>
            <li> Ok, I rarely write reviews but I wanted to let every girl out there know that this crystel glass nail file is THE file to have. It works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess like those inexpensive emery board nail files. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, I promise!!! Once you buy this, you will be happy you did, trust me on it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this file and within weeks (along with sturdy top and bottom coats) noticed an improvement in the strength of my nails.  My nails got so long and strong because one, I kept them polished and two, every nick I had I filed away with this glass file.  Sadly, I broke this file due to carelessness, and I bought a different brand.  Nope.  Not as good.  I noticed a big difference when attempting to file my nails.  This file is sharp!  Other glass files are not as sharp.  I will be purchasing another of this brand ASAP.  For now I am seriously using a sizable shard from what&#x27;s left of my broken file.</li>
            <li> These nail files from \\&quot;Sassella\\&quot; are the very best!  I purchased a few of them a couple of years ago, when I first learned about crystal/glass nail files. When I saw how great they were, I went on the hunt for crystal/glass nail files... bought several (no joke, probably six different vendors on this website).  I&#x27;m here to tell you, \\&quot;not all crystal/glass nail files are created equal.\\&quot; The files from Sassella are the only ones that have stood the test of time... even OPI&#x27;s version of the crystal/glass file does not hold a candle to what you will get from Sassella.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a TON of stuff thru Amazon (a lot of great stuff), but have never even been compelled to write a review. The only way this file will not work is if you drop and break it. I might add... the seller is terrific with the highest level of customer service.</li>
            <li> I play classical guitar with weak nails so I&#x27;ve been reading about care of nails written by classical guitar players-they should know about nails. They all say this file is the best way to go. They were right! This file shaves off nail so gently and quickly! And smoothly! I&#x27;m ordering a couple more so I have them available all the time.</li>
            <li> Excellent file. Long lasting</li>
            <li> Great quality crystal, not sprayed on roughness, clearly the glass itself is etched, which means it will never dull</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it all the time, good quality, like the protective case it came in to prevent it from shattering when dropped. Would def purchase again</li>
            <li> i bought this for my mother. i havent really seen her without it since. she loves it. i paired with gift with opi nail envy to help her nails become more healthy and strong. i read that the glass nail file helps with that also.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended glass nail files and finding these with the carrying case was a real bargain.  I love using it and have purchased more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, I would recommend to anyone that doesn&#x27;t have a problem with losing their nail files.  I have been using it for about sixs months now and cannot be more satisfied, is the same grit now as it was when I received it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I love this file!  Where has this been all my life?  This files very effectively but isn&#x27;t too harsh either.  I love that this doesn&#x27;t wear out, all I have to do is rinse it now and then.</li>
            <li> I am tired of the stupid files sold at Walgreens that are made of cardboard or whatever the flimsy material is. I am a classical guitarist and I need to file my nails weekly. This glass file does the job and though I have only had it for a couple of weeks, it seems to be holding its own. Ideally, I would like it to last me for months.</li>
            <li> Not being a person who messes with their nails much, I wanted an easy no fuss solution for when my nails chipped or broke.  This file is PERFECT, it is great to keep with me on the go, and works well without that rough feel of sandpaper, leaving my nails nice and smooth, without taking too much in one pass.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, nice price and the file makes my wife smile when she looks at her nails. Perfect choice for the money!</li>
            <li> I tried a different brand of crystal file, but it did not hold up.  Some brands have just surface coating.  This file seems to last; so I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> I needed the case for my nail files for were I had to store it.&lt;br /&gt;The file is great I plan on ordering more files.</li>
            <li> I overheard one of my coworkers discussing nail files, and the fact that regular emery boards most people use are terrible for your nails. She mentioned &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; files as being much better. So obviously I did a quick search on Amazon and stumbled upon this product. I don&#x27;t tend to get my nails done at salons very often, so I figured this might be a good investment for doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m shocked at how much I love this nail file. You have to be more careful with it (it is glass) but overall it&#x27;s much gentler on my nails, giving me a smoother file. I definitely won’t be going back to using regular cheap nail files.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used metal files (usually Revlon) because I hate the feel of emery boards and they tore up my nails.  My nails are thin, weak, and flaky.  I love this file.  It does a great job on filing.  You can file both directions.  My nails feel so much smoother using this one.  I just feel it is better for my nails.  You just rinse it to clean it and you can even use it on callouses after bathing while the callouses are still wet.</li>
            <li> I had one like this and it broke. I bought the cheap ones and really regretted it!!!  They did not work at all!!  This one is excellent and like the case, since dropping my first one broke it!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  It is so gentle on my fingernails, yet strong enough to file my toenails.  You can file in both directions without wrecking your nails.  I get smooth nails without needing all different types of files with varying coarseness .  I need to order another to carry with me.</li>
            <li> It works fine.It is a little different than the one I had before but that&#x27;s ok for now.</li>
            <li> Great product, My only regret is not buying it sooner, arrived on time. The nail file has a great feel, and it looks cool too :)</li>
            <li> I saw a nail file like this used by one of my youtube gurus, and thought that I might give it a shot.  It doesn&#x27;t pull at your nails like other nail files do (and let me tell you, I&#x27;ve tried them all, the metal, the cardboard, the sapphire...) and this is gentle enough to feel wonderful, but it gets the job done SO WELL!</li>
            <li> I am a nail file fan and will even admit to having purchased a $60 nail file that I thought would be my last nail file -- I&#x27;m pretty sure my cat knocked that one into a garbage can. C&#x27;est la vie. In any case, that may have been for the best, because I love this nail file so much more than that other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used (for probably a year or two) the cheaper versions of the crystal files with grit added onto glass. Unfortunately, the grit eventually wears off of those, making filing take longer and longer. This one is actually etched, so it won&#x27;t wear away. The file isn&#x27;t too coarse, but it still gets the job done quickly without boring you to tears. I&#x27;m not over the moon with the color choice, but it&#x27;s so effective, I look right past that. This file works with finesse. I&#x27;d buy it again and I&#x27;d buy it for friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus: it comes with a little protective case and carrying case, so you can choose how bulky/protected you&#x27;d like it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color me pleased.</li>
            <li> Great tool to carry in purse. Nice carry case. Works well on nail does not damage. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Almost 2 years since the purchase and still works as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to anyone looking for a great quality Nail File.</li>
            <li> I first bought a glass nail file at an art store in Provincetown.  When I went back to buy more, the store has closed.  I was very happy to find this on Amazon.  The color is gorgeous and I like that there is no name brand on it like many of the others.  It works well and has not dulled.  I bought this to bring to work, so the protective case is wonderful to have.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> It is so wonderful that my 11 year old granddaughter talked me out of it and now I&#x27;m must buy another one!</li>
            <li> I had received a crystal glass file as a gift when my mom went to the Czech Republic years ago. I had broken the file (just the end) so the file portion still worked but I lost it recently. I was devastated. I bought this based on the reviews and I am so thrilled with it. The carrying case that was provided is a durable plastic case to put the file in. While I try very hard to make sure I won&#x27;t drop or break this one, I think the case would help if someone did drop it. I also really loved that the instructions that came with the file said it can be cleaned with soap and water and a light scrub brush (like a nail brush.) I never knew I could clean my previous file. This was well worth the $$ and I am thrilled with it! Great seller!!!</li>
            <li> I love them so much I ordered several -- one for the car, my purse, the bathroom, kitchen, and my husband.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a crystal nail file after watching pinksofoxy&#x27;s nail routine on youtube. So if your in search of a genuine crystal nail file, this is it!</li>
            <li> This nail file works well, and lives up to its reputation for not wearing down. It&#x27;s a bit fragile, so don&#x27;t drop it on your granite counter-tops. Also this is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I used it for years until I lost it. I&#x27;ll be buying another one soon enough. It works fast leaving a nice edge.</li>
            <li> This is a great file.</li>
            <li> Compare to the metal nail file I used, this makes my nails very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concern is that it is made of glass, so it may break.  But well, that&#x27;s why protective case is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice!</li>
            <li> This is a excellent file, the color is pretty too. The case is nice, but it&#x27;s a little short for the plastic sheath the file comes in, bends the top.  It certainly will protect the file though.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail file I&#x27;ve ever found.  I can carry it in my purse, even on a plane because it is glass and not metal.  Works in any direction.</li>
            <li> broke edge after the first fall on the floor...&lt;br /&gt;file that should have \\&quot;last forever\\&quot; lasted just 1 week for me :(</li>
            <li> I found this on Amazon and didn&#x27;t even know something like this existed. Not only does it do a great job, it&#x27;s really beautiful to look at.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to glass nail files by a coworker. When I got this one, I was amazed! My nails feel so healthy and I no longer have that left over piece of nail on the edges like other nail files. This one is good quality and arrived quickly. I&#x27;m very happy with it and can&#x27;t wait to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> This nail file is amazing and I didn&#x27;t know it also has multiple purposes, ever since i&#x27;ve been using this the amount of times my nails peel have dropped dramatically and i can get very nice square nails. Its also very easy to wash it off and make it look like new! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a glass nail file.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the nail file does not last long although they say it will last forever..  They are great to carry in my bag but are not top quality.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t buy crystal file for years, thought was pointless expense. No, is great. My nails stopped peeling. I&#x27;m careful with it, have had my original one for three years, no chips, no breaks, no dulling. Bought another as a gift. Easy to clean, carrying case holds up well. Love this thing, have it with me all the time. So good at taking down nails that I don&#x27;t need nail clipper anymore.</li>
            <li> just received my nail file.&lt;br /&gt;nice surface to file nail in either direction.&lt;br /&gt;medium is a good size to carry in purse</li>
            <li> lasts forever, if you do not drop it hard, and can be rinsed off when looking chalky.&lt;br /&gt;I have three of them!</li>
            <li> File does a great job of keeping nails neat and smooth.  Can&#x27;t believe a little file packs such a big punch.</li>
            <li> I received this nail file I have never had a glass file before I really like this file. I feel the file is sturdy and won&#x27;t. break easily I like the case that was given with it and it fits in my purse fine I definitely would order again</li>
            <li> It is coarser than my wife&#x27;s which she got someplace else. It is also sturdier. Even so, it is too coarse for what I wanted. I have to be gentle to avoid cutting down my finger nails rather than just smoothing off sharp edges after using clippers.</li>
            <li> The glass files are awesome. They don&#x27;t tear up my nails like the sandpaper/cardboard files do. They are very pretty, too.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, it files and shapes my nails leaving clean edges.  All you have to do is rinse it off between using.</li>
            <li> I love these glass nail files.  They file my nails quickly and smoothly.  I&#x27;ll never go back to emory boards.  This one is sturdy and seems like it will hold up well and not break.  I love having a cse so I can throw it in my purse.</li>
            <li> this file is cute and comes in a little case which i never use. i do use the plastic sheath though. it files my nails nice and does not get dull.</li>
            <li> I love this nail file for my purse! I have brittle nails that peel and break easily. Having this file in my purse has saved my nails so many times. I have tried a few others, but the case and size of this one are my favorite!</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my fingernails for the guitar.  It is excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 years and it&#x27;s in perfect shape and continues to do an excellent job on my nails! Once you purchase this product, you will never go back to those horrible cardboard emery boards again! After I use it, I just rinse it and let it air dry, then put it right back into its case.</li>
            <li> I have never liked filing my nails, but this file makes the job so incredibly fast and my nails are so smooth.  Once you use it, you won&#x27;t want to use any other.</li>
            <li> I despise the feeling of filing my nails. Emory boards make me nauseated, and they just seem to shred the layers in my nails and make them weaker. This crystal file lasts forever, doesn&#x27;t have the same rough texture as an emory board (though it still is gritty), and it doesn&#x27;t seem to ruin my nails.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY satisfied with the service and product. Fed ex had a problem with the shipping and I contacted them willing to pay for a another for I have several friends that own the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sent me another one for free to assure my satisfaction, and let me tell you, I am VERY satisfied. It is a great product and all my friends were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone. It is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Replaced the one I lost. Will never go back to the sand paper ones again.</li>
            <li> Bought it a few years ago. Still like new.</li>
            <li> These files work very well and don&#x27;t wear out or dull up right away like the metal ones and emery boards do.</li>
            <li> Been reading about these, and I&#x27;m glad I finally purchases this! It&#x27;s awesome, gentle on my nails, and is supposed to last forever. Will be buying these as gifts for friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is like no other orindary file! Don&#x27;t settle for cheap emery boards or metal files because it&#x27;s not all good for your nails. As soon as I opened up the package when I got it out of the mail I was so totally surpise but how it looked. It&#x27;s actually made out of real crystals/glass. Not only that but it takes less time to file your nails in the shape that you perfare. It takes me longe longer to file my nails with a cheap old metal file and emery boards are nothing but a big pieace of crap ! because they were down so fast after a short while. All it comes with a free handy case to put it in so it won&#x27;t get damage. In the case are also direction on how it&#x27;s use and how to clean it. And best of all it keeps your nail tips smoother so your nail polish will help not chip. A MUST FOR MANICURES!</li>
            <li> I put this in my daughter&#x27;s Christmas stocking.  She loves it.  She loves the case and carries it in her purse wherever she goes.  She said the file works great!</li>
            <li> Much better than the traditional files.  Easy on the nails.  But...don&#x27;t drop it on a hard surface, it might break.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely wonderful. I bought quite a few of them and gave them as stocking stuffers for Christmas. Everyone loves them!</li>
            <li> I play fingerstyle acoustic guitar and cut nails very short to avoid catching on adjacent strings. I find this file makes it unnecessary to cut the nails, just file them - smooth, quick, efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had been using a diamond file with &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;shaping&amp;#34; grits, but this works better than either side. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I noted that another reviewer stated to be careful as this file can really take the length of your nails down. That said, it does do what I wanted and it is well worth the money. I will buy it again if I lose this one. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love this file.  I have ridges on my nails and just file them down as I do my nails.  My husbend won&#x27;t use any other file either.</li>
            <li> They break easy because they are glass. But they work good on your nails. But i carried one in my purse and when I went in my purse to grab my keys I cut my hand all over and had hundreds of slivers of glass shattered all over the inside of purse and inside my hand. They break very easy only problem with it. Other than that, they file good and dont ever run out like reg emery boards</li>
            <li> Love this. Comes with sleeve and case. Good quality of material. Price was higher than most. It is an unique item.</li>
            <li> I was dubious that these files would equal the fancy Czech files&lt;br /&gt;I purchased first. However, I am very happy to say they are just as&lt;br /&gt;good if not better. Love the smooth finish they give my brittle&lt;br /&gt;nails. The case is a bonus &amp; makes them easy to find. The price&lt;br /&gt;was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love this nail file.  It&#x27;s just what I was looking for and seems to be alot better quality than one I bought in a local store.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a crystal nail file that I dropped and broke from another source. This file was much rougher and did not do the same job.  Trying to fine another file like the first one.</li>
            <li> Likes to item so much purchased three more for friends.  Files smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave rough edges.  Great product. Thankyou</li>
            <li> This file is the &amp;#34;Cadillac&amp;#34; of nail files in my opinion. Right size and works like a nail file should. It is attractive, comes with a sturdy protective plastic case and is easy to clean. This file is not fragile but you can&#x27;t treat it like a bull in a china closet either. Use the protective case and do not expose it to unusual abuse and it will last as long as you do. I bought some extras to give away as gifts. Excellent product that I have no problem recommending.</li>
            <li> i happen to be fond of crystal glass nail files.. they&#x27;re much easier on nails than any other kind of file.  i like the case.  it makes it much easier to carry the file wit me.</li>
