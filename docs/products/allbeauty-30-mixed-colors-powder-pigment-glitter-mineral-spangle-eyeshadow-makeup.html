            <li>I don&#x27;t use any of mine, but do use them in my soap making for top glitter.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter has been waiting for this makeup to come for over a month.</li>
            <li>The makeup poured out and she doesn&#x27;y have many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>I love this set and tha glitter is amaz.</li>
            <li>I seen most of it was glitter</li>
            <li>Product came in a timely manner, however packaging could have been better.</li>
            <li>this product was everything that I wanted and more all the colors are bright and shimmery exactly what I wanted.</li>

            <li>She tried to put it on before, and it doesn&#x27;t even apply right!</li>
            <li>THE EYESHADOW OFFERS  A GREAT VARIETY OF HIGH QUALITY COLORS</li>
            <li>Thank You for making such a good product.</li>
            <li>in all, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>so if your looking for a color to try and don&#x27;t know which one to get this is worth the money</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS A GREAT FOR PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL USE.  </li>
            <li>the colors are great there are shades of blues, purples and pinks they even had black, silver, greens and yellow few more colors as well their all great</li>
            <li>This product is great to add to your collection of pigments I usually buy Mac</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the little pots they come in are so cute.</li>
            <li>it arrived on time exactly like they stated.  </li>
            <li>but I love have different brands of pigments</li>
            <li>yes they had a mistake but definitely am going to buy more from them</li>
            <li>However, some don&#x27;t show up very well.  </li>
            <li>Was very upset when I got it on the mail.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t give a review..</li>
            <li>The colors are ultra blend able, thier are a wide verity of pearl shades and some matte.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but the glitter does not stay on your face (or in my case, my eyelids) at all, definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li>After a couple usages I think it&#x27;s an okay dupe for more expensive glitters.</li>
            <li>I noticed the top won&#x27;t stay closed tight and tends to unscrew on its own, leaving the glitter container open and spilling over.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need anymore for awhile unless a new color comes out</li>
            <li>These are very nice if you don&#x27;t mind trying to keep them closed tightly, tops tend to get loose.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the individual little pots</li>
            <li>This product took maybe a month and a half to get to me... Wasn&#x27;t worth the wait!</li>
            <li>They put the makeup, very poorly, in a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li>AS far as makeup use</li>
            <li>but I hope it&#x27;s not a waste.</li>
            <li>The small containers came poorly packaged, all thrown in a bubbled envelope and most of them had their top untied and spilling out.</li>
            <li>I suppose this product container is in worse quality than the product itself as it unscrews quite often and easily.</li>

            <li> If I could separate the container from the glitter as two separate products the glitter wins and the container loses as a bad container holding an okay product.</li>
            <li> If I was this seller I would stop selling this product as it will keep giving them a bad name simply because the top of the glitter container will not stay on.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical...</li>
            <li> though i mean glitter does that it gets on everything, except there were a few double colors, all in all with the glitter mistake on the plastic and the product being really smaller than pictured</li>
            <li> The small jars where just wrapped together in a bundle of flat packing foam material and rubberbanded together.</li>
            <li> , one was missing &amp; one was almost empty, I don&#x27;t think I would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Containers seem small but not really have a ton of makeup in each.</li>
            <li> The lighter colored powder shadows need to be applied heavily to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste.</li>
            <li> The seller said it would take at least 5 to 6 weeks to get them replaced and just insisted on giving me a partial refund and keeping what product that I did receive.</li>
            <li> The loose glitter doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, of course, but even over a base.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t manage them and the lids are almost impossible to unscrew.</li>
            <li> Pots are so small</li>
            <li> I was expecting to get 30 different colors... and was sadly disappointed with the fact that there was at least 2 and even 3 of the same colors....</li>
            <li> least 2/3 of it</li>
            <li> Then there was a card sent with the package stating (in very poor English) to not leave bad comments.</li>
            <li> Sad to say when i got my package i was warned about the mess i was getting into from the company, it wasn&#x27;t to bad</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a couple of times but honestly I&#x27;m not very impressed and will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when i received my package a few of the containers were opened so it was glitter everywhere!</li>
            <li> Never getting this stuff again. :(</li>

    <ol>
            <li> BULLSHIT. I WANTED GLITTERS  &amp; got about 10 of the same colors !  #neveragain</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for!  The colors do not last.  Te glitter shades won&#x27;t even apply.  The eyeshadow burned my eyes.  Then there was a card sent with the package stating (in very poor English) to not leave bad comments.</li>
            <li> Some of the glitter shadows are very nice.  However, some don&#x27;t show up very well.  The lighter colored powder shadows need to be applied heavily to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors.  Glad I got them. Containers seem small but not really have a ton of makeup in each.</li>
            <li> Says its eyeshadow but its not its just glitter. Was very upset when I got it on the mail. I wanted eyeshadow. Never getting this stuff again. :(</li>
            <li> this product was everything that I wanted and more all the colors are bright and shimmery exactly what I wanted. it arrived on time exactly like they stated.  I will buy from them again in the future</li>
            <li> They go on nicely the colors are great there are shades of blues, purples and pinks they even had black, silver, greens and yellow few more colors as well their all great</li>
            <li> This product is great to add to your collection of pigments I usually buy Mac but hey what can I say new is good love all the colors/glitter I&#x27;m kinda glad it&#x27;s not all glitter cause I wear contacts don&#x27;t get me wrong a girl loves her glitter but I love have different brands of pigments it&#x27;s great plus I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need anymore for awhile unless a new color comes out lol</li>
            <li> Sad to say when i got my package i was warned about the mess i was getting into from the company, it wasn&#x27;t to bad though i mean glitter does that it gets on everything, except there were a few double colors, all in all with the glitter mistake on the plastic and the product being really smaller than pictured i would have to say for 30 pigment powders i am impressed the pigment in them is simply perfect for blending, yes they had a mistake but definitely am going to buy more from them and this time i hope the packager they had doesn&#x27;t get the glitter all over, these are indeed sample sizes so if your looking for a color to try and don&#x27;t know which one to get this is worth the money</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but the glitter does not stay on your face (or in my case, my eyelids) at all, definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A GREAT FOR PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL USE.  THE EYESHADOW OFFERS  A GREAT VARIETY OF HIGH QUALITY COLORS</li>
            <li> I brought the mineral powder eyeshadow not for makeup use ; but for scrapbooking..unique idea. I love the colors and the individual little pots makes it perfect for storing in my project boxes.  I felt it was a cheaper  way to get color and glitter for my scrapbook decorating. AS far as makeup use I really can&#x27;t give a review..</li>
            <li> These are very nice if you don&#x27;t mind trying to keep them closed tightly, tops tend to get loose.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I ordered it. I received it fast and loved it. I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone. It looks beautiful on your eye. Very Very pretty! Im glad I bought it! Thank You for making such a good product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on January 13, 2014, and I just received mine today, Feb. 4. The small containers came poorly packaged, all thrown in a bubbled envelope and most of them had their top untied and spilling out. One of them was totally open and spilled all over the envelope. I&#x27;ve used this product a couple of times but honestly I&#x27;m not very impressed and will not repurchase. The loose glitter doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, of course, but even over a base. When I apply with glitter \\&quot;glue\\&quot; then it will stick but some still falls off during the makeup wear. After a couple usages I think it&#x27;s an okay dupe for more expensive glitters. I noticed the top won&#x27;t stay closed tight and tends to unscrew on its own, leaving the glitter container open and spilling over. I suppose this product container is in worse quality than the product itself as it unscrews quite often and easily. If I could separate the container from the glitter as two separate products the glitter wins and the container loses as a bad container holding an okay product. If I was this seller I would stop selling this product as it will keep giving them a bad name simply because the top of the glitter container will not stay on.</li>
            <li> This product took maybe a month and a half to get to me... Wasn&#x27;t worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Some were blendable, some were too coarse to stay on skin. Pots are so small I really can&#x27;t manage them and the lids are almost impossible to unscrew. I don&#x27;t use any of mine, but do use them in my soap making for top glitter.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the 27th of Nov and I still never got the tracking number it&#x27;s already Dec 15 I emailed them &amp; I still didn&#x27;t get any information besides is on its way. I will write another review once it gets here god knows when but I hope it&#x27;s not a waste.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when i received my package a few of the containers were opened so it was glitter everywhere!</li>
            <li> I was expecting to get 30 different colors... and was sadly disappointed with the fact that there was at least 2 and even 3 of the same colors....I gave @ least 2/3 of it Away</li>
            <li> My grand daughter has been waiting for this makeup to come for over a month. It finally came and the eye shadow glitter was EVERYWHERE. They put the makeup, very poorly, in a clear plastic bag. The makeup poured out and she doesn&#x27;y have many colors to choose from. She tried to put it on before, and it doesn&#x27;t even apply right! Waste. of. money. I suggest for customers to buy something else</li>
            <li> I saw this product and thought to good to b true, but when I received my eyeshadows ahead of schedule I was over whelmed with excitement. The colors are ultra blend able, thier are a wide verity of pearl shades and some matte. I love this set and tha glitter is amaz.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my glitters and pigments!!! They are amazing!! I would love to repurchase!!!</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical... For the price pigmented eyeshadow? N I seen most of it was glitter but I took a risk on it and honestly it&#x27;s just as good as my MAC pigmented eyeshadow!! I defiantly recommended !!</li>
            <li> Product came in a timely manner, however packaging could have been better. When I opened the bag that it was sent in, there was gold glitter all over the entire inside. The small jars where just wrapped together in a bundle of flat packing foam material and rubberbanded together. Several jars where not even in the bundle. I received two of the very same colors as well. When I contacted the seller, I basically ended up having to keep the two identical colors and never got the one that was spilled before it got to me. The seller said it would take at least 5 to 6 weeks to get them replaced and just insisted on giving me a partial refund and keeping what product that I did receive. I won&#x27;t be intentionally buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the little pots they come in are so cute. My granddaughter can&#x27;t wait to make lipsticks and shadow and even blush.  She is so imaginative I bet they will be beautiful.</li>
            <li> When I got the package it was open all the containers were nearly open &amp; they had spelt all over the bag, one was missing &amp; one was almost empty, I don&#x27;t think I would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Yup very good other then the dust everywhere</li>
            <li> I received my product prior to the anticipated delivery date, a plus. Product was packaged neatly, containers opened with ease. Only used product as a demo and I love the glitter shadows! However I received several of same colors was the only downfall.</li>
