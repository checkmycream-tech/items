            <li>OPI nail lacquers are excellent.</li>
            <li>OPI polish is the best nail polish on the market and Amazon has the best prices around</li>

            <li>great top coat.</li>
            <li>OPI makes the best top coats available.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I heard that the sally hansen top coat was really good</li>
            <li>but it does leave a nice shine..</li>
            <li>FAST AND LEAVES A BEAUTIFUL SHINE TO THEM.</li>
            <li>OPI has always been one of my favorite nail polish brands and this is by far one of the  best top coats ive ever used.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying the top coat, but since I am a fan of this great product already, I know it will not let me down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>SOME TOP COATS ARE PRONE TO DOING.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for so much more in this product.</li>
            <li>I used the top coat making the layering thicker on my nails</li>
            <li>love love love it.</li>
            <li>Love this top coat.  </li>
            <li>Have had this top coat on my nails without chipping or wearing for up to 10 days.</li>
            <li>This Opi Top Coat has been just what I needed.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love OPI</li>
            <li>This is a good product that goes on smooth, leaves no bubbles, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It was shipped as an unused product, I was first unsure about using a nail polish shipped from the internet, but it has been of good quality.</li>
            <li>It was dry in 1 - 2 minutes and had a wonderful shine.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t (in my experience) have the same brilliant, glossy shine as the OPI for Sephora top-coats.</li>
            <li>A top that provides a nice, but not over-the-top, amount of shine, that dries quickly (5 min), and that is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I  feel pretty confident of my ability to put top coat on my nails.  </li>
            <li>O.P.I. products are, in my humble opinion, the best nail polish and care products out there!</li>
            <li>It dries fast, leaves a nice shine, and keeps my polish from chipping.</li>
            <li>OPI&#x27;s Top Coat is exactly what I was looking for:</li>
            <li>The only better top coat is OPI&#x27;s Rapidry Top Coat.</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat I have yet to find maintains a mani for an extended amount of time and helps dry the polish a little bit faster worth every cent love this!</li>
            <li>Also I like that the brush is big because it makes applying the top coat very easy.</li>
            <li>ALL TOP COATS SAY THEY LEAVE A GLOSSY SHINE OR FAST DRYING</li>
            <li>The Quick Dry Top coat by O.P.I. is better.</li>
            <li>First of all, the products stay on longer!</li>
            <li>This clear top coat lived up to the brand&#x27;s reputation.  </li>
            <li>I experienced OPI nail polish during my first ever manicure a few months ago and knew I had to get this product for home use.</li>
            <li>so I bought this top coat thinking it would last</li>
            <li>Sadly, it is no longer in existence, so I ordered this.</li>
            <li>This product worked really well at first, but after a couple of weeks the polish got more gooey and it didn&#x27;t dry as well</li>
            <li>TOP COAT IS EVERYTHING IT SAYS IT IS AND DOES DRY THE NAILS</li>
            <li>I have pretty high expectations for OPI, and I wasn&#x27;t happy with how slow this top coat dried.</li>
            <li>Very shiny...</li>
            <li>goes on smooth and you don&#x27;t need to put a second coat.</li>
            <li>OPI is a highly respected brand of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I have been using Clinique&#x27;s Fast Dry Top Coat for the last few years, and it drys completely within 60 seconds, regardless of how many coats of polish lie underneath.</li>
            <li>prefer OPI, and some Sally H over most other brands is because of the durability,&amp; intense pigments in whatever color you choose; from lightest to the darkest; you are guaranteed to get a solid color with 2 coats; and with the lighter shades, sometimes one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First after polishing with a solid color; then 2 thin coats of top coat; then one more coat next day.</li>
            <li>Based upon the way it dried, I had to order OPI drying drips and a fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li>I like all O.P.I. products thus far with the exception of the Matte finish.</li>
            <li>Adding an extra layer days later after fill-in and pedicure gives a fresh look to my nails.</li>
            <li>...but takes about 20-30 min to dry..compared with sally&#x27;s fast dri that dries in within 30 seconds, just not worth it to me..</li>

            <li> TOP COAT IS EVERYTHING IT SAYS IT IS AND DOES DRY THE NAILS FAST AND LEAVES A BEAUTIFUL SHINE TO THEM. ALL TOP COATS SAY THEY LEAVE A GLOSSY SHINE OR FAST DRYING BUT NOT ALL OF THEM ACTUALLY DO WAHT THEY SAY. OPI DOES AND IVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH IT. I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY IT AND IT ALSO DOES NOT YELLOW THE NAILS LIKE SOME TOP COATS ARE PRONE TO DOING.  DIANNA FROM CALIFORNIA</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat. It is so shiny and adds the best finishing touch to your manicure. Also I like that the brush is big because it makes applying the top coat very easy.</li>
            <li> I experienced OPI nail polish during my first ever manicure a few months ago and knew I had to get this product for home use. My nails shine and last for over a week. Not damaging at all to my nails or the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> OPI is a highly respected brand of nail polish.  This clear top coat lived up to the brand&#x27;s reputation.  It was dry in 1 - 2 minutes and had a wonderful shine.  I would highly recommend this nail polish.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that goes on smooth, leaves no bubbles, and dries quickly. However, it doesn&#x27;t (in my experience) have the same brilliant, glossy shine as the OPI for Sephora top-coats.</li>
            <li> O.P.I. products are, in my humble opinion, the best nail polish and care products out there! I have tried more expensive ones, I have tried cheaper ones, but O.P.I. has won my vote. Why? First of all, the products stay on longer! If you use the base coat, the color, AND the topcoat together it will stay on your toes for months! And they have TONS of colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have yet to find maintains a mani for an extended amount of time and helps dry the polish a little bit faster worth every cent love this!</li>
            <li> OPI&#x27;s Top Coat is exactly what I was looking for: A top that provides a nice, but not over-the-top, amount of shine, that dries quickly (5 min), and that is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I  feel pretty confident of my ability to put top coat on my nails.  But for whatever reason this polish bubbles up on my nails.  I was looking for so much more in this product.</li>
            <li> OPI nail lacquers are excellent. This is my first time trying the top coat, but since I am a fan of this great product already, I know it will not let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer OPI, and some Sally H over most other brands is because of the durability,&amp; intense pigments in whatever color you choose; from lightest to the darkest; you are guaranteed to get a solid color with 2 coats; and with the lighter shades, sometimes one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tired of having to touch up chips on your nails every other day, try OPI&lt;br /&gt;top coat.

            <li> I used the top coat making the layering thicker on my nails and it the color came off within 2 days (i was extra careful by using gloves when necessary, etc, etc)....    Not sure if its use is really necessary....will try again...</li>
            <li> OPI polish is the best nail polish on the market and Amazon has the best prices around and I always look there before shopping anywhere else.</li>
            <li> OPI has always been one of my favorite nail polish brands and this is by far one of the  best top coats ive ever used. I usually only paint my toenails, and with a top and base coat it usually lasts 1 1/2 weeks. With OPI, is lasts about 2 1/2 weeks. Very shiny...love love love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and my hands are constantly in water so I bought this top coat thinking it would last but it doesn&#x27;t. If I paint my nails at night the next day they are already starting to chip. I heard that the sally hansen top coat was really good so I might just try that.</li>
            <li> ...but takes about 20-30 min to dry..compared with sally&#x27;s fast dri that dries in within 30 seconds, just not worth it to me..but it does leave a nice shine..</li>
            <li> I like all O.P.I. products thus far with the exception of the Matte finish. The Quick Dry Top coat by O.P.I. is better.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW OF AN OPI PRODUCT THAT I DON&#x27;T LIKE THEY ARE ALL AWESOME BUY THEM THEY DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL DO TOPCOAT IS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I have pretty high expectations for OPI, and I wasn&#x27;t happy with how slow this top coat dried. It isn&#x27;t as glossy as I&#x27;d like, either. I have been using Clinique&#x27;s Fast Dry Top Coat for the last few years, and it drys completely within 60 seconds, regardless of how many coats of polish lie underneath. Sadly, it is no longer in existence, so I ordered this. Based upon the way it dried, I had to order OPI drying drips and a fast dry top coat. I&#x27;ll probably just stick with the OPI fast-dry.</li>
            <li> OPI makes the best top coats available. I have been giving myself manicures for over 20 years, and this one of the best I have ever used. It dries fast, leaves a nice shine, and keeps my polish from chipping. The only better top coat is OPI&#x27;s Rapidry Top Coat.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat.  Keeps polish protected and keeps it from wearing off.  Have had this top coat on my nails without chipping or wearing for up to 10 days.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well at first, but after a couple of weeks the polish got more gooey and it didn&#x27;t dry as well</li>
            <li> Perfect top coat. Adding an extra layer days later after fill-in and pedicure gives a fresh look to my nails.</li>
            <li> 5 stars great product.  Need this when doing our&lt;br /&gt;nails.  We, just lvoe it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would tell you to go buy</li>
            <li> Love it! This Opi Top Coat has been just what I needed. It was shipped as an unused product, I was first unsure about using a nail polish shipped from the internet, but it has been of good quality.</li>
            <li> love it. great top coat. goes on smooth and you don&#x27;t need to put a second coat. I love OPI</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give my nails a brought shine whats so ever it&#x27;s horrible! I gave two stars because item was on time</li>
