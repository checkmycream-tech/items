            <li> Good product! Have used before!</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp, damaged hair and after one treatment my scalp feels soooo good!  I bring it along every couple of weeks to the salon and in between that with the oxygenating treatment (drops). You can feel the difference for certain. Will save up for the deep conditioning masque they also feature here. Buy the line -- will not disappoint</li>
            <li> I bought the entire set and it works great on your hair.  Be sure to use the oil non oil with the vitamin leave in treatment.</li>
            <li> it works pretty good... I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> PRODUCT: Excellent product, it detangles my hair after shampooing and conditioning. It leaves a very pineapple-like smell (divine) with a lasting fresh smell. It softens the hair and I use it after fresh washing once a week, and every other day to strengthen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING: It came in regular brown box, taped up around the nozzle of the bottle as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHIPPING: The product arrived early, 1 day before the anticipated delivery period. Wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: I will go through this seller again, it is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this leave in spray. I use it daily on my hair and my children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> My family and I love the UNA products.</li>
            <li> This product was waaaaay... to watery for me not enough oils in it. The product did not make your hair feel soft at all.</li>
            <li> QUITE HONESTLY SPEAKING; THIS IS ONE OF THE TOP 5 BEST LEAVE-IN TREATMENTS ON THE MARKET. ITS PRICEY, YET, WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY. I WILL STOCK UP ON THIS ITEM. IF YOU FLAT IRON OR BLOW DRY OFTEN, YOU WILL BE NEEDING UNA VITAMIN LEAVE-IN TREATMENT. THAT IS, IF YOU WANT YOUR HAIR TO BE SILKY , SOFT, MOISTURIZED AND SOFT TO THE TOUCH AFTER YOU FLAT IRON.</li>
            <li> Really nice leave in. Smells good and make s hair less dry</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really make a difference for my hair...</li>
            <li> after using this product for the past 6 months I can honestly say that it works as far as helping with detangling my hair. I spray this item on after washing my hair and then blow dry it and it helps with the manageability of my hair. I am African American and have medium textured hair. To say that it helps with preventing hair breakage I cant say because I generally rarely have any hair breakage.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this is great to keep my styles moisturized and protected. It&#x27;s not runny or heavy, geat for any hair type.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for hair growth I have ever seen or heard of.  I bought this product for my aunt who has always had problems growing her hair.  Now, it&#x27;s unbelievable, she has hair growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the products, I couldnt believe the results either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much purchase.</li>
            <li> This one was a gift for my friend!  But I use the shampoo and it&#x27;s really good for your thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;This treatment must be great too! Anything UNA works!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any difference using this product!!  Nothing special. I spray on my wet and dry hair and isn&#x27;t a difference at all</li>
            <li> Eh. Nothing special honestly. Hair actually felt dry afterwards.</li>
