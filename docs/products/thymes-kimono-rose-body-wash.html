            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to put on in the evening after a bath or for going out.  </li>
            <li>When my favorite drug store stopped carrying this exceptional Thyme&#x27;s product, I found if on Amazon.</li>

            <li>I love the Thymes company.</li>

            <li>I have received SO many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift once and fell in love with the fragrance.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not over powering and has a nice clean, fresh smell that I absolutely love!  </li>
            <li>Thymes makes great gels with scents that are classy and not at all cloying or &#x27;perfumy&#x27;.</li>
            <li>the lotion and body wash best- with that combo you rarely need the perfume as it has a lasting scent.</li>

            <li>This is a product that lightly scents the body on days when you might not want to wear any perfume or cologne.</li>
            <li>Both the lotion and the shower gel are great and have gotten numerous complements on the scent.  </li>
            <li>Very natural and sweet, refreshing scents.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Please do not discontinue this scent, like so many other wonderful lines that have disappeared after a few years.</li>
            <li>This is nice however the fragrance is a little too light</li>
            <li>it does not smell like a typcial rose scen as its other fragrance hues come through making for an exotic feminine smell that isn&#x27;t too floral, too girlie, or too mature.</li>
            <li>was looking forward to a lovely Rose fragrance.......still using it up but find very little fragrance!</li>
            <li>The soap has a great delicate scent.</li>
            <li>exactly what was wanted.</li>

            <li>This is highly recommended and another winner from Thymes.</li>
            <li>nice for every day, &amp; adds subtle sexiness to evenings.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way with this body wash, so you definitely do not have to use a lot to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>soft &amp; feminine.</li>
            <li>This is nice since the body wash is on the expensive side, so atleast its going to last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Thymes has the most true to life scents and their body wash is luxurious. You need only a small amount to cover your entire body. This particular scent is sensual- it does not smell like a typcial rose scen as its other fragrance hues come through making for an exotic feminine smell that isn&#x27;t too floral, too girlie, or too mature. I enjoy the lotion and body wash best- with that combo you rarely need the perfume as it has a lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I love the Thymes company. They produce wonderfully fragrant, high quality soaps and room sprays for the home. This Kimono Rose body wash is in an attractive bottle. The soap has a great delicate scent. Not overpowering, but pleasant to use. It is not inexpensive, but for a high-end liquid soap, you won&#x27;t find one any better.</li>
            <li> the scent is wonderful. soft &amp; feminine. nice for every day, &amp; adds subtle sexiness to evenings.</li>

            <li> concerning that the bottle had been altered - however the product seems to be what I was looking for and I really like the product.</li>
            <li> When my favorite drug store stopped carrying this exceptional Thyme&#x27;s product, I found if on Amazon. This is a product that lightly scents the body on days when you might not want to wear any perfume or cologne.</li>
            <li> Again, a wonderful scent and so nice to use.  The scent is milder on my skin and last all day, without drying it out.  And my bathroom smells &amp;#34;ooo-lalala&amp;#34; for several hours afterwards</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents in body wash and lotion.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrant wash.</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to a lovely Rose fragrance.......still using it up but find very little fragrance!

            <li> This is such a beautiful fragrance.  IT&#x27;s a little expensive to wear every day but it&#x27;s nice to put on in the evening after a bath or for going out.  I layer it with the lotion.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchases...</li>
