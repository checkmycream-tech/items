            <li>My husband got some of this lotion with a travel kit that he purchased and wanted to get some more.  </li>
            <li>This lotion great and a real bargain.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>So glad I found a place on Amazon to purchase this lotion.</li>
            <li>I just love this product, my sister had stayed in a hotel and this was a sample</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>Best Lotion on the market to help aid in dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells so clean!</li>
            <li>especially feels good around nails, mantains health where cracking is at highest risk, and feels like it is effective for more hours than competitors like Neutrogena.    </li>
            <li>Also it is shower friendly.  </li>
            <li>Light scent, absorbs quickly without being greasy, amazing on super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought so much if it, since a nice amount ended up left on the packaging.</li>
            <li>Which was great because one of them exploded, guessing because large bottles all had loose tops.</li>
            <li>Been using it on my son since he was an infant helps calm his eczema and ashy skin.</li>
            <li>I Love the different sizes for home and on the go!</li>
            <li>The first day it healed up the dryness and the cracks around my cuticles.</li>
            <li>If you take hot showers after soaping up and then put lotion on wait about 3-5 minutes and just rinse off</li>
            <li>They use is in nail salons as well, that&#x27;s where I first saw it</li>
            <li>it will soak into your pores and you will notice much smoother skin.</li>
            <li>Been wearing this lotion for a while now and everyone wants to know what I use on my skin.</li>
            <li>The small tubes are extremely handy to keep in handbags, backpacks, and pockets for on-the-go moisturizing.</li>
            <li>One of the bottles were slightly opened, but other than that... happy with order.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and have trouble finding it in stores.  </li>
            <li>Am surely not alone in being very sensitive to perfumes, and this one, no matter how mild, goes right to my lungs and triggers asthma.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, this scent truly follows you around, it is strong enough to get others&#x27; attention, most likely for the worse.    </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, the moving around made some of the tops unscrew, so not only were all the bottles COVERED in lotion, but there was a nice little puddle left inside the envelope.</li>
            <li>The only skin moisturizer I know of that really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>and I have a whole lot left.</li>
            <li>I like the light scent when putting on this lotion, but then it fades away and is not strong.</li>
            <li>These items are placed in a plastic envelope, but not tightly.</li>
            <li>The only lotion I&#x27;ve been able to use in the past 20 years that keeps my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>fast smoothing my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe</li>

            <li> The only skin moisturizer I know of that really moisturizes. Doesn&#x27;t matter how expensive, I&#x27;ve never found a product that works better. Been using this for 10 years.</li>
            <li> Love hoe it moisturizer your skin</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! Light scent, absorbs quickly without being greasy, amazing on super sensitive skin. Been using it on my son since he was an infant helps calm his eczema and ashy skin. Packaging was done in heavy plastic bag - packed separately. Which was great because one of them exploded, guessing because large bottles all had loose tops.</li>
            <li> The only lotion I&#x27;ve been able to use in the past 20 years that keeps my skin moisturized.  Helps with dry skin and ecsema.  Speedy delivery.  One of the bottles were slightly opened, but other than that... happy with order.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and have trouble finding it in stores.  For the price and value in which Amazon is selling this lotion.  It can&#x27;t be beat.  I have now made this my family and household lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells so clean! Great price and value. I Love the different sizes for home and on the go!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have always adored Triple Lanolin with Aloe Vera. I have been using it for over 30 years. People always compliment me on my complexion and say things like; &amp;#34;You have great skin&amp;#34;. I used to buy it in several different stores but in the 90&#x27;s It dropped off the shelves, never to be seen again. The only place I can find it, is online. It is a great, All Over body lotion that is non-greasy. It doesn&#x27;t have any scent so, won&#x27;t clash with perfumes. It is difficult to find lotions containing lanolin, today.  Lanolin is great for people who have skin conditions.</li>
            <li> My husband got some of this lotion with a travel kit that he purchased and wanted to get some more.  This lotion great and a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast smoothing my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera helping me every time I feel my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> Have tried everything for winter hands, with my current favorites Outdoors Hands and Miracle Hand Repair being too expensive and still adding some fragrance.  I am also sold on the miraculous power of aloe for healing.  This Triple Lanolin is it... works great, goes on quickly without a greasy feeling, especially feels good around nails, mantains health where cracking is at highest risk, and feels like it is effective for more hours than competitors like Neutrogena.    But... oh the tragedy, they have added scent to this lotion.  Am surely not alone in being very sensitive to perfumes, and this one, no matter how mild, goes right to my lungs and triggers asthma.  Moreover, this scent truly follows you around, it is strong enough to get others&#x27; attention, most likely for the worse.    Please please Triple Lanolin, consider an unscented version... folks like me do not care if it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, if it works and does not cause allergy, it will be a winner.  Am going to give Udder Balm Unscented a try...</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It is unbelievably hydrating. I discovered it at my nail salon, as it always left my hands baby-soft. So imagine my joy when I saw this packaged deal! Nine bottles for less than 30 bucks? Sign me up!&lt;br /&gt;Well... I&#x27;m glad I bought so much if it, since a nice amount ended up left on the packaging. These items are placed in a plastic envelope, but not tightly. As far as I can tell, the moving around made some of the tops unscrew, so not only were all the bottles COVERED in lotion, but there was a nice little puddle left inside the envelope. (Please see the pictures I have included.)&lt;br /&gt;It is still a great deal and I have a whole lot left. Still, keep the packaging in mind when you make your purchase.</li>
            <li> Found this lotion on vacation out west. My hands were dried and cracked. A convenience store carried the small tube. This lotion is the best I have ever used. The first day it healed up the dryness and the cracks around my cuticles. I have used this everyday since. It is the best in maintaining a good healthy feeling for my hands. So glad I found a place on Amazon to purchase this lotion. I like the light scent when putting on this lotion, but then it fades away and is not strong.</li>
            <li> Best Lotion on the market to help aid in dry skin.  Also it is shower friendly.  If you take hot showers after soaping up and then put lotion on wait about 3-5 minutes and just rinse off it will soak into your pores and you will notice much smoother skin.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this lotion for a while now and everyone wants to know what I use on my skin. Great product and I just had to buy this bundle for restocking my closet.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion and fabulous deal.</li>
            <li> Excellent supplier. Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> I just love this product, my sister had stayed in a hotel and this was a sample and I used it I was hooked I went online searching and searching and I found it, his is ll I use and it smells wonderful.. ONly by from Amazon, I order from another Company Maya? something I can not remember but I never got my order and I have not gotten my money back.. This one is GREATTTTTT...</li>
            <li> Best hand cream on the market, with a fabulous fragrance.</li>
            <li> When I went to cosmetology school we learned that the only thing that  sinks into your skin is lanolin. That&#x27;s why this lotion works so well. They use is in nail salons as well, that&#x27;s where I first saw it and it does wonders on hands and also feet after a pedicure.</li>
