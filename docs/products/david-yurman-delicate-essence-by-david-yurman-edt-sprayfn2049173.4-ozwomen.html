            <li>There was no statement in the description of this product on the Amazon site or on the seller&#x27;s own site stating that this would come as a \\&quot;Not for Sale\\&quot; \\&quot;Tester\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Exceed my expectations great fragrance excellent packaging the purchase was well worth the price I would repurchase many times in the future</li>

            <li>I ,get so many compliments</li>
            <li>I love most of David Yurman scents.</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell.  </li>
            <li>but I think the first one that came out is more my scent.</li>
            <li>Sweet and flowery.</li>
            <li>It puts you in mind of fresh sweet scented roses.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, my wife is a very kind down to earth person and won&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful fragrance and just like the name, has a delicate fragrance that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I really think its nice but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not a fake...</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, brand new in sealed box; exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>it smells fresh but different from other perfumes, it is elegant and unique.</li>
            <li>But, really?</li>
            <li>The item was shipped promptly and received timely, which was good since I thought it might come a day late.  </li>
            <li>Brand new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very complimentary with my Pink Dove soap which I swear by!</li>
            <li>Very soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>very soft and feminine.</li>
            <li>However, it came in a box clearly labeled \\&quot;Demonstration</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found it in stores recently, but the price is MUCH lower on Amazon...</li>
            <li>Not only because of their poor judgement, but because of their dishonesty in not advising on either Amazon&#x27;s or their own web site that they were selling me a Tester.</li>
            <li>For me as the buyer, I loved the fact that I bought this for $15 less than at the local department store, the only place I could buy it in my small city.</li>
            <li>If I had purchased this for someone else, I would be sending it back as it would be clearly embarrasing to give this as a gift.  </li>

            <li> Stays on all day. Very soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> it smells fresh but different from other perfumes, it is elegant and unique. i will try the other colours next time.</li>
            <li> My favorite DY fragrance.  Quick delivery, brand new in sealed box; exactly what I wanted.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a beautiful, clean scent. very soft and feminine. Sadly it does not last on me more than an hour. whenever I wear this, I do have to reapply often throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne but I think the first one that came out is more my scent. I have gotten a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I ,get so many compliments</li>
            <li> No good smells like an rotten egg</li>
            <li> very good price.  Nice clean smell.  Brand new.</li>
            <li> This one is one of my favorites!!!! It puts you in mind of fresh sweet scented roses. It&#x27;s very complimentary with my Pink Dove soap which I swear by! I can&#x27;t stop sniffing myself when I wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Exceed my expectations great fragrance excellent packaging the purchase was well worth the price I would repurchase many times in the future</li>
            <li> Our daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing fragrance. Sweet and flowery.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife for a stocking stuffer.  The item was shipped promptly and received timely, which was good since I thought it might come a day late.  I like the bouquet/scent.  However, it came in a box clearly labeled \\&quot;Demonstration Tester\\&quot;  \\&quot;Not for Sale\\&quot; and the bottle has a sticker on it that says the same thing.  Luckily for me, my wife is a very kind down to earth person and won&#x27;t really care. But, really? Sending out a product that was purchased as a gift that comes as a \\&quot;Demonstration Tester\\&quot;.  If I had purchased this for someone else, I would be sending it back as it would be clearly embarrasing to give this as a gift.  There was no statement in the description of this product on the Amazon site or on the seller&#x27;s own site stating that this would come as a \\&quot;Not for Sale\\&quot; \\&quot;Tester\\&quot;. Very poor business etiquette and very poor judgement.  I will never purchase from this seller again.  Not only because of their poor judgement, but because of their dishonesty in not advising on either Amazon&#x27;s or their own web site that they were selling me a Tester.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter-in-law as a gift. She loves the scent so on quality, she is the one giving it 5 stars. For me as the buyer, I loved the fact that I bought this for $15 less than at the local department store, the only place I could buy it in my small city. It was a win-win for us both.</li>
            <li> floral and feminine. Light and great for daytime. I love most of David Yurman scents.</li>
            <li> It was perfect . Nothing wrong with it .</li>
            <li> Perfume is not easy for me to find, because most of it makes me feel nauseated. This is a beautiful fragrance and just like the name, has a delicate fragrance that lasts all day. I am often asked what perfume I am wearing when I am out and about. I haven&#x27;t found it in stores recently, but the price is MUCH lower on Amazon...and it&#x27;s not a fake...its wrapped just as if it was purchased at a store.</li>
            <li> Not what I wanted it was bought by mistake. I really think its nice but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!</li>
