            <li>Win win!</li>
            <li>that I wore everywhere else worked great--</li>
            <li>I tend to break out with many moisturizers, not using this product!!  </li>
            <li>I have relatively fair skin however so it may not be as noticeable, but I do blend well.</li>
            <li>this is good</li>
            <li>I have fair, fine-pored, oily, acne-prone skin, and this product works well for me.  </li>
            <li>They all loved it.</li>
            <li>I have found this product to be exceptional.  </li>
            <li>and I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have had great luck with most Neutrogena products that contain sunscreen.</li>
            <li>(my neck looked very interesting).</li>
            <li>Amazing cream.</li>
            <li>For years I have been using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock and it has worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I am not allergic and mostly I don&#x27;t have any skin reaction</li>
            <li>I just love it. :)</li>
            <li>and I am still pleased with the product and would purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>As with all reviews, what works best for one does not work for another, the key is in knowing what ingredients your skin may or may not like, and going from there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to use many sunscreens under my makeup.</li>
            <li>I also have very fair skin, so anyone who has a darker skin tone will likely notice more of the whitish cast of the product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It works.it protects my skin from aging which can help prevent cancer.its easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It also needs a powder coat to not look greasy, but my skin always needs that, so that&#x27;s fine by me.  </li>
            <li>All in all I have to say that I enjoy this product</li>
            <li>The anti-aging protection is more than worth it.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena filled the bill and it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d guess I have a week more of fun and games before this product is done with me.  </li>
            <li>It is great for drier skin, but for my oily skin, in the humid South, I can only use it in winter.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say about this product is that the scent is very mild to non-existent (good for people with sensitive noses).</li>
            <li>My immediate reaction was that it was incredibly greasy feeling and stung a little.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the year, I use the Neutrogena Pure and Free Liquid Sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so this appealed to me on many levels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to dairy (found in many products) and chemically sensitive, so I was stoked to find this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, but it evidently much prefers the previous Neutrogena product, which was non-greasy and perfect to use underneath makeup.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time today.    </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I couldn&#x27;t find Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Defense daily moisturizer with an spf of 45, &amp; thought this product had replaced it.</li>
            <li>Neautrogena has started using &amp;#34;helioflex&amp;#34; in many of their products and it has the above chemicals.  </li>
            <li>This product is thicker and more substantial than Neutrogena&#x27;s Daily, and you do have to wait for it to soak in.  </li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s further evidence that SPF claims are a bunch of rubbish--I will be paying a lot more attention to the ingredient labels from now on when I buy sunscreen, and I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li>Shared the daily moisturizer with many of my family members.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good sunscreen and saves $, as I don&#x27;t have to use my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen that feels moisturizing and foundation applies easily.</li>
            <li>This does not irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The new bulbous tube they have replaced it with is obviously more conspicious and the snap-cap ends up filled with lotion after using it a few times.  </li>
            <li>Second is that it applied smoothly.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Much of my work occurs outside or in a greenhouse (which is even sunnier than outside, in some ways), and this offers great protection for about 4 hours, depending upon sweatiness, and then ok protection for another few.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s SPF 30, gentle, and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>What attracted me to using Neutrogena for Sensitive Skin is because I already use the Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with PureScreen in SPF 50.</li>
            <li>After looking for a \\&quot;healthier\\&quot; moisturizer with sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t going to break the pocketbook, I chose the Neutrogena Healthy Defense SPF 50 (previously, I used Neutrogena&#x27;s &#x27;Visibly Even&#x27; moisturizer with SPF 30).    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this prod  uctokay</li>
            <li>It feels very light, not sticky at all, and only takes a minute to fully dry before I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li>It is not as heavy and gunky as most of the zinc-based sunscreens, so i don&#x27;t break out wearing it.   </li>
            <li>I honesty don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s legal for a product with less active ingredient to claim to be more powerful.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation, which often happens to me when I try a new product.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this sunscreen is that there is no odor, compared to the Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch.</li>
            <li>I have used many Neutrogena products in the past and never considered myself to have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The label says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, which appealed to me because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a normal person with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; working environment, this probably offers decent protection against burn (though not necessarily UV damage) throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it and after 5 days my skin is almost clear.</li>
            <li>And I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>With physical sunblocks this is not as much of an issue.  </li>
            <li>The newer product, \\&quot;for sensitive skin,\\&quot; with an spf of 50, contains: titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide.    </li>
            <li>After 3 days without usage, my face is back to normal.  </li>
            <li>(has anyone else noticed that Amazon has become MUCH less reliable at getting the right product.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals and something I could reliably use on a daily basis.    </li>
            <li>I unfortunately developed an allergy to several of the chemicals in sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I developed red splotchy spots on my cheekbones which I am hoping will go away after applying hydrocortisone.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice Neutrogena had changed the this product until I BROKE OUT IN A RASH after the second day of using this  Neutrogena Sunscreen with \\&quot;pureSCREEN\\&quot; for Sensitive Skin.  </li>
            <li>I am not happy with the results of Healthy Defense daily moisturizer spf 50 purescreen for sensitive skin and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>It did not give the dreaded \\&quot;White Face\\&quot;, seemed to work under my makeup, was not overly greasy, and left my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>This is just as good as the department store moisturizers and much less expensive.  </li>

            <li> This is just as good as the department store moisturizers and much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> It spreads easily and does not raise any flakiness or settle, except in the eyelid creases, as long as I apply it thinly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it overly heavy for my dry skin, and it soaks in in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide do leave a white cast, but I found it not noticeable if applied properly and given time to dry.  </li>
            <li> My first complaint is the packaging.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena still makes lots of sunscreens with the chemical sunblock too, which needs to be stable to have long lasting sunscreening ability.  </li>
            <li> I have medium toned Asian skin, on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using for a long time.</li>
            <li> My only qualm with it was the slight odor it left, and I would use a body mist to cover it and all was well.    </li>
            <li> My ears, however, where I usually put the last little bit of sunscreen on as I am finishing up, took much longer to heal.  </li>
            <li> and I wonder if it&#x27;s due to the fact that it contains physical sunblocks instead of chemical ones.     </li>
            <li> Previously Neutrogena daily moisturizers were packaged in a slim, almost flat, tube with a twist cap.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry out my face.</li>
            <li> I compared the active ingredients listed on the two different bottles.</li>
            <li> When I got home I examined the labels: The two sunscreens have the same active ingredients, but this supposedly SPF 50 product is only 8% titanium dioxide/zinc oxide, while the other, SPF 30 product was 12% titanium dioxide/zinc oxide!</li>
            <li> It does feel slightly heavier than the Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch, but my skin feels smoother.     </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use it everyday because of the white cast it leaves.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the whiteish tinge other people commented on.</li>
            <li> and I had to apply then VERY carefully around my eyes, because if I even perspired slightly</li>
            <li> The previous ones I used all contained the active ingredient avobenzone (or Helioplex)</li>
            <li> They usually are dry feeling and</li>
            <li> of the last 5 products i&#x27;ve ordered, 3 of them have simply been the completely wrong product....)</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands in the past and have had rashes in the spots where I applied sunscreen, and my face even puffed up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe it was the zinc oxide, but it was heavy, greasy, and did NOT absorb into my skin, leaving me with a white-blue tinge.  </li>
            <li> Heavy sun exposure in my life and</li>
            <li> This product goes on easily, it is not sticky or messy.  </li>
            <li> Like the previous reviewer, I was unable to find the Neutrogena daily moisturizer I had been using for years and thought this one would be an acceptable alternative.  </li>
            <li> For the past three days, it has felt like my face is on fire.  </li>
            <li> But it was a mess!!!</li>
            <li> They remained itchy and broken out for a couple days longer than my face/neck.  </li>
            <li> There is something seriously wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> This product does not have avobenzone  and oxybenzone which I am allergic to unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> When people give a \\&quot;one star\\&quot; review to cosmetics and skin products, always read why - almost every product will have a bad story about how it made them \\&quot;break out in a rash\\&quot; or \\&quot;caused bad acne\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I wore this supposedly SPF 50 lotion on my face during a mountain hike and got a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.   </li>
            <li> Horrific.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For years I have been using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock and it has worked wonderfully. My only qualm with it was the slight odor it left, and I would use a body mist to cover it and all was well.    What attracted me to using Neutrogena for Sensitive Skin is because I already use the Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with PureScreen in SPF 50. I was drawn to the PureScreen part and waited for an all-over sunscreen by Neutrogena that was the same. No harsh chemicals and something I could reliably use on a daily basis.    I have sensitive skin so this appealed to me on many levels. I have tried other brands in the past and have had rashes in the spots where I applied sunscreen, and my face even puffed up. Horrific.    The first thing I noticed about this sunscreen is that there is no odor, compared to the Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch. Second is that it applied smoothly. I didn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;white cast\\&quot; as others have stated. I have relatively fair skin however so it may not be as noticeable, but I do blend well. It does feel slightly heavier than the Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch, but my skin feels smoother.     All in all I have to say that I enjoy this product and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately developed an allergy to several of the chemicals in sunscreens. The \\&quot;PureScreen\\&quot; version of the Neutrogena products has saved my skin! It is not as heavy and gunky as most of the zinc-based sunscreens, so i don&#x27;t break out wearing it.   If you can tolerate all the chemicals in the \\&quot;Helioplex\\&quot; version (and don&#x27;t mind putting all those chemicals on your skin, then you probably will prefer Helioplex to PureScreen (since it&#x27;s even lighter still).  But if you&#x27;re looking for zinc-based sunscreen, this one can actually be used as a daily product.  HOWEVER - DO NOT TRUST THESE SELLERS.  I have now ordered the product from both Bella SkinCare AND Heavenly Beauty (both fulfilled by Amazon) - and received the Helioplex version, not the PureScreen version.  Very disappointing.   (has anyone else noticed that Amazon has become MUCH less reliable at getting the right product. of the last 5 products i&#x27;ve ordered, 3 of them have simply been the completely wrong product....)</li>
            <li> I am not allergic and mostly I don&#x27;t have any skin reaction but I got rash and allergic reaction after using this product. I stopped using it and after 5 days my skin is almost clear. But it was a mess!!!</li>
            <li> After looking for a \\&quot;healthier\\&quot; moisturizer with sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t going to break the pocketbook, I chose the Neutrogena Healthy Defense SPF 50 (previously, I used Neutrogena&#x27;s &#x27;Visibly Even&#x27; moisturizer with SPF 30).    I tried it for the first time today.    It was like smearing on clown make-up.      I don&#x27;t know if maybe it was the zinc oxide, but it was heavy, greasy, and did NOT absorb into my skin, leaving me with a white-blue tinge.  I washed it off and went back to the &#x27;Visibly Even&#x27; moisturizer.  The only good thing I can say about this product is that the scent is very mild to non-existent (good for people with sensitive noses).</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be exceptional.  I don&#x27;t find it overly heavy for my dry skin, and it soaks in in a reasonable amount of time.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any lingering white cast at all.  I will continue using for a long time.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream. I just love it. :)</li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction to sunscreen in the 35 years I&#x27;ve been on this planet.  I used this for four days while on vacation and stopped using it two days ago.  My immediate reaction was that it was incredibly greasy feeling and stung a little.  For the past three days, it has felt like my face is on fire.  I developed red splotchy spots on my cheekbones which I am hoping will go away after applying hydrocortisone.  I have used many Neutrogena products in the past and never considered myself to have sensitive skin.  There is something seriously wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer made my skin feel hydrated all day. It didn&#x27;t gum up under my creme to powder foundation. It didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation, which often happens to me when I try a new product. I will definitely use it again when I know I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun. I won&#x27;t use it everyday because of the white cast it leaves. I don&#x27;t want to look washed out when I&#x27;m not wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> Tried this sunscreen out today and I was very pleased.  It did not give the dreaded \\&quot;White Face\\&quot;, seemed to work under my makeup, was not overly greasy, and left my skin feeling soft.  I like the non-chemical sunblock.  I have medium toned Asian skin, on the dry side.  Edit:  I have used this now for a while and I am still pleased with the product and would purchase it again.  When people give a \\&quot;one star\\&quot; review to cosmetics and skin products, always read why - almost every product will have a bad story about how it made them \\&quot;break out in a rash\\&quot; or \\&quot;caused bad acne\\&quot;.  Individuals have different reactions to products, so unless a substantial number have stated that it makes them break out, I try the product anyway.  And I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry out my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my sensitive skin.  I cannot use chemical sunscreens on my face, those WILL sting.  I can use physical sunblocks, which this product has.  Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide do leave a white cast, but I found it not noticeable if applied properly and given time to dry.  I also have very fair skin, so anyone who has a darker skin tone will likely notice more of the whitish cast of the product.  It does need time to \\&quot;dry\\&quot;, but I have no problems waiting the couple of minutes that takes.  Neutrogena still makes lots of sunscreens with the chemical sunblock too, which needs to be stable to have long lasting sunscreening ability.  With physical sunblocks this is not as much of an issue.  As with all reviews, what works best for one does not work for another, the key is in knowing what ingredients your skin may or may not like, and going from there.</li>
            <li> I have had great luck with most Neutrogena products that contain sunscreen. The previous ones I used all contained the active ingredient avobenzone (or Helioplex) and I had to apply then VERY carefully around my eyes, because if I even perspired slightly some of the product would go into my eyes and sting. I don&#x27;t have this problem with this product and I wonder if it&#x27;s due to the fact that it contains physical sunblocks instead of chemical ones.     I haven&#x27;t noticed the whiteish tinge other people commented on. I have light-medium skin that gets oily, and I find that this product helps control the shine on my face. It feels very light, not sticky at all, and only takes a minute to fully dry before I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> It works.it protects my skin from aging which can help prevent cancer.its easy to apply.I highly recommend this prod  uctokay</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Heavy sun exposure in my life and this is good</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I couldn&#x27;t find Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Defense daily moisturizer with an spf of 45, &amp; thought this product had replaced it. The label says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, which appealed to me because my skin is very sensitive. After trying it for about a week, I can say it:    1. Causes my skin to sting, which the spf 45 never did  2. Causes my skin to break out, which the spf 45 never did.  3. It feels greasy, which the spf 45 product never did.    I compared the active ingredients listed on the two different bottles. The SPF 45 contains:  avobenzene, homosalate, octisalate, octocrylene, and oxybenzone.     The newer product, \\&quot;for sensitive skin,\\&quot; with an spf of 50, contains: titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide.    Different contents, different results. I am not happy with the results of Healthy Defense daily moisturizer spf 50 purescreen for sensitive skin and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product does not have avobenzone  and oxybenzone which I am allergic to unfortunately.  Neautrogena has started using &amp;#34;helioflex&amp;#34; in many of their products and it has the above chemicals.  This product goes on easily, it is not sticky or messy.  It does the job.  The product does not have a perfumy smell.  This is just as good as the department store moisturizers and much less expensive.  My dermatologist recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like the previous reviewer, I was unable to find the Neutrogena daily moisturizer I had been using for years and thought this one would be an acceptable alternative.  My first complaint is the packaging. Previously Neutrogena daily moisturizers were packaged in a slim, almost flat, tube with a twist cap. The slim design was un-noticable in a suit or pants pocket. The new bulbous tube they have replaced it with is obviously more conspicious and the snap-cap ends up filled with lotion after using it a few times.  The product itself burns for several minutes after application and throughout the day leaves skin feeling like there is a chalkie residue on it.  I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have fair, fine-pored, oily, acne-prone skin, and this product works well for me.  Much of my work occurs outside or in a greenhouse (which is even sunnier than outside, in some ways), and this offers great protection for about 4 hours, depending upon sweatiness, and then ok protection for another few.  If you&#x27;re a normal person with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; working environment, this probably offers decent protection against burn (though not necessarily UV damage) throughout the day.  I have yet to actually be sunburned on my face while wearing this lotion.  I switched from the Daily Moisturizer to this, and noticed no co-occurring break-outs.  This product is thicker and more substantial than Neutrogena&#x27;s Daily, and you do have to wait for it to soak in.  It also needs a powder coat to not look greasy, but my skin always needs that, so that&#x27;s fine by me.  The anti-aging protection is more than worth it.</li>
            <li> I wore this supposedly SPF 50 lotion on my face during a mountain hike and got a bad sunburn. The SPF 30 sunscreen (by Goddess Garden) that I wore everywhere else worked great--I had no burns anywhere I put that, and burns everywhere I put this product (my neck looked very interesting). When I got home I examined the labels: The two sunscreens have the same active ingredients, but this supposedly SPF 50 product is only 8% titanium dioxide/zinc oxide, while the other, SPF 30 product was 12% titanium dioxide/zinc oxide! I guess that&#x27;s further evidence that SPF claims are a bunch of rubbish--I will be paying a lot more attention to the ingredient labels from now on when I buy sunscreen, and I will not buy this product again. I honesty don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s legal for a product with less active ingredient to claim to be more powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to dairy (found in many products) and chemically sensitive, so I was stoked to find this product.  It works so well and no breakouts!  Thank you, Neutrogena!!!</li>
            <li> After three precancerous spots, I needed to use a stronger sun protectant.  Neutrogena filled the bill and it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that smell</li>
            <li> Use it daily, I am on the beach as a photographer, ride my horse 4 times a week and play tennis..no burn. I tend to break out with many moisturizers, not using this product!!  I am on my 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use many sunscreens under my makeup. They usually are dry feeling and foundation doesn&#x27;t apply well. This is the only sunscreen that feels moisturizing and foundation applies easily. It&#x27;s also a good sunscreen and saves $, as I don&#x27;t have to use my usual moisturizer. Win win!</li>
            <li> Shared the daily moisturizer with many of my family members. They all loved it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice Neutrogena had changed the this product until I BROKE OUT IN A RASH after the second day of using this  Neutrogena Sunscreen with \\&quot;pureSCREEN\\&quot; for Sensitive Skin.  My skin is sensitive, but it evidently much prefers the previous Neutrogena product, which was non-greasy and perfect to use underneath makeup.  This product, which changed formulations from \\&quot;Helioplex\\&quot; to \\&quot;pureSCREEN is horrendous.  Not only have I itched continuously for 2 days, but my face is beginning to break out in the T-zone areas.  I&#x27;d guess I have a week more of fun and games before this product is done with me.  I, however, am definitely done with it.  Back to Mary Kay- it&#x27;s SPF 30, gentle, and non-greasy.  EDIT:  After 3 days without usage, my face is back to normal.  My ears, however, where I usually put the last little bit of sunscreen on as I am finishing up, took much longer to heal.  They remained itchy and broken out for a couple days longer than my face/neck.  WILL NOT touch this stuff again.</li>
            <li> This does not irritate my super sensitive skin. It spreads easily and does not raise any flakiness or settle, except in the eyelid creases, as long as I apply it thinly. It is great for drier skin, but for my oily skin, in the humid South, I can only use it in winter. The rest of the year, I use the Neutrogena Pure and Free Liquid Sunscreen.</li>
