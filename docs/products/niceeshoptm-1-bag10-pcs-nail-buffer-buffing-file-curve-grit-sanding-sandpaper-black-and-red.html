            <li>Product was more than satisfactory.</li>
            <li>sure i&#x27;m a guy who uses a nail file.</li>
            <li>it sure beats having jagged edges when i need to scratch.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not kidding when they list it as &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34;, these are better used by a carpenter.</li>
            <li>more than I need.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have been better quality</li>
            <li>you use to many times one you do your clients nails</li>
            <li>Pleased with packaging too ..</li>
            <li>but I think that the crystal glass files would be a lot better purchase than these.</li>
            <li>but I decided to order one more time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she will get a lot of use out of them like I have.</li>
            <li>Love these..</li>
            <li>LOVE these.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, great products.</li>
            <li>Some reviews said they were flimsy, not at all better</li>
            <li>love them and keeping them in my browser</li>
            <li>so when i run out these are the ones im getting again :)</li>
            <li>Looks better in person.</li>
            <li>okay, manageable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This nailfile works thru more than 4 manicures.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Arrived early and works great</li>
            <li>then most ones you get this cheap</li>
            <li>My nails are brittle and break easily.  </li>
            <li>Files are necessary to keep your nails nice and even,these files are good quality</li>
            <li>its just great and the are pretty large as well.</li>
            <li>The emery boards are fine but not curved as described.</li>
            <li>and I am so pleased with these files they are truly professional grade very satisfied</li>
            <li>The coarse side is perfect for my needs and the fine side is great for the more delicate jobs.</li>
            <li>The size was accurate and the product is great&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>They are amazing, they file your nails very well.</li>
            <li>I love playing with my nails and enjoy making them pretty.</li>
            <li>Nice, to work with, not so heavy nice and easy.</li>
            <li>They worth the price they are cheaply made opi</li>
            <li>Since they were so cheap i wasn&#x27;t expecting much since they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>The shipping is super quick.</li>
            <li>I only bought this many because I keep losing them and normally they wear out really fast, but these are great quality.</li>
            <li>The rough side is nice and gritty while the softer side is great for smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li>Took awhile but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Coming from China there is a bit of a wait so order early if you need more.  </li>
            <li>So I figured in Amazon I can buy my own for the same price.</li>
            <li>shipping takes a while, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how useful my review will be</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and are durable</li>
            <li>and this makes a difference when you have the right tools.  </li>
            <li>My nails had never been long before, so I bought these, because I figured if they were cheap, I&#x27;d have more than one.</li>
            <li>this is a very heavy grit more suitable for calluses than your nails.</li>
            <li>definitely will be ordering more soon ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯</li>
            <li>WILL PURCHASE MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first out of the 10 and it has been months.</li>
            <li>This is the first curved files I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>Exactly as stated in the write up ..</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered these was probably close to a year ago now</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>and you use them for long time good price for money black and long good filing tools.</li>
            <li>I ordered these on march 15 and recived them April 6, pretty fast concidering where they come from.</li>
            <li>so i decided to buy a large pack of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, they are a little more sandy than the regular ones, but</li>
            <li>cant say to much about these file buffers.</li>
            <li>they are very course  and the curve  </li>
            <li>really help get that rounded edge on the side of your nails and to me</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>The curve makes filing much easier</li>
            <li>I really like these nail files.</li>
            <li>and they really do feel like sand paper</li>
            <li>I really like the curved shape</li>
            <li>Finally received the item, nice coarse grain files</li>
            <li>One side is fine, the other is more coarse so they are great for shaping real and fake nails.</li>
            <li>OK, so Im not real sure of the quality of nail files</li>
            <li>The product is decent but it took almost 2 weeks to receive them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are high quality.</li>
            <li>it looks like they will last a long time I will buy again for sure</li>
            <li>great for mens big tough toe nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional nail tech and these are durable!</li>
            <li>well they get the job gone a little cheap</li>
            <li>the gritty side removes calluses and rough edges and the smooth side smoothes and softens.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>But as far as getting the product and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>They were ok but they were completely hard (not soft as the picture looks) plus they were straight and not curved.</li>
            <li>Most likely to be used for a small sanding project.</li>
            <li>I used to have trouble finding filers strong enough to whip threw filing my acrylics</li>
            <li>These are good nail files, but they only come in one file grain type - hard and rough.  </li>
            <li>and I would have given a 5 star rating, except if you bend the even slightly they break and are useless, but with careful use they are a good deal and work just fine.</li>
            <li>Super harsh.</li>
            <li>They are quality nail files and they also last much longer than any other nail files that I have ever used in my life.</li>

            <li> you use to many times one you do your clients nails</li>
            <li> Pleased with packaging too ..</li>
            <li> but I think that the crystal glass files would be a lot better purchase than these.</li>
            <li> but I decided to order one more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she will get a lot of use out of them like I have.</li>
            <li> Love these..</li>
            <li> LOVE these.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, great products.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said they were flimsy, not at all better</li>
            <li> love them and keeping them in my browser</li>
            <li> so when i run out these are the ones im getting again :)</li>
            <li> Looks better in person.</li>
            <li> okay, manageable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This nailfile works thru more than 4 manicures.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Arrived early and works great</li>
            <li> then most ones you get this cheap</li>
            <li> My nails are brittle and break easily.  </li>
            <li> Files are necessary to keep your nails nice and even,these files are good quality</li>
            <li> its just great and the are pretty large as well.</li>
            <li> The emery boards are fine but not curved as described.</li>
            <li> and I am so pleased with these files they are truly professional grade very satisfied</li>
            <li> The coarse side is perfect for my needs and the fine side is great for the more delicate jobs.</li>
            <li> The size was accurate and the product is great&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> They are amazing, they file your nails very well.</li>
            <li> I love playing with my nails and enjoy making them pretty.</li>
            <li> Nice, to work with, not so heavy nice and easy.</li>
            <li> They worth the price they are cheaply made opi</li>
            <li> Since they were so cheap i wasn&#x27;t expecting much since they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> The shipping is super quick.</li>
            <li> I only bought this many because I keep losing them and normally they wear out really fast, but these are great quality.</li>
            <li> The rough side is nice and gritty while the softer side is great for smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> Took awhile but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Coming from China there is a bit of a wait so order early if you need more.  </li>
            <li> So I figured in Amazon I can buy my own for the same price.</li>
            <li> shipping takes a while, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how useful my review will be</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and are durable</li>
            <li> and this makes a difference when you have the right tools.  </li>
            <li> My nails had never been long before, so I bought these, because I figured if they were cheap, I&#x27;d have more than one.</li>
            <li> this is a very heavy grit more suitable for calluses than your nails.</li>
            <li> definitely will be ordering more soon ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯</li>
            <li> WILL PURCHASE MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first out of the 10 and it has been months.</li>
            <li> This is the first curved files I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated in the write up ..</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered these was probably close to a year ago now</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> and you use them for long time good price for money black and long good filing tools.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on march 15 and recived them April 6, pretty fast concidering where they come from.</li>
            <li> so i decided to buy a large pack of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, they are a little more sandy than the regular ones, but</li>
            <li> cant say to much about these file buffers.</li>
            <li> they are very course  and the curve  </li>
            <li> really help get that rounded edge on the side of your nails and to me</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> The curve makes filing much easier</li>
            <li> I really like these nail files.</li>
            <li> and they really do feel like sand paper</li>
            <li> I really like the curved shape</li>
            <li> Finally received the item, nice coarse grain files</li>
            <li> One side is fine, the other is more coarse so they are great for shaping real and fake nails.</li>
            <li> OK, so Im not real sure of the quality of nail files</li>
            <li> The product is decent but it took almost 2 weeks to receive them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are high quality.</li>
            <li> it looks like they will last a long time I will buy again for sure</li>
            <li> great for mens big tough toe nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional nail tech and these are durable!</li>
            <li> well they get the job gone a little cheap</li>
            <li> the gritty side removes calluses and rough edges and the smooth side smoothes and softens.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> But as far as getting the product and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> They were ok but they were completely hard (not soft as the picture looks) plus they were straight and not curved.</li>
            <li> Most likely to be used for a small sanding project.</li>
            <li> I used to have trouble finding filers strong enough to whip threw filing my acrylics</li>
            <li> These are good nail files, but they only come in one file grain type - hard and rough.  </li>
            <li> and I would have given a 5 star rating, except if you bend the even slightly they break and are useless, but with careful use they are a good deal and work just fine.</li>
            <li> Super harsh.</li>
            <li> They are quality nail files and they also last much longer than any other nail files that I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> The are not cheap or deficient in any way, and they work nicely.</li>
            <li> These files were really long and also thick, so I know they will last a long time, and will file off any nail wraps quickly.</li>
            <li> However, they don&#x27;t last long, 2-3 uses each</li>
            <li> long lasting  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like 180 to me, file doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, they were regular fled not curved as advertised ;(</li>
            <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t take so long to get them...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna have these for a long long time!</li>
            <li> and i did not have to wait for very long.</li>
            <li> I have 60 grit sandpaper which is LESS coarse.  </li>
            <li> Too coarse and too little differentiation between the 2 sides.</li>
            <li> These are files are a little too rough on my nails - they feel like a coarse grain sand paper.</li>
            <li> Rough and durable</li>
            <li> they are really flimsy and thin</li>
            <li> Seems like you can only use them for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I received these way before expected delivery date</li>
            <li> and they are just what I needed and expected.  </li>
            <li> These are really rough files, though.  </li>
            <li> I always like to have one around the house and in my handbag, I have long nails and once in awhile one might get a little snag here and there in between manicures.</li>
            <li> They have lots of other stuff i bought too.</li>
            <li> SO OTHER</li>
            <li> I think this will resonate with other customers.</li>
            <li> BUT NOT WORTH</li>
            <li> I priced them at the store and spend less for all of these than just one would cost at Walmart.</li>
            <li> my concern is the black dust powder getting in my gel or acrilic.  </li>
            <li> Too harsh to actually use on the nails, not a good product.</li>
            <li> Just had to wait a little while for them</li>
            <li> This seller refuses to replace any of the missing pieces.</li>
            <li> I have recommended them to quite a few people.</li>
            <li> Heavy grit, worked for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Way to harsh, The end result left my nails really thin and jagged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy them again, but I don&#x27;t regret trying them out.</li>
            <li> I have bought a dozen files in the past and they do not work.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THE 10 Pcs Nail File Buffing Buffer Curve Grit Sanding Sandpaper Black FOR THIS COMPANY AND WAS NOT HAPPY WIT</li>
            <li> They will even sharpen knives, or at least de-burr them.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting there to be thick foam to be in between both sides of the file.</li>
            <li> real heavy</li>
            <li> I am super disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about the files after reading some of the reviews</li>
            <li> And the item we got after a complaint had been made, was broken.</li>
            <li> I also know that there are worse files out there</li>
            <li> Not good at all!</li>
            <li> THE WRONG THING</li>
            <li> When I started taking biotin for my stubborn hair, my nails grew like crazy.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE THEY SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT TO ME!</li>
            <li> but I found these bad boys</li>
            <li> And the price wasn&#x27;t bad either!</li>
            <li> I rate it very badly.</li>
            <li> One of the worst files I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love love love this product its great all times and theres so many that you will never run out! its just great and the are pretty large as well.</li>
            <li> They are a great price and are very sturdy. However, they don&#x27;t last long, 2-3 uses each and they&#x27;re junk. I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy them again, but I don&#x27;t regret trying them out.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome pack and great value</li>
            <li> Love them, the package came. No bent or damaged files. Will order again.</li>
            <li> cant say to much about these file buffers. they are very course  and the curve  really help get that rounded edge on the side of your nails and to me it looks like they will last a long time I will buy again for sure</li>
            <li> great for mens big tough toe nails</li>
            <li> My school TRIED to buy 33 items from this seller and we only got 22 of the items. And the item we got after a complaint had been made, was broken. This seller refuses to replace any of the missing pieces. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Great. Rough and durable</li>
            <li> These just arrived! Took awhile but worth the wait. They arrived in great condition just like the photo. The price was great.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I was very pleased because I did not have to wait anytime. I could not ask for a better price, they are practically giving them away. These buffers are very very good. I have recommended them to quite a few people. I am very pleased! Thank You.</li>
            <li> I love these files..  very nice..  second time I&#x27;ve ordered these from Amazon..  definitely will be ordering more soon ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯</li>
            <li> The emery boards are fine but not curved as described. Hence the 3 stars not 5</li>
            <li> Ok product they are not all Tht great bc they are really flimsy and thin the bend this would work for bigginers</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, they were regular fled not curved as advertised ;(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you should use these for human nails.  Maybe these should be used for animals or furniture. I used one on my nails and it made them jagged and actually ripped my nails.  I am super disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Too harsh to actually use on the nails, not a good product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know this product came from China but, still arrived okay and they work great!</li>
            <li> Working great and way cheaper than Sally&#x27;s. I&#x27;ll be buying them again.</li>
            <li> salon quality files for a great price. Good buy</li>
            <li> Way to harsh, The end result left my nails really thin and jagged. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase these. Most likely to be used for a small sanding project.</li>
            <li> I used to have trouble finding filers strong enough to whip threw filing my acrylics but I found these bad boys and they&#x27;re amazing absoulty perfect!</li>
            <li> When I started taking biotin for my stubborn hair, my nails grew like crazy. My nails had never been long before, so I bought these, because I figured if they were cheap, I&#x27;d have more than one. Pleasantly surprised. Whipped my nails into shape!</li>
            <li> The curve makes filing much easier</li>
            <li> These files were really long and also thick, so I know they will last a long time, and will file off any nail wraps quickly. The grit is also just what I wanted. I&#x27;m very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> Great price, good quality.  Coming from China there is a bit of a wait so order early if you need more.  The boomerang shape of the nail file works well.</li>
            <li> FROM THE WAY IT PERFORMS, DURABILITY, PRICE, SHIPMENT, I RATE IT ALL A GOOD 5. IT FILES SO GOOD WILL PURCHASE MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like 180 to me, file doesn&#x27;t last very long. Seems like you can only use them for a few minutes and then you need another.</li>
            <li> Love the shape and they&#x27;re perfect for Acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Omg  I&#x27;m so glad I found a good sturdy 180 grit file these are soooo damn good a must for manicurist  long lasting  and it does the work for you stock up on them I did</li>
            <li> wonderful professional salon quality product. and i did not have to wait for very long. love it love it love it</li>
            <li> Good Quality as described, will defiantly buy from again. If you do your nails a lot I would recommend getting them, I will be set for months and I do my own acrylics!</li>
            <li> Love the curved shape...work perfectly</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been wanting ti try it and to get it for this price was amazing. The size was accurate and the product is great&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Chrystal</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting there to be thick foam to be in between both sides of the file. It works great.</li>
            <li> I really like these nail files. I always like to have one around the house and in my handbag, I have long nails and once in awhile one might get a little snag here and there in between manicures. I always buy them at my local store but they ran out, I was going to buy one from my manicurist and she wanted $2.00 for just ONE. So I figured in Amazon I can buy my own for the same price. Just had to wait a little while for them but it was worth it!!!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good Product. Better Price ! We can all use these for one thing or another. They will even sharpen knives, or at least de-burr them.</li>
            <li> real heavy and you use them for long time good price for money black and long good filing tools. buy</li>
            <li> I always seem to lose my nail files so i decided to buy a large pack of them. Since they were so cheap i wasn&#x27;t expecting much since they were so cheap. They are amazing, they file your nails very well. They are high quality. I will defiantly buy again</li>
            <li> Awesome, especially for the price. I will buy again. I&#x27;m a cosmetologist so I use a lot of files.</li>
            <li> alot came in the package it work well they get the job gone a little cheap but they work will buy again</li>
            <li> great quality and super cheap price. shipping takes a while, but worth the wait. They have lots of other stuff i bought too.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so so, not sturdy enough.</li>
            <li> JAN,10,2014&lt;br /&gt;I BOUGHT THE 10 Pcs Nail File Buffing Buffer Curve Grit Sanding Sandpaper Black FOR THIS COMPANY AND WAS NOT HAPPY WIT IT BECAUSE THEY SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT TO ME! I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THIS PRODUCT ON MY CLIENTS BECAUSE THE CURVE IS PERFECT FOR FILING! SO OTHER THEN BEING SSENT THE WRONG THING I THINK THEY WORK GREAT AND WOULD BUY IT AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I bought this item bc I love playing with my nails and enjoy making them pretty. Files are necessary to keep your nails nice and even,these files are good quality</li>
            <li> Love these. Price is great!</li>
            <li> The product is decent but it took almost 2 weeks to receive them.</li>
            <li> The nail files get the job done! I would order these again.</li>
            <li> Good products, and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I do my nails weekly and this makes a difference when you have the right tools.  I love this file</li>
            <li> As my title says. They were ok but they were completely hard (not soft as the picture looks) plus they were straight and not curved.</li>
            <li> Nice, to work with, not so heavy nice and easy. Plenty space for us to use on nails of any material.</li>
            <li> Great value, these Nail Files work perfectly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first out of the 10 and it has been months. I love their curved shape and they don&#x27;t fall apart. Sturdy!</li>
            <li> this is a very heavy grit more suitable for calluses than your nails.</li>
            <li> I only bought this many because I keep losing them and normally they wear out really fast, but these are great quality. I think this pack will last me well over a year.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, but item was not a curved emery board. It came from Honk Kong, so I couldn&#x27;t justify sending them back.</li>
            <li> Product was more than satisfactory. Arrived on time. No complaints</li>
            <li> These are sooooooooooooo awesome . Yay</li>
            <li> They came apart when start filing nails. Not good at all!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, 100/180 grit and doesnt leave a residue on the nail.</li>
            <li> Great deal on these. they&#x27;re a bit coarse, but they do the job. sure i&#x27;m a guy who uses a nail file. it sure beats having jagged edges when i need to scratch.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not kidding when they list it as &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34;, these are better used by a carpenter. Super harsh. I would use nail clippers before I used these files.</li>
            <li> Great nail files....fast shipping</li>
            <li> I received these way before expected delivery date and I am so pleased with these files they are truly professional grade very satisfied</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what that picture is. But the nail files are very strong</li>
            <li> Really coarse grit... more than I need.</li>
            <li> These are great nail files, BUT it took almost 6 weeks to receive!</li>
            <li> I do my nails alot and they are just what I needed and expected.  And the price wasn&#x27;t bad either!</li>
            <li> This is the first curved files I&#x27;ve used and I really liked that about them.  These are really rough files, though.  I would not classify them as &amp;#34;buffers&amp;#34;.  Will work well for removing gel nail polish, which is what I purchased them for.</li>
            <li> It does what a file is supposed to.</li>
            <li> They worth the price they are cheaply made opi I thought it would have been better quality but no the be bending it you use to many times one you do your clients nails lol let them have it as a bonus for coming lol.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> Fab .. Exactly as stated in the write up .. Pleased with packaging too ..</li>
            <li> I like the package of 10. I put them all over.. in the bathroom, bedroom, at my desk, etc. The coarse side is perfect for my needs and the fine side is great for the more delicate jobs.</li>
            <li> OK, so Im not real sure of the quality of nail files so I don&#x27;t know how useful my review will be but I think that the crystal glass files would be a lot better purchase than these. I also know that there are worse files out there though so there&#x27;s my review, lol</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and are durable</li>
            <li> Nice and course works good</li>
            <li> The product never showed up. So, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to rate it fairly. But as far as getting the product and in a timely manner. I rate it very badly.</li>
            <li> These fell apart almost immediately. One of the worst files I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I like the curve.  It makes it easier to do the nail.  When they have been used up I will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> These area  great deal. I priced them at the store and spend less for all of these than just one would cost at Walmart.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th time ordering these, on the 2nd time I ordered some I only received 1 file but I decided to order one more time. I absolutely love these they are great with acrylics.</li>
            <li> Arrived early and works great</li>
            <li> These nail files worked great. Great design and very easy to use. Just like the professionals would use in a salon.</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase. They are great for working on acrylics and the price is unbeatable. I am very happy with using these nail files.</li>
            <li> These cannot be for human hands!!!  I have 60 grit sandpaper which is LESS coarse.  These are so coarse they tear up your nails. AND they are the same grit on both sides, while being advertised as being different.</li>
            <li> Work great and durable. Good price. These files work well with my acrylic nail tips. Definitely recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> you can only use the file one time before it crack so you use a lot</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering these. I have an at home gel polish collection and I just use them for my personal nail use. The first time I ordered these was probably close to a year ago now and I&#x27;ve only used like 3 of them. One side is fine, the other is more coarse so they are great for shaping real and fake nails. I recently just purchased them again for my friends birthday gift basket of gel polish stuff. I&#x27;m sure she will get a lot of use out of them like I have. If I ever run out I will deff be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Love these.. I&#x27;m a professional nail tech and these are durable!</li>
            <li> They are a great quality for the price you purchase it for!</li>
            <li> great price and product, also came in 2 weeks  :)</li>
            <li> LOVE these. They were REALLY well, the price was excellent and they are very useful. The rough side is nice and gritty while the softer side is great for smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Heavy grit, worked for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> My sister and I do our nails every Friday night at home and have been using these. Absolutely great and a great price!</li>
            <li> fast shipping, great products. Some reviews said they were flimsy, not at all better then most ones you get this cheap and they do the job! love them and keeping them in my browser so when i run out these are the ones im getting again :)</li>
            <li> Great! Very sturdy and strong. Love their angle perfect to get the perfect shape.</li>
            <li> Brick and Mortars chage anywhere between 2.50 nad 5.00 for two padded emery boards.  The are not cheap or deficient in any way, and they work nicely.</li>
            <li> Great price! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> They are really good quality nail files! I&#x27;m gonna have these for a long long time!</li>
            <li> They arrived on time. Looks better in person. They are quality nail files and they also last much longer than any other nail files that I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> As described. Great Quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> they were ok but not that great of quality</li>
            <li> THese are just great. They are handy, easy to use, and cheap! I loved how quickly they came in the mail as well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, they are a little more sandy than the regular ones, but okay, manageable.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about it is, they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I will be a repeat customer for these nail files. You may think the its the bargain price. Which I have to say was a selling point. But I wanted a nailfile that works.  I have bought a dozen files in the past and they do not work. I think this will resonate with other customers. Even if its a bargain price the item still now and always needs to work as described. This nailfile works thru more than 4 manicures. The shipping is super quick. I will buy these again and again.</li>
            <li> There okay, they file good i like how they curve and they really do feel like sand paper, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> These are good nail files, but they only come in one file grain type - hard and rough.  My nails are brittle and break easily.  These are files are a little too rough on my nails - they feel like a coarse grain sand paper.</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about the files after reading some of the reviews but once I had them in hand and used them I was a believer.They get the job done..the gritty side removes calluses and rough edges and the smooth side smoothes and softens. Wish it didn&#x27;t take so long to get them...don&#x27;t wait until they&#x27;re gone before you re-order</li>
            <li> Too coarse and too little differentiation between the 2 sides. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> good and does a good job</li>
            <li> Awesome.  This s*** is a good product for a great price!</li>
            <li> I really like the curved shape and I would have given a 5 star rating, except if you bend the even slightly they break and are useless, but with careful use they are a good deal and work just fine.</li>
            <li> NEVER RECEIVED MY I ITEMS!!! GREAT PRICE BUT NOT WORTH THE WAIT OF NEVER RECEIVING UR ITEMS!!!</li>
            <li> I like the curve of this file, great for toe nails this is what I needed.</li>
            <li> was expecting a fine/course board but got course/courser.  okay otherwise</li>
            <li> Finally received the item, nice coarse grain files</li>
            <li> I ordered these on march 15 and recived them April 6, pretty fast concidering where they come from. I wish they were white ones cus my concern is the black dust powder getting in my gel or acrilic.  But 180 files are great to have no matter n for the price.</li>
