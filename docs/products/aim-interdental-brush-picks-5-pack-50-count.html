    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These interdental brushes are the best thing to happen since floss.  </li>
            <li>These are a wonderful idea for cleansing between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for when flossing doesn&#x27;t quite work.</li>
            <li>A very good value</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>Two of the picks have a cover that makes them great for on the go or business lunches</li>
            <li>A great cleaning routine to add to dental care.</li>
            <li>great price...</li>
            <li>Great for travel and every day.</li>
            <li>good for the money, the dentist says my gums have greatly inproved since using,</li>
            <li>Great Value, Very Pleased</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but I like to have a cover for each of my picks</li>
            <li>but the wire is fairly flimsy</li>
            <li>I love these brush picks!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stuck with the pricier Oral Bs which I can clean and get a couple of good uses out off.l</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that some came covered.</li>
            <li>I noticed that they work much better on my teeth than floss.  </li>
            <li>Great QUALITY, fast shipping, just as described A+++</li>
            <li>Sometimes floss just doesn&#x27;t do the trick and these are much more discrete.</li>
            <li>and if you aren&#x27;t one of those folk with perfectly close teeth who can barely get floss between them, then these are super for getting between your teeth nice and clean.</li>
            <li>and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so affordable and the handles don&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy at all (which was what I was worried about).  </li>
            <li>but they won&#x27;t fit between my teeth.</li>
            <li>These are supposed to be the super fine brushes that fit braces...</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are easy to clean with just a rinse under the tap, and if you are a germ-a-phobe, a quick dip in peroxide will do the trick as well.</li>
            <li>so I can keep them in pockets (they stay clean that way).  </li>
            <li>They are too flimsy and don&#x27;t clean well between the teeth</li>
            <li>These clean as well</li>
            <li>DenTek&#x27;s Easy Brush Cleaners cost a little more, but they&#x27;re infinitely superior, and can be used for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>Most of the brush picks lose their rigidity after one use, but these are good for a few cleanings.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m lucky to make one around my  mouth with one brush.  </li>
            <li>They do a much more thorough job of removing plaque and debris from between teeth, especially at the important gum line, than dental floss.</li>
            <li>i rarely give one start reviews.</li>
            <li>Reusable and well worth getting.</li>
            <li>This large package of fifty was a terrific price, and it is nice to have a generous supply.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended that I use interdental brushes to clean between my new implant and crown work.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what my kid in braces needed.</li>
            <li>, dip the end of the brush tip in hydrogen peroxide first.  </li>
            <li>So, of course, I went straight to amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>These are helping my gums get back to healthy.</li>
            <li>These work great for cleaning small electronics!</li>
            <li>To reach between teeth, I need a sturdy brush and not those ones that bend so easily and become useless.---Yes, these brush picks are not cheap, but they do the job and that is important.....</li>
            <li>And you can use the brush to gently scrape on the gum tooth surface</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t even make it through my whole mouth.</li>
            <li>Using these _has_ helped, but they aren&#x27;t so very sturdy.</li>
            <li>and I would purchase it for the simple reason that those brush picks are the sturdiest ones available.</li>
            <li>The Tepe brand is more expensive and better.  </li>
            <li>These push out food debris after meals, as well as gently cleans the bio-film plaque off the PROXIMAL surfaces of the teeth, while stimulating the soft tissues.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid flosser, but apparently that wasn&#x27;t keeping my gums from developing issues.</li>
            <li>/&gt;spend a few cents more and buy dentrex</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s soft enough and yet effective for removing food, plaque and anything else you can get stuck in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than toothpicks, because they do not taper wider, the entire wire can go into the tiny spaces between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m buying these at the drug store for a lot more money and in a small count package, I&#x27;m probably not going to use them as often as I should.  </li>
            <li>I can only assume they work well for teeth, too ;-)</li>
            <li>You really aren&#x27;t supposed to reuse these, but I clean them and use them for a few days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These really will make a big difference in your dental hygiene if you use them after each meal.</li>
            <li>they only fit through about half me teeth with larger gaps, the metal wire bends too easily, and the tip feels rather sharp to be jabbing around my gums.</li>
            <li>The first package of little brushes I purchased from a chain drug store.</li>

            <li> , if you have food compacted tween your teeth, you cannot even get the floss in to scrape it out, with the brush, you just push the brush in one side and the food debris is dislodge out the other side.</li>
            <li> my other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more bits of steak or brocolli.  </li>
            <li> pricey and package count was small.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give these a try in place off my usual Oral B brushes.  </li>
            <li> This new dental work was very expensive, so I plan to comply.</li>
            <li> was late in arrival ...</li>
            <li> Brushes are too thick</li>
            <li> fortunately i only paid a dollar for a ten pack but very disappointed with these.</li>

            <li> Exactly what my kid in braces needed.</li>

With floss, some debris can be missed,  but these brushes are small enough to go where floss goes and the tiny bristles brush out between the teeth and you can feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Floss, if you have tightly spaced teeth, as I do, you have to carefully navigate the floss or risk the thread snapping against your gums,with the Inter-dental brush, I simply slide it into the space tween my teeth and gums , less pain and damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With floss, if you have food compacted tween your teeth, you cannot even get the floss in to scrape it out, with the brush, you just push the brush in one side and the food debris is dislodge out the other side. No more bits of steak or brocolli.  And you can use the brush to gently scrape on the gum tooth surface, it&#x27;s soft enough and yet effective for removing food, plaque and anything else you can get stuck in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than toothpicks, because they do not taper wider, the entire wire can go into the tiny spaces between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to clean with just a rinse under the tap, and if you are a germ-a-phobe, a quick dip in peroxide will do the trick as well. Two of the picks have a cover that makes them great for on the go or business lunches</li>
            <li> Forget these flimsy interdental brushes, which always make me feel like I&#x27;m going to impale my tender gums on their all-too-pliable wires. DenTek&#x27;s Easy Brush Cleaners cost a little more, but they&#x27;re infinitely superior, and can be used for a couple of days. These don&#x27;t even make it through my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> These are a wonderful idea for cleansing between the teeth.  These push out food debris after meals, as well as gently cleans the bio-film plaque off the PROXIMAL surfaces of the teeth, while stimulating the soft tissues.  To jump-start the healing of any bleeding sites, dip the end of the brush tip in hydrogen peroxide first.  It oxygenates the entire inter-dental space!</li>
            <li> But I bend these to an angle and they work just fine. Plus they are less expensive. A great cleaning routine to add to dental care.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I like to have a cover for each of my picks so I can keep them in pockets (they stay clean that way).  These picks only have 2 tops you have to rotate with the picks.  As such, I switched to the Dentek brush which not only has individual covers, but also are sturdier.  The Aim brushes bent quicker then my other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These really will make a big difference in your dental hygiene if you use them after each meal.</li>
            <li> I like these brush picks alot, but this last batch seems defective.  The brush breaks off only half way through cleaning my teeth.  This means I have had to use double the amount.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected. Love them. I also love the fact that some came covered. Will order again in the future</li>
            <li> These are perfect for when flossing doesn&#x27;t quite work.</li>
            <li> I love these brush picks!  I noticed that they work much better on my teeth than floss.  You cannot beat the price on them either!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so affordable and the handles don&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy at all (which was what I was worried about).  I like how they give you the caps as well!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I use interdental brushes to clean between my new implant and crown work.  They do a much more thorough job of removing plaque and debris from between teeth, especially at the important gum line, than dental floss.

            <li> These are helping my gums get back to healthy. I am an avid flosser, but apparently that wasn&#x27;t keeping my gums from developing issues. Using these _has_ helped, but they aren&#x27;t so very sturdy. They usually only last for one or two cleanings (I clean them with hydrogen peroxide in between), and sometimes come apart between my teeth, which is a little awkward. All in all, though, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> They are too flimsy and don&#x27;t clean well between the teeth</li>
            <li> Great QUALITY, fast shipping, just as described A+++</li>

            <li> Unfortunately all the colors were the same size small that would just be good for tight teeth space.  The Tepe brand are sized by colors depending on the brush thickness.  I thought if I ordered the Aim brand I would be getting different sizes according to color like the Tepe brand.  The Tepe brand is more expensive and better.  If you value your teeth and have pockets developing between them spend the money and save your teeth !!&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
            <li> These are supposed to be the super fine brushes that fit braces... but they won&#x27;t fit between my teeth. I will use them for preschool art projects instead.</li>
            <li> great price...as represented</li>
            <li> Although this is not the cheapest product on the market, I like it and I would purchase it for the simple reason that those brush picks are the sturdiest ones available. To reach between teeth, I need a sturdy brush and not those ones that bend so easily and become useless.---Yes, these brush picks are not cheap, but they do the job and that is important.....</li>

            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give these a try in place off my usual Oral B brushes.  These clean as well but the wire is fairly flimsy so I&#x27;m lucky to make one around my  mouth with one brush.  I&#x27;ll stuck with the pricier Oral Bs which I can clean and get a couple of good uses out off.l</li>
            <li> was late in arrival ... no substitute for the well packaged dentrex product line&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spend a few cents more and buy dentrex</li>
            <li> Great for travel and every day.</li>
