            <li>Sweet Honesty is fresh, feminine scent.</li>
            <li>I think the sweet honesty is even nice for very young girls to wear and not be to much for them.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and nice!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Not too flowery or childish; just a whisper of pleasant fragrance that makes people wonder what you&#x27;re wearing as you pass by.</li>
            <li>Came fast too!</li>
            <li>Imagine relaxing on a porch a crisp morning in the country.</li>
            <li>This perfume has been one of my ultimate favorite from Avon.</li>
            <li>I reccommend it to every woman, young and old, who wishes to hold on to those tender, exhilarating feelings of young adulthood.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this perfume for anyone, mainly teens and young adults :)</li>
            <li>Sweet, soft smell.</li>
            <li>I am fourteen years old, and I started wearing Sweet Honesty in 6th grade, when I was 11.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and gentle, not overwhelming</li>
            <li>the perfume for women is not the right scent for the young ones first perfume</li>
            <li>A real bargain.  </li>
            <li>Thanks and</li>
            <li>Very uplifting.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh, clean fragrance that isn&#x27;t too heavy but noticeable enough to earn you compliments from complete strangers as it has done many times for me.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy soft smelling fragrances that do not last all day as this one does tend to wear off fast then this one is for you .</li>
            <li>Sweet Honesty takes me back.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for summer.</li>
            <li>This Cologne is one of my favorite scents of my childhood; it&#x27;s not a strong scent</li>
            <li>Such a pretty, subtle scent that brings back good memories.</li>
            <li>In my late twenties now I still enjoy it as much as I did when I was 18, and just putting it on makes me feel as young and full of romantic expectation as I did back then.  </li>
            <li>So I surprised her with this from Amazon..</li>
            <li>is a soft smelling cologne that does not burn the nose or make the eyes water.</li>
            <li>I am a professional, and I guarantee you that people of all ages ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft floral aroma..</li>
            <li>It has a light powdery scent but doesn&#x27;t last long, but 5 stars for that moment of freshness and for reminding me of my younger days.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent reminds me of summers past.  </li>
            <li>this is a very watered down version of the product.</li>

            <li> Love this cologne. Is the one I started wearing since I was a child in Peru, and I am more than glad that I can still find it when I need it. Arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> Sweet, soft smell. Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> LOVE the flowery fragrance of Sweet Honesty.  Has always been one of my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; colognes.  I also loved this seller&#x27;s price therefore, I ordered 2 bottles. I had to contact the company four times. In the end, item received 10 days after it was due to arrive and customer service was a joke. I had a very hard time receiving an informative reply to my e-mails and when I did receive a reply, it was skimpy on the information side and the tone of the e-mail was condescending.  While I will continue to wear the lovely fragrance of Sweet Honesy, I WILL NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to get an old favorite.</li>
            <li> I hate heavy, strong colognes. This one is light and refreshing. I love the smell. It is not over powering.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this ever since I was a litle girl, and it still smell so sweet and innocent &amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3.</li>
            <li> Over 10years ago, my best friend Mindy gave me a bottle   of Sweet  honesty. She passed away now from cancer, and every time I ware it I   think of her. It&#x27;s real hard to find a friend these days who treats you like   family. This perfume makes me feel safe, and happy. To me, it smells like honey,   and brings back childhood memories of baking in the kitchen. I can&#x27;t take my   blankey every where I go, but I can take my Sweet Honesty. It&#x27;s like a hug in a   bottle! In a world that&#x27;s ever changing, and when life isn&#x27;t so   easy, It&#x27;s nice to have something to count on.  Raquel Vega</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for over ten years now and will continue to do so no matter what age I am.  It is a lovely mixture of vanilla, citrus and soft floral notes that I can best describe as smelling like innocence, if innocence had a smell.  In my late twenties now I still enjoy it as much as I did when I was 18, and just putting it on makes me feel as young and full of romantic expectation as I did back then.  It is a fresh, clean fragrance that isn&#x27;t too heavy but noticeable enough to earn you compliments from complete strangers as it has done many times for me.  I reccommend it to every woman, young and old, who wishes to hold on to those tender, exhilarating feelings of young adulthood.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. I buy it all the time. It reminds me of when I was much, much younger. I am allergic to a lot of perfumes and this is one that I can wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this since the 1970s, when I turned thirteen. It and Estee Lauder Youth Dew were my first-ever perfumes.  It&#x27;s a classic, perfect for any age.  Sweet floral, flirty scent.</li>
            <li> It has been my one and only for years and years and years and years and years.  That should be enough required words</li>
            <li> this was the same cologne that my girlfriend has been looking for she though she would never find this cologne again.Thanks Amazon you have made yet another person very happy</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Aunt who loves it. She said Avon made her wait too long and it was a couple bucks more... So I surprised her with this from Amazon.. Good Choice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Avon Sweet Honesty for many years and I will always use it...I am definitely pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> What a nice inexpensive fragrance.  Highly recommend for summer. Fresh scent reminds me of summers past.  A real bargain.  My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Easy to give this rating since I have worn Sweet Honesty for probably 45 years. It&#x27;s my husbands favorite fragrance and has been affordable over the years...</li>
            <li> I bought this as one of the items for Christmas for granddaughter  I couldn&#x27;t believe they still make it...it was 60 years ago I wore  it..it is perfect for young girls the perfume for women is not the right scent for the young ones first perfume</li>

            <li> I am fourteen years old, and I started wearing Sweet Honesty in 6th grade, when I was 11. Ever since then, I have been hooked on this perfume. It smells light, innocent, and sweet, but not overpowering. And, it lasts way, way longer then my other perfumes (Philosophy, Perlier, Cherry Blossom etc.) This is also the most favorite out of all my perfumes :) Everyone asks me, (even my friends at school)\\&quot;what perfume do you have on? It smells so fresh and nice!\\&quot; Even a couple of teachers at my private school ask me \\&quot;what perfume is that? It smells so clean and pretty!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even got my mom hooked on this scent (lol) as she was using Philosophy Amazing Grace before. Now, she also likes this scent, better than Amazing Grace :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this perfume for anyone, mainly teens and young adults :)</li>
            <li> The item arrived well before the est. delivery date and was as described by the seller.  I am very happy with this product and so it my mom as it was a gift for her.  Thanks and I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I grew up using this perfume.  It is my favorite Avon prefume.  It has a nice soft smell of baby powder.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty, subtle scent that brings back good memories. Reminds me of spring in Ohio as a child. The only downside is the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last long on me. Nevertheless I am thrilled with this perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne and the price was good. Came fast too!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and gentle, not overwhelming</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> For years I wore this perfume, but moved out of NYC and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Now I am able to reorder anytime I run-out!!&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of this perfume is the same in every bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on from around 1977 or so and have always liked this.  I like this is a soft smelling cologne that does not burn the nose or make the eyes water. I have been around some of those that can burn the eyes and this is not one of the.. I think the sweet honesty is even nice for very young girls to wear and not be to much for them. If you enjoy soft smelling fragrances that do not last all day as this one does tend to wear off fast then this one is for you .</li>
            <li> Very uplifting. A scent I believe is made for morning air. Imagine relaxing on a porch a crisp morning in the country. This is the scent that reminds me of that.</li>
            <li> This Cologne is one of my favorite scents of my childhood; it&#x27;s not a strong scent and that&#x27;s why I love it so much!</li>
            <li> It has a light powdery scent but doesn&#x27;t last long, but 5 stars for that moment of freshness and for reminding me of my younger days.&lt;br /&gt;If you want something to last throughout the day this is not the fragrance to buy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a light, summery fragrance, this us it. Not too flowery or childish; just a whisper of pleasant fragrance that makes people wonder what you&#x27;re wearing as you pass by. Love it!</li>
            <li> Sweet Honesty takes me back. I enjoy the scent. My mother used to wear it and had a the vintage year champagne bottle of it. Lovely light scent not too sweet.</li>
            <li> This perfume has been one of my ultimate favorite from Avon. It was only recently that I realized I could buy it in Amazon! The fragrance reminds me of baby lotion/products... it&#x27;s soothing, not overpowering, and the scent stays on you the entire day! I am a professional, and I guarantee you that people of all ages ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. Plus, I travel a lot and the size it comes in is appropriate for traveling anywhere!</li>
            <li> Perfect perfume for my tween. It&#x27;s a soft floral aroma.. I use to use this perfume back in the day. I&#x27;m glad I can share it with my daughter ;)</li>
            <li> Love this ! Quick shipping, and smells just like it did years ago ! Love it !</li>
