            <li> Plus it&#x27;s sticky and gooey, most cosmetics makers use lots of other artificial ingredients to take away the stickiness but that&#x27;s what makes it WORK.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s sooooo small.</li>
            <li> It was very heavy fluid.</li>
            <li> This product came as a very thick syrup and without mixing it with another moisturizing cream is far too sticky to use on my face alone.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s hard to estimate actual concentration.</li>

            <li> Love it. Makes a world of a difference for my hair, when I mixed it with my conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great for hair product receipes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how it works yet.</li>
            <li> I learned about panthenol a while back but I never took the time to find it. I mixed it in with my hair conditioner and my lotion and my hair and skin was so soft. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s sooooo small.</li>
            <li> Panthenol is a skin and hair plumper. Many, many produces contain small amounts of it but not enough to really work. Plus it&#x27;s sticky and gooey, most cosmetics makers use lots of other artificial ingredients to take away the stickiness but that&#x27;s what makes it WORK. Yes, it&#x27;s sticky and gooey and you can&#x27;t put it on at bed time, you have to use it during the day when you have a couple of hours to let it soak up. Not convenient or easy to use but what incredible results I get. It does not last forever though, you must keep using it one a week or so to keep up the results but to me it&#x27;s worth the trouble because it really reduces the lines in my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 2 oz because I wasn&#x27;t certain what to expect from this product. I suffer from adult acne breakouts and wanted a healthier alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this at night directly on problem areas and in a day or so, the skin is beginning to heal -- just one of the benefits of Provitamin B5. I encourage you to do your research. I will purchase this again and in the larger size.</li>
            <li> so far I thinking this product save my hair after I bleach by my self. I use in my hair ends , them I mixed olive oil  and coconut oil and leave for 2 days. My hair still damage but I saved to cut off.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much for my skin at all. I did not see any improvements after 6 months of using.</li>
            <li> Love this product, leaves my hair soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> It was too greasy to use on my hair. It was very heavy fluid. I ended up tossing it away.</li>
            <li> Great to mix with your hair care products to get glossy hair. Good to hydrate chapped lips or for under eyes.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Works great on skin lesions and also on pimples on your face! Love it, even though it is veeery sticky. :)</li>
            <li> This is excellent in my home made shampoos and creams. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Exactly as listed. Love this product and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 5% Panthenol for years and love it, but with the added Provitamin B5 my face feels much firmer.  Really like it.</li>

            <li> Excellent product. Excellent service!!</li>
            <li> seems like dexpanthenol. used it in addition to minoxidil. description says that activity is 75%. So it&#x27;s hard to estimate actual concentration.</li>
            <li> Just got still have to try it out</li>
