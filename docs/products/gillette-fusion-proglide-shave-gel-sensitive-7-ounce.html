            <li>Best shave cream Gillette sells.</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This product goes great with the Fusion Pro Glide Razor.  </li>
            <li>and well i think that we are happy with it.</li>
            <li>Not so great for my face.</li>
            <li>Good product, happy happy...........</li>
            <li>Good one i recommend to all</li>
            <li>I used think this was as good as it gets for shaving until I discovered Dr Carver&#x27;s Shave Butter from Dollar Shave Club.</li>
            <li>See, sometimes not changing what works is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>about the best shaving cream available</li>
            <li>But again, what good is a product if it doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li>Good stuff but</li>
            <li>As good as any, better than some.</li>
            <li>Best stuff currently IMO - works great</li>
            <li>I could take it or what ever else was handy.</li>
            <li>Good Shaving Cream &amp; a cheap price</li>
            <li>, there is something nice about buying directly from the manufacturer - this is a good brand, good kind... but have not found a routine shaving cream</li>
            <li>It was like most of the others out there.</li>
            <li>but I sure can&#x27;t get any more out of it.</li>
            <li>I know &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; should equate to something better but that is not the case with this and thank you Gillette for sticking with what works.</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>Now I see why better shaving creams/gels cost more.</li>
            <li>what more can I say?  </li>
            <li>I must confess I don&#x27;t see even a minor difference among their many flavors of shaving gels, but this one works as well as any, and coupled with my Gillette FlexBall&amp;#34; razor contributes to an excellent shave.</li>

            <li>it is good one and nice in use very smooth and have a nice fragile thanks</li>
            <li>The smell was also sort of strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>and I have had a couple that don&#x27;t stop dispensing and make a huge</li>
            <li>Wife likes its fragrance and that is important.</li>
            <li>I also received this on the bzz campaign which was free.</li>
            <li>While I had once loved Gillette - my first razor was a Mach 3, I have used a Gillette all my life, from their body wash to their shaving cream (here) to their razors, I tried, really I did, but I couldn&#x27;t keep up the charade.</li>
            <li>Great gel offers a smooth shave for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Helps to keep skin cool and lubricated while still giving a close shave.</li>
            <li>So I my guess is you&#x27;re served better by saving your cash for any basic/generic shave gel, because it really makes no difference.</li>
            <li>3/4 full or so</li>
            <li>Gillette was kind enough to send me a free sample of this gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>, I got the super close shave I was looking for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to essentially throw away 17 cans because of this very reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, all the bump issues that have been reported I also have experienced.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, the gel itself provides a smooth and comfortable shave and seems to hydrate the face very well during the shave.</li>
            <li>overall it was nice.</li>
            <li>i liked the blue gel a lot it does come out creamy after you pump it out</li>
            <li>and it can cost more because it is designated for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My struggle this;  When I saw the Gel oze out of the top I expected it to be warm as they past shaving creamactually used to warm up somehow.  </li>
            <li>that different from most shaving gels</li>
            <li>I have always loved shaving gels and I have tried a few of them</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this gives me a clean close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>Have been using Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel for the last several years with good results.  </li>
            <li>This has been the only shaving gel that doesn&#x27;t give my skin fits...ie I am very sensitive to any kind of unusual ingredients in shaving</li>
            <li>It provided a fluid and smooth shaving surface.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and I will buy again.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog the razor and it lathers very well.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product from bzzagent.com thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Although the Mach 3 cartridge in my razor was relatively new, it was not shaving very well.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and no issue with razor drag.</li>
            <li>In this particular case, the nozzle didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>There is some Blue Dye in it that causes some mild reaction.  </li>
            <li>The Fusion Proglide Sensitive Mens Shaving Gel works very well.  </li>
            <li>I subsequently used this product again from a local pharmacy and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Attempts to wash the gel from between the blades of the new cartridge were unsuccessful.  </li>
            <li>Seems to compliment the new ball razors a lot.  </li>
            <li>My husband got the new Gillette trimmer that you can attach a razor blade to and loves it.  </li>
            <li>I tried a new Mach 3 cartridge which became totally clogged after the first shave.  </li>
            <li>Tried soaking for several hours in what started out as hot water and washing under the faucet</li>
            <li>The skin care offered a sharp and clean shave.</li>
            <li>far as the actual &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, when it does finally come out, it does offer a clean, close</li>
            <li>If you wet your face enough with hot water and use enough of this gel, it works fine.  </li>
            <li>A quick visual check showed that the spaces between the blades were totally clogged.  </li>
            <li>and it just a HUGE waste in my opinion.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, this is over priced junk compared the the shave butter from Dollar Shave Club.  </li>
            <li>my skin is to sensitive</li>
            <li>For sensitive, soft skin, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>It does not close completely after use.</li>
            <li>Sensitive 2.5oz version</li>
            <li>unfortunately being able to use only a 1/4 of the can pretty much negates any positives about this product.</li>
            <li>gentleman in the house, as well as the ladies who gave it a try, did not find it special or different from the other shaving gels used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendation: If you can get this shaving gels with coupons at Amazon, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase, but if you have sensitive skin, there is not that much difference from many others out there.</li>
            <li>This product claims to be for sensitive skin, yet it left my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li>I have gone back to my old shaving gel brand, which keeps dispensing properly until the very end when there is no more gel left in the can.</li>
            <li>It dispenses normally the first few times, however, after maybe 4 or 5 uses, the can will all of a sudden have VERY LITTLE/NO pressure and will not dispense properly, but rather, it will be VERY slow (if it even</li>

            <li> But it is the same as any other.</li>
            <li> (Not worth time/effort to figure out how to send back!)</li>
            <li> I will never buy shave cream or gel from any other company again.</li>
            <li> It was cold going on and changes to foam quickly.</li>
            <li> This is consistent with several cans that I tried, I was figuring maybe it was a bad can, but time and time again, this problem persisted.</li>
            <li> OK - So this shaving gel is EXTREMELY annoying.</li>
            <li> I thought that I had a problem with only ONE can, however, after purchasing a few other cans randomly from different places, I found that there is still an issue with the dispensing mechanism.</li>
            <li> Every single shave gel product line they have (not just this one, as I have tried almost all of them and their varieties) loses pressure within a month.</li>
            <li> The can is still heavy</li>
            <li> There always some waste.</li>
            <li> To say it vexed me that I wasted my money on this product would be an understatement.</li>
            <li> but very little gel washed out,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the mechanism of the can, as there is something wrong with the pressure after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> Usually I use this and like!</li>
            <li> On that note, I have never had a problem like this with any other brand and there just seems to be something weird going on with the Gillette Fusion shaving gel line.</li>
            <li> The dispenser parts break too, VERY hard to get product out</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with any Gillette Fusion ProGlide product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any Gillette Fusion ProGlide product.  </li>
            <li> I would give this product zero stars but that appears to be impossible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great gel offers a smooth shave for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Usually I use this and like! In this particular case, the nozzle didn&#x27;t work. (I even removed the inner cap - and played with the nozzle to persuade it work, but unsuccessfully.) I needed to discard it unused. (Not worth time/effort to figure out how to send back!) I subsequently used this product again from a local pharmacy and it worked fine. Probably a &amp;#34;bad one.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good one i recommend to all</li>
            <li> Every time I used it my face would breakout.  It reall sucked walking around with a spothey face!  Gillette should be ashamed,  aaaaaaaand they take oee their product line</li>
            <li> I used think this was as good as it gets for shaving until I discovered Dr Carver&#x27;s Shave Butter from Dollar Shave Club. This product claims to be for sensitive skin, yet it left my skin feeling dry. As far as I am concerned, this is over priced junk compared the the shave butter from Dollar Shave Club.  I will never buy shave cream or gel from any other company again.</li>
            <li> Good product, happy happy...........</li>
            <li> As good as any, better than some.</li>
            <li> I dont shave with the razor my skin is to sensitive but i use it for my shape up the blade just slides</li>
            <li> If you wet your face enough with hot water and use enough of this gel, it works fine.  Wife likes its fragrance and that is important.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Great product.</li>
            <li> Best shave cream Gillette sells.</li>
            <li> Best stuff currently IMO - works great</li>
            <li> The skin care offered a sharp and clean shave. It provided a fluid and smooth shaving surface. It did what a shaving cream should. However I did not feel any &amp;#34;whoa&amp;#34; moment in it. It was like most of the others out there. The smell was also sort of strong for my liking. overall it was nice. But it is the same as any other. If I was shopping for some cream. I could take it or what ever else was handy. I also received this on the bzz campaign which was free.</li>
            <li> it is good one and nice in use very smooth and have a nice fragile thanks a lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good bye ...</li>
            <li> Good Shaving Cream &amp; a cheap price, there is something nice about buying directly from the manufacturer - this is a good brand, good kind... but have not found a routine shaving cream</li>
            <li> Great Product! Gillette was kind enough to send me a free sample of this gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with any Gillette Fusion ProGlide product. I must confess I don&#x27;t see even a minor difference among their many flavors of shaving gels, but this one works as well as any, and coupled with my Gillette FlexBall&amp;#34; razor contributes to an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> I was about four shaves into this can of shaving gel before it stopped dispensing altogether.  The can is still heavy and I can tell there is quite a bit still in there but I sure can&#x27;t get any more out of it.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product from bzzagent.com thanks to Gillette.  I have tried this product and although it is no different from other Gillette gel products I have tried, I would definitely still recommend it because of that.  I have always loved shaving gels and I have tried a few of them but I always go back to Gillette shaving gel. See, sometimes not changing what works is a good thing.  I know &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; should equate to something better but that is not the case with this and thank you Gillette for sticking with what works.</li>

I must confess I don&#x27;t see even a minor difference among their many flavors of shaving gels, but this one works as well as any, and coupled with my Gillette FlexBall&amp;#34; razor contributes to an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> For sensitive, soft skin, this is the way to go. Helps to keep skin cool and lubricated while still giving a close shave.</li>
            <li> I would give this product zero stars but that appears to be impossible.  Here&#x27;s why.  Although the Mach 3 cartridge in my razor was relatively new, it was not shaving very well.  A quick visual check showed that the spaces between the blades were totally clogged.  Tried soaking for several hours in what started out as hot water and washing under the faucet but very little gel washed out,  I tried a new Mach 3 cartridge which became totally clogged after the first shave.  Attempts to wash the gel from between the blades of the new cartridge were unsuccessful.  I will throw away the cans I have and go to back to using Edge gel.</li>
            <li> This product goes great with the Fusion Pro Glide Razor.  I have sensitive skin and this gives me a clean close shave without irritation. The price is reasonable and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> i liked the blue gel a lot it does come out creamy after you pump it out and well i think that we are happy with it. i get one and my father gets one. thank you nicholas popel</li>
            <li> It does not close completely after use. There always some waste.</li>
            <li> These cans stop working after about 1/4 of the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; comes out. This is consistent with several cans that I tried, I was figuring maybe it was a bad can, but time and time again, this problem persisted. The dispenser parts break too, VERY hard to get product out and I have had a couple that don&#x27;t stop dispensing and make a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, when it does finally come out, it does offer a clean, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;It also does offer some moisturizing effect too, and I have not had any issues with bumps or any sort of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately being able to use only a 1/4 of the can pretty much negates any positives about this product.</li>
            <li> ... But I wish it had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d purchased both gel &amp; the shaving stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I got the super close shave I was looking for (one can say that&#x27;s a plus), but within 48 hours came the bumps. And boy did I get bumps. Like wart size!!! To say it vexed me that I wasted my money on this product would be an understatement. There is nothing \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; about this shave gel. Its a case of same ol&#x27; same ol&#x27;. So I my guess is you&#x27;re served better by saving your cash for any basic/generic shave gel, because it really makes no difference. Heck, the suds from  a bar of soap can suffice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took two weeks before the bumps cleared. Wish I could return this stuff. Dumped the proglide stick as well and went back to using foil trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product helps provide smooth non irritating shaves. I was having difficulty with razor burn and this has all but eliminated the problem.</li>
            <li> It is okay. Nothing to brag about.&lt;br /&gt;Not that different from most shaving gels and it can cost more because it is designated for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gentleman in the house, as well as the ladies who gave it a try, did not find it special or different from the other shaving gels used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: If you can get this shaving gels with coupons at Amazon, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase, but if you have sensitive skin, there is not that much difference from many others out there.</li>
            <li> Not so great for my face. Not as hydrating as stated</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide Sensitive Mens Shaving Gel works very well.  Seems to compliment the new ball razors a lot.  My struggle this;  When I saw the Gel oze out of the top I expected it to be warm as they past shaving creamactually used to warm up somehow.  It was cold going on and changes to foam quickly.</li>
            <li> Now I see why better shaving creams/gels cost more.</li>
            <li> about the best shaving cream available</li>
            <li> OK - So this shaving gel is EXTREMELY annoying. I thought that I had a problem with only ONE can, however, after purchasing a few other cans randomly from different places, I found that there is still an issue with the dispensing mechanism. It dispenses normally the first few times, however, after maybe 4 or 5 uses, the can will all of a sudden have VERY LITTLE/NO pressure and will not dispense properly, but rather, it will be VERY slow (if it even works)…As a result, you have to throw the can away while it&#x27;s still 3/4 full or so and it just a HUGE waste in my opinion. On that note, I have never had a problem like this with any other brand and there just seems to be something weird going on with the Gillette Fusion shaving gel line. I have gone back to my old shaving gel brand, which keeps dispensing properly until the very end when there is no more gel left in the can. That is enough of a reason for me to rate this product poorly — only giving it 2/5 stars. On a positive note, the gel itself provides a smooth and comfortable shave and seems to hydrate the face very well during the shave. It doesn&#x27;t clog the razor and it lathers very well. But again, what good is a product if it doesn&#x27;t even work. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the mechanism of the can, as there is something wrong with the pressure after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> My husband got the new Gillette trimmer that you can attach a razor blade to and loves it.  I got this to accompany the purchase.</li>
            <li> Have been using Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel for the last several years with good results.  This has been the only shaving gel that doesn&#x27;t give my skin fits...ie I am very sensitive to any kind of unusual ingredients in shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is that when traveling on a plane....the seven oz container isn&#x27;t allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have tried Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive 2.5oz version and it has worked well for me.  There is some Blue Dye in it that causes some mild reaction.  To handle that I have shaved every other day for several weeks to allow my body to become less sensitive to it and that seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So at last I have a solution to the travel dilemma.  Hope it works well for you also.</li>
            <li> Shaving cream, what more can I say?  Goes on easily and no issue with razor drag.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but the extra cost over traditionals isn&#x27;t justifiable.</li>
            <li> While I had once loved Gillette - my first razor was a Mach 3, I have used a Gillette all my life, from their body wash to their shaving cream (here) to their razors, I tried, really I did, but I couldn&#x27;t keep up the charade. Every single shave gel product line they have (not just this one, as I have tried almost all of them and their varieties) loses pressure within a month. I tried every trick from heating the can back up to increase the pressure of the air in the can, to trying to take care of the can to ensure it doesn&#x27;t happen again, but nothing restores the lost pressure. And you can feel the weight of the compressed shaving cream in the can. I&#x27;ve had to essentially throw away 17 cans because of this very reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, all the bump issues that have been reported I also have experienced.</li>
