            <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>This is one of the most pleasant smelling perfumes I have come across in quite a while.</li>
            <li>This particular PHilton perfume is the best choice of all the scents.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, girly, and very clean scent</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>*:)</li>
            <li>just love it...</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful scent!</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on it, I decided to &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; up and forget about who&#x27;s name is across the bottle.</li>
            <li>This scent is unique in its own, but for my taste in fragrance, it stands tall and strong along side my two favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>good product was exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li>I came across this perfume in a local store, and loved the way it smelled on me!</li>
            <li>Was so happy that I was able to find this set for my niece as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>The best way I can impress upon this scent, is to relate it to the two fragrances I am most fond of wearing over the years, which are Very Irresistible by Givenchy &amp; Ed Hardy by Christian Audigier.</li>
            <li>The lotion in this set has a light shimmer to it, which is great for summertime and bare skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light not over powering</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light fruity/floral scent, but it lasts for hours on me.</li>
            <li>I am very particular with my scents, as most people are.</li>
            <li>Packaging was bubble wrapped, came right on time!</li>
            <li>Got my package quick.</li>
            <li>Attentive very fast and son .</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;re not a big fan of Paris, the person, you&#x27;ll love this scent!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, very pleased carefully packaged.</li>
            <li>smells great long lasting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to like many perfumes, however I bought this as a present</li>
            <li>Not into that whole thing, as I am 27 years old and a full fledged grown up ;)</li>
            <li>The bath gel doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as the perfume, in my opinion, but layering all of these products makes the perfume last longer than it already does.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the lotion</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and it came very well wrapped...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I bought the body spray a while back on clearance, because I needed a cheap fruity fragrance for work.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>hopefully they give me a discount to make up for the old lotion…</li>

            <li> no quit use to perfume or don&#x27;t like the heavy scents.</li>
            <li> shower gel was oozing :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it before leaving for work, and the scent still faintly lingers by the time I go to bed.  </li>

            <li> Love Love Love this perfume. I can&#x27;t live without. Everyone compliments me on good I smell. It&#x27;s light not over powering and you can&#x27;t even smell it on yourself but everyone does. This is prefect for some is no quit use to perfume or don&#x27;t like the heavy scents. Got my package quick. The only problem I had was that the body lotion smelled expired. I really wanted the lotion and I had to throw it away :- (&lt;br /&gt;I should of returned but I didn&#x27;t know I could. Any how, I think I will still buy with this seller hopefully they give me a discount to make up for the old lotion…lol</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not one to like many perfumes, however I bought this as a present and of course I had to smell it and it smells delicious! Packaging was bubble wrapped, came right on time! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years, and hope they never discontinue it! It&#x27;s a light fruity/floral scent, but it lasts for hours on me. I&#x27;ve applied it before leaving for work, and the scent still faintly lingers by the time I go to bed.  The lotion in this set has a light shimmer to it, which is great for summertime and bare skin!

            <li> This particular PHilton perfume is the best choice of all the scents.It arrived in a timely manner and was packed well, so all bottles were intact/unbroken.Even if you&#x27;re not a big fan of Paris, the person, you&#x27;ll love this scent! Two words-Delish/Intoxicating</li>
            <li> You lost this item once and had to be replace and your UPS delivery man can&#x27;t follow simply instructions again  we asked if you guys could tell the delivery man to knock since I have no door bell and no one knocked.</li>
