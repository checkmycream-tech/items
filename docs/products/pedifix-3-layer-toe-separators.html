    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I wear these inside my merrell barefoot series shoes and they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>I liked the triple ones best.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>The cotton swab separates the toes and the strip of lambs wool holds it in place...works great</li>
            <li>Works Great with hammertoes.</li>
            <li>The quality is quite good, they come by snale mail</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazing.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I have yet to decide which kind I prefer.</li>
            <li>The foam kind of gets bent out of shape after awhile</li>
            <li>and after I began using this product I am able to walk with more comfort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helpful, I&#x27;m glad I purchased them</li>
            <li>They are washable and may be used many times.</li>
            <li>Both of the Pedfix products that I have purchased are virtually identical.they do an OK job but tend to deform more than I think they should.</li>
            <li>Better to get a silicone separator.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using cotton balls.</li>
            <li>They last months, they don&#x27;t collapse easily and provide good space btwn the toes, and they&#x27;re very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>just as I expected, very good to have the 3 sizes</li>
            <li>They are comfortable between my toes.</li>
            <li>These work, are comfortable because they are foam.</li>
            <li>so I might need to replace them after a month or so, but the price is cheap.</li>
            <li>Almost have to use a band-aid to secure.</li>
            <li>These foam separatros are easy to clean with a liquid dishwashing soap or Nutrogena.</li>
            <li>Cheap sponges-</li>
            <li>Was cheap, but not even worth that</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>They really work and do the job right.</li>
            <li>However, they only stay in place with shoes that fit exactly.</li>
            <li>although ad says three large pairs,</li>
            <li>I found this product to be very helpful.</li>
            <li>Durable, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I rate them very highly.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>I suppose if you sat very still, these might put some space between your toes for whole minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li>Only one of the separators was useful at all to my problem.</li>
            <li>Only wished I could get them in the medium size and not small medium and large sizes.</li>
            <li>My pedorthist recommended these and while they&#x27;re okay, it&#x27;s hard to get them to stay in place.</li>
            <li>Depend on how sensitive you feet are.</li>
            <li>These toe separators are quite soft and comfy, but they won&#x27;t stay in place, even with socks worn over them.  </li>
            <li>While these help some, they slip out of place quite frequently and end up in my socks or elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Overall, I wasted my money unless you count satisfying my curiosity.</li>
            <li>Gel separators feel better, stay put, and may last a bit longer, but they will break down if you wear them over a long day and/or work out as hard as I do.  </li>

            <li> I suffer from recent toe misalignment and partial hammer toe</li>
            <li> These work well at staying dry when I wear them for ballet, although they do not always stay put, so sometimes I tape them in place with coach tape.  </li>
            <li> They dry overnight.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t personally vouch for them, but he swears by them to keep his toes from &amp;#34;crossing over&amp;#34; each other!</li>
            <li> If the shoes are generously wide (which I need for bunions), they can slip out of place.</li>
            <li> However, these foam ones are the least likely to slip of any type of separators, and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch.     </li>
            <li> Still works better than this worthless product.</li>
            <li> (The velcro one does stay in place overnight but is uncomfortable and squishes the toes next to their outside neighbors.</li>
            <li> Like little sponges.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> If the silicone ones are too thick for between your little toes, then just slice it in half with a razor.</li>
            <li> These do the job, unlike the thin gel-like ones (see my other review).</li>
            <li> They are just too thick.</li>
            <li> This is not good if you are prone to athlete&#x27;s foot.)    </li>
            <li> no good  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product</li>
            <li> For walking or lying in bed, though, they&#x27;re useless, unless, in bed, you can get your feet under the covers with these things still in place, find a position that doesn&#x27;t squish them out of place, and then lie like a mummy,</li>
            <li> I bought Correct Toes for my hallux limitus, but I found them very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Bad bad product.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>

            <li> I bought Correct Toes for my hallux limitus, but I found them very uncomfortable.  I bought 2 packs of these and put btwn every toe.  They&#x27;re amazing.  They last months, they don&#x27;t collapse easily and provide good space btwn the toes, and they&#x27;re very comfortable.  I wear these inside my merrell barefoot series shoes and they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> These Seperators are just Iike I have gotten from my doctor.  The quality is quite good, they come by snale mail but they come.  I will know to reorder sooner next time.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Pedifix 3 Layer Toe separator is as described and is made with quality materials.   I suffer from recent toe misalignment and partial hammer toe and after I began using this product I am able to walk with more comfort.</li>
            <li> I have used these before. I liked the triple ones best. They are comfortable between my toes. Like little sponges. Depend on how sensitive you feet are. Some people prefer the gel.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Only wished I could get them in the medium size and not small medium and large sizes.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very helpful. It releaved a lot of foot pain. It is a great product. Even my foot doctor likes it.</li>
            <li> These work well at staying dry when I wear them for ballet, although they do not always stay put, so sometimes I tape them in place with coach tape.  Gel separators feel better, stay put, and may last a bit longer, but they will break down if you wear them over a long day and/or work out as hard as I do.  To be honest, I have yet to decide which kind I prefer.</li>
            <li> These work, are comfortable because they are foam. The foam kind of gets bent out of shape after awhile so I might need to replace them after a month or so, but the price is cheap.</li>
            <li> My pedorthist recommended these and while they&#x27;re okay, it&#x27;s hard to get them to stay in place. If you don&#x27;t have socks on, I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d do it. Almost have to use a band-aid to secure.</li>
            <li> These toe separators are quite soft and comfy, but they won&#x27;t stay in place, even with socks worn over them.  And I can&#x27;t see any change in the direction of my overlapping toes.  Overall, I wasted my money unless you count satisfying my curiosity.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Durable, fast delivery. They are just too thick.</li>
            <li> They wont last forever since the outer layer is foam, but they do the trick to keep toes separated and give some relief.</li>
            <li> These do the job, unlike the thin gel-like ones (see my other review). However, they only stay in place with shoes that fit exactly. If the shoes are generously wide (which I need for bunions), they can slip out of place. However, these foam ones are the least likely to slip of any type of separators, and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch.     (The velcro one does stay in place overnight but is uncomfortable and squishes the toes next to their outside neighbors. This is not good if you are prone to athlete&#x27;s foot.)    These foam separatros are easy to clean with a liquid dishwashing soap or Nutrogena. They dry overnight.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wear these with shoes but they don&#x27;t seem to stay in place when worn this way under socks.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful, I&#x27;m glad I purchased them</li>
            <li> They just did not stay in place. no good  if it&#x27;s not working well.</li>
            <li> These are terrific. They really work and do the job right. They are washable and may be used many times. I rate them very highly.&lt;br /&gt;Hope others will try them</li>
            <li> three different sizes although ad says three large pairs,</li>
            <li> Both of the Pedfix products that I have purchased are virtually identical.they do an OK job but tend to deform more than I think they should.</li>
            <li> Just foam cut into shapes. Something one can do for themselves. Was cheap, but not even worth that price.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> just as I expected, very good to have the 3 sizes</li>
            <li> The toe separators pop out and don&#x27;t work.  I cut a sheet of lambs wool into thin finger like slice and secure some cotton swabs between the toes. The cotton swab separates the toes and the strip of lambs wool holds it in place...works great</li>
            <li> Bad bad product. It crushes and becomes dust, also falls out of place between toes. Better to get a silicone separator. If the silicone ones are too thick for between your little toes, then just slice it in half with a razor. Still works better than this worthless product.</li>
            <li> Works Great with hammertoes.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you sat very still, these might put some space between your toes for whole minutes at a time.  For walking or lying in bed, though, they&#x27;re useless, unless, in bed, you can get your feet under the covers with these things still in place, find a position that doesn&#x27;t squish them out of place, and then lie like a mummy,</li>
            <li> My husband ordered these and loves them! I can&#x27;t personally vouch for them, but he swears by them to keep his toes from &amp;#34;crossing over&amp;#34; each other!</li>
            <li> While these help some, they slip out of place quite frequently and end up in my socks or elsewhere. Only one of the 3 sizes worked for me.</li>
            <li> Cheap sponges- that&#x27;s all this product is. You&#x27;re better off using cotton balls. The washable filter provided with a wet-dry vac is thicker and studier than this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay in place even when taped</li>
            <li> Only one of the separators was useful at all to my problem.</li>
    </ol>
