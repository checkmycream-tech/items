    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is the very best eye cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to find it for 19.99 here that is a very good price.</li>
            <li>It absorbs great and the crepines and dryness of the skin under my eyes is diminishing.</li>
            <li>Smells delicius and its a great cream</li>
            <li>While I have always had great skin(it tends to run in my family)</li>
            <li>Great product, great company.</li>
            <li>Amazing product for the price!</li>
            <li>I recommend as a nice quality product but don&#x27;t expect any miracles!</li>
            <li>If I feel good</li>
            <li>this stuff makes my eyes feel good.</li>
            <li>The lines appear to be diminishing and it feels so good when I apply it.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product, has a excellent ingredient deck, and is a nice consistency so it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very, very pleased</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed and will update with another review when I&#x27;ve been using it longer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love!  </li>
            <li>The name is amazing also.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product; I don&#x27;t notice any drastic improvement</li>
            <li>Feel&#x27;s nice on and tightens my pores.</li>
            <li>The price is awesome as I saw it in a Health Food store for almost 2 times as much.  </li>
            <li>this is the best stuff I have ever used it really does work</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular and the pump results in dryish clumps.</li>
            <li>this eye cream is super silky and absorbs beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Its the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried out so far</li>
            <li>Wanted to love this product, but it irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>the eye cream works better for all day moisture but not too oily.</li>
            <li>I truly love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my face, under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>After a couple days I stopped using it my skin got so much better.  </li>
            <li>Eh, it was ok but for my type of skin, Jamaican,Irish.</li>
            <li>So it was ok</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>So many eye creams are often too emollient and they can cause milia, but not this one.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Oz did an entire segment on using niacin amide  on the skin, and the great quick results, and so farâ€¦ I see proof!!!</li>
            <li>It gave my eyes a very refreshed and bright look.  </li>
            <li>and they really go well with one another, love the serum!</li>
            <li>After using it for about 6 weeks I saw a huge improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It does help smooth out my skin.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have been thrilled with how much this product has helped with the bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think an eye cream at this price would do much, but I knew that the peptide ingredients in it are supposed to be beneficial for puffy eyes</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t find it useful as a fresh de-puffing/soothing/lifting effect kind of eye product that I like to use in the morning.  </li>
            <li>it is light and cool feeling.  </li>
            <li>I also love that the ingredients are natural and more on the botanical side.</li>
            <li>It still won&#x27;t cover a rough night of no sleep, lol.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that I will love this line since it doesn&#x27;t have much chemicals</li>
            <li>It seems to be a good basic eye cream.</li>
            <li>What impresses me the most is how much smoother my under-eye concealer goes on after using this.  </li>
            <li>Even hours afterward, my eyes feel refreshed and when I get a good night&#x27;s sleep, they look years younger than before.  </li>
            <li>Light irritation, burning sensation right away after I put it on.</li>
            <li>Found this and love it so far.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream, there are extraordinary claims if you use continually for 56 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more in the future .</li>
            <li>Helps with under eye circles and fine lines so they are barely noticeable</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t use this every single day but most.</li>
            <li>nice eye cream, but a little watery.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very moisturizing either.</li>
            <li>I use this to moisterize my whole face and sometimes my hands.</li>
            <li>I can look my best, was it the mad Hippie eye cream or not ?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this eye cream for about a week, but it has already had a significant impact on the insomnia caused bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It relieved my puffy eyes, smoothed fine lines and prevented new ones b/c when I stopped using this stuff recently, lines/puffiness started cropping up again.</li>
            <li>That is definitely due to the niacin amide in the product so early listed in the ingredients meaning there&#x27;s more of that than the rest that follows.</li>
            <li>This peptide eye cream is great for anyone that is troubled by discoloration, swelling and/or wrinkles around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It does leave the skin around my eyes soft and it is not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>No miracles for my new wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive so it might work well for you if it doesn&#x27;t bother your eyes.</li>
            <li>It helps a lot and thank you creators of Mad Hippie for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I have the Moisturizer and eye cream and face serum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 52 years old.  </li>
            <li>Being a mother, I regularly do not get enough sleep, but this eye cream helps keep me looking fresh regardless.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s lasting a long time; no bad smells or oiliness on the skin or anything.</li>
            <li>Mad Hippie is my new favorite skin care company!!</li>
            <li>I have had good skin all my life and yet I&#x27;ve had to fight dark circles under my eyes as well as the lines that start when you hit the late 40&#x27;s and early 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Mad Hippie eye cream is really good combined with the vit C cream .</li>
            <li>Might be great for some but not for me. :(</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Might be great for some but not for me. :(</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite product from mad hippie.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to tell if it made any difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product for awhile, I began to get a strange dryness under my eye.  </li>
            <li> i use a little and am careful not to get near the edges of my eyes at night</li>
            <li> A little disappointing but still a nice product.  </li>
            <li> My hands get really dry from my job and they will stay silky feeling for 2 hand washes.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is moisturizing without leaving residue and it soothed my already dry and irritated eyelids (result of another product).</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this eye cream, but there is nothing special about it either.  </li>
            <li> After a month of using  only once a day for a couple weeks it&#x27;s a shame I have to rate down this item to 1 star and throw it away.</li>
            <li> you only need a little.</li>
            <li> I have spent up to $150 each 60 days on under eye cream</li>
            <li> if i am sloppy or use too much at night I wake up with crusty eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , when i was 30, I started getting dark circles plus a little bag under my left eye.  </li>
            <li> I do have extreme discoloration under my eyes though which it has NOT helped.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it is worth the additional cost - it seems to work as well as my Clinique Dramatic Moisturizing Gel if I used that around my eye.  </li>
            <li> for day use this has never happened, 4 stars instead of five because the 56 day experiment to get rid of dark circle and bags isn&#x27;t over yet.</li>
            <li> It made my dark circles darker.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has had to battle dark circles and bags from sinus/allergy problems.  </li>
            <li> This little bottle, because of the way it dispenses, lasts for months.</li>
            <li> So a few years ago I started with any cream and worked my way to this product.</li>
            <li> Damn, time to purchase again - can&#x27;t be lazy w/ skincare.</li>
            <li> So far, I like this brand, Mad Hippie,</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money :(</li>
            <li> Within the last 18 months I have used Mad Hippie for under $25 and those problems are all gone.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other Mad Hippie products seemed a bit pricey, but this eye cream lasts a while</li>
            <li> My skin had a poor reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure why someone decided my review wasn&#x27;t helpful, but whatever...maybe they were having an understandably bad day b/c of the bags under their eyes.</li>
            <li> After thinking that it was from a concealer I was wearing, I began just using the Mad Hippie.  </li>
            <li> I have also tried mad hippie face moisterizer but</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not had any reactions to any Mad Hippie product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> There is nothing bad about the cream -</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a nice product; I don&#x27;t notice any drastic improvement but I feel it&#x27;s maintaining my skin&#x27;s moisture well and it&#x27;s lasting a long time; no bad smells or oiliness on the skin or anything. I recommend as a nice quality product but don&#x27;t expect any miracles! It still won&#x27;t cover a rough night of no sleep, lol.</li>
            <li> nice eye cream, but a little watery.  If you&#x27;re looking for something thicker and a deeper moisturizer, this may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for awhile, I began to get a strange dryness under my eye.  (I tend to have oily skin).  It looked irritated as though I scratched the area, which initially I thought I had.  After thinking that it was from a concealer I was wearing, I began just using the Mad Hippie.  Bingo!  That was it.  I&#x27;ve stopped using this product and the irritation has never come back.</li>
            <li> Burns eyes. They say DO NOT PUT ON EYELIDS. Well, I want to use eye cream on my eyelids too. Don&#x27;t they have aging issues? It isn&#x27;t very moisturizing either.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I was hoping that I will love this line since it doesn&#x27;t have much chemicals but this didn&#x27;t do anything for my eye area.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream, there are extraordinary claims if you use continually for 56 days.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t gotten there yet. it moisturizes and is not greasy. if i am sloppy or use too much at night I wake up with crusty eyes.&lt;br /&gt;if i use a little and am careful not to get near the edges of my eyes at night this isn&#x27;t a problem. for day use this has never happened, 4 stars instead of five because the 56 day experiment to get rid of dark circle and bags isn&#x27;t over yet.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love this product, but it irritated my eyes. I am very sensitive so it might work well for you if it doesn&#x27;t bother your eyes. I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to tell if it made any difference.</li>
            <li> Mad Hippie eye cream is really good combined with the vit C cream . So a few years ago I started with any cream and worked my way to this product. Feel&#x27;s nice on and tightens my pores. Today while getting my senior discount ,the teller couldn&#x27;t believe my age.. If I feel good I can look my best, was it the mad Hippie eye cream or not ? I plan to buy more in the future .</li>
            <li> Its the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried out so far and I&#x27;m sticking with it! I use this to moisterize my whole face and sometimes my hands. My hands get really dry from my job and they will stay silky feeling for 2 hand washes. I have also tried mad hippie face moisterizer but the eye cream works better for all day moisture but not too oily. I&#x27;m very happy to find it for 19.99 here that is a very good price. I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve not had any reactions to any Mad Hippie product I&#x27;ve tried. I also don&#x27;t use this every single day but most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks and already notice a smoother tighter skin tone around my eyes. That is definitely due to the niacin amide in the product so early listed in the ingredients meaning there&#x27;s more of that than the rest that follows. Dr. Oz did an entire segment on using niacin amide  on the skin, and the great quick results, and so farâ€¦ I see proof!!!</li>
            <li> This peptide eye cream is great for anyone that is troubled by discoloration, swelling and/or wrinkles around the eyes.  After using it for about 6 weeks I saw a huge improvement in my skin.  It gave my eyes a very refreshed and bright look.  Amazing product for the price!</li>
            <li> Helps with under eye circles and fine lines so they are barely noticeable</li>
            <li> I truly love this product.  The price is awesome as I saw it in a Health Food store for almost 2 times as much.  I love the way it feels on my face, under my eyes.  The name is amazing also.  Mad Hippie is my new favorite skin care company!!</li>
            <li> Light irritation, burning sensation right away after I put it on. For that reason and since I don&#x27;t want to throw my money away I have to alternate and use only at night, I don&#x27;t find it useful as a fresh de-puffing/soothing/lifting effect kind of eye product that I like to use in the morning.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ** UPDATE ** After a month of using  only once a day for a couple weeks it&#x27;s a shame I have to rate down this item to 1 star and throw it away. The skin around my eyes got dry/chapped. This has never ever happened to me before with any eye product before.  After a couple days I stopped using it my skin got so much better.  Complete waste of money :(</li>
            <li> I found that only a small amount of this product went a long way for me, and therefore was worth the price. It seems to be a good basic eye cream.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my eyes feel good.</li>
            <li> Caused skin irritation.</li>
            <li> It has irritated my eyes (I have oily and non-sensitive skin) ... Its like burning under my eye area... so I wont purchase it again</li>
            <li> this eye cream is super silky and absorbs beautifully.  It does help smooth out my skin.  I do have extreme discoloration under my eyes though which it has NOT helped.  (Based on the description, that is why I wanted to try this)  A little disappointing but still a nice product.  What impresses me the most is how much smoother my under-eye concealer goes on after using this.  It helps prevent tugging, and diminishes any flaking and creasing.  I may re-purchase just for that reason.  Some of the other Mad Hippie products seemed a bit pricey, but this eye cream lasts a while so it&#x27;s more worth the price.</li>
            <li> Eh, it was ok but for my type of skin, Jamaican,Irish. It made my dark circles darker. So it was ok but the outcome is killing me.</li>
            <li> I have been thrilled with how much this product has helped with the bags under my eyes.  Being a mother, I regularly do not get enough sleep, but this eye cream helps keep me looking fresh regardless.</li>
            <li> My skin had a poor reaction to this product. Might be great for some but not for me. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this eye cream for about a week, but it has already had a significant impact on the insomnia caused bags under my eyes. I honestly didn&#x27;t think an eye cream at this price would do much, but I knew that the peptide ingredients in it are supposed to be beneficial for puffy eyes so I purchased it anyway. I&#x27;m pretty impressed and will update with another review when I&#x27;ve been using it longer. :)&lt;br /&gt;EDIT - Not sure why someone decided my review wasn&#x27;t helpful, but whatever...maybe they were having an understandably bad day b/c of the bags under their eyes. Anyway, I&#x27;ve used this eye cream for a while now and I&#x27;m still pretty impressed. It relieved my puffy eyes, smoothed fine lines and prevented new ones b/c when I stopped using this stuff recently, lines/puffiness started cropping up again. Damn, time to purchase again - can&#x27;t be lazy w/ skincare.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love!  This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that actually started to get rid of that bluish color under my eyes.mi think it&#x27;s hereditary although I am 51. I actually started to see a difference in a week. Very, very pleased</li>
            <li> At the recommendation of my aesthetician I was looking for an eye cream or serum with peptides in it.  Found this and love it so far. It absorbs great and the crepines and dryness of the skin under my eyes is diminishing. I also love that the ingredients are natural and more on the botanical side.</li>
            <li> So far, I like this brand, Mad Hippie, My skin is sensitive and I have the Moisturizer and eye cream and face serum and they really go well with one another, love the serum!</li>
            <li> So many eye creams are often too emollient and they can cause milia, but not this one.  It is a great product, has a excellent ingredient deck, and is a nice consistency so it absorbs quickly.  It keeps my under eye area moisturized without making it greasy.This is my second purchase and I will continue to repurchase as needed.</li>
            <li> I have had good skin all my life and yet I&#x27;ve had to fight dark circles under my eyes as well as the lines that start when you hit the late 40&#x27;s and early 50&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m now 52 years old.  The eye cream hasn&#x27;t been a miracle drug but it has helped my eyes immensely.  The lines appear to be diminishing and it feels so good when I apply it.  Even hours afterward, my eyes feel refreshed and when I get a good night&#x27;s sleep, they look years younger than before.  I would recommend this to anyone who has had to battle dark circles and bags from sinus/allergy problems.  It helps a lot and thank you creators of Mad Hippie for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> this is the best stuff I have ever used it really does work</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular and the pump results in dryish clumps.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells delicius and its a great cream</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this eye cream, but there is nothing special about it either.  No miracles for my new wrinkles.  It does leave the skin around my eyes soft and it is not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> There is nothing bad about the cream - it is light and cool feeling.  However, I saw no benefits either.  Not sure it is worth the additional cost - it seems to work as well as my Clinique Dramatic Moisturizing Gel if I used that around my eye.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the very best eye cream I have ever used. While I have always had great skin(it tends to run in my family), when i was 30, I started getting dark circles plus a little bag under my left eye.  I have spent up to $150 each 60 days on under eye cream and I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied.  Within the last 18 months I have used Mad Hippie for under $25 and those problems are all gone.  Put that extra $125 back in your wallet.</li>
            <li> you only need a little. This little bottle, because of the way it dispenses, lasts for months. Pair it with the face cream, and your skin will thank you. I&#x27;m trying the serum next. Great product, great company.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite product from mad hippie. Tried the vitamin C serum and the exfoliating serum and they did not work for me. The eye cream is moisturizing without leaving residue and it soothed my already dry and irritated eyelids (result of another product).</li>
