            <li> Like REALLY slow.</li>
            <li> The face spinner does spin slow but does the job.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not bad good for the price but too small I thought it will be bigger but over all I love and I recommend it</li>
            <li> I bought this little gadget from China exactly 7 days ago &amp; I just received it TODAY! LOL wow this company does not mess around with shipping!! It came with five little attachments &amp; it works OK... just get some good AA batteries for this thing. It&#x27;s kind of weak, but if you want a very gentle exfoliator, massager, facial moisture applicant, for your face, than this tiny toy like thing is for you... which is what I was looking for, because I have very sensitive skin. I love it! Very happy with my purchase! The price is perfect!</li>
            <li> It really works, but don&#x27;t use the one with bristles for too long, because they will start to hurt a little.</li>
            <li> Great deal I thot but once received, it looked too cheap. Packaging was not good. Product quality goes with it&#x27;s  cheap price.</li>
            <li> It came in a plastic bag which was fine but when I put in batteries and it spun really slow. Like REALLY slow. You might as well get one that doesn&#x27;t move if you&#x27;re thinking of buying this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small works great very good product</li>
            <li> i love this facial brush i use it to wash my face and blend my make up it works wonders</li>
            <li> LOVE this item! I use this item every time i shower (usually every other day) and it works GREAT! I love the different tops that come with it, and it doesn&#x27;t say it but this thing is WATERPROOF!</li>
            <li> Since the scrubbers are a big thing to use, I decided to get one and I love it....my face has never felt so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how clean my face feels after I use this. I use it at night and it cleans off all the excess dirt, makeup etc.. I like how it doesn&#x27;t stop as soon as it touches my face. The size is perfect, it&#x27;s not too small or too big. I purchased this item and the next day it was shipped, five days later I recieved it. Shipping is fast! Item arrived way before the estimated delivery date. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a cleaner healthier face.</li>
            <li> I love it and all the heads but it&#x27;s really small and very slow it doesn&#x27;t have much power and dryed my skin out</li>
            <li> U get what u pay for.... Right! Well surprisingly it works great and is exactly what I&#x27;d expected for the price point. I purchased as atrial run to see if I really wanted this type cleaning system before investing more money. A resounding YES! I&#x27;ll keep this unit for travel and buy stronger model for home!! Beauty art replacement heads are readily available!! Once again Amazon home run!!</li>
            <li> Love this thing, love the price and all</li>
            <li> Works very well and perfect size</li>
            <li> I just love this I use it everyday and I have noticed a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This spin brush works well, delivered fast, and packaged well. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast!! Which was good. The face spinner does spin slow but does the job.</li>
            <li> The speed was extremely slow even with brand new batteries and set on high.  Cheaply made. It feel apart when I tried using it the second the time.</li>
            <li> I like it! The speed is great for sensitive skin. The shipping was fast arrived within a week although the handling was not it looked like it might have flew out of the truck, it had two burn holes on the package and a dark scrap mark on the facial brush device, had to hit it a couple time just for it to turn on so that&#x27;s why the four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s be careful with the stone(the pink head( bit rough if u have sensitive skin be easy with it.</li>
            <li> this one works good for my 11 year old not very high quality but your not paying much either so in this you get what you paid for and it took awhile to come in</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this. I pretty much just use the bristle head to wash my face and it definetly does the job to clean and exfoliate my face. Of course your face wash plays a roll too but i have received far less breakouts with this little machine. the sponge head also works great to massage in your moisturizer or lotion pretty much anything honestly! The only con i can find about this item is that it isn&#x27;t waterproof so i cant take it in the shower and wash my face. Other than that i highly recommend this item, especially because its cheap.</li>
            <li> Pay less than 10 dollars for this. Yes it is worth of the price.</li>
            <li> I got it and i love it it works just like it says it do</li>
            <li> It does its work, but I would like that it spins faster</li>
            <li> Great price i was surprised that the speed is really slow even its on high non waterproof great for night wash i would recomend</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
