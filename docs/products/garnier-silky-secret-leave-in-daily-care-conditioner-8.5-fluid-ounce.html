    <ol>
            <li>To my surprise, it was a perfect blend of moisture to make my happier than it&#x27;s been in a while.  </li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>This product is also the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used to revive my hair when it&#x27;s been slept on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good budget leave-in conditioner (I have curly hair, so this isn&#x27;t a step I can skip!).  </li>
            <li>But great price</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>I find them to be very effective.</li>
            <li>Its a good product except it leaves my hair a bit sticky.</li>
            <li>And it smells good.</li>
            <li>Softens my beard nicely and keeps it looking good.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased!</li>
            <li>Service was very quick and it arrived it great shape.</li>
            <li>Nice smell without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I have had really good luck with most of Garnier&#x27;s leave-in products.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look just as good as it did right away a wash!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>Probably would not buy again as there are better products out there for my hair.</li>
            <li>What I love the most about it is how it&#x27;s a perfect 2nd day product.</li>
            <li>Smell was ok and falls in line with Garnier scents.</li>
            <li>I usually love Garnier products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>go so many compliments</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product from Garnier.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and it leaves her hair smooth and</li>
            <li>Has too strong of a smell and feels a bit heavy/grimy on your hair.</li>
            <li>I love the very light fruit fresh smell of this...far better than some products that have a distinct &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; to them.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is prone to getting greasy.</li>
            <li>BUT DOESN&#x27;T WORK FOR MY FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li>Light spray.  </li>
            <li>Still - great price for someone that uses leave-in conditioner daily!</li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic and works well for detangling my hair.</li>
            <li>Light, yet penetrates the hair to soften it and add definition to curls.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>Does the trick, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes to condition of my hair, etc.  </li>
            <li>gives a nice shine and makes the hair really soft!</li>
            <li>The smell is very citrus like, mostly grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that would make my hair super shiny &amp; decided to buy this after reading favorable reviews online.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t strong and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look unwashed or like there&#x27;s too much product in it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything else that leaves my hair so soft, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>Not the greatest leave in conditioner there is but not the worse.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent and how it conditions and detangles long hair.  </li>
            <li>this product does exactly what it say it doe.</li>
            <li>will I be purchasing this again most definitely. ..</li>
            <li>I must say, this stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I love this product for when my hair is especially frizzy</li>
            <li>I have tried others and this one is great for daily conditioning of long hair.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair smell really good though, but it doesnt last a long time.</li>
            <li>Does not do much for detangling.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much?</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care much for this leave in formula.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see or feel much of a difference on my hair.</li>
            <li>I use leave-in conditioner on my beard every few days, but this is a nice touch up in a rush.</li>
            <li>plan on continuing to buy this product as long as it&#x27;s available, if it&#x27;s ever discontinued i&#x27;ll be very upset.</li>
            <li>but I needed a good leave in conditioner that would help combat the issues from chlorine and this is not a strong enough moisturizer for that.</li>
            <li>It really makes your hair soft and feel silky.</li>
            <li>I had to use dry shampoo to absorb some of the residue until I could do a full shampoo and conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>use it on my hair whilst damp which detangles it and makes it super soft and shiny when dry.</li>
            <li>it does what it says it does, and if I am required to leave feed back that contains a certain amount of words just to submit it when 2 or 3 words work just as well</li>
            <li>I also often spray a little more on when it dries for an extra boost of shine.</li>
            <li>.it leaves my hair sooo soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my 8 year old daughters hair  as a detangler.</li>
            <li>So a quality leave-in conditioner is a must to keep my hair looking softer and not dried out.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure what kind of hair this for, but it does work well on thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Like an odd squeaky clean feeling but yet heavy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I HATE HOW GREASY IT LEAVES MY HAIR AFTER 5 MINUTES OF SPRAYING MY HAIR, SMELLS GOOD</li>
            <li> It keeps the fly-aways pulled back and out of my face all day, while keeping my hair soft instead of hard and sticky like hair spray would make it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I dont like how it feels on my hair</li>
            <li> For a leave in treatment it&#x27;s ok.  The smell is very citrus like, mostly grapefruit.  It&#x27;s just ok.  Does not do much for detangling.  I do not use it every day, only a few days a week.  Probably would not buy again as there are better products out there for my hair.</li>
            <li> Its a good product except it leaves my hair a bit sticky. Maybe I&#x27;m using too much? But great price so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not as conditioning as I had hoped for curly waist length hair that is in the pool every day.  It&#x27;s not a bad product but I needed a good leave in conditioner that would help combat the issues from chlorine and this is not a strong enough moisturizer for that.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I haven&#x27;t found anything else that leaves my hair so soft, smooth and shiny! The smell isn&#x27;t strong and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look unwashed or like there&#x27;s too much product in it. What I love the most about it is how it&#x27;s a perfect 2nd day product. It makes my hair look just as good as it did right away a wash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now.  It&#x27;s a good budget leave-in conditioner (I have curly hair, so this isn&#x27;t a step I can skip!).  Nice smell without being overpowering.  Light spray.  I gave 4 instead of 5 stars simply because it&#x27;s nothing to write home about.  Does the trick, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes to condition of my hair, etc.  Still - great price for someone that uses leave-in conditioner daily!</li>
            <li> Leaves an odd feeling on my hair. Like an odd squeaky clean feeling but yet heavy. Smell was ok and falls in line with Garnier scents.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care much for this leave in formula. Didn&#x27;t see or feel much of a difference on my hair. Not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of leave in condictioner .and none of did the trick.but this product does exactly what it say it doe. .it leaves my hair sooo soft and silky. ....will I be purchasing this again most definitely. ..</li>
            <li> I love the very light fruit fresh smell of this...far better than some products that have a distinct &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; to them.  It works.  I&#x27;ve used some different brands &amp; after trying this one, I&#x27;m sticking to it.  I picked up their glossy finish also.  For times when I want a little extra shine.</li>
            <li> Softens my beard nicely and keeps it looking good.  I use leave-in conditioner on my beard every few days, but this is a nice touch up in a rush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this item in our local stores. It keeps my hair under control without being sticky. And it smells good. Service was very quick and it arrived it great shape. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I usually love Garnier products. I find them to be very effective. This leave-in is something you should just leave. I used it on damp hair after washing and conditioning my hair. It left my hair feeling like a sticky, dirty mess. I had to use dry shampoo to absorb some of the residue until I could do a full shampoo and conditioning treatment. I will go back to my Dove products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my 8 year old daughters hair  as a detangler. I love the scent and it leaves her hair smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find it in any store in my area so I had to stock up online.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this at Walmart a few months ago to help tame my curls and fly-aways when pulling my hair back. Since then, I can&#x27;t find it at Walmart, so I bought it from Amazon. I must say, this stuff works pretty well. I use a few sprays then brush it through my hair. It keeps the fly-aways pulled back and out of my face all day, while keeping my hair soft instead of hard and sticky like hair spray would make it.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent and how it conditions and detangles long hair.  It&#x27;s a great product.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Meh.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> it does what it says it does, and if I am required to leave feed back that contains a certain amount of words just to submit it when 2 or 3 words work just as well</li>
            <li> I love this product for when my hair is especially frizzy but I want to wear it down without doing anything too fancy with it. It also smells fantastic and works well for detangling my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair.  So a quality leave-in conditioner is a must to keep my hair looking softer and not dried out.  I have had really good luck with most of Garnier&#x27;s leave-in products.  I was nervous about this one as it is a spray, and my concern was that it wouldn&#x27;t be \\&quot;enough\\&quot; to keep things under control, or that it would be oily which makes my hair, well, oily.  To my surprise, it was a perfect blend of moisture to make my happier than it&#x27;s been in a while.  Great product!  NO residue feel either!  Light, yet penetrates the hair to soften it and add definition to curls.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is prone to getting greasy. I was looking for a product that would make my hair super shiny &amp; decided to buy this after reading favorable reviews online. I am so pleased! It does not weigh my hair down or make it greasy in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my hair whilst damp which detangles it and makes it super soft and shiny when dry.

            <li> I HATE HOW GREASY IT LEAVES MY HAIR AFTER 5 MINUTES OF SPRAYING MY HAIR, SMELLS GOOD BUT DOESN&#x27;T WORK FOR MY FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really makes your hair soft and feel silky. My hair does not have a dry look anymore.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this, it my hair feels like straw.  I am not sure what kind of hair this for, but it does work well on thick hair.  I will not use this one again.</li>
            <li> not really sure if it works. i dont use this product by itself. i use it with the fall fight spray and triple nutrition spray in the morning and before i go to bed. i put it on dry hair. makes my hair smell really good though, but it doesnt last a long time. gives a nice shine and makes the hair really soft! go so many compliments</li>
            <li> Just ok. Not the greatest leave in conditioner there is but not the worse. Has too strong of a smell and feels a bit heavy/grimy on your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this for my 5yo daughters wavy/curly thin hair. this product does not condition at all. Its thin watery and and like scented water.</li>
            <li> I love this product from Garnier.  I have tried others and this one is great for daily conditioning of long hair.  It keeps your hair from tangling and it also adds some shine.  Never leaves any sticky residue.</li>
