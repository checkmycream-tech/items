            <li>Quick, Fast, Easy shipping :)</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to be super sweet all the time.</li>
            <li>super fast couldn&#x27;t believe it!!</li>
            <li>The pink and blue combo is the perfect wig for my sweet Lolita outfits.</li>
            <li>it looks amazing just like the picture it came the next day</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>I messed up the first one sitting on it.</li>
            <li>Especially for the price :)  </li>
            <li>My husband loves it as well ;)</li>
            <li>so it looks pretty real.</li>
            <li>cause still really cute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Shipping not so much, took forever..</li>
            <li>The wing really fits well for the price that your paying.</li>
            <li>but you get used to the weight fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The wing does kind of get heavy when the pigtails are added</li>
            <li>Fits good around my big noggin with a little fixing of the bangs.</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair, so I need to have two of the two piece wig caps and braided my hair under it, but they magically fit!!</li>
            <li>The pig tails are detachable, and it&#x27;s nice and thick</li>
            <li>First, the color have a little bit different with those pictures, but it&#x27;s ok,</li>
            <li>the pink matched, but the blue was more vibrant (less pastel) on the extensions compared with the wig.</li>
            <li>Much fuller and softer than I expected.</li>
            <li>The pony tails can get a little heavy but the wig is fabulous!  </li>

            <li> I bought this for lolita purposes, and it&#x27;s just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I have black shoulder length hair, and a round face.</li>
            <li> Pretty but very small!!!</li>
            <li> I thought the wig would be a waste of money</li>
            <li> The wing does not look at all fake when you put it on.</li>

            <li> Great wig and the shipping was fast! I had a lot of compliments on it throughout the entire day I wore it.</li>
            <li> Gets tangly rather easily, but it&#x27;s also very easy to get the tangles out. Hard to get the wig on at first but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. Very cute and perfect for my sweet lolita coordinate!</li>
            <li> This wig has a ton of hair and looked great with a cupcake costume. Wore this for fantasy fest in key west! Lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Could not be happier with this wig. I  bought it with the pink/blonde option, and both are beautiful. The wig caps that came with were also great. I have really thick hair, so I need to have two of the two piece wig caps and braided my hair under it, but they magically fit!!</li>
            <li> Great quality!  Great price!</li>
            <li> came out really cute, perfect for my first wig!</li>
            <li> The pink and blue combo is the perfect wig for my sweet Lolita outfits. Pig tails are clip ons so I don&#x27;t have to be super sweet all the time. Fits good around my big noggin with a little fixing of the bangs. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> I bought this for lolita purposes, and it&#x27;s just what I expected! The pig tails are detachable, and it&#x27;s nice and thick so it looks pretty real. Even without the pig tails too! I had no problems buying this, and I&#x27;m gonna buy another one for my friend!</li>
            <li> Pretty but very small!!! Seems like it would fit a child!!</li>
            <li> Wore this for halloween and got many complements on it. I love the detachable ponytails.</li>
            <li> First, the color have a little bit different with those pictures, but it&#x27;s ok, cause still really cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;second, No that length of those photos. Will shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still accept. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This wig met my expectations. It&#x27;s not shiny like cheap synthetic hair. I have black shoulder length hair, and a round face. So the wig was excellent. I use it with my Lolita clothes. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Wig is great.. Shipping not so much, took forever..</li>
            <li> I love this wig it looks amazing just like the picture it came the next day super fast couldn&#x27;t believe it!!</li>
            <li> This is an incredible wing! The wing really fits well for the price that your paying. Also the pigtails are really easy to attach and detach it is not a hassle at all. The wing does kind of get heavy when the pigtails are added but you get used to the weight fast. The wing does not look at all fake when you put it on. Also there is a lot of hair to work with.</li>
            <li> I got this wig to wear with a unicorn costume for Halloween and it was perfect! I used one of the extensions as a tail for the costume (matching mane and tail!), and saved the other extension for later in case I messed up the first one sitting on it. But the wig is very good quality, wasn&#x27;t too hot, wasn&#x27;t scratchy, and stayed put once I tightened the adjusters inside. I got a ton of compliments on my costume, and the majority of them were for the wig. It&#x27;s curled beautifully just like the photos. And I read a couple reviews that said the pink on the extensions was off compared to the wig itself, but I actually had the opposite issue- the pink matched, but the blue was more vibrant (less pastel) on the extensions compared with the wig. Not noticeable, especially since I had the extension attached to my &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; area :) but thought I&#x27;d mention it. I thought the wig would be a waste of money but I&#x27;m very glad I took a risk!</li>
            <li> Great quality ! Quick, Fast, Easy shipping :) Thanks</li>
            <li> Super cute! Delivered very quick.</li>
            <li> cute! cute! cute! just as expected for what you pay for. its a costume so i wasn&#x27;t looking for excellent quality.</li>
            <li> This wig is great for the price! It adjusts for your head size and it comes with wig caps for underneath too, myself and 2 of my friends wore them for halloween and they were fantastic!</li>
            <li> The pony tails can get a little heavy but the wig is fabulous!  Especially for the price :)  My husband loves it as well ;)</li>
            <li> GORGEOUS wig. Much fuller and softer than I expected.</li>
