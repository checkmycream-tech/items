    <ol>
            <li>awesome.  </li>
            <li>Not the best smelling product</li>
            <li>Excellent price.</li>
            <li>Happy wife Happy life!!!</li>
            <li>Good product for a great value!  </li>
            <li>but if you sleep on it, then it holds that shape too lol.</li>
            <li>Great root lift product.</li>
            <li>great product...holds your hair in place all day.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my hair, Thank you</li>
            <li>my hair comes out great using this</li>
            <li>It is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It is probably more effective for those with a thinner mane.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>great value fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love all their products.</li>
            <li>but it has a very strong scent like really strong perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, not fruity or floral like so many other hair products, but somehow more grown up.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply at roots, abd provides body without wieght.</li>
            <li>It helps give lift and body to fine hair.</li>
            <li>Best stuff around if you have fine, limp hair!  </li>
            <li>The product is in mousse form and comes out of the bottle with a fair amount of force, which makes it easy to apply it in specific areas.</li>
            <li>I experienced the same intense, relentless allergic reaction once</li>
            <li>A friend mentioned it was great for adding volume, but it weighed my hair down.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I would not purchase the Root Pump Plus again, however, I still have faith in the Sexy Hair line, so I would most definitely continue trying new products.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and this gives me so much body, more than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li>Its more like it makes your hair a little courser at the roots so that you can tease it and it will keep its shape better.  </li>
            <li>This is my one and only favorite hair mousse.</li>
            <li>Plus came just under a day after first applying it to my roots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not real fond of strong perfumy scents unless they are fruity or fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>I used it as directed - put it right near the roots of my hair and styled as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love what this does for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I love Spray and Play Harder from Big Sexy Hair, so when my ultra thick curly hair needed some lift on top, the obvious choice seemed to be their Root Pump</li>
            <li>I have to shake the bottle for a while, then spray from like an arms length away, but it coats my roots nicely when my hair is wet or dry and gives me some volume and shape throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Although, this product works well as a root lift and I will keep using it until I find another product that works well and smells less like cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>I wear  a light natural essence perfume almost daily, but I just dont like this  heavy, perfume scents</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might work better for short hair, but my aunt has very short hair and disliked it, too.</li>
            <li>I have very thin fine hair that loves to lay flat on my head, this spray helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that is normal in thickness - not fine, not thick.</li>

            <li> Does wonders for my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> While it did provide some lift, I suppose my hair is simply too heavy because it didn&#x27;t provide enough volume to justify the price.</li>
            <li> Be careful to get the big spray nozzle, not the small white one.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling heavy and dry.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it only on my roots, then applied my other usual products and dried my hair with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> It volumizes my thin hair sky high without making it rock hard.</li>
            <li> This product is just as reliable as it has been in the past!</li>
            <li> I purchased Root Pump after cutting my very long hair into a shoulder sweeping bob.  </li>
            <li> but it could be worse.</li>
            <li> My hair felt heavy and dirty immediately after using this product.</li>
            <li> My scalp itched so badly, it hurt to scratch.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the worst hair styling product I have ever used.</li>

            <li> great value fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Happy wife Happy life!!!</li>
            <li> awesome.  I have the thickest, heaviest hair there could be, and this stuff is the boss of it.</li>
            <li> its alright.  I feel like you have to be a stylist to know how to use this properly.  It does create volume all by itself.  Its more like it makes your hair a little courser at the roots so that you can tease it and it will keep its shape better.  but if you sleep on it, then it holds that shape too lol.</li>
            <li> Great root lift product.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. Easy to apply at roots, abd provides body without wieght. Can even make a second day!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I would do without this stuff.  My hair is very fine and this gives me so much body, more than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I have NEVER put product in my hair and decided to try this because my sister uses it and my hair is getting flatter all the time.  It is amazing!  My husband comments on my &#x27;big&amp;#34; hair everytime I wear it.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> This is my one and only favorite hair mousse. It volumizes my thin hair sky high without making it rock hard. Not the best smelling product but it could be worse. Also the spray lever was a bit stiff on the particular bottle I received. Other than that it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Good product for a great value!  Works as it should. Be careful to get the big spray nozzle, not the small white one.</li>
            <li> I love this but it has a very strong scent like really strong perfume. I&#x27;m not real fond of strong perfumy scents unless they are fruity or fresh smelling.

            <li> I love Spray and Play Harder from Big Sexy Hair, so when my ultra thick curly hair needed some lift on top, the obvious choice seemed to be their Root Pump Plus. It smells wonderful, not fruity or floral like so many other hair products, but somehow more grown up. The product is in mousse form and comes out of the bottle with a fair amount of force, which makes it easy to apply it in specific areas. I sprayed it only on my roots, then applied my other usual products and dried my hair with a diffuser. While it did provide some lift, I suppose my hair is simply too heavy because it didn&#x27;t provide enough volume to justify the price. It is probably more effective for those with a thinner mane.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with the Root Pump Plus came just under a day after first applying it to my roots. Uncontrollable itching. My scalp itched so badly, it hurt to scratch. I had to shampoo my hair as soon as I got home from work, which I usually only do twice per week (it&#x27;s a curly girl thing). A week later, I decided to give it a second chance to no avail. I experienced the same intense, relentless allergic reaction once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I would not purchase the Root Pump Plus again, however, I still have faith in the Sexy Hair line, so I would most definitely continue trying new products.</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Best stuff around if you have fine, limp hair!  Just wish they made this in a travel size, kinda big to put in your luggage.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and find it definitely as advertised.  It helps give lift and body to fine hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  Does wonders for my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> Definitely gives your hair a lift.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair that loves to lay flat on my head, this spray helps tremendously. I have to shake the bottle for a while, then spray from like an arms length away, but it coats my roots nicely when my hair is wet or dry and gives me some volume and shape throughout the day.</li>
            <li> great product...holds your hair in place all day.  I don&#x27;t know how I would style my hair without it.  Love all their products.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling heavy and dry.  I purchased Root Pump after cutting my very long hair into a shoulder sweeping bob.  A friend mentioned it was great for adding volume, but it weighed my hair down.  I followed the directions and used it sparingly.  It also smelled rancid.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair, Thank you</li>
            <li> This product is just as reliable as it has been in the past!</li>
            <li> my hair comes out great using this</li>
