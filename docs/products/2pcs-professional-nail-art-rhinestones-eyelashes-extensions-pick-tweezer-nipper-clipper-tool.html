            <li>They&#x27;re great for picking up and placing the rhinestones.</li>
            <li>Great for picking up rhinestones.</li>
            <li>This was a great buy and a good price.</li>
            <li>These craft tweezers are made well and fairly sturdy.</li>
            <li>Plus the price is fair.</li>
            <li>Great for all of those detailed type of work.  </li>
            <li>Really nice, they grip well, and came before estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>I love the way they are easy to use and handy.</li>
            <li>think i will have to wait one more month.</li>
            <li>However, the package it came in had a tear at the top and the tweezers fell out when I received it.</li>
            <li>in fact I think they work better than any tweezers I have ever owned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I use them for most anything you could want or need to use tweezers on.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Although the tweezers received were in good condition and came within a reasonable time-frame</li>
            <li>So quick and easy!</li>
            <li>Sharp and great use for the price!</li>
            <li>They have a tiny pin of a head which is great because it allows for more targeted tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li>And the narrow point tweezers are perfect for applying permanent lashes.</li>
            <li>They are pointy sharp, no a toy for sure, but that is what makes them so good.  </li>
            <li>This product is only good for lash removal.</li>
            <li>I just got lucky that it didn&#x27;t fall out during the shipment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get a lot more uses out of them, I love them and can&#x27;t believe I got 2 for less that $2.</li>
            <li>They also help you to position them quickly.</li>
            <li>This works great for picking up those small nail art designs.</li>
            <li>The work with tiny gemstone placement and are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>These arrived promptly and so far they are lasting in sharpness and are in good quality.</li>
            <li>It makes things so much easier!</li>
            <li>i have not reveived them yet, i have almosto forgetten that take so long more than a month.i</li>
            <li>Really like these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>You can see the smooth side (which should be on the outside) is on the inside on one piece and the grooved &amp;#34;gripping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>far they seem pretty sturdy</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>They are sharp at the point and make picking up nail art decorations  easy.  </li>
            <li>Just needed new ones since my older ones are about at the end of their tenure.</li>
            <li>I know there are easy workarounds for some of those, but at the price these tweezers cost it&#x27;s not necessary to have multiple tools.</li>
            <li>They did not hold an eyelash, plus the black coating on them give off a strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li>I use these for lash extentions, I really liked that they are slightly weighted but wish the straight point was a little longer.</li>
            <li>Complete junk.</li>
            <li>i ordered two sets and the tip of the tweezers aren&#x27;t even straight, they were crooked</li>

            <li> they are a little bit bigger than i imagine</li>
            <li> They were old, looked weathered and use, extremely dull.</li>

            <li> These craft tweezers are made well and fairly sturdy. I use them to grab vinyl nail decals and other crafts.</li>
            <li> Really nice, they grip well, and came before estimated delivery date. The edge where the black meets the silver is a little rough, but I filed it with a metal file so it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li> I am using these for scrapbooking!  Great for all of those detailed type of work.  Just needed new ones since my older ones are about at the end of their tenure.</li>
            <li> Great quality the price was a perfect match also.  I love the way they are easy to use and handy.</li>
            <li> i have not reveived them yet, i have almosto forgetten that take so long more than a month.i think i will have to wait one more month.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help me pick up glitter pieces for my nail art and it works will. However, the package it came in had a tear at the top and the tweezers fell out when I received it. I just got lucky that it didn&#x27;t fall out during the shipment.</li>
            <li> use for eyelash extension works great</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing trying to apply rhinestones, appliques, foils, etc to nails before using the bent tweezer. It makes things so much easier! I know there are easy workarounds for some of those, but at the price these tweezers cost it&#x27;s not necessary to have multiple tools. And the narrow point tweezers are perfect for applying permanent lashes.</li>
            <li> Received this product to do lashes. You can&#x27;t even pick up anything with them. Don&#x27;t waste your money. They won&#x27;t even touch each other ðŸ˜¥</li>
            <li> I bought these to glue rhinestones to things and they work perfectly. They&#x27;re great for picking up and placing the rhinestones. I&#x27;ve also used them for putting on my false eyelashes. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get a lot more uses out of them, I love them and can&#x27;t believe I got 2 for less that $2. They also arrived at my house in a little over a week.</li>
            <li> These are not your typical tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in fact I think they work better than any tweezers I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them to use for putting on gems on nails. But I use them for most anything you could want or need to use tweezers on. I use for eyebrows and everything under the sun. They have a tiny pin of a head which is great because it allows for more targeted tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far they seem pretty sturdy too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars! Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought these to help me grab my stones and fimo slices.  They were as described and work rather well.  They are sharp at the point and make picking up nail art decorations  easy.  Would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Really like these tweezers.  I use them for crafting.  They are pointy sharp, no a toy for sure, but that is what makes them so good.  The work with tiny gemstone placement and are easy to clean.  Plus the price is fair.</li>
            <li> They were old, looked weathered and use, extremely dull. Complete junk.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s excellent. Very pleased!!!!!</li>
            <li> poor quality. i ordered two sets and the tip of the tweezers aren&#x27;t even straight, they were crooked so it cannot be used for anything but to pick out junk.</li>
            <li> Although the tweezers received were in good condition and came within a reasonable time-frame, I was very disappointed that I received two of the type of tweezer (curved) I didn&#x27;t want. I specifically ordered this set for the straight tweezer....and am not sure why I received two of the same type.</li>
            <li> So quick and easy! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and well made.  These arrived promptly and so far they are lasting in sharpness and are in good quality.</li>
            <li> Came to me within a month. Sharp and great use for the price!</li>
            <li> Great for picking up rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Arrived in just a couple of weeks and product is made well. Very happy with both!</li>
            <li> I have to wait a month but the product is perfect and it came well packaged.  they are a little bit bigger than i imagine but the tip is very thin.</li>
            <li> This works great for picking up those small nail art designs. They also help you to position them quickly. This was a great buy and a good price.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware, the angled tweezers did not function correctly and upon closer inspection I realized they were assembled wrong.  Instead of part A and part B being welded together, I got 2 part A&#x27;s.  You can see the smooth side (which should be on the outside) is on the inside on one piece and the grooved &amp;#34;gripping&amp;#34; part (which should be on the inside) is facing outward.  They are junk.</li>
            <li> This product is only good for lash removal. Its wight is too heavy for application.</li>
            <li> They did not hold an eyelash, plus the black coating on them give off a strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li> I use these for lash extentions, I really liked that they are slightly weighted but wish the straight point was a little longer.</li>
