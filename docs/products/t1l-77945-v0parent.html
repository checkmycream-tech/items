            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>but it is a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not sticky at all and so perfect under your day cream.</li>
            <li>All good traits for an eye serum.</li>
            <li>After reading so many great things about this product, I have to say I&#x27;m a bit underwhelmed.</li>
            <li>It contains three ingredients, hyaluronic acid, vitamin C and caffeine, that are particularly effective for the under eye area.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best eye serum out on the market.</li>
            <li>but I feel realy nice.</li>
            <li>This is very nice and soothing, I like all of their products I&#x27;ve tried so far, many to go!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a creamy gel in consistency.</li>
            <li>Just OK.</li>
            <li>I used to use Arbonne and love this even more.</li>
            <li>I use all the brightening line from Andalou and love them.</li>
            <li>It is like a gel and feels good going on, it is not heavy or sticky and absorbs very easily.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this (since it&#x27;s cruelty free and has a good EWG score).</li>
            <li>Good ingredients but haven t seen much brightening yet or depuffing .</li>
            <li>Has a light citrus scent.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably best for normal to slightly dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be reducing fine wrinkles and is very soothing as well.</li>
            <li>I also tried their night cream and had the same kind of results.</li>
            <li>Wake in the morning with a fresh feel around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the entire line.  </li>
            <li>First, ignore the claims about plant stem cells.  </li>
            <li>Try for the first time , nothing chang yet</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried the eye serum.</li>
            <li>I have bought other products from Andalou and liked them</li>
            <li>This is better than the most expensive brand available.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I can critique so far is that all the Andalou products have a very strong scent.</li>
            <li>My absolute favourite when it comes to eye cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fruity, but is too much for my face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so I really hoped this would work out</li>
            <li>Really helps with puffiness.</li>
            <li>and it has some very beneficial ingredients.</li>
            <li>When I wore it under makeup, it was unfortunately very drying and flakey.</li>
            <li>This is a thin gel-like eye serum that goes on nice and cool.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to improve the appearance of the eye area.</li>
            <li>It is nothing special and is not moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li>It is natural yet works as effectively as the most expensive brands with toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I like to use this in the warmer months and something a little more emollient in the winter.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say anything for the product yet, it won&#x27;t give miracles without use of other strong products (glycolic acid, retinol, etc)...</li>
            <li>Andalou naturals Luminous Eye Serum has not only brightened, but has depuffed the huge bag under my left eye and has reduced the darkness under both eyes.</li>
            <li>I am almost 61 years old and when you wake with no wrinkles, it counts!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of other gels and I like this one because it does not have a fragrance and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It does sooth and does not irritate my sensitive and allergy prone eyes</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients that don&#x27;t cause rashes or allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>But I would expect the treated eye to look less dry and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>The first night I got it, I put some under one eye and nothing under the other eye because I wanted to compare in the morning.</li>
            <li>So far, this product is totally non-irritating to my eye area, smells like nothing, and feels invisible.</li>

            <li> useful but a bit expensive!</li>

            <li> I have used another brand which is hypoallergenic for years but was trying to save a little money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just dabbing on plain castor or coconut oil over it for hydration.</li>

            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> but no irritation and you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the ingredients they&#x27;ve packed in here.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy again but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> My absolute favourite when it comes to eye cream. It&#x27;s light and not sticky at all and so perfect under your day cream.</li>
            <li> Good ingredients but haven t seen much brightening yet or depuffing . It does sooth and does not irritate my sensitive and allergy prone eyes</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a significant difference. I do like the feel of it. The only thing that I can critique so far is that all the Andalou products have a very strong scent. It&#x27;s very fruity, but is too much for my face.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Andalou is my go to brand and this did not disappoint. It&#x27;s more of a creamy gel in consistency. Has a light citrus scent. Brightens and tightens. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This product is not for me. Left me with swollen eyes and a rash everywhere I put the cream. I couldn&#x27;t even bear to try it again because my skin looked and felt burnt after using just once. Not what I expected from an all natural product line. I also tried their night cream and had the same kind of results. Guess this line is not for me. --update-- if you order through Nutricity they will not give you a refund even if you have a bad reaction. If you want to try this product, buy through someone else who stands behind what they sell.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. It is natural yet works as effectively as the most expensive brands with toxic ingredients. It is non-greasy and melts right into the delicate undereye area. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great gel eye cream to help reduce puffiness.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of other gels and I like this one because it does not have a fragrance and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Well I was going to give it one star but that&#x27;s &amp;#34;I hate it.&amp;#34; 2 stars is &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it.&amp;#34; (according to Amazon). I found this product irritating to my eyes and drying and if anything my dark circles looked worse after using it. I have bought other products from Andalou and liked them so I really hoped this would work out but it didn&#x27;t. I have used another brand which is hypoallergenic for years but was trying to save a little money. Fail.</li>
            <li> Just OK. I did not notice any difference.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve tried others and keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li> Soothing and illuminating</li>
            <li> Love this product and the entire line.  My skin loves it too! Natural ingredients that don&#x27;t cause rashes or allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> Really helps with puffiness.</li>
            <li> This is very nice and soothing, I like all of their products I&#x27;ve tried so far, many to go!  I don&#x27;t know if it helped my black under-eye issue.  But otherwise, I recommend.  All of their products are well-made!</li>
            <li> Wake in the morning with a fresh feel around my eyes. I am almost 61 years old and when you wake with no wrinkles, it counts!</li>
            <li> Great product. Not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> This is perfect!  I used to use Arbonne and love this even more.</li>
            <li> First, ignore the claims about plant stem cells.  A plant stem cell can&#x27;t regenerate human skin cells or any other cell in the body, that said,&lt;br /&gt;Luminous Eye Serum is an excellent moisturizer for the eye area . It contains three ingredients, hyaluronic acid, vitamin C and caffeine, that are particularly effective for the under eye area. .&lt;br /&gt;Probably best for normal to slightly dry skin.  I like to use this in the warmer months and something a little more emollient in the winter.</li>
            <li> So far, this product is totally non-irritating to my eye area, smells like nothing, and feels invisible. All good traits for an eye serum. Seems to be reducing fine wrinkles and is very soothing as well. A keeper.</li>
            <li> useful but a bit expensive!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best eye serum out on the market. This is better than the most expensive brand available. It has worked in less than 2 weeks for me. Andalou naturals Luminous Eye Serum has not only brightened, but has depuffed the huge bag under my left eye and has reduced the darkness under both eyes. Thank you Andalou Naturals!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this (since it&#x27;s cruelty free and has a good EWG score). The first night I got it, I put some under one eye and nothing under the other eye because I wanted to compare in the morning. Obviously, I wouldn&#x27;t expect lines or circles to disappear overnight. But I would expect the treated eye to look less dry and more hydrated. Unfortunately, it looked EXACTLY the same as the untreated eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I&#x27;ve decided to keep using it since I spent money on it. I&#x27;m just dabbing on plain castor or coconut oil over it for hydration. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m still not seeing any change in my under eye circles or bumps. It may reduce puffiness a little, but that&#x27;s it so far. Will update review if anything improves. If not, I will try a different product next time.</li>
            <li> Try for the first time , nothing chang yet but I feel realy nice.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and great service!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried the eye serum. I use all the brightening line from Andalou and love them. This is no exception. It is like a gel and feels good going on, it is not heavy or sticky and absorbs very easily. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to improve the appearance of the eye area. It will now be my regular eye serum.</li>
            <li> This is a thin gel-like eye serum that goes on nice and cool. It isn&#x27;t sticky at all and it has some very beneficial ingredients. Comes in a tube and I have had no problems with packaging. Can&#x27;t say anything for the product yet, it won&#x27;t give miracles without use of other strong products (glycolic acid, retinol, etc)...but no irritation and you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the ingredients they&#x27;ve packed in here.</li>
            <li> After reading so many great things about this product, I have to say I&#x27;m a bit underwhelmed. It is nothing special and is not moisturizing enough. After wearing it overnight, I woke up with puffy, dry eyes. When I wore it under makeup, it was unfortunately very drying and flakey. Also made my eyes water, which I read it is not supposed to do.</li>
