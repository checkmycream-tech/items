            <li>Prego brushes are wonderful; I have four of them.</li>

            <li>Great value,</li>
            <li>This brush does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Great brushes and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing!  </li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
            <li>This one is a good diameter size, but the bristles don&#x27;t grab my hair well.</li>
            <li>The shipping from this seller was very fast and I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great results.</li>
            <li>This brush allowes the air to flow through nicely.  </li>
            <li>a chin length bob and this brush (3\\&quot; diameter) gives it a nice turned in bottom (without it being TOO flipped under).</li>
            <li>And my hair has never gotten caught in it; it always releases really nicely.</li>
            <li>This is a very good quality, light weight durable hairbrush perfect for getting my very curly hair straight and smooth!  </li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>it will give me a nice shiny, smooth, and fully of bounce whispy curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon had this brush.</li>
            <li>Like I said it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite brushes</li>
            <li>Love, love , love these brushes.</li>
            <li>This one was great and for a decent price.</li>
            <li>It is light and very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Best proffessional brush to use with blow dryer once your hair is about 75% dry for desired effect.</li>
            <li>The brush is also really light.  </li>
            <li>I have the same brush in a 3 inch diameter, and that one works great.</li>
            <li>Great brush for blowouts for long hair.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>She obviously loves the brush and I was the hero who was able to locate her favorite brush.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth and straight with just a touch of under curl on the ends how I like it.</li>
            <li>It gives it a nice big curl.  </li>
            <li>I FINALLY found a brush that makes my hair look nice while blow drying.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s warm enough to give me all day volume and bounce and doesn&#x27;t catch/tangle at all.</li>
            <li>High quality, smooth in the hair.</li>
            <li>Some places charge much more for the same quality.</li>
            <li>My wife was looking for a replacement to this exact brush.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve owned though</li>
            <li>Seemed to work well at first</li>
            <li>I use this brush along with a pro tourmaline hairdryer and it does exactly what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair seems to dry quickly, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for my long (upper-mid back length) hair.  </li>
            <li>I have spent 3x this on round brushes at the salon and have not been impressed.</li>
            <li>then I expected but still works ok for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stock up on a few different sizes since they are such a great price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: I would recommend this brush (3 inch) to anyone with longer hair who wants a blown-out, frizz-free style.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>This round brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have bought many of these type of styling brushes and they just do not last very long and are not as well made.  </li>
            <li>They help by smoothing the hair and since they are vented help to dry the hair quickly too.</li>
            <li>This brush helps to cut that time down to 20 minutes and leaves my hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>However, when the product arrived it was the original colors i could have ordered anywhere else for a lot less.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like it.</li>
            <li>hair is completely frizz</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, only I should have gotten a slightly smaller size for my bangs.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering other sizes very soon.  </li>
            <li>(a common problem with similar brushes of different brands).&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s light weight.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I wish the bristles were longer, but they seem to do the job straightening my hair.  The handle sucks, though.  My hair gets caught between the barrel and the spongy handle all of the time.  It&#x27;s very annoying - not to mention sometimes painful.</li>
            <li> Best proffessional brush to use with blow dryer once your hair is about 75% dry for desired effect. Makes my hair smooth and straight with just a touch of under curl on the ends how I like it. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I have the 270 and it was just too small This one was great and for a decent price. My daugther uses it too and loves it. Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the brush. After a few uses, you can see the bristles bend/soften up/ get weaker...though it still works the same when I use it now as it did at the start. For the money, it&#x27;s a good brush. Some places charge much more for the same quality.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  Just as reviewed and expected.</li>
            <li> Just as described. I love it! Great brush for blowouts for long hair. High quality, smooth in the hair. Great value,</li>
            <li> This brush does a great job.  It usually takes me 30 minutes to blow dry my hair because my hair is so thick.  This brush helps to cut that time down to 20 minutes and leaves my hair smooth.  I have medium length hair (past my shoulders) with long layers.  If I curl my hair under and in sections while blow drying, then run my fingers throw it with a tiny bit of Textureline from Artec it will give me a nice shiny, smooth, and fully of bounce whispy curls.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, only I should have gotten a slightly smaller size for my bangs. Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> This brush was a little bigger then I expected but still works ok for me. I like it and will order another smaller one. It helps my hair dry faster while blow drying. Great brushes and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> the plastic at the head of the barrel broke rendering it useless a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon had this brush. My wife was looking for a replacement to this exact brush. She obviously loves the brush and I was the hero who was able to locate her favorite brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, it&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve owned though so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  My hair seems to dry quickly, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for my long (upper-mid back length) hair.  It gives it a nice big curl.  The brush is also really light.  My hair gets kinda frizzy, but that could just be due to my drying technique.  Overall I really like it.</li>
            <li> i specifically ordered through this vendor because they offered a color i had not seen anywhere else. However, when the product arrived it was the original colors i could have ordered anywhere else for a lot less. False advertisement!!</li>
            <li> Prego brushes are wonderful; I have four of them. This one is a good diameter size, but the bristles don&#x27;t grab my hair well. I have the same brush in a 3 inch diameter, and that one works great. Like I said it&#x27;s just ok.</li>

            <li> Love, love , love these brushes. They help by smoothing the hair and since they are vented help to dry the hair quickly too. My go to brush.</li>
            <li> I FINALLY found a brush that makes my hair look nice while blow drying. I have a chin length bob and this brush (3\\&quot; diameter) gives it a nice turned in bottom (without it being TOO flipped under). And my hair has never gotten caught in it; it always releases really nicely.</li>
