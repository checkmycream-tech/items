            <li>My husbands favorite.  </li>
            <li>Macy&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t sell the after shave by itself, so this was great to find.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping, thanks.</li>
            <li>love the smell and feel of the aftershave.  </li>

            <li>He prefers the after shave balm to after shave and cologne because it is more soothing to his face after he shaves.</li>
            <li>Comfortable on your face.</li>
            <li>Not the original Drakkar Noir but an acceptable replacement.</li>
            <li>I prefer the original container shape.</li>
            <li>excellent merchandise was just what I expected thanks for good quality and service will order them again very soon thanks a lot</li>
            <li>My Dad loved his Christmas present.  </li>
            <li>So anyway, this is an OK after shave balm, but it should be much thicker.</li>
            <li>Drakkar Noir Aftershave Balm brings a refreshing vibrant feel of protection after my morning shave; occasionally, I remember a recent visit to Paris and the delightful food, parks, and art</li>
            <li>Delivered exactly as expected-perfectly!</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it as a single item through Amazon and ordered it immediately!</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this product (and I love the fragrance), as it is much kinder to the skin after shaving than the alcohol-based products.  </li>
            <li>It was the right item</li>
            <li>Right brand.  </li>
            <li>Item purchased was as advertised; prompt delivery; quality expected and great value compared to normal retail outlet</li>
            <li>Very nice product, very heavy scent.</li>
            <li>I first used Drakkar Noir before you were born when you had to buy it in France.</li>
            <li>Kept it only because my husband said it would be OK</li>
            <li>and he really needed it.</li>
            <li>To me it really isn&#x27;t anything like the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Drakkar.</li>
            <li>Very soothing to skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is a nice size that will last him a long time.</li>
            <li>Product feels more slimy than a typical aftershave or lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love Drakkar Noir, but this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Ok guys I&#x27;m sorry to inform you that I have tried the original and tried one</li>
            <li>This is a little more &#x27;runny&#x27; than I&#x27;d like; however, the fragrance works well for me personally.</li>
            <li>You definitely do not need that much of it.</li>
            <li>I get a whole set of this Drakkar Noir (aftershave, underarm, au de toilet) from Macy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it came  as expected, it was the correct size,package clean and neat ,product was as expected,</li>
            <li>Yea, I finally found a balm I could feel complete after a close shave using the Drakkar&#x27;s balm -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He loves this aftershave but never wants to commit to buying a whole set just for this item.</li>
            <li>Too bad the local department stores do not carry this great smelling facial balm.</li>

            <li> Too bad the local department stores do not carry this great smelling facial balm.</li>
            <li> but just too thin as the original after shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too disappointed good enough for me</li>
            <li> In the past few years, we&#x27;ve found that in the department stores and such, it is only available in a gift box with various other Drakkar Noir products--rather than as a single item.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for years and will continue as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> I feel this aftershave is not the same as the one I have had (empty now).  </li>
            <li> Too watery ... Have to be careful when tipping this up to get some out as its almost like water .</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a total waste!</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is something that should be considered by other buyer&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Was a lil bit watered down j a lil bit nothing too extreme like 10-</li>
            <li> Get the regular after shave, it smells like Drakkar, but it is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Even though thats what the pic shows, when I received it it was a small tube of balm.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find aftershave anymore.</li>
            <li> Not happy about that.  </li>
            <li> It is an disappointing, and think it is not genuine product.</li>
            <li> Wrong stuff.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Not to say it&#x27;s terrible</li>

            <li> Ok fragrance.  Product feels more slimy than a typical aftershave or lotion.  Doesn&#x27;t moisturize well.</li>
            <li> Drakkar Noir Aftershave Balm brings a refreshing vibrant feel of protection after my morning shave; occasionally, I remember a recent visit to Paris and the delightful food, parks, and art I experienced there.</li>
            <li> Comfortable on your face.</li>
            <li> Too watery ... Have to be careful when tipping this up to get some out as its almost like water . Still smells okay but just too thin as the original after shave I use to buy.</li>
            <li> My Dad loved his Christmas present.  It is hard to find aftershave anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Drakkar Noir Balm for over twenty years.  It&#x27;s scent is not over powering and is good for and feels good on my face.  I use it with the spray cologne under my clothing; this way my cologne is not over powering, but nice for those you let close to you.</li>
            <li> I first used Drakkar Noir before you were born when you had to buy it in France. So anyway, this is an OK after shave balm, but it should be much thicker. It&#x27;s too runny.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the balm in a bottle this is not for you! Even though thats what the pic shows, when I received it it was a small tube of balm. I have always gotten the balm for my husband &amp; it&#x27;s always come in the bottle. Not sure if it&#x27;s been repackaged but the picture is VERY deceiving! Kept it only because my husband said it would be OK and he really needed it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the fragrance and how it makes his skin feel.</li>
            <li> This aftershave lotion smells similar to Drakkar but is different to me. You definitely do not need that much of it. A little goes a long way. Still a good buy though.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product (and I love the fragrance), as it is much kinder to the skin after shaving than the alcohol-based products.  In the past few years, we&#x27;ve found that in the department stores and such, it is only available in a gift box with various other Drakkar Noir products--rather than as a single item.

            <li> This product is the greatest as far as I am concerned. Have been using it for years and will continue as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> Delivered exactly as expected-perfectly!</li>
            <li> The picture shows a bottle and that&#x27;s what I thought I was ordering but I received a tube.  Not happy about that.  I needed it urgently so did not bother complaining (earlier) or returning.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite.  Too bad the local department stores do not carry this great smelling facial balm.</li>
            <li> Good after shave conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not the original Drakkar Noir but an acceptable replacement. Has a soothing feeling after you shave and a nice aroma.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Leaves face feeling good and cool.</li>
            <li> it came  as expected, it was the correct size,package clean and neat ,product was as expected,good value for the cash,nice job</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the smell of Drakkar&#x27;s aftershave to its cologne. But, what I received has no odor at all. You pays your money, you takes your chances.</li>
            <li> Nice aftershave balm, smells great. Great product for the price. Would order again, a nice supplement to the cologne after shaving.</li>
            <li> very good, and a good price.</li>
            <li> excellent merchandise was just what I expected thanks for good quality and service will order them again very soon thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Yea, I finally found a balm I could feel complete after a close shave using the Drakkar&#x27;s balm -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I chose this item (balm) was because there isn&#x27;t an after-shave lotion in this brand - The Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drakkar had discontinued making the after-shave lotion along while ago but produced this Balm that is a close use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of the discontinued after-lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To discover that Amazon.com would be selling this product and at a good price too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Item purchased was as advertised; prompt delivery; quality expected and great value compared to normal retail outlet</li>
            <li> Women love it so do I!</li>
            <li> This product has no smell what ever. No soothing effect that I could feel. It is a total waste! I love Drakkar Noir, but this is a waste of money. Get the regular after shave, it smells like Drakkar, but it is hard to find. I will never buy the balm again!!!</li>
            <li> Have been a big fan of the Drakkar scent for years but the formula or quality of the ingredients seems to have changed. To me it really isn&#x27;t anything like the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Drakkar. Not to say it&#x27;s terrible just that it&#x27;s now an &amp;#34;also ran&amp;#34; among all the others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 20+ years.  I prefer the original container shape.</li>
            <li> Drakkar is a very nice cologne. This aftershave balm works perfectly. It hydrates my skin and has a nice smell. GREAT!</li>
            <li> Have used for years.  The only one that my wife likes......</li>
            <li> Macy&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t sell the after shave by itself, so this was great to find.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping, thanks.</li>
            <li> I feel this aftershave is not the same as the one I have had (empty now).  I get a whole set of this Drakkar Noir (aftershave, underarm, au de toilet) from Macy.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and feel of the aftershave.  When my aftershave is out, I look and order this from Amazon.  It is an disappointing, and think it is not genuine product.</li>
            <li> Love it and love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Ok guys I&#x27;m sorry to inform you that I have tried the original and tried one that an oganizstion sold on Amazon and the org. Was a lil bit watered down j a lil bit nothing too extreme like 10-15percent I&#x27;m not too disappointed good enough for me</li>
            <li> Very soothing to skin after shaving.  No burning like some aftershaves.  And the women like the scent !</li>
            <li> The shaving balm works well and has the great Drakkar scent.</li>
            <li> It was the right item but I thought it would  come  in a bottle, it  came in a  tube.  No problems though.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, very heavy scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost twenty years and like it.  I do however have one concern about it though.  The product is never sealed so you have no way of knowing if it has been tampered with.  When I buy it in a set, the pkg will always be sealed so I am not worried about it.  Perhaps this is something that should be considered by other buyer&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Product came on time and as advertised.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  My husband using this after he shaves and he smells great and he loves the product.</li>
            <li> good product and it arrived on time</li>
            <li> Drakkar Noir always works for me.  This is a little more &#x27;runny&#x27; than I&#x27;d like; however, the fragrance works well for me personally.</li>
            <li> been using for 30 yrs</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get what the picture showed.  Thought I was ordering aftershave.  Received a tube of something to rub on.  Right brand.  Wrong stuff.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> I always wear this. My wife loves it. Thanks for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Got this for my Husband at Christmas time. He loves this aftershave but never wants to commit to buying a whole set just for this item. It is a nice size that will last him a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband.  This is his every work day scent.  Very nice, not too overpowering.  He prefers the after shave balm to after shave and cologne because it is more soothing to his face after he shaves.</li>
