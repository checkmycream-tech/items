    <ol>
            <li>All in all a very good buy that gets the job done with distinction!</li>
            <li>The best shaver that I had ever had.</li>
            <li>Great Shaver!!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with comfort, noise, charging, and cleaning.  </li>

            <li>I am very happy with it and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a problem with the screen and Amazon took care immediately, great customer service!</li>
            <li>The best one they&#x27;ve made!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this razor on a Friday and received it on a Saturday (great service, Amazon!).  </li>

            <li>Excellent battery life, charges rapidly.  </li>
            <li>He said the razor part was great!</li>
            <li>Love it!!!!</li>
            <li>Best of all, if it needs charged, it will still function when plugged in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Provides excellent shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver does a real nice job.  </li>
            <li>Excellent battery life, a good 16-18 month cutter blade and foil life.</li>
            <li>Great razor.</li>
            <li>and they are great</li>
            <li>did do a great job on the hair it did get, if you don&#x27;t mind having to use a razor also for the strays.</li>
            <li>great.  </li>
            <li>The trim is great.</li>
            <li>It has a great slide up sideburn trimmer instead of a pop out trimmer.</li>
            <li>had purchased a foil/cutter replacement pack when I bought the shaver, and I&#x27;m glad I did!!  </li>
            <li>I get a very good shave and have had no problums of any kind.</li>
            <li>Great price, good close shave.  </li>
            <li>This is a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>this is definitive good product.</li>
            <li>It does its job surprisingly well</li>
            <li>(see reviews) - just a good shave.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good electric shaver the Remington is not it.</li>
            <li>Shaver works well- good and close.</li>
            <li>Seems to hold a good charge, too.&lt;br /&gt;Who</li>
            <li>I own one of these shavers and have been happy with the performance.</li>
            <li>He loved it.</li>
            <li>I used it about 15 times and never got a good shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get a good close shave.</li>
            <li>The body does not even have rubberized grips on the side for good handling.</li>
            <li>It seems to be well made, holds a good charge, and feels well balanced in the hand.</li>
            <li>If I shave every day it does fairly well but takes longer than it should.</li>
            <li>I got a excellent price with free shipping at Amazon.</li>
            <li>The service was excellent and the product arrived quickly in the sealed original&lt;</li>
            <li>this is a great shave, as for the foils on most shavers dnt press it on your face</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My favorite!  </li>
            <li>Well made, easy to use and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Amazing for a &lt;$40 razor - no linear motors, 5 track heads, and so on.  </li>
            <li>Excellent shaver, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>After shaving it looked liked</li>
            <li>This is the best product in any concievable category in my whole life that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>This is a Great Product I love this shaver as the replacement for my Norelco razor of 17 or more years</li>
            <li>because I liked the close aggressive shave.</li>
            <li>He has always liked the Remington shavers.</li>
            <li>This new Remington is lightweight and provides an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>He always had this brand of shaver &amp; he is very happy with his new gift.</li>
            <li>I would have, however, paid a bit more if a carrying case of some kind (for travel/packing) was part of the deal.  </li>
            <li>but right now I am a happy camper.</li>
            <li>quick delivery for a good price</li>
            <li>I was able to use this shaver every morning for just over two weeks before having to give it a charge.</li>
            <li>The worn out Norelco does a much better job</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied and think this model is an improvement.</li>
            <li>After using for a couple of months it never got any better.</li>
            <li>I have purchased another shaver about 3 times the cost of this one and it is night and day better.</li>
            <li>It is light and a nice shape to hold.</li>
            <li>My third Remington and the best of all.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for one of the most dear men in my life.  </li>
            <li>I have used Remington brand shavers for more than 25+ years.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I would gladly recommend it.</li>
            <li>have just ordered a Braun 320s-4 from Amazon hoping it will be much better.</li>
            <li>Better than with my Braun.</li>
            <li>What would make it even better, I thought, would be a pivoting head (which the Braun has) for better maneuverability.</li>
            <li>/&gt;with the better handling and maneuverability of the pivot and flex technology.</li>
            <li>The better maneuverability of the pivoting head is cancelled out, for me, by the length</li>
            <li>I was pleased when it arrived</li>
            <li>Better than the Braun from that stand point.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>5 more words required</li>
            <li>My husband is enjoying his Remington Pivot --he</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The shave is good too, although I only use it to shave my mustache area and use a manual razor to shave the rest, but for me, I am worried about durability and after much trial and error, I have found the Remington Men&#x27;s electric shaver to work the best for me.</li>
            <li>Recharging unit is easy and charge lasts through many shaves.</li>
            <li>He uses it most of the time and says for the money it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Yes a better, closer, and every bit comfortable - no hair pulling - shave.  </li>
            <li>Despite initial frustration the ways described above, I am very happy with this shaver; it does a great job.</li>
            <li>It has a nice heft, and I really like being able to rinse it with water.</li>
            <li>The design is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It shaves well and can be easily cleaned with water.  </li>
            <li>because he has, up until now, been a very loyal Remington customer...</li>
            <li>I am therefore comparatively easy to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the foils they seem to pick up my hair type and shave me clean.</li>
            <li>It is designed in the USA and could easily have been designed without this flaw.</li>
            <li>It comes apart easily for cleaning.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine.  </li>
            <li>so even if successful would probably have only added 6 months or so to its life as many reviews note).  </li>
            <li>Many, many shaves on one charge ( got over 25 shaves on first charge)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it gave you a much closer shave and felt much better on your face!  </li>
            <li>It works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Gives a smooth cut.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor as it was cheap and as a back-up while I tried to repair the Norelco (...by the way this was a no go -</li>
            <li>I feel that the foils should be available seperately as it is not nessesary</li>
            <li>but I feel that the manufacturer should make the replacement foils available seperately.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is just me, I have a light beard, yet I don&#x27;t get a close shave.</li>
            <li>It is available on Amazon</li>
            <li>Got a different one it is great.</li>
            <li>(although it is still available at some retailers, including Amazon ), because it has a pivoting head and supposedly floating foils as well.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have went cheap on my electric razor purchase.</li>
            <li>I like the LED indicator light telling you</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>cheap plastic parts and clips.  </li>
            <li>This razor is very quiet and does a great job of shaving the face and neck.</li>
            <li>It does the job nice and fast.</li>
            <li>and a flashing light means it is already fully charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does give a very smooth shave, better than my older Remingtons and Norelcos.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>and frankly gives a closer and better shave than my old beloved and relatively higher end</li>
            <li>Gave me a very smooth shave the first time.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!  </li>
            <li>I always shave after showering so the skin is clean.</li>
            <li>of them are going to clean you up in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t wish to use water to clean any electrical device.</li>
            <li>clean shave.</li>
            <li>This new model is also excellent, keeps a long charge, and shaves well.</li>
            <li>and it has the 5 minute quick charge, gives a clean shave, and it is neck friendly.</li>
            <li>but I think this might be true with every foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>This has been true of any electric shaver that I have ever owned!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>still not an expensive great product, but pretty good for the money.&lt;br /&gt;great to be able to wash it out.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done quick and neat.</li>
            <li>When I came across the Remington Pivot and Flex Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Razor at Amazon.com and saw the price I quickly ordered it.</li>
            <li>battery life with quick charge&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li>Quick recharge for (1) shave was a deciding factor.</li>
            <li>Using talc or a talc stick makes it work a whole lot better and actually gives a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li>First, I am able to get a much closer shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is only ok!</li>
            <li>I have been using Remington razors and shavers for several decades, and the F-4790 is a very good, basic shaver.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s such a smooth and clean and easy shave</li>
            <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the cost of replacing the blade and shield.</li>
            <li>#34;It just as good as my other one which was a Remington MS3-1000&amp;#34;--</li>
            <li>#34;I made the right choice&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>All in all, the price is right.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>it sits right where my thumb falls-</li>
            <li>The shaver gives a close shave and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>so it is also very easy to turn OFF in the middle of the shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty powerful.</li>
            <li>I have paid many more dollars for other shavers only to have them explode beyond repair upon impact and when I drop this razor, I am able to repair it myself, (with caregiver assistance)</li>
            <li>The old Panasonic had more blades in the cutting head and more oscillations per minute giving a good shave without pulling pain and doing a good job on the neck and next to the mouth.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to remove the individual foil from the replacemt pack and install it in the original foil holder very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Summary---</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and types of shavers and found the Remington dual-foil electric is the most comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have found that they provide a clean comfortable shave in a relatively short run time.</li>
            <li>Amazon is really supporting well those of us away from home.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>such is definitely better than trying to hold onto some squirrely space age looking thing -</li>
            <li>So, I am able to detail my facial hair if I need to or get to the troublesome spots under my jaw.</li>
            <li>I had wind burn and my face was red for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This was a razor that couldn&#x27;t cut hot butter.  </li>
            <li>I am sorry that Remington discontinued their MS2 390 microscreen shaver because that was an excellent electric foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>if you do this these will last you a long time and give u a great shave</li>
            <li>They are built better and will last longer.</li>
            <li>and it was exactly what I was looking for,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Remington electric shavers for most of my adult life,  and normally get years of use out of each shaver.  </li>
            <li>I did have to return mine because the pivet point at which the head swivels is actually higher than the foils themselves.</li>
            <li>Gets a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li>Just exactly what i wanted...</li>
            <li>rather they be lower than higher than the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the trimmer that raises,  barely raises above the foil so cannot be used as easily as a trimmer that better clears the foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>felt that the original foils developed holes in them to soon</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is extremely long.&lt;br /&gt;Pivot head is nice for close</li>
            <li>I would advise anyone looking for a good shave at a reasonable cost to increase the budget a little and buy one of the mid-range models from Braun or Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I should have known better.&lt;br /&gt;The low cost and pivoting head are about the only good things I can say about this shaver.</li>
            <li>If you feel comfortable paying $40 for a product that is most certainly guaranteed to break within a few months, then this is your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>on my last 3 shavers purchased seemed to tear easily.  </li>
            <li>Most stores that sell Remington products no longer carry the replacement screens, or blades, and the prices charged on the internet sites are almost the same as the purchase price for a new razor.</li>
            <li>It does not handle neck hairs no matter how many times you rub your neck raw trying to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>In fact, at the price of most replacement cutters I wonder what pray tell one has to loose in gettingthis guy?  </li>
            <li>works well, and the price was much lower compared with many other brands that had a much higher price tag attached to them.</li>
            <li>Hard to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>It is slim and very controllable.  </li>
            <li>THANKS FOR YOUR ANSWER.</li>
            <li>It does not work very well, neither with or against the grain.  </li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>The head can be removed and rinsed, which he really likes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really convenient to turn</li>
            <li>shipped fast too.</li>
            <li>Shaves fast and close.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, for its affordability and use.</li>
            <li>The trimmer extension is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver 3 years ago for almost $70.00, and it has done very well.</li>
            <li>Yes and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, really, but not nearly as good as the 390, which has a much more powerful</li>
            <li>Product is as ordered, very durable and water proof as advertised.</li>
            <li>I really like the look and feel of this razor.</li>
            <li>After charging it over night, it was ready for use.</li>
            <li>This razor works just as well as any foil razor on the market, even ones that cost five times as much.</li>
            <li>also, it shaved very close on the face but not my neck</li>
            <li>Be sure you read the directions for shaving and don&#x27;t just assume because you are a 50 something with years of experience that you won&#x27;t learn from the 3-4 minutes reading the concise - all English (yay Remington!) - directions.  </li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li>This model incorporates the important features, including corded and cordless operation, international voltage, and quick charge, so that you can get a shave even when you forget to charge the razor and when traveling outside of North America.</li>
            <li>I cannot get a very close shave with this Remington model, particularly on the neck.</li>
            <li>(in my opinion) to have to replace the cutters as often as the foils.&lt;br /&gt;Of course one foil developed a hole first</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the charge I can shave my face more than 11 consecutive days and cleaning out cut hair debris takes less than 9-15 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Razor dulls very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m deployed currently to the Mideast so mail order is essential for many things.</li>
            <li>I EXPECTED IT TO BE MORE PERFORMANT THAN A 12-YEAR OLD PHILIPS SHAVER I HAVE BEEN USING</li>
            <li>I bought these to replace an older razor my husband uses.</li>
            <li>Bought a complete new shaver because I could not find foil and blades at a reasonable cost!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see it because it is right against the foils, which makes it kind of hard to get the the smaller areas.</li>
            <li>- there is something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; feeling about shaving with the rotary razor, but such has apparently gone the way of the 100 Watt light bulb I guess.  </li>
            <li>The foil razor works much better than the rotery for a few reasons.  </li>
            <li>The on/off switch is positioned exactly where my thumb wants to rest causing numerous inadvertant turn-offs during shaving.</li>
            <li>I am able to use this shaver quite a few times before recharging.</li>
            <li>while shaving it causes the cutters the rub against the foils and destroy them, glide across face lightly  up and down and in circular motion so it will catch the hairs on it own, also dnt allow facial hairs to grow out long before shaving this shaver is design to shave stubble hairs use the popup trimmer to shave long hairs then foils for close shave, also never use a brush of any kind to clean foils with or harsh chemicals just rinse clean in sink and spray disinfectant on them only brush the cutters and pocket where cutters sit,</li>
            <li>I have been using a Norelco 6423 for some time and it was time to buy new heads (or a new shaver).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy a new Norelco on Amazon and eventually trash the Remington.  </li>
            <li>a new screen, can&#x27;t seem to locate one</li>
            <li>I have purchased two new units to have on hand just in case.</li>
            <li>Bottom line - if you have a light beard and shave daily this will do an acceptable job at a low price.</li>
            <li>This is my second Remington in the last 5 years, and I was extremely pleased with my previous one (smaller, cheaper model) that still works fine</li>
            <li>At first, it worked well but after only about 2 weeks in use, it wouldn&#x27;t start, I charged it again and</li>
            <li>the body of the razor stays intact and only the foil blades need to be put back into the original holders and it still works as per the instructions.</li>
            <li>I was about at the cost for a complete new shaver.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s just not that great when it comes to cutting whiskers.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it in the shower or wet shaving like it says it is capable of, because who wants to hold a battery-powered shaver in the shower?</li>
            <li>The more expensive shaver is quiet and gives me a baby smooth shave every time with out any problems.</li>
            <li>far charges</li>
            <li>and it left my skin very sore.  </li>
            <li>That led me to this F4790&lt;br /&gt;model, which Remington says is intended to be the direct successor to the now-discontinued 390</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this shaver and it definitely does all one would expect plus</li>
            <li>This shaver shaves as close as my old Remington.</li>
            <li>My neck developed a rash every time I used it.</li>
            <li>I use an electric razor after the shower on a dry face - quick and easy, and have been doing so for at least 35 years now.  </li>
            <li>No loose hairs falling out of the chambers as in the newer high end wet/dry Phillips models,</li>
            <li>It is very easy to cut your self easily and badly.</li>
            <li>It felt a little bulky to me at first because I had been using a single foil Remington before this one, but I quickly got used to the \\&quot;new feel\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have had so many bad trimmers/shavers over the past 5 years due to my really sensitive skin, but this Remington shaver is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Both the shaving and trimming were less than adequate.  </li>
            <li>By the time I actually get a decent shave, my face is suffering</li>
            <li>I always appreciate when products last a long time and are worth the price.</li>
            <li>Granted, I still prefer the way older models were designed in which you simply had to press 2 tabs on the sides to remove the piece holding the screens.</li>
            <li>After shaving for quite some time with the high-end Braun Series7, I was introduced to the much less expensive Remington MS2-390 which, to my surprise, yielded an extremely close shave--as good as the Braun or better.</li>
            <li>It is worth what I paid for it, but don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
            <li>If you wait too long to replace the foil, you will really notice it once you do, because your shaving time will be shorter.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor instead of buying a 3rd set of screens and a new Hair</li>
            <li>Third, the metal mesh make it much easier to tell what is under the actual blade.  </li>
            <li>For the price of this unit, it was worth giving it a shot as my previous Phillips Norelco had bit the dust.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t like the ergonomics of the Remmy nearly as much as the Braun, I began to alternate it with the Braun on a regular basis</li>
            <li>Initial charging gave flashing green light.</li>
            <li>it shaves about as well as the Braun single head razor, but is much harder to brush clean</li>
            <li>At first, I was like &amp;#34;shit, this aint shavin nothin&amp;#34;, because I was trying to use it like any other razor.</li>
            <li>I have not been disappointed with the Remington, which has given me some of the closest and most comfortable</li>
            <li>I bought this Remington F4790 to replace an old Panasonic double bladed wet/dry rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>This review is by 63 year old man that has only used electric razors and Remington&#x27;s beginning with the XLR.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too big for the old cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s old, his facial hair is coarse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long liked the thin screen head and the width of the shaving area.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works on certain other hair types.</li>
            <li>The F4790 is a very basic razor with essentially no bells and whistles - only a green charging light and on-off switch.  </li>
            <li>On the negative side this is a rather large and even clunky razor that does not come with a travel case (main reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5).  </li>
            <li>the less it is also quite large</li>
            <li>However,  I find it a little large and I am not used to</li>
            <li>So I am tempted to buy this model again on Amazon because the price has fallen to below half what i paid, and maybe it will be a good spare if mine ever fails to charge.</li>
            <li>and 2)\\&quot;Easily\\&quot; Cleaning it by holding it under running water is not easy; it consists of some disaassembly first, liquid soap, brushing, and rinsing the parts before reassembly and the final faucet rinse!</li>
            <li>Due to my issue, Remington is sending me new screen/cutters.       </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a real nice job.  </li>
            <li> Excellent battery life, a good 16-18 month cutter blade and foil life.</li>
            <li> Great razor.</li>
            <li> and they are great</li>
            <li> did do a great job on the hair it did get, if you don&#x27;t mind having to use a razor also for the strays.</li>
            <li> great.  </li>
            <li> The trim is great.</li>

            <li> Great price, good close shave.  </li>
            <li> This is a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> this is definitive good product.</li>
            <li> It does its job surprisingly well</li>
            <li> (see reviews) - just a good shave.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good electric shaver the Remington is not it.</li>
            <li> Shaver works well- good and close.</li>
            <li> Seems to hold a good charge, too.&lt;br /&gt;Who</li>
            <li> I own one of these shavers and have been happy with the performance.</li>
            <li> He loved it.</li>
            <li> I used it about 15 times and never got a good shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get a good close shave.</li>
            <li> The body does not even have rubberized grips on the side for good handling.</li>
            <li> It seems to be well made, holds a good charge, and feels well balanced in the hand.</li>
            <li> If I shave every day it does fairly well but takes longer than it should.</li>
            <li> I got a excellent price with free shipping at Amazon.</li>
            <li> The service was excellent and the product arrived quickly in the sealed original&lt;</li>
            <li> this is a great shave, as for the foils on most shavers dnt press it on your face</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite!  </li>
            <li> Well made, easy to use and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Amazing for a &lt;$40 razor - no linear motors, 5 track heads, and so on.  </li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After shaving it looked liked</li>
            <li> This is the best product in any concievable category in my whole life that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> This is a Great Product I love this shaver as the replacement for my Norelco razor of 17 or more years</li>
            <li> because I liked the close aggressive shave.</li>
            <li> He has always liked the Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> This new Remington is lightweight and provides an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> He always had this brand of shaver &amp; he is very happy with his new gift.</li>
            <li> I would have, however, paid a bit more if a carrying case of some kind (for travel/packing) was part of the deal.  </li>
            <li> but right now I am a happy camper.</li>
            <li> quick delivery for a good price</li>
            <li> I was able to use this shaver every morning for just over two weeks before having to give it a charge.</li>
            <li> The worn out Norelco does a much better job</li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied and think this model is an improvement.</li>
            <li> After using for a couple of months it never got any better.</li>
            <li> I have purchased another shaver about 3 times the cost of this one and it is night and day better.</li>
            <li> It is light and a nice shape to hold.</li>
            <li> My third Remington and the best of all.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for one of the most dear men in my life.  </li>
            <li> I have used Remington brand shavers for more than 25+ years.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I would gladly recommend it.</li>
            <li> have just ordered a Braun 320s-4 from Amazon hoping it will be much better.</li>
            <li> Better than with my Braun.</li>
            <li> What would make it even better, I thought, would be a pivoting head (which the Braun has) for better maneuverability.</li>
            <li> /&gt;with the better handling and maneuverability of the pivot and flex technology.</li>
            <li> The better maneuverability of the pivoting head is cancelled out, for me, by the length</li>
            <li> I was pleased when it arrived</li>
            <li> Better than the Braun from that stand point.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> 5 more words required</li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying his Remington Pivot --he</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The shave is good too, although I only use it to shave my mustache area and use a manual razor to shave the rest, but for me, I am worried about durability and after much trial and error, I have found the Remington Men&#x27;s electric shaver to work the best for me.</li>
            <li> Recharging unit is easy and charge lasts through many shaves.</li>
            <li> He uses it most of the time and says for the money it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Yes a better, closer, and every bit comfortable - no hair pulling - shave.  </li>
            <li> Despite initial frustration the ways described above, I am very happy with this shaver; it does a great job.</li>
            <li> It has a nice heft, and I really like being able to rinse it with water.</li>
            <li> The design is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It shaves well and can be easily cleaned with water.  </li>
            <li> because he has, up until now, been a very loyal Remington customer...</li>
            <li> I am therefore comparatively easy to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the foils they seem to pick up my hair type and shave me clean.</li>
            <li> It is designed in the USA and could easily have been designed without this flaw.</li>
            <li> It comes apart easily for cleaning.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine.  </li>
            <li> so even if successful would probably have only added 6 months or so to its life as many reviews note).  </li>
            <li> Many, many shaves on one charge ( got over 25 shaves on first charge)&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it gave you a much closer shave and felt much better on your face!  </li>
            <li> It works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth cut.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor as it was cheap and as a back-up while I tried to repair the Norelco (...by the way this was a no go -</li>
            <li> I feel that the foils should be available seperately as it is not nessesary</li>
            <li> but I feel that the manufacturer should make the replacement foils available seperately.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just me, I have a light beard, yet I don&#x27;t get a close shave.</li>
            <li> It is available on Amazon</li>
            <li> Got a different one it is great.</li>
            <li> (although it is still available at some retailers, including Amazon ), because it has a pivoting head and supposedly floating foils as well.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have went cheap on my electric razor purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the LED indicator light telling you</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> cheap plastic parts and clips.  </li>
            <li> This razor is very quiet and does a great job of shaving the face and neck.</li>
            <li> It does the job nice and fast.</li>
            <li> and a flashing light means it is already fully charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does give a very smooth shave, better than my older Remingtons and Norelcos.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> and frankly gives a closer and better shave than my old beloved and relatively higher end</li>
            <li> Gave me a very smooth shave the first time.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!  </li>
            <li> I always shave after showering so the skin is clean.</li>
            <li> of them are going to clean you up in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wish to use water to clean any electrical device.</li>
            <li> clean shave.</li>
            <li> This new model is also excellent, keeps a long charge, and shaves well.</li>
            <li> and it has the 5 minute quick charge, gives a clean shave, and it is neck friendly.</li>
            <li> but I think this might be true with every foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> This has been true of any electric shaver that I have ever owned!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> still not an expensive great product, but pretty good for the money.&lt;br /&gt;great to be able to wash it out.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done quick and neat.</li>
            <li> When I came across the Remington Pivot and Flex Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Razor at Amazon.com and saw the price I quickly ordered it.</li>
            <li> battery life with quick charge&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> Quick recharge for (1) shave was a deciding factor.</li>
            <li> Using talc or a talc stick makes it work a whole lot better and actually gives a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li> First, I am able to get a much closer shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is only ok!</li>
            <li> I have been using Remington razors and shavers for several decades, and the F-4790 is a very good, basic shaver.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s such a smooth and clean and easy shave</li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the cost of replacing the blade and shield.</li>
            <li> #34;It just as good as my other one which was a Remington MS3-1000&amp;#34;--</li>
            <li> #34;I made the right choice&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> All in all, the price is right.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> it sits right where my thumb falls-</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a close shave and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> so it is also very easy to turn OFF in the middle of the shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty powerful.</li>
            <li> I have paid many more dollars for other shavers only to have them explode beyond repair upon impact and when I drop this razor, I am able to repair it myself, (with caregiver assistance)</li>
            <li> The old Panasonic had more blades in the cutting head and more oscillations per minute giving a good shave without pulling pain and doing a good job on the neck and next to the mouth.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to remove the individual foil from the replacemt pack and install it in the original foil holder very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Summary---</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and types of shavers and found the Remington dual-foil electric is the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have found that they provide a clean comfortable shave in a relatively short run time.</li>
            <li> Amazon is really supporting well those of us away from home.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> such is definitely better than trying to hold onto some squirrely space age looking thing -</li>
            <li> So, I am able to detail my facial hair if I need to or get to the troublesome spots under my jaw.</li>
            <li> I had wind burn and my face was red for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This was a razor that couldn&#x27;t cut hot butter.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry that Remington discontinued their MS2 390 microscreen shaver because that was an excellent electric foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> if you do this these will last you a long time and give u a great shave</li>
            <li> They are built better and will last longer.</li>
            <li> and it was exactly what I was looking for,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington electric shavers for most of my adult life,  and normally get years of use out of each shaver.  </li>
            <li> I did have to return mine because the pivet point at which the head swivels is actually higher than the foils themselves.</li>
            <li> Gets a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li> Just exactly what i wanted...</li>
            <li> rather they be lower than higher than the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the trimmer that raises,  barely raises above the foil so cannot be used as easily as a trimmer that better clears the foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> felt that the original foils developed holes in them to soon</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is extremely long.&lt;br /&gt;Pivot head is nice for close</li>
            <li> I would advise anyone looking for a good shave at a reasonable cost to increase the budget a little and buy one of the mid-range models from Braun or Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I should have known better.&lt;br /&gt;The low cost and pivoting head are about the only good things I can say about this shaver.</li>
            <li> If you feel comfortable paying $40 for a product that is most certainly guaranteed to break within a few months, then this is your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> on my last 3 shavers purchased seemed to tear easily.  </li>
            <li> Most stores that sell Remington products no longer carry the replacement screens, or blades, and the prices charged on the internet sites are almost the same as the purchase price for a new razor.</li>
            <li> It does not handle neck hairs no matter how many times you rub your neck raw trying to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> In fact, at the price of most replacement cutters I wonder what pray tell one has to loose in gettingthis guy?  </li>
            <li> works well, and the price was much lower compared with many other brands that had a much higher price tag attached to them.</li>
            <li> Hard to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> It is slim and very controllable.  </li>
            <li> THANKS FOR YOUR ANSWER.</li>
            <li> It does not work very well, neither with or against the grain.  </li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> The head can be removed and rinsed, which he really likes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really convenient to turn</li>
            <li> shipped fast too.</li>
            <li> Shaves fast and close.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, for its affordability and use.</li>
            <li> The trimmer extension is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver 3 years ago for almost $70.00, and it has done very well.</li>
            <li> Yes and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, really, but not nearly as good as the 390, which has a much more powerful</li>
            <li> Product is as ordered, very durable and water proof as advertised.</li>
            <li> I really like the look and feel of this razor.</li>
            <li> After charging it over night, it was ready for use.</li>
            <li> This razor works just as well as any foil razor on the market, even ones that cost five times as much.</li>
            <li> also, it shaved very close on the face but not my neck</li>
            <li> Be sure you read the directions for shaving and don&#x27;t just assume because you are a 50 something with years of experience that you won&#x27;t learn from the 3-4 minutes reading the concise - all English (yay Remington!) - directions.  </li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li> This model incorporates the important features, including corded and cordless operation, international voltage, and quick charge, so that you can get a shave even when you forget to charge the razor and when traveling outside of North America.</li>
            <li> I cannot get a very close shave with this Remington model, particularly on the neck.</li>
            <li> (in my opinion) to have to replace the cutters as often as the foils.&lt;br /&gt;Of course one foil developed a hole first</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the charge I can shave my face more than 11 consecutive days and cleaning out cut hair debris takes less than 9-15 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Razor dulls very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m deployed currently to the Mideast so mail order is essential for many things.</li>
            <li> I EXPECTED IT TO BE MORE PERFORMANT THAN A 12-YEAR OLD PHILIPS SHAVER I HAVE BEEN USING</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace an older razor my husband uses.</li>
            <li> Bought a complete new shaver because I could not find foil and blades at a reasonable cost!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see it because it is right against the foils, which makes it kind of hard to get the the smaller areas.</li>
            <li> - there is something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; feeling about shaving with the rotary razor, but such has apparently gone the way of the 100 Watt light bulb I guess.  </li>
            <li> The foil razor works much better than the rotery for a few reasons.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch is positioned exactly where my thumb wants to rest causing numerous inadvertant turn-offs during shaving.</li>
            <li> I am able to use this shaver quite a few times before recharging.</li>
            <li> while shaving it causes the cutters the rub against the foils and destroy them, glide across face lightly  up and down and in circular motion so it will catch the hairs on it own, also dnt allow facial hairs to grow out long before shaving this shaver is design to shave stubble hairs use the popup trimmer to shave long hairs then foils for close shave, also never use a brush of any kind to clean foils with or harsh chemicals just rinse clean in sink and spray disinfectant on them only brush the cutters and pocket where cutters sit,</li>
            <li> I have been using a Norelco 6423 for some time and it was time to buy new heads (or a new shaver).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy a new Norelco on Amazon and eventually trash the Remington.  </li>
            <li> a new screen, can&#x27;t seem to locate one</li>
            <li> I have purchased two new units to have on hand just in case.</li>
            <li> Bottom line - if you have a light beard and shave daily this will do an acceptable job at a low price.</li>
            <li> This is my second Remington in the last 5 years, and I was extremely pleased with my previous one (smaller, cheaper model) that still works fine</li>
            <li> At first, it worked well but after only about 2 weeks in use, it wouldn&#x27;t start, I charged it again and</li>
            <li> the body of the razor stays intact and only the foil blades need to be put back into the original holders and it still works as per the instructions.</li>
            <li> I was about at the cost for a complete new shaver.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s just not that great when it comes to cutting whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in the shower or wet shaving like it says it is capable of, because who wants to hold a battery-powered shaver in the shower?</li>
            <li> The more expensive shaver is quiet and gives me a baby smooth shave every time with out any problems.</li>
            <li> far charges</li>
            <li> and it left my skin very sore.  </li>
            <li> That led me to this F4790&lt;br /&gt;model, which Remington says is intended to be the direct successor to the now-discontinued 390</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this shaver and it definitely does all one would expect plus</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves as close as my old Remington.</li>
            <li> My neck developed a rash every time I used it.</li>
            <li> I use an electric razor after the shower on a dry face - quick and easy, and have been doing so for at least 35 years now.  </li>
            <li> No loose hairs falling out of the chambers as in the newer high end wet/dry Phillips models,</li>
            <li> It is very easy to cut your self easily and badly.</li>
            <li> It felt a little bulky to me at first because I had been using a single foil Remington before this one, but I quickly got used to the \\&quot;new feel\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have had so many bad trimmers/shavers over the past 5 years due to my really sensitive skin, but this Remington shaver is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Both the shaving and trimming were less than adequate.  </li>
            <li> By the time I actually get a decent shave, my face is suffering</li>
            <li> I always appreciate when products last a long time and are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Granted, I still prefer the way older models were designed in which you simply had to press 2 tabs on the sides to remove the piece holding the screens.</li>
            <li> After shaving for quite some time with the high-end Braun Series7, I was introduced to the much less expensive Remington MS2-390 which, to my surprise, yielded an extremely close shave--as good as the Braun or better.</li>
            <li> It is worth what I paid for it, but don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
            <li> If you wait too long to replace the foil, you will really notice it once you do, because your shaving time will be shorter.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor instead of buying a 3rd set of screens and a new Hair</li>
            <li> Third, the metal mesh make it much easier to tell what is under the actual blade.  </li>
            <li> For the price of this unit, it was worth giving it a shot as my previous Phillips Norelco had bit the dust.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t like the ergonomics of the Remmy nearly as much as the Braun, I began to alternate it with the Braun on a regular basis</li>
            <li> Initial charging gave flashing green light.</li>
            <li> it shaves about as well as the Braun single head razor, but is much harder to brush clean</li>
            <li> At first, I was like &amp;#34;shit, this aint shavin nothin&amp;#34;, because I was trying to use it like any other razor.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed with the Remington, which has given me some of the closest and most comfortable</li>
            <li> I bought this Remington F4790 to replace an old Panasonic double bladed wet/dry rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> This review is by 63 year old man that has only used electric razors and Remington&#x27;s beginning with the XLR.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big for the old cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s old, his facial hair is coarse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long liked the thin screen head and the width of the shaving area.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works on certain other hair types.</li>
            <li> The F4790 is a very basic razor with essentially no bells and whistles - only a green charging light and on-off switch.  </li>
            <li> On the negative side this is a rather large and even clunky razor that does not come with a travel case (main reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5).  </li>
            <li> the less it is also quite large</li>
            <li> However,  I find it a little large and I am not used to</li>
            <li> So I am tempted to buy this model again on Amazon because the price has fallen to below half what i paid, and maybe it will be a good spare if mine ever fails to charge.</li>
            <li> and 2)\\&quot;Easily\\&quot; Cleaning it by holding it under running water is not easy; it consists of some disaassembly first, liquid soap, brushing, and rinsing the parts before reassembly and the final faucet rinse!</li>
            <li> Due to my issue, Remington is sending me new screen/cutters.       </li>
            <li> Apparently, this one needs to shave on a dry, not oily face, in circular motions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the new razor less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The push-up trimmer is located on the back and rises only to the height of the foils, which makes it nearly impossible to effectively edge sideburns.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time I used this shaver to try and cut neck hairs or a long hair on my face it actually cut me to to the point of bleeding.  </li>
            <li> He likes the fact that the charging cord is long enough to reach from the outlet to his shelf without a problem.</li>
            <li> I find that annoying but the original was a gift and the price was right given my current circumstances.</li>
            <li> think in part the problem is with the dual foil - next one will have a single foli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, after a week of camping I look like a teenager with his first (attempted) beard.</li>
            <li> I think the foil part of the shaver works well as long as you shave every day.  </li>
            <li> In the up position it is level with the head so you can shave and cut the long hairs.</li>
            <li> Long whiskers are bent over by the combs and they do not penetrate the holes to be cut off.  </li>
            <li> it works great,just like an old one I had a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I can use the trimmer part first then pass it over a few times and still have a few hairs showing.</li>
            <li> No shaving cream, no skill, just wash up, dry off, and get at it.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ll brush it out dry instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The combs on this razor only have tiny round holes instead of slots.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t throw away your 25cent BIC single blade disposable.</li>
            <li> - I would suggest a razor with a single foil</li>
            <li> My problem was that it was past due for a new set of blades and foil.</li>
            <li> The blades do not protrude as much above the shaver as in previous models, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> trimmer works the same as on previous models.</li>
            <li> The razor is larger than previous models and does not come with a travel case.</li>
            <li> Though I typically shave with a blade, I needed a rechargeable shaver for travel and occasional weekend touch up.  </li>
            <li> My previous Remington lasted nearly five years, and this improved model seems like it should last at least as long.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> The plastic protective cover is a little tricky to snap on properly.</li>
            <li> Shaves just as well but is a little larger and heavier.</li>
            <li> They give you a secondary razor attached to the main body for long hair, but it aint shit.</li>
            <li> one that&#x27;s priced somewhere in-between most and least expensive</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars except for the unbelievably crappy (yes, crappy) cover that barely fits and takes the blade shield off every time I remove.</li>
            <li> It is a rough shave compared to my Norelco Sensotouch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shave not as close as expected / hoped for.  </li>
            <li> It is a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It can be used plugged or unplugged, and it has a green led to indicate that it is charging, as well as a red led to indicate that it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> Spent 20 minutes trying to get a shave</li>
            <li> I am not very hairy at all.</li>
            <li> Have to go over same area a few times.</li>
            <li> Totally child proof and shit</li>
            <li> EVEN WHEN I SPENT AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME SHAVING WITH THIS NEW SHAVER, THE RESULT IS NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> Second, and maybe my facial hairs are made of steel, but the shaving action was very poor.</li>
            <li> I had the other for a few years, replacing cutters, but the battery finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> It also needed new cutting blades and screen, so I decided to just buy a new on.  </li>
            <li> This is a very loud shaver, it makes as much noise as a blender, especially if you use the trimmer to try and get those annoying longer hairs.</li>
            <li> However, it is a little bigger than my previous Braun.</li>
            <li> I have owned other electric razors which did their work well without the burn and skip.</li>
            <li> the smoothest shave, but extremely close</li>
            <li> Having recieved it, in short order, I was anxious to try it out.</li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks,  my fingers eventually slipped and crushed the screen.  </li>
            <li> After about 14 months I replaced that with an expensive Panasonic which had very high reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Unlike earlier shavers, the cutting blades only need to be replaced once a year (depending, I suppose, on how coarse your hair is).</li>
            <li> I can spend twice as much time and still there are random hairs, sometimes in patches of 5-10 hairs.</li>
            <li> Norelco - now Phillips Norelco seems to have gone down hill based on reviews so maybe a ~$150 Panasonic?  </li>
            <li> If cover is placed over cutter heads it just falls off when placing razor down.  </li>
            <li> If cover is pushed very firmly down over cutter head it snaps in place</li>
            <li> It is ugly, bulky, too long, too curved and cheaply built of all dull plastic.</li>
            <li> AND IN FACT IT IS LESS PERFORMANT.</li>
            <li> I started off with a corded Remington, upgraded to a Remington microscreen, then to a Norelco 8865 XL spectra, and now have this Remington F4790 which is the subject of this review.    </li>
            <li> It is black plastic and seems well built.  </li>
            <li> With my previous Remingtons, when the Hair Pocket became worn, the life of the screens would be shortened.</li>
            <li> My previous shaver&#x27;s rechargeable batteries would no longer charge and I could not get it repaired.</li>
            <li> This foil shaver has slight posts you can feel on either side of the foil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two and a half years of use</li>
            <li> I had to shave several times and even then it failed to cut properly</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace a Braun that I&#x27;d had less than a year that fell apart.  </li>
            <li> The secondary razor that comes attached might cut you if you use it improperly, but I almost never need to use it because it&#x27;s fo long</li>
            <li> I usually shave every other day so have to go over some areas a couple of times to get the longer ones.</li>
            <li> Truly a pathetic bit of engineering on an otherwise vice nice, well-priced product.</li>
            <li> The head is not securely attached and comes off when trying to remove the head cover.</li>
            <li> HE USES IT EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> The side trimmer stop working after a few months.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave anything, and when it does everything is uneven.  </li>
            <li> This shaver was just a waste of  money - false economy - as the savings were not really savings as I ended up just throwing it</li>
            <li> Like, if you got this JESUS style facial hair where evrythang on yo face is like two inches long, you goan have a bad time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of electric shavers in the past but never a foil shaver.</li>
            <li> I have tried others and they are no better, even at 3 times the price.</li>
            <li> I called Remington ccustomer service and was told to grab the cover by the lip on one side and lift; that usually works.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as my previous $29.00 Remington.</li>
            <li> the batteries you can get now days for replacement are not very good -</li>
            <li> It comes with a brush for cleaning the cutting heads and assembly, and the cutting assembly, including the foil can be rinsed under the water tap to clean out the cut whiskers.</li>
            <li> just change the head periodically when they get dull.</li>
            <li> It is hard to use the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> guess I&#x60;ve learned it&#x27;s hard to expect a lot from a shaver at this price point.</li>
            <li> I also wish this shaver had a pop-out trimmer like Panasonic and Philips Norelco shavers--the \\&quot;push-up\\&quot; trimmer is hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> My complaint is with the pop up trimmer.  </li>
            <li> so I think some negative is deserved.  </li>
            <li> Only negative note is the cutting screen cover.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I used the razor improperly or if this is a common problem, but it&#x27;s one that I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> and it is too late to return</li>
            <li> Lately, something has changed, and the foil screens  </li>
            <li> The pivot head is an unbelievably stupid idea that works like it was invented by an MBA Marketing Flunky,  Do not waste your money on this razor - unless you want to give it to a guy you dislike.</li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money</li>
            <li> and that is really bad because unless you keep it exactly flat it grabs and cuts your skin.</li>
            <li> do not buy this as you will regret it unless you have skin that is tough as leather.</li>
            <li> It works, but leaves stubble behind on my face.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst electric razor I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Remington so-called warranty is a farce.  </li>
            <li> If your hair gets longer the foil has a hard time cutting it</li>
            <li> Given the tenderness of my skin, the weird hair growth that it exhibits, I was skeptical this would work.</li>
            <li> but it is expensive at $109.99</li>
            <li> I also discovered that if you leave the plastic cap on and press the edges of the cap, it is easier to remove the piece holding the screen (and would make it unlikely that you would accidentally crush the screen).  </li>
            <li> On my neck they were uncomfortable as the plastic would scratch along my skin.</li>
            <li> He said it was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> After 5 months the pivot head clips broke and the razor is now useless.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a really weird</li>
            <li> I have owned a Braun which was as noisey as a chainsaw and gave a lousy shave.</li>
            <li> I am ill and I drop things allot, including electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I have never tried to grow a beard because if I did it would be very thin.</li>
            <li> But, IMHO those with heavy beards probably will be very disappointed with this razor.</li>
            <li> but then when removing cover the cutting screen comes off with cover.  </li>
            <li> Makes for awkward handling.</li>
            <li> The performance of this Remington Pivot and Flex  rechargeable shaver was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Awkward to remove the piece holding the screen for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> This razor pulled my husband&#x27;s whiskers, and made for a very uncomfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Walmart was out of the Norelco shaver and I made a decision that turned out to be a bad one.  </li>
            <li> I had to say this to tthose with bad reviews</li>
            <li> the cut was bad</li>
            <li> The ergonomics are bad.  </li>
            <li> I sort of hate to admit this</li>
            <li> Just annoying that the razor&#x27;s head protective cover does not stay in place.  </li>
            <li> I hate this thing.  </li>
            <li> I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SHAVE WELL:</li>
            <li> The worst part of shaving was the noise and the damage it did to my face.</li>
            <li> Returned, terrible shaver.</li>
            <li> if it cannot handle me it is a horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my second Remington in the last 5 years, and I was extremely pleased with my previous one (smaller, cheaper model) that still works fine but it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the cost of replacing the blade and shield. This new model is also excellent, keeps a long charge, and shaves well. It has a nice heft, and I really like being able to rinse it with water. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars except for the unbelievably crappy (yes, crappy) cover that barely fits and takes the blade shield off every time I remove. Truly a pathetic bit of engineering on an otherwise vice nice, well-priced product. I would also like to praise Amazon&#x27;s service which got the razor to me in about five days. I&#x27;m deployed currently to the Mideast so mail order is essential for many things. Amazon is really supporting well those of us away from home. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver for the price. It works well and is easy to clean. Recharging unit is easy and charge lasts through many shaves.</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth cut.  The trimmer works fine.  It is slim and very controllable.  I like the way it works without a cord as well as with a cord.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SHAVE WELL: I EXPECTED IT TO BE MORE PERFORMANT THAN A 12-YEAR OLD PHILIPS SHAVER I HAVE BEEN USING AND IN FACT IT IS LESS PERFORMANT. EVEN WHEN I SPENT AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME SHAVING WITH THIS NEW SHAVER, THE RESULT IS NOT GOOD, I DO NOT LOOK WELL SHAVED. WHAT CAN I DO? RETURN THE PRODUCT? IF SO, HOW SHOULD I PROCEED? THANKS FOR YOUR ANSWER.</li>
            <li> I have had so many bad trimmers/shavers over the past 5 years due to my really sensitive skin, but this Remington shaver is by far the best! i cannot describe the feeling  of &amp;#34;I made the right choice&amp;#34;. this is definitive good product.</li>
            <li> I think the foil part of the shaver works well as long as you shave every day.  If your hair gets longer the foil has a hard time cutting it but I think this might be true with every foil shaver.  My complaint is with the pop up trimmer.  It does not work very well, neither with or against the grain.  It feels like there is a lot of pulling of the hair and it misses some.  Also when the pop up trimmer is popped-up I can&#x27;t really see it because it is right against the foils, which makes it kind of hard to get the the smaller areas. All in all, the price is right.</li>
            <li> This new Remington is lightweight and provides an excellent shave. I have tried other brands and types of shavers and found the Remington dual-foil electric is the most comfortable. This model incorporates the important features, including corded and cordless operation, international voltage, and quick charge, so that you can get a shave even when you forget to charge the razor and when traveling outside of North America. The design is easy to hold. The blades do not protrude as much above the shaver as in previous models, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the quality of the shave. The build seems solid. My previous Remington lasted nearly five years, and this improved model seems like it should last at least as long.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t throw away your 25cent BIC single blade disposable. I bought this Remington F4790 to replace an old Panasonic double bladed wet/dry rechargeable.  The old Panasonic had more blades in the cutting head and more oscillations per minute giving a good shave without pulling pain and doing a good job on the neck and next to the mouth.  This Chinese made Remington belongs in the seen on TV isle at CVS for $9.99. It does not handle neck hairs no matter how many times you rub your neck raw trying to get a clean shave. The pivot head is an unbelievably stupid idea that works like it was invented by an MBA Marketing Flunky,  Do not waste your money on this razor - unless you want to give it to a guy you dislike.</li>
            <li> It is a rough shave compared to my Norelco Sensotouch.&lt;br /&gt;I believe I get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.The price is right.</li>
            <li> I use an electric razor after the shower on a dry face - quick and easy, and have been doing so for at least 35 years now.  I started off with a corded Remington, upgraded to a Remington microscreen, then to a Norelco 8865 XL spectra, and now have this Remington F4790 which is the subject of this review.    The F4790 is a very basic razor with essentially no bells and whistles - only a green charging light and on-off switch.  It is black plastic and seems well built.  Again - no chrome, metal coverings, and LED displays or multi-color lights.  It does its job surprisingly well and frankly gives a closer and better shave than my old beloved and relatively higher end Norelco 8865XL did.  Yes a better, closer, and every bit comfortable - no hair pulling - shave.  Amazing for a &lt;$40 razor - no linear motors, 5 track heads, and so on.  I sort of hate to admit this - there is something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; feeling about shaving with the rotary razor, but such has apparently gone the way of the 100 Watt light bulb I guess.  On the negative side this is a rather large and even clunky razor that does not come with a travel case (main reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5).  Clunky is a bit subjective I guess as for some of us \\&quot;extra-size\\&quot; XL pawed men such is definitely better than trying to hold onto some squirrely space age looking thing - none the less it is also quite large so I think some negative is deserved.  I bought this razor as it was cheap and as a back-up while I tried to repair the Norelco (...by the way this was a no go - the batteries you can get now days for replacement are not very good - so even if successful would probably have only added 6 months or so to its life as many reviews note).  Norelco - now Phillips Norelco seems to have gone down hill based on reviews so maybe a ~$150 Panasonic?  Meanwhile, I am in no hurry as this &lt;$40 Remington functions quite well.  In fact, at the price of most replacement cutters I wonder what pray tell one has to loose in gettingthis guy?  No loose hairs falling out of the chambers as in the newer high end wet/dry Phillips models, etc. (see reviews) - just a good shave.  Be sure you read the directions for shaving and don&#x27;t just assume because you are a 50 something with years of experience that you won&#x27;t learn from the 3-4 minutes reading the concise - all English (yay Remington!) - directions.  All in all a very good buy that gets the job done with distinction!</li>
            <li> The best shaver that I had ever had.</li>
            <li> This is not what I  thought that I had  ordered. I wanted a triple folil&lt;br /&gt;Shaver and gave a specific model number which was one  the I had from my current shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  stilll have not made up my mind whether to keep it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron Reinknecht</li>
            <li> The foil razor works much better than the rotery for a few reasons.  First, I am able to get a much closer shaver.  Second, because the blades move side to side rather than spinning around, fewer hairs are ripped out.  That means fewer ingrown hairs.  Third, the metal mesh make it much easier to tell what is under the actual blade.  So, I am able to detail my facial hair if I need to or get to the troublesome spots under my jaw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of electric shavers in the past but never a foil shaver. For the price of this unit, it was worth giving it a shot as my previous Phillips Norelco had bit the dust. I was able to use this shaver every morning for just over two weeks before having to give it a charge. Given the tenderness of my skin, the weird hair growth that it exhibits, I was skeptical this would work. However, I can confirm that this shaver, regardless of your skin sensitivity, will do the trick. Excellent shaver, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This shaver does a real nice job.  It felt a little bulky to me at first because I had been using a single foil Remington before this one, but I quickly got used to the \\&quot;new feel\\&quot;. I usually shave every other day so have to go over some areas a couple of times to get the longer ones. This has been true of any electric shaver that I have ever owned!!&lt;br /&gt;I felt that the original foils developed holes in them to soon (about 40 shaves)&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased a foil/cutter replacement pack when I bought the shaver, and I&#x27;m glad I did!!  I feel that the foils should be available seperately as it is not nessesary (in my opinion) to have to replace the cutters as often as the foils.&lt;br /&gt;Of course one foil developed a hole first and I was able to remove the individual foil from the replacemt pack and install it in the original foil holder very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Summary--- Great Shaver!!  but I feel that the manufacturer should make the replacement foils available seperately.</li>
            <li> This razor does not give a close shave. It irritates the skin on the face which stays sore for a while. The head is not securely attached and comes off when trying to remove the head cover. Not nearly as good as my previous $29.00 Remington. I would not recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Norelco 6423 for some time and it was time to buy new heads (or a new shaver). Walmart was out of the Norelco shaver and I made a decision that turned out to be a bad one.  I purchased the Remington F4790 instead of returning later for the Norelco.  I have tried to use the Remington but it simply doesn&#x27;t shave close at all.  The worn out Norelco does a much better job and that&#x27;s what I am still using.  I&#x27;ll probably buy a new Norelco on Amazon and eventually trash the Remington.  If you are looking for a good electric shaver the Remington is not it.</li>
            <li> At first, it worked well but after only about 2 weeks in use, it wouldn&#x27;t start, I charged it again and still nothing</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a replacement for an identical one for which I&#x27;d lost a part when changing out the blades. If you&#x27;re looking for a close shave, don&#x27;t buy this product! It works, but leaves stubble behind on my face.  I find that annoying but the original was a gift and the price was right given my current circumstances.</li>
            <li> Very happy with comfort, noise, charging, and cleaning.  Only negative note is the cutting screen cover.  Just annoying that the razor&#x27;s head protective cover does not stay in place.  If cover is placed over cutter heads it just falls off when placing razor down.  If cover is pushed very firmly down over cutter head it snaps in place but then when removing cover the cutting screen comes off with cover.  Then you have to pry screen out of cover and reinstall onto razor.</li>
            <li> GOT THIS FOR MY DAD. HE USES IT EVERYDAY AND IT IS STILL WORKING.  VERY GLAD I GOT IT FOR HIM.</li>
            <li> Great razor. I have been using it for years. Does not pull hair. I replace it with the same one when it  needs replacing .love it!</li>
            <li> This review is by 63 year old man that has only used electric razors and Remington&#x27;s beginning with the XLR. I bought the F4790 to replace my MicroScreen 2 TCT model MS2-100. I&#x27;ve had the new razor less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big improvement is that the \\&quot;Hair Pocket,\\&quot; the plastic part that holds the screens, is now one piece with the screens. With my previous Remingtons, when the Hair Pocket became worn, the life of the screens would be shortened. Before I noticed the worn Hair Pocket on my MS2, I went threw 2 sets of screens. I bought this razor instead of buying a 3rd set of screens and a new Hair Pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave seems to be the same as the MicroScreen 2 TCT. The TCT model was a big improvement in closeness from the XLR and the 1st MicroScreen 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works the same as on previous models. In the up position it is level with the head so you can shave and cut the long hairs. However when extended, the \\&quot;pivot\\&quot; is locked. The pivoting head does keep both screens on your face. The razor is larger than previous models and does not come with a travel case. It&#x27;s too big for the old cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied and think this model is an improvement.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Amazon as I was looking for a replacement electric shaver that used both batteries and could run on electricity with the core attached. My previous shaver&#x27;s rechargeable batteries would no longer charge and I could not get it repaired. So I was looking for something that I could use if the batteries went out.  This shaver does both of those but that is all it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not give a close shave. They say give it 2 weeks to 30 days in the instructions to adjust to it.  After using for a couple of months it never got any better. I could run my hand over my face after shaving and still feel stubble. The worst part of shaving was the noise and the damage it did to my face. After shaving it looked liked I had wind burn and my face was red for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is the noise. This is a very loud shaver, it makes as much noise as a blender, especially if you use the trimmer to try and get those annoying longer hairs. Instead of the trimmer being built into the head between the foils it is separate and that is really bad because unless you keep it exactly flat it grabs and cuts your skin. I have the cuts to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I used this shaver to try and cut neck hairs or a long hair on my face it actually cut me to to the point of bleeding.  It is very easy to cut your self easily and badly. This shaver should come with a warning. I gave up on it after a couple of months and I will never buy an inexpensive shaver again. I have purchased another shaver about 3 times the cost of this one and it is night and day better. The more expensive shaver is quiet and gives me a baby smooth shave every time with out any problems. This shaver was just a waste of  money - false economy - as the savings were not really savings as I ended up just throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not give this to anyone unless it was a punishment or used to torture prisoners or something. Remington should pull this from the market -please do not buy this as you will regret it unless you have skin that is tough as leather.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just me, I have a light beard, yet I don&#x27;t get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Shave not as close as expected / hoped for.  A prior Braun in the same price range provided a closer shave.  Braun razor&#x27;s have become pricey.  5 O&#x27;clock shawdow now about noon or 1 PM - hence when I need a close shave I use a safety razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think in part the problem is with the dual foil - next one will have a single foli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product - I would suggest a razor with a single foil</li>
            <li> I got this for my Dad as a Christmas gift and he raves about it. The head can be removed and rinsed, which he really likes.</li>
            <li> this was a gift to someone who did a lot of research to see which product would suit his needs. he picked the remington pivot and flex men&#x27;s rechargeable electric dual foil shaver. he said it is perfect.</li>
            <li> It is only ok! Does not give you a close shave, by 3:00 PM you need another shave!! Had a Remington MicroFlex 200 the last 8 years and it gave you a much closer shave and felt much better on your face!  If the battery did not stop, I would still be using it!</li>
            <li> This item did not meet my expectations. It did not work properly so I returned it. It did not take the whiskers off.</li>
            <li> Shaver works well- good and close. Seems to hold a good charge, too.&lt;br /&gt;Who put the ON/OFF button there- it&#x27;s really convenient to turn on- it sits right where my thumb falls- so it is also very easy to turn OFF in the middle of the shave. Makes for awkward handling. Needs redesigin.</li>
            <li> I own one of these shavers and have been happy with the performance. My problem was that it was past due for a new set of blades and foil. I found that after taxes, delivery for the parts alone I was about at the cost for a complete new shaver. Bought a complete new shaver because I could not find foil and blades at a reasonable cost!</li>
            <li> It shaves well and can be easily cleaned with water.  Amazon&#x27;s shipping was fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might next time go back to rotating heads. This foil shaver has slight posts you can feel on either side of the foil. I&#x27;d rather they be lower than higher than the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the trimmer that raises,  barely raises above the foil so cannot be used as easily as a trimmer that better clears the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far charges nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No travel pouch came with it.</li>
            <li> Great price, good close shave.  I have tried others and they are no better, even at 3 times the price.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for.  performs well and titanium blades last forever!  shipped fast too.</li>
            <li> This was a razor that couldn&#x27;t cut hot butter.  It is a total waste of money.  Sorry I wasted my money</li>
            <li> The performance of this Remington Pivot and Flex  rechargeable shaver was disappointing.  Both the shaving and trimming were less than adequate.  I am sorry that Remington discontinued their MS2 390 microscreen shaver because that was an excellent electric foil shaver.  It is available on Amazon but it is expensive at $109.99</li>
            <li> These well made products are just what I was looking for. This is well made and arrived in short order. Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Remington razors and shavers for several decades, and the F-4790 is a very good, basic shaver. It is light and a nice shape to hold. The shaving head pivots so it follows the contour of your face, so shaving well. Unlike earlier shavers, the cutting blades only need to be replaced once a year (depending, I suppose, on how coarse your hair is). It comes with a brush for cleaning the cutting heads and assembly, and the cutting assembly, including the foil can be rinsed under the water tap to clean out the cut whiskers. It can be used plugged or unplugged, and it has a green led to indicate that it is charging, as well as a red led to indicate that it needs to be charged. The charger is also included. I am very happy with it and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two and a half years of use I have down-graded this from 5 star to 4 star. A piece of metal in the foil screen broke and stuck out of the screen and began to scratch my face. This prompted me to change razors to avoid this problem in the future. I don&#x27;t know if I used the razor improperly or if this is a common problem, but it&#x27;s one that I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> works well, and the price was much lower compared with many other brands that had a much higher price tag attached to them.</li>
            <li> My third Remington and the best of all.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for one of the most dear men in my life.  He loved it. It lives on and I&#x27;ll remember him always.</li>
            <li> This is the best product in any concievable category in my whole life that I have ever purchased. I sometimes find myself sort of day dreaming about the shaver and it&#x27;s power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the charge I can shave my face more than 11 consecutive days and cleaning out cut hair debris takes less than 9-15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this razor or regret not dong so.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington brand shavers for more than 25+ years. I have found that they provide a clean comfortable shave in a relatively short run time. This newest model that has a pivot head makes it even easier to use and moves on the face faster. I had a problem with the screen and Amazon took care immediately, great customer service!</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a close shave and the price was right.  However, it is a little bigger than my previous Braun.</li>
            <li> Though I typically shave with a blade, I needed a rechargeable shaver for travel and occasional weekend touch up.  This model appeared to have everything I needed, and it performs as described.  I would have, however, paid a bit more if a carrying case of some kind (for travel/packing) was part of the deal.  Nonetheless, I would gladly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for years and the battery finally died.  It also needed new cutting blades and screen, so I decided to just buy a new on.  Well worth it!  Battery has been going on it&#x27;s initial charge for three weeks and counting.  Shaves fast and close.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The side trimmer stop working after a few months.</li>
            <li> The combs on this razor only have tiny round holes instead of slots.  Long whiskers are bent over by the combs and they do not penetrate the holes to be cut off.  You have to go over and over your face to get a shave.  Spent 20 minutes trying to get a shave and it left my skin very sore.  The pop up trimmer only comes up even with the combs and you cannot see what you&#x27;re trimming.  The view is blocked by the shaver&#x27;s body.  I wrecked my mustache trying to trim it.  This shaver is a waste of money.  Going to buy another Norelco rotary like I had before.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst electric razor I have ever owned! It misses spots even after I repeat trying to shave them. I don&#x27;t like to pan a product but this one, in my opinion, definitely rates one star. By the time I actually get a decent shave, my face is suffering prime time razor burn. I have owned other electric razors which did their work well without the burn and skip.</li>
            <li> The best one they&#x27;ve made!  I always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> Well made, easy to use and it does a great job.  He likes the fact that the charging cord is long enough to reach from the outlet to his shelf without a problem.</li>
            <li> This is my wife account Im writing this review on bt I had to say this to tthose with bad reviews, I dnt know if they received a defective shaver or it&#x27;s something on their part bt this is a great shave, as for the foils on most shavers dnt press it on your face while shaving it causes the cutters the rub against the foils and destroy them, glide across face lightly  up and down and in circular motion so it will catch the hairs on it own, also dnt allow facial hairs to grow out long before shaving this shaver is design to shave stubble hairs use the popup trimmer to shave long hairs then foils for close shave, also never use a brush of any kind to clean foils with or harsh chemicals just rinse clean in sink and spray disinfectant on them only brush the cutters and pocket where cutters sit, if you do this these will last you a long time and give u a great shave, I use this same shaver in the barbershop daily and all day and they are great just change the head periodically when they get dull.</li>
            <li> This razor pulled my husband&#x27;s whiskers, and made for a very uncomfortable shave.  Something has changed with this razor and with Remington, because he has, up until now, been a very loyal Remington customer...</li>
            <li> the cut was bad I had to shave several times and even then it failed to cut properly</li>
            <li> My husband bought another one.</li>
            <li> The foil wore thru almost immediately.  I replaced it with a different Remington product.</li>
            <li> I cannot get a very close shave with this Remington model, particularly on the neck. I have to go over and over the same areas holding the shaver at different anfles. Finally just settle for what I end up with. It is what it is and it is too late to return it.&lt;br /&gt;I have just ordered a Braun 320s-4 from Amazon hoping it will be much better.</li>
            <li> Returned, terrible shaver. Got a different one it is great.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, for its affordability and use. Its lightweight and simple to use. The trimmer extension is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Not the smoothest shave, but extremely close</li>
            <li> An all around traditional Remington shaver. I have long liked the thin screen head and the width of the shaving area. When used in a circular pattern it performs well.</li>
            <li> This is a Great Product I love this shaver as the replacement for my Norelco razor of 17 or more years</li>
            <li> Reasons not to buy this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Hard to get a good shave.  Must go over the same area several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  The ergonomics are bad.  It is hard to use the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  It is loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  After about 4 months, the head keeps popping up so you can&#x27;t use the foils.  Basically unusable.</li>
            <li> I am not very hairy at all. I have never tried to grow a beard because if I did it would be very thin. Seriously, after a week of camping I look like a teenager with his first (attempted) beard. I am therefore comparatively easy to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using electric shavers for 35 years, both foil and rotary, if it cannot handle me it is a horrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver always leaves some hair. I always shave after showering so the skin is clean. I can pass over some areas 5 times with no results. I can use the trimmer part first then pass it over a few times and still have a few hairs showing. I tried stretching my skin. I can spend twice as much time and still there are random hairs, sometimes in patches of 5-10 hairs. I used it about 15 times and never got a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did do a great job on the hair it did get, if you don&#x27;t mind having to use a razor also for the strays. Didn&#x27;t another guy say that? Essentially I have to use a razor on my entire face because the strays are everywhere.</li>
            <li> I always appreciate when products last a long time and are worth the price. I bought this shaver 3 years ago for almost $70.00, and it has done very well. Excellent battery life, a good 16-18 month cutter blade and foil life. If you wait too long to replace the foil, you will really notice it once you do, because your shaving time will be shorter. So I am tempted to buy this model again on Amazon because the price has fallen to below half what i paid, and maybe it will be a good spare if mine ever fails to charge. I don&#x27;t use it in the shower or wet shaving like it says it is capable of, because who wants to hold a battery-powered shaver in the shower? Sheesh. All in all I like it.</li>
            <li> when I received shaver I put in on charge per instructions for 24 hours. I shaved every day for about 14 days at approx. 5 minutes per shave before I had to recharge. I get a very good shave and have had no problums of any kind.</li>
            <li> He seems to like it.&lt;br /&gt;Need a new screen, can&#x27;t seem to locate one</li>
            <li> net damaged after 3-5 use now it&#x27;s garbage</li>
            <li> I use the shaver every day and like it a lot. It gets the job done quick and neat. I do use the Face Saver Pre-shaver powder stick.</li>
            <li> I get a good close shave. Better than with my Braun. However,  I find it a little large and I am not used to it&#x27;s size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?? Yes and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> After shaving for quite some time with the high-end Braun Series7, I was introduced to the much less expensive Remington MS2-390 which, to my surprise, yielded an extremely close shave--as good as the Braun or better. While I didn&#x27;t like the ergonomics of the Remmy nearly as much as the Braun, I began to alternate it with the Braun on a regular basis&lt;br /&gt;simply because I liked the close aggressive shave. What would make it even better, I thought, would be a pivoting head (which the Braun has) for better maneuverability. That led me to this F4790&lt;br /&gt;model, which Remington says is intended to be the direct successor to the now-discontinued 390 (although it is still available at some retailers, including Amazon ), because it has a pivoting head and supposedly floating foils as well. In view of the very low price point I&lt;br /&gt;guess I was expecting a miracle of sorts--a shave as close as the 390 but&lt;br /&gt;with the better handling and maneuverability of the pivot and flex technology. I should have known better.&lt;br /&gt;The low cost and pivoting head are about the only good things I can say about this shaver. It is ugly, bulky, too long, too curved and cheaply built of all dull plastic. Totally unergonomic. The better maneuverability of the pivoting head is cancelled out, for me, by the length (it&#x27;s about one inch longer than the 390 ). The body does not even have rubberized grips on the side for good handling. The push-up trimmer is located on the back and rises only to the height of the foils, which makes it nearly impossible to effectively edge sideburns. The on/off switch is positioned exactly where my thumb wants to rest causing numerous inadvertant turn-offs during shaving. The foils don&#x27;t float independantly as advertised--they just flex a bit when pushed manually.&lt;br /&gt;And oh, the shave. It&#x27;s not bad, really, but not nearly as good as the 390, which has a much more powerful motor.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x60;ve learned it&#x27;s hard to expect a lot from a shaver at this price point.I would advise anyone looking for a good shave at a reasonable cost to increase the budget a little and buy one of the mid-range models from Braun or Panasonic. They are built better and will last longer. Avoid the temptation of going for a higher-priced Remington (unless it&#x27;s the 390 while they last)--they simply are not built to last.</li>
            <li> still not an expensive great product, but pretty good for the money.&lt;br /&gt;great to be able to wash it out.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. He always had this brand of shaver &amp; he is very happy with his new gift.</li>
            <li> I used a Philips Norelco rotary for 6 months and decided it didn&#x27;t get close enough. Then I used one of these Remingtons for 6 months, dropped it and broke it, and purchased a replacement. After about 14 months I replaced that with an expensive Panasonic which had very high reviews on Amazon. I used the Panasonic for around a year then switched back to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this shaver irritates my skin, which the Panasonic did not. I also wish this shaver had a pop-out trimmer like Panasonic and Philips Norelco shavers--the \\&quot;push-up\\&quot; trimmer is hard to maneuver. However, this shaver is faster and closer than my others ever were, so I plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Awkward to remove the piece holding the screen for cleaning.  In less than 2 weeks,  my fingers eventually slipped and crushed the screen.  Once the screen is bent, you&#x27;re screwed.    Update:  Due to my issue, Remington is sending me new screen/cutters.       I also discovered that if you leave the plastic cap on and press the edges of the cap, it is easier to remove the piece holding the screen (and would make it unlikely that you would accidentally crush the screen).  However, the user manual doesn&#x27;t mention this.   Granted, I still prefer the way older models were designed in which you simply had to press 2 tabs on the sides to remove the piece holding the screens.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing.  It doesn&#x27;t shave anything, and when it does everything is uneven.  I tried to use it for 2 weeks and it just didn&#x27;t cut it.  Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have went cheap on my electric razor purchase.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a electric foil shaver for some time but would only find the rotary style which I don&#x27;t like. When I came across the Remington Pivot and Flex Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Razor at Amazon.com and saw the price I quickly ordered it. I was pleased when it arrived and it was exactly what I was looking for,it works great,just like an old one I had a few years ago. For anyone who likes a no fuss shave this is the razor to get.</li>
            <li> This is now my second shaver just like it.  I had the other for a few years, replacing cutters, but the battery finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I will keep buying this model as it is efficient, functional and definitely inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor on a Friday and received it on a Saturday (great service, Amazon!).  I bought it to replace a Braun that I&#x27;d had less than a year that fell apart.  I have not been disappointed with the Remington, which has given me some of the closest and most comfortable shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Misses a lot.Have to go over same area a few times.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all that matters.  He&#x27;s old, his facial hair is coarse.&lt;br /&gt;It works, and he loves it.  That&#x27;s all that matters to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the electric razors are just about the same.&lt;br /&gt;None of them are going to clean you up in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick one that&#x27;s priced somewhere in-between most and least expensive&lt;br /&gt;Works for Dad, works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington electric shavers for most of my adult life,  and normally get years of use out of each shaver.  Lately, something has changed, and the foil screens  on my last 3 shavers purchased seemed to tear easily.  On this shaver, the screen only lasted for two shaves before ripping.  Most stores that sell Remington products no longer carry the replacement screens, or blades, and the prices charged on the internet sites are almost the same as the purchase price for a new razor.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the foils they seem to pick up my hair type and shave me clean. Better than the Braun from that stand point. I did have to return mine because the pivet point at which the head swivels is actually higher than the foils themselves. On my neck they were uncomfortable as the plastic would scratch along my skin. It is designed in the USA and could easily have been designed without this flaw. Come on American designers we are smarter than this. (aren&#x27;t we?)</li>
            <li> Bought this based of some reviews but am returning it after one test. First, it&#x27;s very loud. Second, and maybe my facial hairs are made of steel, but the shaving action was very poor. Maybe it works on certain other hair types.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY MINE FELL APART</li>
            <li> Product is as ordered, very durable and water proof as advertised. Product was not damaged in any way and works great!!</li>
            <li> I really like the look and feel of this razor. It seems to be well made, holds a good charge, and feels well balanced in the hand. It comes apart easily for cleaning. So, why only 3 stars? Well, it&#x27;s just not that great when it comes to cutting whiskers.  I have a beard and use it only on my neck and cheeks. If I shave every day it does fairly well but takes longer than it should. If I skip a day it takes a lot longer yet. Skip 2 days and I can shave for 15 minutes and it still won&#x27;t pick up everything.  Bottom line - if you have a light beard and shave daily this will do an acceptable job at a low price. Using talc or a talc stick makes it work a whole lot better and actually gives a pretty good shave. But, IMHO those with heavy beards probably will be very disappointed with this razor.</li>
            <li> Everything my husband wanted in a shaver, especially that it can be used corded and cordless. He has always liked the Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> Broke after using it for 10 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several years--I shave while commuting in my car.  Excellent battery life, charges rapidly.  I like the LED indicator light telling you it&#x27;s time to charge.  Easy to clean.  Gets a pretty close shave.  It doesn&#x27;t go into &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; areas well, like under the nose, but every face is different.  Solid product</li>
            <li> Very basic but functional razor..It is my second one as I had one lost by Delta..</li>
            <li> I am using this shaver for several months now and I love it. No problem. 5 more words required but I have nothing to add.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this shaver and it definitely does all one would expect plus the price&lt;br /&gt;is great.  The service was excellent and the product arrived quickly in the sealed original&lt;br /&gt;package.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace an older razor my husband uses. He said the razor part was great! He does not care for the sideburn trimmer. He said it was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver. Gave me a very smooth shave the first time. It is very quiet. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> it shaves about as well as the Braun single head razor, but is much harder to brush clean and I don&#x27;t wish to use water to clean any electrical device. It is worth what I paid for it, but don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying his Remington Pivot --he said &amp;#34;It just as good as my other one which was a Remington MS3-1000&amp;#34;--</li>
            <li> Bought this razor 5 months ago.  Constant problems with head popping off when shaving.  After 5 months the pivot head clips broke and the razor is now useless.  If you feel comfortable paying $40 for a product that is most certainly guaranteed to break within a few months, then this is your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is extremely long.&lt;br /&gt;Pivot head is nice for close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD&lt;br /&gt;Remington so-called warranty is a farce.  No where on their site do they have information on warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Razor dulls very quickly.  After about 10 shaves, you get pulling and shave is not close.&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap plastic parts and clips.  These are built like those $5 battery razors at the checkout counters.</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves as close as my old Remington. I have a beard so I just shave my neck, but I use the pop-up trimmer often on my beard and mustache. I am able to use this shaver quite a few times before recharging. Best of all, if it needs charged, it will still function when plugged in. The plastic protective cover is a little tricky to snap on properly. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had a remington razor before this. It was time to replace it. Going through Amazon&#x27;s list,  I found one that caught my eye. It was the 4790. Having recieved it, in short order, I was anxious to try it out. After charging it over night, it was ready for use. I found the razor worked to my satisfaction and cleaning was simple enough. The trimmer was a bit different as instead of a pop-up this one pushs up. Works for me.</li>
            <li> At first, I was like &amp;#34;shit, this aint shavin nothin&amp;#34;, because I was trying to use it like any other razor. Apparently, this one needs to shave on a dry, not oily face, in circular motions. So it&#x27;s a really weird razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Very clean shave. Turns hairy bigfoots into baby faced bitches&lt;br /&gt;-It will never cut yo face. Like, no kidding. The secondary razor that comes attached might cut you if you use it improperly, but I almost never need to use it because it&#x27;s fo long hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Long battery life with quick charge&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;-Idiot proof instructions&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use. No shaving cream, no skill, just wash up, dry off, and get at it. Totally child proof and shit, it&#x27;s such a smooth and clean and easy shave that it&#x27;s like rubbing a ______ over yo face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Terrible with longer hair. They give you a secondary razor attached to the main body for long hair, but it aint shit. Like, if you got this JESUS style facial hair where evrythang on yo face is like two inches long, you goan have a bad time. Don&#x27;t take this to shaving any hair longer than 1 inch. I swear to god it&#x27;s like rubbing a jagged knife against yoself.</li>
            <li> My favorite!  It&#x27;s my default..</li>
            <li> This razor is very quiet and does a great job of shaving the face and neck. The trim is great.</li>
            <li> Replaced a Remington MS2 280. Shaves just as well but is a little larger and heavier. Quick recharge for (1) shave was a deciding factor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. This razor works just as well as any foil razor on the market, even ones that cost five times as much.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Son&#x27;s birthday. He loves it and it does just what he wanted in an electric shaver. It has a great slide up sideburn trimmer instead of a pop out trimmer. I got a excellent price with free shipping at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my son who was using a razor blade and wanted to try an electric shaver.  He loves it and I doubt he will go back to the razor blade.</li>
            <li> Got it. Charged it. Tried to remove hair with it (shave) and it did nothing. The trimmer blade that popped up did work but the two foils literally did nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. A bit noisy and a bit too big. It does the job nice and fast. It&#x27;s pretty powerful.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what i wanted...quick delivery for a good price</li>
            <li> I have owned a Braun which was as noisey as a chainsaw and gave a lousy shave. My friend bragged about Norelco so I figured it would be just what I needed. Man, was that a mistake. My neck developed a rash every time I used it. I have since bought the Remington and it has the 5 minute quick charge, gives a clean shave, and it is neck friendly. I will review again in 6 months but right now I am a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I am ill and I drop things allot, including electric shavers. I have paid many more dollars for other shavers only to have them explode beyond repair upon impact and when I drop this razor, I am able to repair it myself, (with caregiver assistance) the body of the razor stays intact and only the foil blades need to be put back into the original holders and it still works as per the instructions. The shave is good too, although I only use it to shave my mustache area and use a manual razor to shave the rest, but for me, I am worried about durability and after much trial and error, I have found the Remington Men&#x27;s electric shaver to work the best for me. I have purchased two new units to have on hand just in case.</li>
            <li> Many, many shaves on one charge ( got over 25 shaves on first charge)&lt;br /&gt;Provides excellent shave&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer works well as preshaver.&lt;br /&gt;Big item for me is the worldwide power capability&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the screen cover does not stay attached while travelling</li>
            <li> Initial Problems: 1) removing Plastic head cover takes foll head assembly with it. 2) Initial charging gave flashing green light. I called Remington ccustomer service and was told to grab the cover by the lip on one side and lift; that usually works. and a flashing light means it is already fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;There were two surprises: 1) The trimmer is completely different than shown in the picture online; It does work, but I&#x27;d prefer what I&#x27;d seen. and 2)\\&quot;Easily\\&quot; Cleaning it by holding it under running water is not easy; it consists of some disaassembly first, liquid soap, brushing, and rinsing the parts before reassembly and the final faucet rinse! No thank you; I&#x27;ll brush it out dry instead.&lt;br /&gt;  It does give a very smooth shave, better than my older Remingtons and Norelcos.&lt;br /&gt; Despite initial frustration the ways described above, I am very happy with this shaver; it does a great job.</li>
            <li> mine may be different than yours but it was too big for my liking.  also, it shaved very close on the face but not my neck and you need to have short stubble for it to work well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father, who doesn&#x27;t need a super-close shave every day.  He uses it most of the time and says for the money it works just fine.</li>
