    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Great deal on the pricing from vendor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy my hairdresser told me about this product.</li>
            <li>My curls are more defined and stay beautiful all day without using a diffuser.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure you will be as happy as your hair will be.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>love this shampoo, my curls are nice and shiney, no frizz greatest price around and fast shipping</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, curly in parts and wavy in others</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooo strong that it gave me a headache all day, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash the stuff out of my hair!</li>
            <li>and I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love the Redken Curvaceous shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I love what this product does for my curls when I do my hair curly.</li>
            <li>I do like this shampoo when I wear my hair curly which is most of the time.</li>
            <li>I love it, too.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and the conditioner that matches it.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>My guy is not the kind of guy to purchase special &amp;#34;products&amp;#34; for his hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is in the best shape it&#x27;s been in, in a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and creamy, provides amazing curl definition, lathers just enough to ensure that those of us who miss fun bubbles but don&#x27;t miss their drying capability breathe a contented sigh of happiness, adds moisture, and makes my tresses look pretty amazing, but...the fragrance!</li>
            <li>I purchased the travel size of shampoo and conditioner, so glad I did not buy the full size.</li>
            <li>The lather doesn&#x27;t make the product work any better, but it does make it more visually easy to see how much has gotten into each section of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic for curly hair</li>
            <li>A definite dealbreaker for me, despite its good qualities.</li>
            <li>but I found the opposite; it is a very light weight cream shampoo; it is not supposed to create a lot of suds because it is more like the Wen products, it is a cream shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This product, by the rspected haircare company of Redken, whose products were used by many beauty salons I favored, is intended for unisex daily use, for anyone who has curly, frizzy hair that needs to be tamed and elongated, for loose waves to spiral curls.  </li>
            <li>Redken is a great product, it is a little pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>and/or are willing to spend all of the money for the full product line.</li>
            <li>Just don’t think this shampoo is worth</li>
            <li>its premium price.t think this shampoo is worth its premium price.</li>
            <li>yes, you heard me right).</li>
            <li>and it does not feel right.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw this new line that Redkin came out with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I don’t like its fragrance.</li>
            <li>This would be such a fabulous product if it weren&#x27;t for the over the top, gave me a headache and is definitely a dealbreaker fragrance!!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair full of waves, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>With the old Redken Fresh Curls I could do my hair straight and leave it for 3-4 days before it was greasy and had to be washed again.</li>
            <li>shampoo doesn&#x27;t make a whole lot of lather, which I didn&#x27;t really mind that overly much</li>
            <li>However, when I want to do my hair straight with my straightener</li>
            <li>It also has a very musky smell that reminds me of men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>What really pushed this into the \\&quot;will not use/buy again\\&quot; is that you can&#x27;t really stop with the shampoo and conditioner-</li>
            <li>With this new Curvaceous cream my hair is greasy from the first day.</li>
            <li>My mother and other well-meaning people used always to tell me how many people wished they had curly hair, and got permanents to curl their hair.</li>
            <li>I saw a Redken trio of beauty aids for curly hair, these products in particular, with its eye-catching design, I remembered the hair salons that had used Redken products and decided to try it: the whole trio, in fact.</li>
            <li>The manufacturers state that its formula includes particularly helpful Moringa oil.</li>
            <li>and it takes such a small amount to get good results that it&#x27;s not as pricey as it seems.</li>
            <li>They recommend it be stored in a cool, dry</li>
            <li>stuff smells nice enough in both its conditioner and shampoo form, although the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last nearly as long as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
            <li>I got it thru Amazon because it was sold out where I live.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I have found it just doesn’t hold long enough, I am lucky if it holds for a full day.</li>
            <li>The big issue with these products is that I didn&#x27;t see any positive effects on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wish this product had a different fragrance.</li>
            <li>Conditioned wo leaving my hair too soft and imp.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural oils yet cleans it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad, otherwise this would be a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>have regretted my curly frizzy hair all my life, and have spent many hours and dollars in various beauty salons trying to get it straightened, with results that included horrendously dry hair with breakage and oxidation.</li>
            <li>But here in North Carolina, the American South, with long hot humid summers, as a young woman no longer, I decided the time had come to try to make my peace with the hair with which I was born.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had days where I&#x27;ve dried my hair, started to straighten, and then re-wet my hair trying to rinse it more and ultimately just done it curly because it was so greasy.</li>
            <li>No returns apparently either...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pretty much use the same basic review with both and have a few changes for each.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as daily use friendly as some of the other stuff I&#x27;ve used from other hairstylist locations.</li>
            <li>So over the last few years, I have tried many products to try to preserve my small curls and prevent frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> But his hair was getting dry and brittle and anything but simple.</li>
            <li> I find the results of this Redken product no different than any mass market shampoo I have tried in my never-ending quest to tame my wild and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not typically sensitive to smells, but I couldn&#x27;t handle this one.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and aids those of us with curls to control the frizz.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is extremely musky and smelled like a man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> but I know will bother some other people.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the last Curl line.</li>
            <li> Then, I find that, though this trio of products does give me the small curls I want in my hair, my hair is not as shiny as some other products have made it.</li>
            <li> I know another review has said this shampoo doesn&#x27;t suds, leaves hair limp</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be gentle enough for me to use it daily, as it makes my hair either insanely frizzy or feel somewhat greasy depending on what I do with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to use since my Fresh Curls have been discontinued :(</li>
            <li> The shampoo is a really low lather, I have very thick wavy hair and even with a generous amount of shampoo it was very hard to work into my hair.</li>
            <li> That might not seem bad, but this stuff can get pretty expensive and if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on hair care products or don&#x27;t like to use a lot of stuff, this can be a dealbreaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He was skeptical about buying anything &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; for his hair.</li>
            <li> But I have been disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> I know another review has said this shampoo doesn&#x27;t suds, leaves hair limp but I found the opposite; it is a very light weight cream shampoo; it is not supposed to create a lot of suds because it is more like the Wen products, it is a cream shampoo.  My hair is very fine, curly in parts and wavy in others and I love this shampoo.  It leaves my hair full of waves, soft and shiny.  I ordered several bottles to have on hand.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo, my curls are nice and shiney, no frizz greatest price around and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> This would be such a fabulous product if it weren&#x27;t for the over the top, gave me a headache and is definitely a dealbreaker fragrance!! It&#x27;s rich and creamy, provides amazing curl definition, lathers just enough to ensure that those of us who miss fun bubbles but don&#x27;t miss their drying capability breathe a contented sigh of happiness, adds moisture, and makes my tresses look pretty amazing, but...the fragrance! It&#x27;s sooo strong that it gave me a headache all day, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash the stuff out of my hair! Have never understood why companies feel the need to pump mega-fragrance into products; doesn&#x27;t it make sense that if people are gravitating to sulfate-free, paraben-free products that they might also want not-so-much added fragrance, too? A definite dealbreaker for me, despite its good qualities. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used for curly hair. I Also use the conditioner and no frizz at all. If you have curly or wavy hair  you should these products a try.</li>
            <li> I really wish this product had a different fragrance. Using both the shampoo and conditioner worked well for my hair. Helped some with frizz and manageability. However, the smell is extremely musky and smelled like a man&#x27;s cologne. I did use almost the entire the bottle. Towards the end, it was giving me such a headache that I had to switch. I&#x27;m not typically sensitive to smells, but I couldn&#x27;t handle this one. It&#x27;s too bad, otherwise this would be a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Conditioned wo leaving my hair too soft and imp.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the last Curl line.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of it&#x27;s natural oils yet cleans it.  Fantastic for curly hair</li>
            <li> Love the Redken Curvaceous shampoo. Great deal on the pricing from vendor. Lasts a long time and aids those of us with curls to control the frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redken products for years and I love what this product does for my curls when I do my hair curly. My curls are more defined and stay beautiful all day without using a diffuser. However, when I want to do my hair straight with my straightener there&#x27;s a film that I can&#x27;t get out of my hair!! With the old Redken Fresh Curls I could do my hair straight and leave it for 3-4 days before it was greasy and had to be washed again. With this new Curvaceous cream my hair is greasy from the first day. I&#x27;ve actually had days where I&#x27;ve dried my hair, started to straighten, and then re-wet my hair trying to rinse it more and ultimately just done it curly because it was so greasy. I will finish the bottle I have but will not purchase this again. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to use since my Fresh Curls have been discontinued :(</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was recommended by my hairdresser.  I got it thru Amazon because it was sold out where I live.  It&#x27;s great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I do like this shampoo when I wear my hair curly which is most of the time. If I am going to straighten....I use another shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw this new line that Redkin came out with. I purchased the travel size of shampoo and conditioner, so glad I did not buy the full size. The shampoo is a really low lather, I have very thick wavy hair and even with a generous amount of shampoo it was very hard to work into my hair. I have not noticed any change in my waves/curls and my hair almost seems drier. It also has a very musky smell that reminds me of men&#x27;s cologne. Will not use again.</li>
            <li> My guy is not the kind of guy to purchase special &amp;#34;products&amp;#34; for his hair. He&#x27;s a former Marine and likes to keep things simple. But his hair was getting dry and brittle and anything but simple. The woman who cuts his hair suggested he try this shampoo (rather than the body soap he was using on it--yes, you heard me right). He was skeptical about buying anything &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; for his hair. I bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves it. His hair is softer and actually behaves. I love it, too. Total win/win!</li>
            <li> This does not smell like, nor work like the curvaceous that I buy at the local salon.  There is no scent at all and it does not feel right. No returns apparently either...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy my hairdresser told me about this product. Redken is a great product, it is a little pricey but worth it and it takes such a small amount to get good results that it&#x27;s not as pricey as it seems. I love this shampoo and the conditioner that matches it. My hair is in the best shape it&#x27;s been in, in a long time. I also use an Argan oil for my curls and with the Waves cream from Redken I&#x27;m set to go. My hair is shiny and healthy. Try it and i&#x27;m sure you will be as happy as your hair will be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this along with a review for the conditioner and I&#x27;d like to stress that I&#x27;ve used both of them, so I&#x27;ll pretty much use the same basic review with both and have a few changes for each. The big issue with these products is that I didn&#x27;t see any positive effects on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells nice enough in both its conditioner and shampoo form, although the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last nearly as long as I&#x27;d like it to. This doesn&#x27;t seem to be gentle enough for me to use it daily, as it makes my hair either insanely frizzy or feel somewhat greasy depending on what I do with the shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s not as daily use friendly as some of the other stuff I&#x27;ve used from other hairstylist locations. What really pushed this into the \\&quot;will not use/buy again\\&quot; is that you can&#x27;t really stop with the shampoo and conditioner- the product really only works well if you buy all of the various products in the hair care line, which includes a separate bottle of some hair goop. That might not seem bad, but this stuff can get pretty expensive and if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on hair care products or don&#x27;t like to use a lot of stuff, this can be a dealbreaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t make a whole lot of lather, which I didn&#x27;t really mind that overly much but I know will bother some other people. The lather doesn&#x27;t make the product work any better, but it does make it more visually easy to see how much has gotten into each section of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that hair care products are different depending on which hair type you have, but I&#x27;d probably suggest skipping this unless you&#x27;ve had this before and/or are willing to spend all of the money for the full product line.</li>

This product, by the rspected haircare company of Redken, whose products were used by many beauty salons I favored, is intended for unisex daily use, for anyone who has curly, frizzy hair that needs to be tamed and elongated, for loose waves to spiral curls.  The manufacturers state that its formula includes particularly helpful Moringa oil. They recommend it be stored in a cool, dry place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have regretted my curly frizzy hair all my life, and have spent many hours and dollars in various beauty salons trying to get it straightened, with results that included horrendously dry hair with breakage and oxidation. My mother and other well-meaning people used always to tell me how many people wished they had curly hair, and got permanents to curl their hair. I looked – politely, I hope—disbelieving. But here in North Carolina, the American South, with long hot humid summers, as a young woman no longer, I decided the time had come to try to make my peace with the hair with which I was born. So over the last few years, I have tried many products to try to preserve my small curls and prevent frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw a Redken trio of beauty aids for curly hair, these products in particular, with its eye-catching design, I remembered the hair salons that had used Redken products and decided to try it: the whole trio, in fact. I like a couple of things about this shampoo: that it is low lather and requires only one shampoo.  But I have been disappointed in this product. Firstly, I don’t like its fragrance. Then, I find that, though this trio of products does give me the small curls I want in my hair, my hair is not as shiny as some other products have made it. Finally, I have found it just doesn’t hold long enough, I am lucky if it holds for a full day. I find the results of this Redken product no different than any mass market shampoo I have tried in my never-ending quest to tame my wild and curly hair. Just don’t think this shampoo is worth its premium price.t think this shampoo is worth its premium price.</li>
