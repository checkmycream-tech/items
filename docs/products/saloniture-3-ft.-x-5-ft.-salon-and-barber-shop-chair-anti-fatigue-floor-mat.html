            <li>:}</li>
            <li>What I like the most about these mats is that they are light and flexible.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s time to sweep and or vac, they are easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>I am not a barber and enjoy standing at my desk.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to stand on, huge, easy to clean and sweep hair off.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my small salon..</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd time ordering the barber mats from Mix Wholesale, and every time I have had a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The one thing that does bug me is the SUPER matte finish.</li>
            <li>Just right cushion</li>
            <li>I really like these!</li>
            <li>It actually had damage to the foam top when I unpacked it.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable to stand on for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed with this product</li>
            <li>Way better than expected.</li>
            <li>but this is a bit more that I expected,</li>
            <li>but they are brand new.</li>
            <li>This is a very comfortable matte, but it does produce a lot of air bubbles and the edges of the matte lifts up and a lot of my clients almost trip on the edge which is NOT SAFE for your clients at all.</li>
            <li>The mat is soft thick and very comfortable</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow.</li>
            <li>To be honest I&#x27;m not happy with this the mat shown in the picture is no the same that they send me is not even close.</li>
            <li>So heavy and thick , feels so good standing on it</li>
            <li>But it goes from a black color to a light grey, with in days.  </li>
            <li>slides a little but for the money well worth it.</li>
            <li>Not too shiny a kind of dull look compared to my other one!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re huge, not recommended for a small space at all ..only for  an open space</li>
            <li>Next time I will get a bit thicker, this one is not thick enough, but I like it otherwise.</li>
            <li>I am interested in whether the sides will stay down and not flip up.  </li>

            <li> Perfect Companion for my Stand Up Desk. I am not a barber and enjoy standing at my desk. Just right cushion</li>
            <li> Great quality, looks sturdy and feels great</li>
            <li> Great for the price!! Would order again.</li>
            <li> Yhe issue is the video secu is too small I need to send them back to so I can gate the big one thank everything was ok just the tv stands</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter she&#x27;s a hairstylist and sometimes she works or home cause she has home station, she was happy with a nice mat at home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price. Just not the material I&#x27;m used to over the years in the salon business. It will have to work for now. No I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied,did not like the type of finish on top,hair is very hard to get off of it</li>
            <li> slides a little but for the money well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars because it feels comfortable on the feet but looks very different from the picture it is not attractive for an upscale salon you can see how they sealed it together it goes all the way around the Matt which customers will see looks very generic and very different from what they show you in the picture very disappointed</li>
            <li> Not too shiny a kind of dull look compared to my other one! But feels great!</li>
            <li> I love my chair  it&#x27;s the best thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd time ordering the barber mats from Mix Wholesale, and every time I have had a pleasant experience. Easy to order, good price, great product.... 👍 👍 👍</li>
            <li> It could of been better but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with my purchase of these mats</li>
            <li> This is a very comfortable matte, but it does produce a lot of air bubbles and the edges of the matte lifts up and a lot of my clients almost trip on the edge which is NOT SAFE for your clients at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Great size and flattened out immediately</li>
            <li> I ordered 3..perfect for my salon...it came rolled up, but after  a day or so it laid completely flat...they are  bigger than what I expected...they&#x27;re huge, not recommended for a small space at all ..only for  an open space</li>
            <li> It looks like it will work out, didn&#x27;t know it had a space for the styling chair.  I am interested in whether the sides will stay down and not flip up.  It has been done for a week; it seems to be laying ok.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great mat! The only reason people could be having problems with the edges not laying down is because they aren&#x27;t laying it down on the correct side.</li>
            <li> To be honest I&#x27;m not happy with this the mat shown in the picture is no the same that they send me is not even close. I&#x27;m very dissapointed with this product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for work at the barbershop. He loves it. It supports his feet well. The price was also great</li>
            <li> These look fantastic in our salon!  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my small salon.. just enough cushion to keep my legs and back from killing after a long day. Arrived sooner than expected. ..</li>
            <li> Great product...Great price! I was a little disappointed with the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; being more of a charcoal color. Because if this, I will have to replace even my good ones in order for them to match. :}</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow. I ordered this product for my home studio. It was delivered 2 days later. I am so extremely happy with my purchase. It is comfortable to stand on, huge, easy to clean and sweep hair off. Matte finish,  and a total bang for my buck. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!  Salon owner,  By far, one of the best mats ever purchased. Great quality. Way better than expected. Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Mats don&#x27;t lay flat. Makes it hard to move around the salon. They don&#x27;t look good either.</li>
            <li> super plush, perfect!</li>
            <li> The mat is ok! It does help your feet and knees. But it goes from a black color to a light grey, with in days.  When you open the package, there&#x27;s a letter saying that the mat will flatten out in a week. That&#x27;s a lie. It&#x27;s been almost a month and the mat has NOT flatten out. I&#x27;m always tripping all over it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mat.  I use it for Barbering when I&#x27;m in the shop.</li>
            <li> What I like the most about these mats is that they are light and flexible. When it&#x27;s time to sweep and or vac, they are easy to manipulate. I have not had any problem with the mats laying down at the corners or staying in place. I like the color and slight texture. The hair does seem to stick to them a bit but they are brand new. We&#x27;ll see how they hold up.</li>
            <li> I really like these! The price was amazing and they are easy to clean...way easier than mats I paid triple for!</li>
            <li> Mat was damaged when I recieved it like it had been cut up</li>
            <li> Im very unhappy bout these matts them edges stil wont lay flat al the way it bein 5 months</li>
            <li> Very happy with the mats in my shop</li>
            <li> There awesome comfortable great for any shop.</li>
            <li> So heavy and thick , feels so good standing on it</li>
            <li> The mat is soft thick and very comfortable</li>
            <li> Very pleased customer!!!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my salon</li>
            <li> Works great! Great quality easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Great mat and good size.</li>
            <li> This mat s just like any other, only a little corner didn&#x27;t fully flatten out but its nothing noticeable. The one thing that does bug me is the SUPER matte finish. I like matte finishes but this is a bit more that I expected, but over all a good mat!</li>
            <li> Next time I will get a bit thicker, this one is not thick enough, but I like it otherwise.</li>
            <li> The mat is very comfortable and waterproof, but it is not as durable as represented.  It actually had damage to the foam top when I unpacked it.  I have chosen to keep it regardless because I need to subject it to a lot of wear and I know it won&#x27;t stay perfect anyway.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable floor mat and price was excellent</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to stand on for long periods of time.</li>
