            <li>GREAT product,,,,Really allows for a dry to the touch, no smears or smudges, manicure in 20 minutes or so, helped by the oily finish.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this, I have three kids and don&#x27;t have the time to wait for my nails to dry, yet I love to do my nails and this</li>
            <li>Boy were the reviews right.</li>
            <li>Love this quick dry.</li>
            <li>it helps the manicure last longer and makes your cuticles look healthy.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, but I don&#x27;t like the oily feel after it is on.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It comes with a lot more than other drying drops.</li>
            <li>however occasionally it turns my top coat a milky white...</li>

            <li>It really works and dry nails to fast</li>
            <li>You will still need to let your full manicure (3-4 coats of polish and base coat) cure before you clean the house,  but you can do a manicure repair (polish and top coat) and read in bed and then sleep without getting sheet prints.</li>
            <li>but my manicure is holding up extremely well for the first week.</li>
            <li>Not only did my nails dry fast</li>

            <li> Not only does it dry your polish (through all coats) -</li>
            <li> But of course after the polish dried you can wash your hands</li>
            <li> I even bring it to the salon so they can use this and not the spray they usually  apply.</li>
