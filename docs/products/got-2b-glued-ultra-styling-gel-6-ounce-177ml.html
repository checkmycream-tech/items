            <li>The 2nd best part is the cost...</li>
            <li>I love all the Got2B products, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great if you know your hair wont be disturbed too much during the day, but otherwise, i would suggest using the inPLAY sculpting paste.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This mohawk gel is for my sons hair and it is such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I have used this companies hair glue for a while and thought a light gel with max hold would be better.</li>
            <li>This works way better than the original glue they have.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>it was easy to clean from my hands and to wash out of my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great gel, but I still prefer the yellow tube version.</li>
            <li>It is not a &#x27;solid hold&#x27; but is dang good.</li>
            <li>so I put some of this in my hands and rubbed my hands together and gently go over the top of my hair and all of the stray hairs stay in place all day.</li>
            <li>I have to be quick because it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Why pay more if the product works the same or better......</li>
            <li>Shampoo takes it out quickly and he says it doesn&#x27;t hurt when it&#x27;s being taken out.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and stays strong.</li>
            <li>this product is good for sensitive skin, my son has baby eczema and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My son loves his mohawk, but finding the right styling products for it can be a hassle.</li>
            <li>His mohawk is large, and a lot of products don&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for making it easy to stock up on this item.... and save me from spending $ 30.00 for the same amount at a salon....</li>
            <li>It kept her fine hair slicked back all day.</li>
            <li>This hair gel is no joke, it really does hold all day.</li>
            <li>really works, hair wont move</li>
            <li>it wasnt really strong, like the ones i bought from Walgreens, it feels weak &amp; i needed to apple more to my hair in oder for it to work....</li>
            <li>I received the item quickly and the next day styled my hair with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product..</li>
            <li>That is quite a feat, as she is six years old and doesn&#x27;t stop to worry about messing up her hair.</li>
            <li>Gel holds for a whole entire day.</li>
            <li>This is a bit more watery and is more difficult to style short hair than the yellow tube.</li>

            <li> This on the other hand when wet would become frizzy and pliable and stay that way.</li>
            <li> Granted my glue would due that if you went heavy</li>
            <li> I sometimes have little hairs sticking up by my bangs</li>

            <li> My little one is a toddler and he pulls at his hair, sweats, runs around all day and it stays in place!</li>
            <li> This is my gel to style my spiky hair everyday!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this stuff</li>
            <li> but once your re-wet it would be as hard as stone.</li>
            <li> Done in 30 seconds or less!!!</li>
            <li> It keeps my fauxhawk in place without being as stiff and doesn&#x27;t flake or get weird.  </li>
            <li> all it did was make my hair greasy it SUCKS!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> left my hair looking greasy</li>
            <li> Bought this for my short-haired daughter&#x27;s ballet recital. It kept her fine hair slicked back all day. That is quite a feat, as she is six years old and doesn&#x27;t stop to worry about messing up her hair.</li>
            <li> This works well, good hold and comes out easily with shampoo. It is not a &#x27;solid hold&#x27; but is dang good. It is not as limp as a pomade and not as stiff as wax.</li>
            <li> This ultra glued gel is the best! It works for spikes, stiff curls, etc. It works very well, and stays strong. I would recommend it to anyone who wants great gel and great hair! It is easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> Good hold and great smelling, except that I got flakes on my hair couple of hours after applying. nevertheless, good product</li>
            <li> When i straighten my hair I sometimes have little hairs sticking up by my bangs so I put some of this in my hands and rubbed my hands together and gently go over the top of my hair and all of the stray hairs stay in place all day.</li>
            <li> This works way better than the original glue they have.  It keeps my fauxhawk in place without being as stiff and doesn&#x27;t flake or get weird.  Much more pliable and easier to work with.  Goes on like gel, hardens like glue, but still blows in the wind a bit.</li>
            <li> I style my hair every day! I have a hard time finding this stuff so I checked Amazon. It works really well and has a very firm hold. I have to be quick because it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The greatest Firm hair gel that doesn&#x27;t smell horrible. The 2nd best part is the cost... Great product and I have been using it for a long time... The only draw back is it is hard to sometimes find this exact product. Glued is different than their other products but the packaging is very similar.... Thank you Amazon for making it easy to stock up on this item.... and save me from spending $ 30.00 for the same amount at a salon.... Why pay more if the product works the same or better......</li>
            <li> I HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! all it did was make my hair greasy it SUCKS! it is a wast of money and my hair is still greasy! DO NOT GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  and would not give it 1 star if i didnt have to!</li>
            <li> My son loves his mohawk, but finding the right styling products for it can be a hassle. His mohawk is large, and a lot of products don&#x27;t work right. Some gels or glues take too long to set and he hates having to stay still for it (he&#x27;s only 6). it&#x27;s worse when some gels/glues won&#x27;t make the ends stand up straight and they droop over. This one is perfect. I damp his hair just a little and then style it up. It takes just a couple of minutes and doesn&#x27;t leave flakes or white streaks. It starts to harden within a couple of minutes and stays that way all day. Shampoo takes it out quickly and he says it doesn&#x27;t hurt when it&#x27;s being taken out. I love all the Got2B products, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> This hair gel is no joke, it really does hold all day. it doesn&#x27;t take too much to style your hair, and it was&#x27;t very expensive. it was easy to clean from my hands and to wash out of my hair. There is one problem that i have with this gel, and it&#x27;s that it flakes. I&#x27;m a highschool student, and in my sports training class i need to dress out. after the class, my hair always seems to have flakes in it, and my friends said that &amp;#34;it looks like i have dandruff.&amp;#34; i&#x27;m not saying that the gel is bad or doesnt work. it&#x27;s great if you know your hair wont be disturbed too much during the day, but otherwise, i would suggest using the inPLAY sculpting paste.</li>
            <li> For the price and shipping, this is the vest deal ever. Gel holds for a whole entire day. This is the best gel I ever used. I ordered two boxes if gel...</li>
            <li> We used to use &amp;#34;Spike It&amp;#34; hair cement until we couldn&#x27;t find it anymore and then decided to try this. This gel is nice to work with and smells great and does a good job. I only wish it would dry faster because it stays wet a little too long for my taste.</li>
            <li> it wasnt really strong, like the ones i bought from Walgreens, it feels weak &amp; i needed to apple more to my hair in oder for it to work.... I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend.  He says he likes it.  No complaints.  I do like that it&#x27;s not sticky, oily or heavy when he puts it on.</li>
            <li> I have used this companies hair glue for a while and thought a light gel with max hold would be better. I received the item quickly and the next day styled my hair with it. I am in the military and I have to take my hat on and off all day. This gel claimed no flakes but by mid day I had some flaking issues. Granted my glue would due that if you went heavy but once your re-wet it would be as hard as stone. This on the other hand when wet would become frizzy and pliable and stay that way. Not impressed and will stick with my glue.</li>
            <li> really works, hair wont move</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. This mohawk gel is for my sons hair and it is such a wonderful product! Such a time saver... Ya just squeeze a dollop of gel on u hands, rub hands together then swipe hands up a couple of times to pull the hair into a mohawk position and VOILA! Done in 30 seconds or less!!! Amazing stuff! My little one is a toddler and he pulls at his hair, sweats, runs around all day and it stays in place! It&#x27;s also great bc this product is good for sensitive skin, my son has baby eczema and sensitive skin so this stuff is AWESOME! 5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> This is a great gel, but I still prefer the yellow tube version. This is a bit more watery and is more difficult to style short hair than the yellow tube. I will still use it as a backup in case I travel or run out of the yellow tube.</li>
            <li> This is my gel to style my spiky hair everyday! I can&#x27;t live without this product..Its probably one of the best gels I have used, and I have used A LOT!</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this, I have tried other brands and he says it is not the same. Good price for prime customers</li>
