            <li>I have been using this fragnance for more than 5 years nonstop, and I finished more than 5 bottles purchased from Saks Fifth Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>

            <li>Thanks for a good product and value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, light, sexy, and exotic.</li>

            <li>Hope they are not discontinuing it-&lt;br /&gt;light floral/spice fragrance which is fine for any</li>
            <li>This perfume is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love it and suggest it for any women that wants to feel sexy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this fragrance at this price.</li>
            <li>I first heard of this when Kelly Rippa mentioned on her show that it was her favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, I&#x27;ve been hooked since I first caught a wiff at a Sephora store.</li>
            <li>They were right!</li>

            <li>It smells great and lasts a very long time!!</li>
            <li>° SUPER FAST SHIPPING!!</li>
            <li>and it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>This buy on Amazon was so great, it was unbelievable.</li>
            <li>It smells the same, but it appears to contain more alcohol...</li>
            <li>I tried it without smelling it first and it is everything I was told.</li>
            <li>It smells so amazingly good and last a really long time.</li>
            <li>Fresh, not sweet, and elegant.</li>
            <li>for which I paid a very high price!this</li>
            <li>and the price had  really dropped-</li>
            <li>The first note is similar but it changed to something else quickly.</li>
            <li>When I received it from Amazon and tried it though, quickly I realized there is something different.</li>
            <li>Very light and fresh, but still heavy enough to be a nighttime fragrance.</li>
            <li>per others, the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to match the normal retail package</li>
            <li>The packaging was half-opened with scotch tape added later to try to hold various parts of it closed without any kind of plastic wrapper</li>
            <li>the real thing is just a bit different from the sample i had.</li>
            <li>It does not smell anywhere near what it is supposed to smell like.</li>
            <li>So I shopped a long while watching prices as I don&#x27;t really wear perfume anymore</li>

            <li> I was so excited to find this fragrance at this price. It has been my favorite for a while. When I received it from Amazon and tried it though, quickly I realized there is something different. The first note is similar but it changed to something else quickly. It also doesn&#x27;t last even 1 hour when my usual Essence lasted for days. Maybe it stayed on their shelves too long. Displeased, I called Amazon and they refunded my money with apologies! Their customer service is what keeps me coming back.</li>
            <li> This perfume is fantastic. I had smelled it for the first time in a Sephora in Chicago, and silly me didn&#x27;t buy it. So when I got home to Canada, full of regret, I was happy to see it available online. It smells so amazingly good and last a really long time. Very light and fresh, but still heavy enough to be a nighttime fragrance. A little expensive, but who cares? So good.</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell, as it did not smell like the one I smelled in Nieman Marcus.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> Essence Narciso Rodriguez By Narciso Rodriguez For Women Eau De Parfum&lt;br /&gt;ESSENCE NARCISO RODRIGUEZ For Women Eau De Parfum - very good</li>
            <li> and the price had  really dropped- great deal! Hope they are not discontinuing it-&lt;br /&gt;light floral/spice fragrance which is fine for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;Others ask what I am wearing....</li>

            <li> one of my favorites :-)</li>
            <li> My wife loves this essence. Wears it all the time. Thanks for a good product and value.</li>
            <li> I love wearing the bath gel and cologne together.</li>
            <li> I first heard of this when Kelly Rippa mentioned on her show that it was her favorite perfume. So I shopped a long while watching prices as I don&#x27;t really wear perfume anymore but sometimes its appropriate and I don&#x27;t want to overwhelm anyone around me. This does not leave a heavy scent. Love it! What I bought will last me the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> The packaging was half-opened with scotch tape added later to try to hold various parts of it closed without any kind of plastic wrapper/seal around it like most have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per others, the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to match the normal retail package either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add insult to injury, it&#x27;s not even possible to return, at least not via the normal channels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the other reviewers comment, I&#x27;m going to try calling Amazon to see if I can get a refund.</li>
            <li> I got it fast and safe. I love this perfume. Thank you for great serves. I will order more stuff with you.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance of all time. Have used it for a number of years. Fresh, not sweet, and elegant.</li>
            <li> My wifey loves it. I earned handsome points....</li>
            <li> ...but dries to this wonderful fresh scent. the real thing is just a bit different from the sample i had. the sample was not so strong in the begining. but both dry and smell the same after a while.</li>
            <li> I had one which was about to finish for which I paid a very high price!this was a very good price and I definetly would recommend it for a friend</li>
            <li> love the scent and get lots of compliments. Great price!</li>
            <li> I love Essence by Narciso Rodriguez. It has been my favorite for a while. When I received it from Amazon and tried it, I realized that it&#x27;s fake... it wears off too soon… It&#x27;s not similar to the one I buy at the Department Stores. Very disappointing!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent! It&#x27;s clean, light, sexy, and exotic. There is a but, and it&#x27;s that the frangrace wears off too soon.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most beautiful fragrance I&#x27;ve ever had it&#x27;s soft and very sexy I love it and suggest it for any women that wants to feel sexy.</li>
            <li> Essence, the \\&quot;focal point\\&quot; is what I expected. It smells good, but not as good as the sample that was given to me in the department store. I specifically searched for this perfume because I was mesmerized by the alluring fragrance of the sample. It smells the same, but it appears to contain more alcohol...a harsh scent, not warm and inviting. When it&#x27;s gone, I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> She is now wearing it as her daily perfume.  She also wears Chance as her evening fragrance so you can compare.</li>
            <li> I was buying this perfume for my wife at Saks 5th for $125 and it is well worth it. It smells so good. Got it for $80 at amazon...great deal!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because Kelly Rippa mentioned it on her show and talked about how great people said she smelled. They were right! It smells great and lasts a very long time!! I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this scent, I&#x27;ve been hooked since I first caught a wiff at a Sephora store. But in Sephora, a 3.3 oz. was around $120. Way too expensive! This buy on Amazon was so great, it was unbelievable. The scent is a musk with rose petals and sandalwood. Beautiful and Romantic. &amp;lt;3 Thank you!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Excellent Perfume - 100% Authentic!!! ° SUPER FAST SHIPPING!!! ° Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragnance for more than 5 years nonstop, and I finished more than 5 bottles purchased from Saks Fifth Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I received my fist bottle from Amazon, there is no doubt in my mind that this is fake. It does not smell anywhere near what it is supposed to smell like. If I could give it zero stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame it is not returnable.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my sisters, one of they favor Perfume and I like the smell I will get one myself.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice smell.  I get compliments on it everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the fragrance.  I gave it some time to see if I could/would get used to it but only got worse.  Three people I asked did not like it on me either.  I was disappointed that I could not return it!</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful, fresh and light.  I was so disappointed that it only lasted a few minutes.  You have to keep reapplying it during the day to smell it.</li>
            <li> it is a wonderful scent.  I receive many compliments on this perfume.  I tried it without smelling it first and it is everything I was told.</li>
