            <li>I started using the BP treatment in December, and by March my acne was 95% gone, and my skin was beautiful as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>They all work great for me.  </li>
            <li>Over time, my skin became even toned and lines have greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>Also great on-the-spot treatment.  </li>
            <li>This product works great.  </li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>A great product to lighten acne erythematous mark.</li>
            <li>The lotion doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it absorbs into my skin very nicely.</li>
            <li>But it controls it very effectively.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled!</li>
            <li>I already use the acne treatment and it works good.</li>
            <li>I have since added this to my routine, along w/ the cleanser and BP; and I am very happy w/ the quick results.  </li>
            <li>I love their customer support, and I will continue buying from them again!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll help your face more than you know!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE acne.org!</li>
            <li>Love these two products!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels really nice and tingly on my skin.</li>
            <li>Well I didnt liked the BP as well...</li>
            <li>Nothing but good things to say at this point :)</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s good to get my AHA in without also causing more breakouts.</li>
            <li>It just feels nice,</li>
            <li>I am thrilled</li>
            <li>I really liked this poduct</li>
            <li>Not too fancy but downright effective.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!!</li>
            <li>But it is worth to buy!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this as it completely cleared up my friends acne, she literally has perfect skin now.</li>
            <li>It is more effective for me than BP.  </li>
            <li>Also, I noticed that my skin looks smoother and has a nice healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>really good product that gives smooth skin</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have tried for acne!</li>
            <li>Skin is clear and bright!!</li>
            <li>very quickly clearing up my acne!</li>
            <li>I still break out here and there, but for the most part this keeps it in check amazingly well...and for CHEAP! :-)</li>
            <li>I did not believe the reviews since it seemed so good to be true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as effective as the BP is, it isn&#x27;t quite perfect because it makes your skin very dry</li>
            <li>Hmm this item is okay, I guess.</li>
            <li>but once it dries, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>, the non express postage to au is greater than the cost of the product itself.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t until a change in birth control that my skin began to break out more often.</li>
            <li>I hope I continue to see more progress as I continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>I had a lump which did not go away after many weeks.</li>
            <li>I wish it would have been the miracle product for me as it has been for so many others.</li>
            <li>Best to use at night as others have said since AHA can make your skin sensitive to light.  </li>
            <li>Every day after a morning shower, i apply it to my back and shoulders, (so awesome to not have a bleaching effect to my clothes) and then go on with my day.</li>
            <li>This stuff is all great quality and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but I love this for my body acne.</li>
            <li>For some reason it works better for my body than benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and</li>
            <li>I really love this product but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because I still get breakouts.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be better for acne prevention.</li>
            <li>Before the pimple even came out I put aha cream on top of it.</li>
            <li>I can safely say i will be using this product for life.</li>
            <li>LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product</li>
            <li>and it does help u with acne scars! :)</li>
            <li>Try different combinations, quantities, and frequencies of products that you think are best.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because I started breaking out more.</li>
            <li>Love acne.org products but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I wouldn&#x27;t say the product is for everyone, but I&#x27;m sure it works for some.</li>
            <li>Skin looks more healthy and moisturized as usage continues.</li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>
            <li>I use the whole acne.org regimen and I&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I used to use the whole acne.org regimen, and it worked GREAT for years.</li>
            <li>It does exfoliation, but I&#x27;m happy with just the normal 3 step regimen.</li>
            <li>My skin is finally clear and beautiful.</li>
            <li>My skin now is very smooth and the skin tone is fantastic.   </li>
            <li>I love Acne.orgs products, they are simle, easy to use, and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this inexpensive effective product!</li>
            <li>Now to get to the most important part, my marks.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, I need this in my skin care regimen as it has helped improved my skin texture significantly.</li>
            <li>This AHA+ by Acne.org is really cool!</li>
            <li>I use it as a spot treatment for any pimple or lump that develops - not just on my face, and they go away very quickly, in 12 hours</li>
            <li>This is the BEST acne cream, hands down.</li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t helped with a fine line i&#x27;m developing between my eyebrows either.  </li>
            <li>I was fine with the benzoyl peroxide and the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine at exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>Post-acne marks have started fading much more quickly.    </li>
            <li>I am super glad that i found this product.</li>
            <li>As a huge fan of Dan Kern&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide gel for acne, I got this AHA to add to my face routine, but then found it made no difference to my face.  </li>
            <li>This is a HUGE tube by the way.</li>
            <li>but after a month i could already see a huge amount of improvement.</li>
            <li>I started up the acne.org regime again and within a few weeks my skin looked great (for my age!)  </li>
            <li>keeps your skin smooth</li>
            <li>Awesome product it helped dried up my break out.</li>
            <li>great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many good reviews of this product before I finally decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li>but other wise it works so well!</li>
            <li>I originally came from a tropical country to work in the US and i came during winter in Minnesota.  </li>
            <li>I noticed significant peeling of skin, which I guess meant exfoliation worked.</li>
            <li>A bit watery in consistency, better come with a warning so that the first time user would not squeeze it out.</li>
            <li>This is such a good product and I would deffo recommend to anyone who has acne whether it is light or severe acne.</li>
            <li>The hormone medication is the most effective, but once I stopped taking it, the acne comes back.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s best for those with normal to dry skin because of the lotion texture.  </li>
            <li>You probably shouldn&#x27;t put this on right before you lay out on the beach!    </li>
            <li>But this item is good if you have big, liquidy pustules or if you have a zit coming out, it helps.</li>
            <li>My only concern is that it is so good at exfoliating that if I use it once a day I tend to get</li>
            <li>It feels much softer, smoother, and more even-toned.</li>
            <li>You can use it as a full face moisturizer, or a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>It works more like an exfoliator, quite gentle for oily skin, exfoliates well, fades my acne scars a bit.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist prescribed me Retin A and Hydroquinone cream which is supposed to be the good standard of Hyperpigmentaion removal.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Just in time for me to be able to be poolside on vacation without so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad price for AHA+ of this quality and this anount.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product along with The Regimen and so far it&#x27;s been working pretty good.</li>
            <li>It has a mild &#x27;chemically&#x27; smell which fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Apply it and GENTLY massage it into your skin until absorbed (shouldn&#x27;t take more than three minutes, if that).</li>
            <li>Also since it&#x27;s a generous size it doesn&#x27;t run out too quick.</li>
            <li>my skin was not turning over as quickly b/c of aging.  </li>
            <li>Can sting a bit upon application, but that fades quickly.</li>
            <li>It does not stain your clothes, or your bed sheets, and adsorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s better is that the AHA prevents new acne to form.  </li>
            <li>the three step regimen is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take much time at all.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well!</li>
            <li>the good part is this item is large and it last.</li>
            <li>and you may very well need to dilute it with a little lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for smooth soft skin asap.</li>
            <li>love so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had more clear and moisturized skin and plan on using this product forever since it is also useful for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better to use this product a night, because AHA makes your skin sensitive to the sunlight.</li>
            <li>i recommend this product to people who have tries benzyl peroxide and have skin that has basically become immune to it, works really good</li>
            <li>(still worth it of course)</li>
            <li>Behold, my face looks better and better, very smooth to the touch and the plugged pores are few and far between.</li>
            <li>Like I&#x27;m sure it will last me a full year.</li>
            <li>This works great for getting all that dry skin off and making your skin glow and that even complextion, makes your skin also feel baby soft</li>
            <li>I think it didn&#x27;t really help at all to be honest, my pores are still clogged, same size, no difference at all after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Of course everyone has different types of skin and it may not be suitable for everyone, but I have to say it does not hurt to try because at first I did not even like this myself, but I have learned how to use it and how often.</li>
            <li>They are very responsible and trustworthy.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and now my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first time I got this delivery though, it leaked all over the packaging.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!  </li>
            <li>This works very well!  </li>
            <li>and since then my skin has gotten a lot better with occasional break outs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glowing!</li>
            <li>I also use this as a spot treament for deep acne cysts and it clears them in a couple days (when they used to take a month or more).</li>
            <li>i have had this problem for some years, and usually it is only better in the summer months when i can get some sun.</li>
            <li>I used a very similar product in the past, Jan Marini Factor A+ lotion, w/ good results; but after time it caused more problems than it was worth.  </li>
            <li>must mention that I am not using it exactly as prescribed.  </li>
            <li>At first it seemed that it wasn&#x27;t working</li>
            <li>and recently it was a lot more.  </li>
            <li>I never could actually be 100% sure that stuff</li>
            <li>I use it on my back and shoulders where I had acne for many years growing up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not kidding--this was probably the best careless purchase I have ever made in my life.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the fact that this is so affordable and comes in such a large size.</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t react positively.</li>
            <li>That is the real reason I bought this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>It cleared up all my post acne marks, if you&#x27;re looking for the one that really works, this is the real deal!</li>
            <li>I use it, as directed, and I strongly recommend you do the same, too.</li>
            <li>Dan - if you read these reviews, PLEASE never let some large company buy you out</li>
            <li>It took around 3 months eventually all of the large pimples and redness all went away.</li>
            <li>I would get small flakes from time to time, and as I flicked them, a nice plump blackhead would come right out.</li>
            <li>it was working fine until last 4 months</li>
            <li>Decent price for the size!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for consistent results.</li>
            <li>the pimple is huge and red.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise and ensuing glee, I discovered that AHA is recommended for the treatment of acne, something I&#x27;ve also been blessed with.</li>
            <li>I tried it before my shin was ready and think I gave myself a skin burn.</li>
            <li>much breakouts...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really informative and you don&#x27;t have to register to read.     </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>so I use it for my chest and back to stay acne free.</li>
            <li>b/c I can control how much</li>
            <li>I started using the AHA at the beginning of the regimen, b/c I am already very accustom to AHA.  </li>
            <li>and you dont need a whole lot</li>
            <li>the gentle way you apply this just makes it feel like a treat every time I use it.</li>
            <li>and it was very flakey and sore.  </li>
            <li>anyways since then i found a product on [...] or at walmart called stress free triple acting toner and hydrating acne treatment.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference after using this product.</li>
            <li>I use the acne.org system which has really cleared up my skin, so I don&#x27;t find the need to reach for this product too often.</li>
            <li>This stuff actual makes my face not red in the T zone and more calm</li>
            <li>think the AHA is what really makes it work.  </li>
            <li>My spots have not completely faded but my areas of unblemished skin is flawless and I dont break out as much as I usually do.</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this to people for clearing up spots and aftermath of acne.</li>
            <li>Clears up scars extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>It can treat that kind of red acne on my back and face.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>but then my back acne just returned again , though it has significantly reduced my arm acne as well</li>
            <li>but I would still keep using it cuz it is better than other products yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy, no harsh smell, and it works very, very well.</li>
            <li>This product is pleasant to use and probably is helping to moisturize my skin, which is being dried out by hitting it with the big guns (hefty applications of the Acne-org benzoyl peroxide).  </li>
            <li>The AHA+ cleared my chest completely up in a week--right in time for the first day of school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My facial acne is not bad at all</li>
            <li>Other AHA-containing creams are way more expensive than this, so this is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 weeks now, and I&#x27;m sure this tube will last me several months.    </li>
            <li>but it was only mild flaking.</li>
            <li>I tryed many different types of acne treatment including proactiv and numerous prescriptions.</li>
            <li>I only use the AHA and a mild wash.</li>
            <li>I have on my shoulders and chest, actually making it look smoother and more like actual skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the products and follow the advice of how to  use them.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going into my sophomore year of high school, and I have struggled with acne since fifth or sixth grade.</li>
            <li>highly, highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to get rid of their acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoother and I believe that all my little whiteheads and blackheads that used to turn into zits/acne like state have mostly gone away.</li>
            <li>I do wish it was a little more affordable</li>
            <li>and i can already tell the redness and old spots are already going away!!</li>
            <li>Benzyl Peroxide is a generous size, but after months of use my skin wouldn&#x27;t clear completely and it became very, VERY</li>
            <li>It came quick, nice little bonus and it was larger than what I expected, another nice little bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have tried absolutely everything apart from Accutane and it just wouldn&#x27;t quite clear.....</li>
            <li>If you need something to really get your skin clear, use this.  </li>
            <li>Also after using this product it will make your skin very touchable and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft and brighter looking, it really does even out the tones of your face.</li>
            <li>overall, it&#x27;s worth trying, just don&#x27;t get your hopes up</li>
            <li>After a few months of use, I notice my skin to be softer and more radiant.  </li>
            <li>I had one huge ugly pimple right splat on my chest that just wouldn&#x27;t go away, and it was visible in just about every shirt I own.</li>
            <li>As one of the previous reviews said it does make your skin more sensitive to sunlight/UVA/UVB.</li>
            <li>I have complete and utter faith in you, and the best day of my life (as far as cosmetic discoveries go) was the day I blindly stumbled upon acne.org.</li>
            <li>When I went to order a new bottle of BP, I saw the new AHA+ treatment and figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>I would advise to only use this product at night as it makes your face SUPER red and very shiny.</li>
            <li>If my skin gets super dry then I will put on the cetaphil moisturizer.</li>
            <li>All throughout high school I had clear skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who is suffering from adult acne.</li>
            <li>as prominent and no more pusy zits were appearing.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>my skin was soo soft!</li>
            <li>i dont think it has ever been that soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every single penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see a budge in the marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hearing such positive reviews on</li>
            <li>My current routine is first DK cleanser, then Moisturize (Decleor Iris Night Balm),  add a light layer of DK&#x27;s AHA all over, then spot w/ DK&#x27;s BP to trouble areas.  </li>
            <li>and my skin looks better and much less red!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for the past couple of weeks and although my acne marks have not faded much (I&#x27;ll be using a TCA peel for them soon - the original reason I bought this.</li>
            <li>but when my face all cleared up  i notice little red pus bumps on the top layer of my skin</li>
            <li>how it helps me because I&#x27;m already clear when I use benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>in the beginning it began to clear my acne</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, lasts for ages and the tube is a lot bigger than I expected (its the size of a deodorant bottle),</li>
            <li>so far it works</li>
            <li>I am fifty years old and have combination skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>If benzoyl peroxide isn&#x27;t doing much to heal your blemishes, I would definitely recommend this AHA lotion.</li>
            <li>Over the last few years I have been experiencing break outs more frequently.</li>
            <li>Figured I&#x27;d share my experience so far.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used almost the whole 6 oz by now putting it on my arms face chest and back</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect it  to reduce your pores or completely fade scars</li>
            <li>Anyway, benzoyl peroxide was never a big help, and the bleaching side effect was too much.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was just my skin, but I had a burning sensation on my entire face after using too much.</li>
            <li>So far, no reactive pimples.  </li>
            <li>I am 50+ year old with oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I never had cysts, just really unattractive whiteheads that wouldn&#x27;t go away, especially on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WARNING: can make skin shiny and sensitive to sunlight with overuse.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Went to another brand that is all natural that worked for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25, and have finally found the right regimen that will keep me clear on my face and back.</li>
            <li>i put it on the first time and let it dry</li>
            <li>I use it at night and it has helped with my mild acne (I did not have an adjustment period as I was using another AHA product previously).</li>
            <li>I breakout regardless of perfect daily diet and the regimen:(</li>
            <li>It seems to FINALLY get rid of those red marks and also appears to help prevent those spots from fully developing in the first place.</li>
            <li>Many of the directions on the bottles are excessive to keep you at the store, or not enough to make you need a follow-up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However you need to be careful at first.</li>
            <li>I only need a little bit for my entire face, and at $16.11 per tube, it&#x27;s a great price, seeing that it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion: it moisturizes dry areas and balances oily areas.</li>
            <li>and the improvements really arent that noticable, especially after shipping and handling the final cost</li>
            <li>red marks are fading away fast, red marks that I&#x27;ve had for a while are fading within days.</li>
            <li>I finally found something that worked for my perimenopausal adult acne!</li>
            <li>A little bit after that you will notice you smile lines softening.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to buy this other brand, the red Alpha Hydrox lotion since it&#x27;s like half the price and with better reviews</li>
            <li>I have been using this AHA+ as a substitute for my night time moisturizer, and it has worked wonders on both my acne, my general skin tone, firmness and appearance, and the appearance of my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for a product to clear my skin totally and get rid of acne marks/scars...</li>
            <li>After years and years of struggling with acne, the regimen is the only thing that has kept me consistently clear.</li>
            <li>keeps skin pretty clear  in all trouble areas</li>
            <li>The acne.org system is the ONLY thing that helps keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>Finally, my face is clear by using Acne.org products.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps clear my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 46 year old man with back acne since my teens .....</li>
            <li>This will help fade marks left after acne (hyper pigmentation), and make your skin soft.</li>
            <li>, my chest acne is barely there</li>
            <li>I use it on my face at night because of that, and I have sensitive skin with occasional acne in the T zone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about everything for adult acne treatment: hormone medication, antibiotics, topical prescription and non prescription treatments.</li>
            <li>sometimes if you catch the pimple early enough with this, the pimple will disappear before it fully forms.</li>
            <li>It does burn as some of the other reviewers stated and if I use too much it does sometime begin to rub off or peel, and it has never faded any of my clothes as some people said.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of daily use, my back and shoulders are visibly clear and the texture of the skin is noticeably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Another thing, is that it does not dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>Stings a little at first.  </li>
            <li>I still do get  one or two small ones occasionally but they disappear quickly.  </li>
            <li>After one application of this and the next day the lump had shrunk so I could barely find it.     </li>
            <li>This makes my skin SO soft and gets rid of all my dry skin patches.  </li>
            <li>: wash my face with the daily cleanser gently, wait for my face to dry, then I put on the BP \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;, and then I wait for that to dry, and then I put on the AHA+ which helps with scars and mini moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have super thick skin.</li>
            <li>And I was a little confused about whether it&#x27;s OK to apply right after the other.</li>
            <li>I use this AHA product every single night, and have done so since early 2010.</li>
            <li>It gets rid of your flakes, and after a while benzoyl peroxide messes with your skins natural ability to heal--or prolongs it, I&#x27;m a victim of this</li>
            <li>I use this stuff every night on my skin, and it has really made my red marks less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It burns a little and it doesn&#x27;t really effect the result.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I started using the BP treatment in December, and by March my acne was 95% gone, and my skin was beautiful as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> They all work great for me.  </li>

            <li> Also great on-the-spot treatment.  </li>
            <li> This product works great.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it every night before bed and have noticed great things since then.</li>
            <li> Besides that it&#x27;s great, and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Acne scars and redness have greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> A great product to lighten acne erythematous mark.</li>
            <li> The lotion doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it absorbs into my skin very nicely.</li>
            <li> But it controls it very effectively.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled!</li>
            <li> I already use the acne treatment and it works good.</li>
            <li> I have since added this to my routine, along w/ the cleanser and BP; and I am very happy w/ the quick results.  </li>
            <li> I love their customer support, and I will continue buying from them again!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll help your face more than you know!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE acne.org!</li>
            <li> Love these two products!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels really nice and tingly on my skin.</li>
            <li> Well I didnt liked the BP as well...</li>
            <li> Nothing but good things to say at this point :)</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s good to get my AHA in without also causing more breakouts.</li>
            <li> It just feels nice,</li>
            <li> I am thrilled</li>
            <li> I really liked this poduct</li>
            <li> Not too fancy but downright effective.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!</li>
            <li> But it is worth to buy!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as it completely cleared up my friends acne, she literally has perfect skin now.</li>
            <li> It is more effective for me than BP.  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that my skin looks smoother and has a nice healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> really good product that gives smooth skin</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have tried for acne!</li>
            <li> Skin is clear and bright!!</li>
            <li> very quickly clearing up my acne!</li>
            <li> I still break out here and there, but for the most part this keeps it in check amazingly well...and for CHEAP! :-)</li>
            <li> I did not believe the reviews since it seemed so good to be true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as effective as the BP is, it isn&#x27;t quite perfect because it makes your skin very dry</li>
            <li> Hmm this item is okay, I guess.</li>
            <li> but once it dries, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> , the non express postage to au is greater than the cost of the product itself.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t until a change in birth control that my skin began to break out more often.</li>
            <li> I hope I continue to see more progress as I continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I had a lump which did not go away after many weeks.</li>
            <li> I wish it would have been the miracle product for me as it has been for so many others.</li>
            <li> Best to use at night as others have said since AHA can make your skin sensitive to light.  </li>
            <li> Every day after a morning shower, i apply it to my back and shoulders, (so awesome to not have a bleaching effect to my clothes) and then go on with my day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is all great quality and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but I love this for my body acne.</li>
            <li> For some reason it works better for my body than benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and</li>
            <li> I really love this product but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because I still get breakouts.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be better for acne prevention.</li>
            <li> Before the pimple even came out I put aha cream on top of it.</li>
            <li> I can safely say i will be using this product for life.</li>
            <li> LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product</li>
            <li> and it does help u with acne scars! :)</li>
            <li> Try different combinations, quantities, and frequencies of products that you think are best.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because I started breaking out more.</li>
            <li> Love acne.org products but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I wouldn&#x27;t say the product is for everyone, but I&#x27;m sure it works for some.</li>
            <li> Skin looks more healthy and moisturized as usage continues.</li>
            <li> Works like magic.</li>
            <li> I use the whole acne.org regimen and I&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I used to use the whole acne.org regimen, and it worked GREAT for years.</li>
            <li> It does exfoliation, but I&#x27;m happy with just the normal 3 step regimen.</li>
            <li> My skin is finally clear and beautiful.</li>
            <li> My skin now is very smooth and the skin tone is fantastic.   </li>
            <li> I love Acne.orgs products, they are simle, easy to use, and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this inexpensive effective product!</li>
            <li> Now to get to the most important part, my marks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I need this in my skin care regimen as it has helped improved my skin texture significantly.</li>
            <li> This AHA+ by Acne.org is really cool!</li>
            <li> I use it as a spot treatment for any pimple or lump that develops - not just on my face, and they go away very quickly, in 12 hours</li>
            <li> This is the BEST acne cream, hands down.</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t helped with a fine line i&#x27;m developing between my eyebrows either.  </li>
            <li> I was fine with the benzoyl peroxide and the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine at exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> Post-acne marks have started fading much more quickly.    </li>
            <li> I am super glad that i found this product.</li>
            <li> As a huge fan of Dan Kern&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide gel for acne, I got this AHA to add to my face routine, but then found it made no difference to my face.  </li>
            <li> This is a HUGE tube by the way.</li>
            <li> but after a month i could already see a huge amount of improvement.</li>
            <li> I started up the acne.org regime again and within a few weeks my skin looked great (for my age!)  </li>
            <li> keeps your skin smooth</li>
            <li> Awesome product it helped dried up my break out.</li>
            <li> great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many good reviews of this product before I finally decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> but other wise it works so well!</li>
            <li> I originally came from a tropical country to work in the US and i came during winter in Minnesota.  </li>
            <li> I noticed significant peeling of skin, which I guess meant exfoliation worked.</li>
            <li> A bit watery in consistency, better come with a warning so that the first time user would not squeeze it out.</li>
            <li> This is such a good product and I would deffo recommend to anyone who has acne whether it is light or severe acne.</li>
            <li> The hormone medication is the most effective, but once I stopped taking it, the acne comes back.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s best for those with normal to dry skin because of the lotion texture.  </li>
            <li> You probably shouldn&#x27;t put this on right before you lay out on the beach!    </li>
            <li> But this item is good if you have big, liquidy pustules or if you have a zit coming out, it helps.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that it is so good at exfoliating that if I use it once a day I tend to get</li>
            <li> It feels much softer, smoother, and more even-toned.</li>
            <li> You can use it as a full face moisturizer, or a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> It works more like an exfoliator, quite gentle for oily skin, exfoliates well, fades my acne scars a bit.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed me Retin A and Hydroquinone cream which is supposed to be the good standard of Hyperpigmentaion removal.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Just in time for me to be able to be poolside on vacation without so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad price for AHA+ of this quality and this anount.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with The Regimen and so far it&#x27;s been working pretty good.</li>
            <li> It has a mild &#x27;chemically&#x27; smell which fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Apply it and GENTLY massage it into your skin until absorbed (shouldn&#x27;t take more than three minutes, if that).</li>
            <li> Also since it&#x27;s a generous size it doesn&#x27;t run out too quick.</li>
            <li> my skin was not turning over as quickly b/c of aging.  </li>
            <li> Can sting a bit upon application, but that fades quickly.</li>
            <li> It does not stain your clothes, or your bed sheets, and adsorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s better is that the AHA prevents new acne to form.  </li>
            <li> the three step regimen is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take much time at all.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well!</li>
            <li> the good part is this item is large and it last.</li>
            <li> and you may very well need to dilute it with a little lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for smooth soft skin asap.</li>
            <li> love so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had more clear and moisturized skin and plan on using this product forever since it is also useful for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better to use this product a night, because AHA makes your skin sensitive to the sunlight.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product to people who have tries benzyl peroxide and have skin that has basically become immune to it, works really good</li>
            <li> (still worth it of course)</li>
            <li> Behold, my face looks better and better, very smooth to the touch and the plugged pores are few and far between.</li>
            <li> Like I&#x27;m sure it will last me a full year.</li>
            <li> This works great for getting all that dry skin off and making your skin glow and that even complextion, makes your skin also feel baby soft</li>
            <li> I think it didn&#x27;t really help at all to be honest, my pores are still clogged, same size, no difference at all after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Of course everyone has different types of skin and it may not be suitable for everyone, but I have to say it does not hurt to try because at first I did not even like this myself, but I have learned how to use it and how often.</li>
            <li> They are very responsible and trustworthy.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and now my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first time I got this delivery though, it leaked all over the packaging.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!  </li>
            <li> This works very well!  </li>
            <li> and since then my skin has gotten a lot better with occasional break outs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glowing!</li>
            <li> I also use this as a spot treament for deep acne cysts and it clears them in a couple days (when they used to take a month or more).</li>
            <li> i have had this problem for some years, and usually it is only better in the summer months when i can get some sun.</li>
            <li> I used a very similar product in the past, Jan Marini Factor A+ lotion, w/ good results; but after time it caused more problems than it was worth.  </li>
            <li> must mention that I am not using it exactly as prescribed.  </li>
            <li> At first it seemed that it wasn&#x27;t working</li>
            <li> and recently it was a lot more.  </li>
            <li> I never could actually be 100% sure that stuff</li>
            <li> I use it on my back and shoulders where I had acne for many years growing up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding--this was probably the best careless purchase I have ever made in my life.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the fact that this is so affordable and comes in such a large size.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t react positively.</li>
            <li> That is the real reason I bought this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> It cleared up all my post acne marks, if you&#x27;re looking for the one that really works, this is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I use it, as directed, and I strongly recommend you do the same, too.</li>
            <li> Dan - if you read these reviews, PLEASE never let some large company buy you out</li>
            <li> It took around 3 months eventually all of the large pimples and redness all went away.</li>
            <li> I would get small flakes from time to time, and as I flicked them, a nice plump blackhead would come right out.</li>
            <li> it was working fine until last 4 months</li>
            <li> Decent price for the size!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for consistent results.</li>
            <li> the pimple is huge and red.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise and ensuing glee, I discovered that AHA is recommended for the treatment of acne, something I&#x27;ve also been blessed with.</li>
            <li> I tried it before my shin was ready and think I gave myself a skin burn.</li>
            <li> much breakouts...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really informative and you don&#x27;t have to register to read.     </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> so I use it for my chest and back to stay acne free.</li>
            <li> b/c I can control how much</li>
            <li> I started using the AHA at the beginning of the regimen, b/c I am already very accustom to AHA.  </li>
            <li> and you dont need a whole lot</li>
            <li> the gentle way you apply this just makes it feel like a treat every time I use it.</li>
            <li> and it was very flakey and sore.  </li>
            <li> anyways since then i found a product on [...] or at walmart called stress free triple acting toner and hydrating acne treatment.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> I use the acne.org system which has really cleared up my skin, so I don&#x27;t find the need to reach for this product too often.</li>
            <li> This stuff actual makes my face not red in the T zone and more calm</li>
            <li> think the AHA is what really makes it work.  </li>
            <li> My spots have not completely faded but my areas of unblemished skin is flawless and I dont break out as much as I usually do.</li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this to people for clearing up spots and aftermath of acne.</li>
            <li> Clears up scars extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> It can treat that kind of red acne on my back and face.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> but then my back acne just returned again , though it has significantly reduced my arm acne as well</li>
            <li> but I would still keep using it cuz it is better than other products yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy, no harsh smell, and it works very, very well.</li>
            <li> This product is pleasant to use and probably is helping to moisturize my skin, which is being dried out by hitting it with the big guns (hefty applications of the Acne-org benzoyl peroxide).  </li>
            <li> The AHA+ cleared my chest completely up in a week--right in time for the first day of school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My facial acne is not bad at all</li>
            <li> Other AHA-containing creams are way more expensive than this, so this is a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks now, and I&#x27;m sure this tube will last me several months.    </li>
            <li> but it was only mild flaking.</li>
            <li> I tryed many different types of acne treatment including proactiv and numerous prescriptions.</li>
            <li> I only use the AHA and a mild wash.</li>
            <li> I have on my shoulders and chest, actually making it look smoother and more like actual skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the products and follow the advice of how to  use them.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going into my sophomore year of high school, and I have struggled with acne since fifth or sixth grade.</li>
            <li> highly, highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to get rid of their acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother and I believe that all my little whiteheads and blackheads that used to turn into zits/acne like state have mostly gone away.</li>
            <li> I do wish it was a little more affordable</li>
            <li> and i can already tell the redness and old spots are already going away!!</li>
            <li> Benzyl Peroxide is a generous size, but after months of use my skin wouldn&#x27;t clear completely and it became very, VERY</li>
            <li> It came quick, nice little bonus and it was larger than what I expected, another nice little bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have tried absolutely everything apart from Accutane and it just wouldn&#x27;t quite clear.....</li>
            <li> If you need something to really get your skin clear, use this.  </li>
            <li> Also after using this product it will make your skin very touchable and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft and brighter looking, it really does even out the tones of your face.</li>
            <li> overall, it&#x27;s worth trying, just don&#x27;t get your hopes up</li>
            <li> After a few months of use, I notice my skin to be softer and more radiant.  </li>
            <li> I had one huge ugly pimple right splat on my chest that just wouldn&#x27;t go away, and it was visible in just about every shirt I own.</li>
            <li> As one of the previous reviews said it does make your skin more sensitive to sunlight/UVA/UVB.</li>
            <li> I have complete and utter faith in you, and the best day of my life (as far as cosmetic discoveries go) was the day I blindly stumbled upon acne.org.</li>
            <li> When I went to order a new bottle of BP, I saw the new AHA+ treatment and figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I would advise to only use this product at night as it makes your face SUPER red and very shiny.</li>
            <li> If my skin gets super dry then I will put on the cetaphil moisturizer.</li>
            <li> All throughout high school I had clear skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone who is suffering from adult acne.</li>
            <li> as prominent and no more pusy zits were appearing.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> my skin was soo soft!</li>
            <li> i dont think it has ever been that soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every single penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see a budge in the marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hearing such positive reviews on</li>
            <li> My current routine is first DK cleanser, then Moisturize (Decleor Iris Night Balm),  add a light layer of DK&#x27;s AHA all over, then spot w/ DK&#x27;s BP to trouble areas.  </li>
            <li> and my skin looks better and much less red!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for the past couple of weeks and although my acne marks have not faded much (I&#x27;ll be using a TCA peel for them soon - the original reason I bought this.</li>
            <li> but when my face all cleared up  i notice little red pus bumps on the top layer of my skin</li>
            <li> how it helps me because I&#x27;m already clear when I use benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> in the beginning it began to clear my acne</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, lasts for ages and the tube is a lot bigger than I expected (its the size of a deodorant bottle),</li>
            <li> so far it works</li>
            <li> I am fifty years old and have combination skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> If benzoyl peroxide isn&#x27;t doing much to heal your blemishes, I would definitely recommend this AHA lotion.</li>
            <li> Over the last few years I have been experiencing break outs more frequently.</li>
            <li> Figured I&#x27;d share my experience so far.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used almost the whole 6 oz by now putting it on my arms face chest and back</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect it  to reduce your pores or completely fade scars</li>
            <li> Anyway, benzoyl peroxide was never a big help, and the bleaching side effect was too much.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just my skin, but I had a burning sensation on my entire face after using too much.</li>
            <li> So far, no reactive pimples.  </li>
            <li> I am 50+ year old with oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I never had cysts, just really unattractive whiteheads that wouldn&#x27;t go away, especially on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WARNING: can make skin shiny and sensitive to sunlight with overuse.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Went to another brand that is all natural that worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25, and have finally found the right regimen that will keep me clear on my face and back.</li>
            <li> i put it on the first time and let it dry</li>
            <li> I use it at night and it has helped with my mild acne (I did not have an adjustment period as I was using another AHA product previously).</li>
            <li> I breakout regardless of perfect daily diet and the regimen:(</li>
            <li> It seems to FINALLY get rid of those red marks and also appears to help prevent those spots from fully developing in the first place.</li>
            <li> Many of the directions on the bottles are excessive to keep you at the store, or not enough to make you need a follow-up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However you need to be careful at first.</li>
            <li> I only need a little bit for my entire face, and at $16.11 per tube, it&#x27;s a great price, seeing that it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion: it moisturizes dry areas and balances oily areas.</li>
            <li> and the improvements really arent that noticable, especially after shipping and handling the final cost</li>
            <li> red marks are fading away fast, red marks that I&#x27;ve had for a while are fading within days.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that worked for my perimenopausal adult acne!</li>
            <li> A little bit after that you will notice you smile lines softening.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to buy this other brand, the red Alpha Hydrox lotion since it&#x27;s like half the price and with better reviews</li>
            <li> I have been using this AHA+ as a substitute for my night time moisturizer, and it has worked wonders on both my acne, my general skin tone, firmness and appearance, and the appearance of my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for a product to clear my skin totally and get rid of acne marks/scars...</li>
            <li> After years and years of struggling with acne, the regimen is the only thing that has kept me consistently clear.</li>
            <li> keeps skin pretty clear  in all trouble areas</li>
            <li> The acne.org system is the ONLY thing that helps keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Finally, my face is clear by using Acne.org products.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps clear my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 46 year old man with back acne since my teens .....</li>
            <li> This will help fade marks left after acne (hyper pigmentation), and make your skin soft.</li>
            <li> , my chest acne is barely there</li>
            <li> I use it on my face at night because of that, and I have sensitive skin with occasional acne in the T zone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about everything for adult acne treatment: hormone medication, antibiotics, topical prescription and non prescription treatments.</li>
            <li> sometimes if you catch the pimple early enough with this, the pimple will disappear before it fully forms.</li>
            <li> It does burn as some of the other reviewers stated and if I use too much it does sometime begin to rub off or peel, and it has never faded any of my clothes as some people said.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of daily use, my back and shoulders are visibly clear and the texture of the skin is noticeably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Another thing, is that it does not dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> Stings a little at first.  </li>
            <li> I still do get  one or two small ones occasionally but they disappear quickly.  </li>
            <li> After one application of this and the next day the lump had shrunk so I could barely find it.     </li>
            <li> This makes my skin SO soft and gets rid of all my dry skin patches.  </li>
            <li> : wash my face with the daily cleanser gently, wait for my face to dry, then I put on the BP \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;, and then I wait for that to dry, and then I put on the AHA+ which helps with scars and mini moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have super thick skin.</li>
            <li> And I was a little confused about whether it&#x27;s OK to apply right after the other.</li>
            <li> I use this AHA product every single night, and have done so since early 2010.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of your flakes, and after a while benzoyl peroxide messes with your skins natural ability to heal--or prolongs it, I&#x27;m a victim of this</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every night on my skin, and it has really made my red marks less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It burns a little and it doesn&#x27;t really effect the result.</li>
            <li> If I see one coming, especially on my neck, I will spot treat several times a day with this and BP and it really seems to clear it up much faster or prevent it altogether and at the very least make it less noticeable(smaller).</li>
            <li> When I finished it I was left with uneven skin tones and a decent amount of Hyperpigmentaion.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s really better than my usual moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> After two days of using this product those blemishes were flat and not as enflamed.</li>
            <li> (this amount will last you a long time!)--I don&#x27;t believe it has lowered its quality.</li>
            <li> I love this so much that I think you&#x27;re stupid for not using it with DK&#x27;s regimen.</li>
            <li> So, I gave this and the benzoyl peroxide treatment a try (so many other have failed).</li>
            <li> the treatment period is a little long, you should have patient and avoid sunshine after you use it, since the glycolic acid will make your face sensitive.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t take long till my face was covered with acne</li>
            <li> Generous size lasts a long time, too.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have to complain about is that there are really no directions on the tube so you have to find it online.  </li>
            <li> and I waited to long?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put on clothes until it has dried completely.</li>
            <li> I have looked for killer product for long long time.</li>
            <li> I used lotions and salycylic acid, astringents, and some other topical stuff.  </li>
            <li> I do the same thing at night, except every other night I use the AHA+ instead of BP.</li>
            <li> All the other topical treatments I&#x27;ve tried have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glycolic acid lotion promotes skin cell turnover, so I have flaking -</li>
            <li> Benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid always made my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using it religiously every night for the past 2 weeks and the little white bumps are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> My face is glowing and a little goes a long way-will definitely re-order</li>
            <li> You have to use an AHA lotion to prep your skin a couple weeks prior), my skin is a lot less congested and even.</li>
            <li> I use this product to treat breakouts or marks left by previous breakouts.</li>
            <li> But my skin started drying out, and my dermatologist advised I should cut back to just a small (pea-sized) amount of this, twice daily.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe acne and it really got me down when I was at secondary school</li>
            <li> it stings just a little if you have open scabs</li>
            <li> The little white bumps under my skin have never really cleared until I started using the glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> kinda like those bad photos you see of celebrities who have had too many peels on their face.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have followed Dan&#x27;s advice and the few years in between</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll report back in a few months.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quicker than expected and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li> but it definitely has helped me get rid of ols skin and hasn&#x27;t dried me out</li>
            <li> but it is not really helping me with scarring maybe it will work bette for someone else.</li>
            <li> expected</li>
            <li> My face feels smoother overall although I still have small non inflamed bumps on my forehead and cheeks and my nose is only slightly less oily.</li>
            <li> My acne makes me very self conscious as I work in the kitchens where it is virtually impossible to wear make-up as the steam, dirt and things from dishwashers, ovens etc make your make-up slide</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried every product that says that is going to help with my adult acne with no good resultsim 28.</li>
            <li> I give this product, and the other [...] products my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Prior to this I was using Jan Marini Bioglycolic wash, which I had to eliminate since that would be excessive chemical exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> My skin couldn&#x27;t cope with the extreme dryness.  </li>
            <li> This product does sting a little upon application and the texture seems to have changed a little since I purchased last year</li>
            <li> Also, this stuff is pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I have struggled with mild random acne outbreaks on my face (usually after friday and saturday nights of drinking and etc.)</li>
            <li> I apply this with my moisturiser every night and it burns for about 15/20 mins and then it dies down.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on any other products, just buy this one.</li>
            <li> I had AHA all over the box and half of the bottle was gone.</li>
            <li> , just think, this is acid that is trying to remove scars so you will feel a slight burning feeling.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d only notice it if you try and apply foundation over it (not a good look).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now i almost have 1 less thing to worry about everyday as i go through life.</li>
            <li> After a little research, I decided to try AHA to help treat some wrinkles I&#x27;ve been noticing.</li>
            <li> It made my eyes water a little</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a sting too it</li>
            <li> It does work, it just takes a little bit of time.</li>
            <li> i can feel it tingle a little when i put it on</li>
            <li> The feeling of this going on your skin is like a little piece of heaven.</li>
            <li> so is ether your acne or the little bumps .</li>
            <li> I started using it and it started to burn a little.</li>
            <li> I did order the whole system, just this moisturizer because of the cold weather coming, and I wanted to fade some spots.</li>
            <li> Within the week, my breakouts dried out, my blackheads weren&#x27;t</li>
            <li> so it dried out parts of my forehead and chin</li>
            <li> I started breaking out again after a week of non use and had to squeeze a few whities</li>
            <li> I had a few blemishes on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> The small improvement was not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I also found that applying BP prior to adding moisturizer was too irritating for me.  </li>
            <li> I have some hyperpigmentation that cleared up after just a few times of using this.</li>
            <li> It might be too heavy for oily or combo skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing in the market that i&#x27;ve tried and believed in because it really does remove disgusting pimples on my back.</li>
            <li> But it was irritating, especially in use with the rest of Dan&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use every day, just a few times a week.</li>
            <li> If applied to a small break out, it accelerates the healing process and helps bring the inflammation down.</li>
            <li> Treat your skin gently and if it becomes dry or irritated - do not be afraid to moisterize!  </li>
            <li> Usually I use the moisturizer during the day and this at night unless I need some spot treatment done during the day, then I&#x27;d use a little.</li>
            <li> The color was yellow and it smelled like car oil and left a bad reaction to my skin.</li>
            <li> the bad part is that while it does help with the acne, large bumps and that stuff</li>
            <li> Use this no more tan 3 times a week</li>
            <li> Mix a small amount of it in with the moisturizer (maybe an amount the size of a pea?)</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product makes your skin go through a purging period.</li>
            <li> No more flaking after using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only did this stuff remove my acne, it also seems to disolve the scars and weird roughness</li>
            <li> that you can stick 2 toothpicks in, and 2 other holes that looked terrible that just weren&#x27;t healing right</li>
            <li> they are nearly gone and don&#x27;t develop as badly as before.</li>
            <li> It slowly starts to bleach freakles and acne marks after about a month.</li>
            <li> Again that doesn&#x27;t mean this will happen to you.</li>
            <li> I mean a hole in my face</li>
            <li> These occasional break outs seem to happen all at once which is very unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any dryness or flakiness in my skin just a subtle glow.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not super expensive and wont break the bank.</li>
            <li> Finally after years of frustrated google searches, i found AHA.</li>
            <li> no more acne for me!!...</li>
            <li> My face got worse.</li>
            <li> BP doesn&#x27;t work for me, and i just cant stand multiple annoying stages of applying goop on my skin.</li>
            <li> this one make me scars even worse.</li>
            <li> I remember feeling so awkward because I was the only kid in my grade who had really bad acne.</li>
            <li> cause me to break out very badly on my chest, especially during the summer.</li>
            <li> I figured I would try it even though I was skeptical since the &amp;#34;gold standard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I became insecure about my skin since it masked my beauty.</li>
            <li> I was desperate and decided to give this a try along with the acne.org bp treatment.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some bad scars, and by bad</li>
            <li> I felt terribly bad about them, but after a couple days of using this stuff the redness of the scars faded a lot and they also are in the process of healing completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t terrible but not great either.....</li>
            <li> Hugely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed, after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Alas!!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s insane!</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t even from terrible pimples or anything, just BP&#x27;s fault.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a 46 year old man with back acne since my teens ..... have tried absolutely everything apart from Accutane and it just wouldn&#x27;t quite clear..... it wasn&#x27;t terrible but not great either.....always some spots on the go and lots of red marks. Started using this twice a day and my skin is the best it&#x27;s been in 30 years !!!! Results after a week or two.....transformed in a month ! I now only need to use it once a day. (I also use 30% Glycolic acid on my back once a week for a deeper clean)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had found this years ago. Best thing ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps.... Dear Amazon.....please sell this on your UK site as well !!</li>
            <li> alright so I have been using this for ONLY. a week and I already see improvement. it stings just a little if you have open scabs but other wise it works so well!</li>
            <li> I use it every night and now my skin feel so soft and smooth. My acne marks are fading away.</li>
            <li> The color was yellow and it smelled like car oil and left a bad reaction to my skin. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> After a little research, I decided to try AHA to help treat some wrinkles I&#x27;ve been noticing. Much to my surprise and ensuing glee, I discovered that AHA is recommended for the treatment of acne, something I&#x27;ve also been blessed with. I have been using this AHA+ as a substitute for my night time moisturizer, and it has worked wonders on both my acne, my general skin tone, firmness and appearance, and the appearance of my wrinkles. I LOVE the fact that this is so affordable and comes in such a large size. I have been using it for 3 weeks now, and I&#x27;m sure this tube will last me several months.    I give this product, and the other [...] products my highest recommendation. I am absolutely thrilled!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for the past couple of weeks and although my acne marks have not faded much (I&#x27;ll be using a TCA peel for them soon - the original reason I bought this. You have to use an AHA lotion to prep your skin a couple weeks prior), my skin is a lot less congested and even. I would get small flakes from time to time, and as I flicked them, a nice plump blackhead would come right out. The blackheads on my nose are &amp;#34;melting out&amp;#34; and my pores look smaller. There was a purging period, which I&#x27;m nearing the end of. All in all, I see myself using this product forever!&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I use it twice a day, morning and night after washing my face with the CeraVe hydrating cleanser. I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Hmm this item is okay, I guess. I don&#x27;t know what or how it helps me because I&#x27;m already clear when I use benzoyl peroxide. One thing though, is BP doesn&#x27;t help with clogged pores, not at all for me, so I bought this item just to hope that it would help. I think it didn&#x27;t really help at all to be honest, my pores are still clogged, same size, no difference at all after 3 weeks. I finally just squeezed them out. But this item is good if you have big, liquidy pustules or if you have a zit coming out, it helps. It also helps with skin tone and flakiness. The first time I got this delivery though, it leaked all over the packaging. I had AHA all over the box and half of the bottle was gone. I wrote a review to them saying what had happened, and they instantly sent me another tube, no questions asked,  within days. I love their customer support, and I will continue buying from them again! They are very responsible and trustworthy. (The second package did not leak)</li>
            <li> This makes my skin SO soft and gets rid of all my dry skin patches.  Seems to be helping with my acne also, but I just started using this a week ago..love so far.</li>
            <li> I struggled with moderate acne on my back and nothing seemed to help.  This product has been the only thing that has cleared my back up.....I noticed a difference within a week!!  I highly recommend this product!!  Love love love it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I don&#x27;t have massive break outs anymore when I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels really nice and tingly on my skin. It made my eyes water a little but once it dries, it&#x27;s ok. Also, it&#x27;s not perfumed which I like. It has a mild &#x27;chemically&#x27; smell which fades quickly. Within the week, my breakouts dried out, my blackheads weren&#x27;t as prominent and no more pusy zits were appearing. My face feels smoother overall although I still have small non inflamed bumps on my forehead and cheeks and my nose is only slightly less oily. So this product keeps the skin at a manageable level for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On MUA, people have been saying that is product is drying. I definitely agree. I have combination skin so it dried out parts of my forehead and chin but it was only mild flaking. You&#x27;d only notice it if you try and apply foundation over it (not a good look).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that the effects disappear when you stop using it. I started breaking out again after a week of non use and had to squeeze a few whities off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the non express postage to au is greater than the cost of the product itself. That&#x27;s insane!</li>
            <li> I use 3 of the acne.org products at this time.  The AHA, the Treatment and the Organic Jojoba Oil.  They all work great for me.  I replaced my evening retin-a with the aha and my skin looks better and much less red!  I highly recommend the products and follow the advice of how to  use them.  Treat your skin gently and if it becomes dry or irritated - do not be afraid to moisterize!  This is the second time I have followed Dan&#x27;s advice and the few years in between I thought I had outgrown acne. No way.  I started up the acne.org regime again and within a few weeks my skin looked great (for my age!)  I have tried plenty of \\&quot;green\\&quot; acne products, but if they don&#x27;t work what&#x27;s the point.  Dan - if you read these reviews, PLEASE never let some large company buy you out - you put thought and care in your products and I fear they will ruin them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Dan!</li>
            <li> very quickly clearing up my acne! Is drying, but even the drying effects are fading after 2 weeks. I bought this as it completely cleared up my friends acne, she literally has perfect skin now. Im hoping it will do the same for me!</li>
            <li> As a huge fan of Dan Kern&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide gel for acne, I got this AHA to add to my face routine, but then found it made no difference to my face.  BUT, it&#x27;s great for those annoying red bumps on the outer side of my upper arms, which I&#x27;ve learned are called keratosis pilaris and affect up to 50% of the world&#x27;s population.  After 5 days of using it once a day on my upper arms, the red bumps that I&#x27;ve had since I was born are 75% gone.  Wow!  Other AHA-containing creams are way more expensive than this, so this is a great deal.  Once again you create awesomeness, Dan Kern!</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s not a bad price for AHA+ of this quality and this anount. I wish I had tied it years ago.&lt;br /&gt;However you need to be careful at first. I tried it before my shin was ready and think I gave myself a skin burn. Use this no more tan 3 times a week and you may very well need to dilute it with a little lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for smooth soft skin asap.It slowly starts to bleach freakles and acne marks after about a month. A little bit after that you will notice you smile lines softening.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for me. Use after Acne.org cleaner and treatment. I tryed many different types of acne treatment including proactiv and numerous prescriptions. This was my last hope before taking accutane.. so far it works but i think i will still start accutane at some point.</li>
            <li> I am fifty years old and have combination skin that is prone to breakouts. I use this AHA product every single night, and have done so since early 2010. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s creamy, no harsh smell, and it works very, very well. Over time, my skin became even toned and lines have greatly diminished. I use it, as directed, and I strongly recommend you do the same, too. Apply it and GENTLY massage it into your skin until absorbed (shouldn&#x27;t take more than three minutes, if that). I dare say that this may be excellent for any skin type, regardless if you have acne or not. In any case, exfoliating the skin is one key step in bringing your face back to it&#x27;s intended loveliness. I, also, use this on my neck and upper back.&lt;br /&gt;Namaste.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion: it moisturizes dry areas and balances oily areas. I use it at night and it has helped with my mild acne (I did not have an adjustment period as I was using another AHA product previously). My only concern is that it is so good at exfoliating that if I use it once a day I tend to get a \\&quot;polished\\&quot; look - kinda like those bad photos you see of celebrities who have had too many peels on their face. I need to cut back and use this only once or twice a week rather than daily. I&#x27;ll report back in a few months.</li>
            <li> After reading rave reviews about this AHA lotion on acne.org, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have oily / acne-prone skin.    I&#x27;ve replaced my regular moisturizer with this a few days ago, and I am amazed at how much my skin has improved. It feels much softer, smoother, and more even-toned. Post-acne marks have started fading much more quickly.    The lotion doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it absorbs into my skin very nicely. I only need a little bit for my entire face, and at $16.11 per tube, it&#x27;s a great price, seeing that it will last a long, long time. You can use it as a full face moisturizer, or a spot treatment. It even works well on stubborn body acne too.    The only drawback is that it increases your skin&#x27;s sensitivity to sunlight, so keep some sunscreen at hand. You probably shouldn&#x27;t put this on right before you lay out on the beach!    If benzoyl peroxide isn&#x27;t doing much to heal your blemishes, I would definitely recommend this AHA lotion.</li>
            <li> This works very well!  It is more effective for me than BP.  Also great on-the-spot treatment.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After Sticking to the regimen, applying to Dans BP for 5months i changed to AHA+ Lotion. but I shouldve have not done that.. My face got worse. Well I didnt liked the BP as well... siGH...&lt;br /&gt;So much breakouts... well just avoid the product.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quicker than expected and absorbs well into the skin. My face is glowing and a little goes a long way-will definitely re-order</li>
            <li> This product works great.  It does not irritate my skin and I can use it on a daily basis.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Over the last few years I have been experiencing break outs more frequently. All throughout high school I had clear skin and it wasn&#x27;t until a change in birth control that my skin began to break out more often. Of course I changed it and since then my skin has gotten a lot better with occasional break outs. These occasional break outs seem to happen all at once which is very unfortunate. So for this, I figured I would try this product. I was looking on Amazon for a product that can brighten my complexion while controlling acne and not over drying. I read the reviews and figured, &amp;#34;what the hell.&amp;#34; I have been using it for almost two weeks and have noticed a difference in my skin and complexion. At the time I started using it I had a few blemishes on my cheeks and chin. After two days of using this product those blemishes were flat and not as enflamed. I have been using it every night before bed and have noticed great things since then. I have not seen any dryness or flakiness in my skin just a subtle glow. I hope I continue to see more progress as I continue to use this product. I hope this review helped. Figured I&#x27;d share my experience so far. Nothing but good things to say at this point :)</li>
            <li> I had a lump which did not go away after many weeks. After one application of this and the next day the lump had shrunk so I could barely find it.     I use it as a spot treatment for any pimple or lump that develops - not just on my face, and they go away very quickly, in 12 hours they are nearly gone and don&#x27;t develop as badly as before.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I need this in my skin care regimen as it has helped improved my skin texture significantly. Of course everyone has different types of skin and it may not be suitable for everyone, but I have to say it does not hurt to try because at first I did not even like this myself, but I have learned how to use it and how often. I normally only wear mine at night and at night only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many good reviews of this product before I finally decided to give it a try. I wish it would have been the miracle product for me as it has been for so many others. It does help with acne, just not to the extent i was hoping. i use it for back acne and on my chest but my chest has continued to break out consistantly for a month since i&#x27;ve been using it. i&#x27;ve used almost the whole 6 oz by now putting it on my arms face chest and back and the improvements really arent that noticable, especially after shipping and handling the final cost was over $25. it hasn&#x27;t helped with a fine line i&#x27;m developing between my eyebrows either.  overall, it&#x27;s worth trying, just don&#x27;t get your hopes up like i did :*(</li>
            <li> It works more like an exfoliator, quite gentle for oily skin, exfoliates well, fades my acne scars a bit. But don&#x27;t expect it  to reduce your pores or completely fade scars</li>
            <li> I have super thick skin. This stuff doesn&#x27;t burn or peel me but I am glowing. I&#x27;m using in conjunction with salicylic acid in the mornings and benzoyl peroxide in the evening. I&#x27;m really glowing! I&#x27;ve also been doing 15% TCA peels and my scars are rapidly fading. This stuff doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like anti-wrinkle treatments bc it&#x27;s non-comedogenic. So it&#x27;s good to get my AHA in without also causing more breakouts. This is a HUGE tube by the way. Like I&#x27;m sure it will last me a full year. I use it on my face as my daily moisturizer. Mind you... nothing burns my face except extensive sun exposure and a medium chem peel so I can do twice a day/every day no problem.</li>
            <li> I have used this since 2011 and it works wonderfully!  If you need something to really get your skin clear, use this.  Best to use at night as others have said since AHA can make your skin sensitive to light.  What can I say, a must buy!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work, but it didn&#x27;t, not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased and followed &#x27;The Regimen&amp;#34; From Acne.org and added this in on hopes to get rid of my red marks.&lt;br /&gt;The Benzyl Peroxide is a generous size, but after months of use my skin wouldn&#x27;t clear completely and it became very, VERY dry.&lt;br /&gt;This AHA stuff added to the dryness. Now I use the BP as a spot treatment along with Purpose face wash. I&#x27;m still searching for a product to clear my skin totally and get rid of acne marks/scars...</li>
            <li> This product is pleasant to use and probably is helping to moisturize my skin, which is being dried out by hitting it with the big guns (hefty applications of the Acne-org benzoyl peroxide).  But it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s really better than my usual moisturizer.  And I was a little confused about whether it&#x27;s OK to apply right after the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several over the counter acne treatments and prescription treatments. Benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid always made my skin too dry. I use AHA as my moisturizer and apply it after I wash my face in the AM and PM. It has a little bit of a sting too it but your skin eventually adjust to it. I&#x27;ve never had more clear and moisturized skin and plan on using this product forever since it is also useful for wrinkles. I also use this as a spot treament for deep acne cysts and it clears them in a couple days (when they used to take a month or more). I also use it on my upper back and chest. Just wear sunscreen over it if you are tanning or going outside.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every night on my skin, and it has really made my red marks less noticeable. They are almost gone now! Also after using this product it will make your skin very touchable and soft. I think it&#x27;s better to use this product a night, because AHA makes your skin sensitive to the sunlight. Besides that it&#x27;s great, and I will buy again. Oh, yeah I use this for my bacne, and it works wonderfully. This will help fade marks left after acne (hyper pigmentation), and make your skin soft.</li>
            <li> That is so big that I doubt can I use it up...&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. It can treat that kind of red acne on my back and face.&lt;br /&gt;But the treatment period is a little long, you should have patient and avoid sunshine after you use it, since the glycolic acid will make your face sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with mild random acne outbreaks on my face (usually after friday and saturday nights of drinking and etc.) My bigger problem though was acne on my back and shoulders! i have had this problem for some years, and usually it is only better in the summer months when i can get some sun. Anyway, benzoyl peroxide was never a big help, and the bleaching side effect was too much.The small improvement was not worth the hassle. Finally after years of frustrated google searches, i found AHA. I have been using it for about 2 weeks. Every day after a morning shower, i apply it to my back and shoulders, (so awesome to not have a bleaching effect to my clothes) and then go on with my day. I also shower at night, and then rinse it off and use a regular salicylic acid wash (off brand neutrogena wash). I sometimes put it on my face at night, but not every night. (my shoulders are a bigger problem). Alas!!! There is definitly a 90% improvement (nothing is perfect). I am super glad that i found this product. Now i almost have 1 less thing to worry about everyday as i go through life. Hopefully this is your miracle cure too!..By the way, i dont use any multiple step regiment. I only use the AHA and a mild wash. BP doesn&#x27;t work for me, and i just cant stand multiple annoying stages of applying goop on my skin. This stuff is not super expensive and wont break the bank. Go for it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since July and I have noticed a change in my skin. It&#x27;s smoother and I believe that all my little whiteheads and blackheads that used to turn into zits/acne like state have mostly gone away. I do break out on the occasion and that&#x27;s why I keep using this. If you&#x27;re unsure how to use this go to the [....] site and check the message boards. They&#x27;re really informative and you don&#x27;t have to register to read.     I use it at night as a moisturizer and use [[ASIN:B00164IZYM [..]8 oz. Moisturizer]] if I need extra moisturizer. Usually I use the moisturizer during the day and this at night unless I need some spot treatment done during the day, then I&#x27;d use a little. This stuff is all great quality and at a reasonable price. As one of the previous reviews said it does make your skin more sensitive to sunlight/UVA/UVB. Always wear sunscreen even if it&#x27;s not sunny! It&#x27;ll help your face more than you know!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now along with the Acne.org Regimen Treatment Kit. Don&#x27;t use too much. Maybe it was just my skin, but I had a burning sensation on my entire face after using too much. Mix a small amount of it in with the moisturizer (maybe an amount the size of a pea?) and it seems to work well. Acne scars and redness have greatly reduced. It does work, it just takes a little bit of time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this that often on my face because I use a retinol serum instead but I love this for my body acne. For some reason it works better for my body than benzoyl peroxide so I use it for my chest and back to stay acne free. Also since it&#x27;s a generous size it doesn&#x27;t run out too quick.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that worked for my perimenopausal adult acne! I love this stuff and the three step regimen is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take much time at all. I use it morning and night and it cleared up my face in no time.</li>
            <li> I used a very similar product in the past, Jan Marini Factor A+ lotion, w/ good results; but after time it caused more problems than it was worth.  I would get reactive pimples around my chin, so I discontinued it&#x27;s use.  Six months later, acne returned b/c my skin was not turning over as quickly b/c of aging.  I have since added this to my routine, along w/ the cleanser and BP; and I am very happy w/ the quick results.  So far, no reactive pimples.  I also like this in a tube rather than pump, b/c I can control how much is dispensed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must mention that I am not using it exactly as prescribed.  I started using the AHA at the beginning of the regimen, b/c I am already very accustom to AHA.  Prior to this I was using Jan Marini Bioglycolic wash, which I had to eliminate since that would be excessive chemical exfoliation.  I also found that applying BP prior to adding moisturizer was too irritating for me.  My current routine is first DK cleanser, then Moisturize (Decleor Iris Night Balm),  add a light layer of DK&#x27;s AHA all over, then spot w/ DK&#x27;s BP to trouble areas.  No irritation, only results.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product to people who have tries benzyl peroxide and have skin that has basically become immune to it, works really good i can feel it tingle a little when i put it on, i cant say it has demolished my acne but it definitely has helped me get rid of ols skin and hasn&#x27;t dried me out, i only use it before bed. I do wish it was a little more affordable but you do get a lot of product and you dont need a whole lot it just takes a minute for your skin to soak it in.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with The Regimen and so far it&#x27;s been working pretty good. The little white bumps under my skin have never really cleared until I started using the glycolic acid. I have been using it religiously every night for the past 2 weeks and the little white bumps are almost completely gone. Also, I noticed that my skin looks smoother and has a nice healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. I really love this product but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because I still get breakouts. Not sure if this product makes your skin go through a purging period.</li>
            <li> in the beginning it began to clear my acne but then my back acne just returned again , though it has significantly reduced my arm acne as well , my chest acne is barely there but it is not really helping me with scarring maybe it will work bette for someone else. My facial acne is not bad at all but there is one pimple that will not go away and this is not helping with it, i just wish my bacne would be cleared by this</li>
            <li> I have oily skin I thought this product would be better for acne prevention. Before the pimple even came out I put aha cream on top of it. Hugely disappointed. I ve been using dan regime for 2 yrs it was working fine until last 4 months I breakout regardless of perfect daily diet and the regimen:(</li>
            <li> I do not like this product.  It does nothing for my skin.  I still break out.  I would not recommend this to any one with acne problems.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I finished a accutane course almost a year ago. When I finished it I was left with uneven skin tones and a decent amount of Hyperpigmentaion. My dermatologist prescribed me Retin A and Hydroquinone cream which is supposed to be the good standard of Hyperpigmentaion removal. Not the case for me, I used that combo for 7 months and I didn&#x27;t see a budge in the marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hearing such positive reviews on Acne.orgs AHA I figured I would try it even though I was skeptical since the &amp;#34;gold standard&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t work I had doubts about this. It came quick, nice little bonus and it was larger than what I expected, another nice little bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used this for a couple of days mixed with a moisturizer like they recommend. The feeling of this going on your skin is like a little piece of heaven. It just feels nice, the gentle way you apply this just makes it feel like a treat every time I use it. It makes your skin so soft and brighter looking, it really does even out the tones of your face. Also it gets rid of that dullness your face has after recovering from acne. Now to get to the most important part, my marks. I see a 70% reduction in my Hyperpigmentaion and just over a months use!!! Amazing! I am thrilled and I now consider this a product that I never want to go without. Give this a try!</li>
            <li> I originally came from a tropical country to work in the US and i came during winter in Minnesota.  My skin couldn&#x27;t cope with the extreme dryness.  Before i came i had flawless skin but it didn&#x27;t take long till my face was covered with acne and it was very flakey and sore.  I was desperate and decided to give this a try along with the acne.org bp treatment. It took around 3 months eventually all of the large pimples and redness all went away. At first it seemed that it wasn&#x27;t working but after a month i could already see a huge amount of improvement. Now i&#x27;m on my third month with the product and i can say that it is a miracle product.  My skin now is very smooth and the skin tone is fantastic.   And what&#x27;s better is that the AHA prevents new acne to form.  I still do get  one or two small ones occasionally but they disappear quickly.  I use hhe product as a moisturizer every night.  I can safely say i will be using this product for life.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried every product that says that is going to help with my adult acne with no good resultsim 28. the good part is this item is large and it last. the bad part is that while it does help with the acne, large bumps and that stuff but when my face all cleared up  i notice little red pus bumps on the top layer of my skin so is ether your acne or the little bumps . i would NOT buy again. anyways since then i found a product on [...] or at walmart called stress free triple acting toner and hydrating acne treatment. i wash my face and use the toner then use the cream and leave it on every night and every morning. it took about a week to see the big difference. no more acne for me!!...but if you skip a day you might start getting break outs again so stay on track hope this helps.</li>
            <li> No more flaking after using. It feel sting once you apply but for short period only. Promote metabolism of face skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years now - this stuff works on acne and for anti aging- keeps your skin smooth</li>
            <li> After years and years of struggling with acne, the regimen is the only thing that has kept me consistently clear. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for consistent results. This stuff keeps your skin from flaking.</li>
            <li> This AHA+ by Acne.org is really cool! I only use it for spot treatment along with BP to treat acne that appears to be just forming or &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; zits. I also use it on my neck where I get these spots that sometimes won&#x27;t go away for months. That is the real reason I bought this product in the first place. It seems to FINALLY get rid of those red marks and also appears to help prevent those spots from fully developing in the first place. If I see one coming, especially on my neck, I will spot treat several times a day with this and BP and it really seems to clear it up much faster or prevent it altogether and at the very least make it less noticeable(smaller). I highly recommend this inexpensive effective product! I don&#x27;t use it all over my face though, just as a spot treatment so I won&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness used that way.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference after using this product. I would just stick to the benzoyl peroxide. It&#x27;s somewhat sticky and gives sort of a greasy finish. It burns a little and it doesn&#x27;t really effect the result. I was fine with the benzoyl peroxide and the moisturizer. I do not think I will purchase it again</li>
            <li> I am 50+ year old with oily acne prone skin. So, I gave this and the benzoyl peroxide treatment a try (so many other have failed). Behold, my face looks better and better, very smooth to the touch and the plugged pores are few and far between. The calming effect of the licorice in it is noticeable. Generous size lasts a long time, too. I am nicer to my face now. Wish I had this years ago, but the acne scarring is diminishing over time with this.  One tip I learned I will pass along - B vitamins causes breakout in some people, it does on me.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t react positively. Each time I used it I broke out. And there was a burning sensation with each use.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed, after 2 weeks It did nothing it only made my face swell</li>
            <li> This is such a good product and I would deffo recommend to anyone who has acne whether it is light or severe acne. I suffer from severe acne and it really got me down when I was at secondary school and then when I got a job. My acne makes me very self conscious as I work in the kitchens where it is virtually impossible to wear make-up as the steam, dirt and things from dishwashers, ovens etc make your make-up slide off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product about 2 months ago and already noticing a big difference on my face. I apply this with my moisturiser every night and it burns for about 15/20 mins and then it dies down. I would advise to only use this product at night as it makes your face SUPER red and very shiny. A lot of people don&#x27;t like the burning sensation but I actually do because then I know that it is working as it&#x27;s not going to do anything if it doesn&#x27;t, just think, this is acid that is trying to remove scars so you will feel a slight burning feeling. It&#x27;s cheap, lasts for ages and the tube is a lot bigger than I expected (its the size of a deodorant bottle), really good product that gives smooth skin and I would deffo be buying again!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 months with &amp;#34;the regimen&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use this product to treat breakouts or marks left by previous breakouts. I use the acne.org system which has really cleared up my skin, so I don&#x27;t find the need to reach for this product too often. When I do, I find it very effective! I have some hyperpigmentation that cleared up after just a few times of using this. You can use it as a spot treatment or on your entire face. I use it at night after cleansing and using the acne.org benzoyl peroxide treatment. When I use this, I skip moisturizer as it would alter the effectiveness of the product. This product does sting a little upon application and the texture seems to have changed a little since I purchased last year (this amount will last you a long time!)--I don&#x27;t believe it has lowered its quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an athlete and I always had a lot of acne on my chest and my shoulders and recently it was a lot more.  I used lotions and salycylic acid, astringents, and some other topical stuff.  I never could actually be 100% sure that stuff I use is doing its job until I used this stuff. My brother had a bunch of stuff from acne.org and I saw it this one in the bathroom so I used it and asked him if it worked and he said yea it does.  So I kept putting it on after my shower and I couldn&#x27;t believe my acne was disappearing on my body so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did this stuff remove my acne, it also seems to disolve the scars and weird roughness I have on my shoulders and chest, actually making it look smoother and more like actual skin. Another thing, is that it does not dry my skin out.  I use it on my face at night because of that, and I have sensitive skin with occasional acne in the T zone.  This stuff actual makes my face not red in the T zone and more calm looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the AHA is what really makes it work.  I wish they sold similar products in the pharmacy, but I don&#x27;t think they do.  The only thing I have to complain about is that there are really no directions on the tube so you have to find it online.  Also, this stuff is pretty expensive (still worth it of course) so I&#x27;m going to buy this other brand, the red Alpha Hydrox lotion since it&#x27;s like half the price and with better reviews so hopefully I&#x27;ll get similar results.  I don&#x27;t know if this is the only type of stuff like this out there, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I thought this is gonna improve my skin a lot. And it did not do that well as&lt;br /&gt;I expected but I would still keep using it cuz it is better than other products yet.</li>
            <li> I really liked this poduct becuase I noticed a difference in my skin only after a week of using it. I did order the whole system, just this moisturizer because of the cold weather coming, and I wanted to fade some spots. My spots have not completely faded but my areas of unblemished skin is flawless and I dont break out as much as I usually do. It does burn as some of the other reviewers stated and if I use too much it does sometime begin to rub off or peel, and it has never faded any of my clothes as some people said.</li>
            <li> keeps skin pretty clear  in all trouble areas</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE acne.org! It saved my skin, literally. This product is truly &amp;#34;the cherry on top&amp;#34; so to speak. You won&#x27;t regret giving these products a try.</li>
            <li> LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product and i just received it not even a week ago! i put it on the first time and let it dry and when i went to go do my makeup for work my skin was soo soft! i dont think it has ever been that soft! and i can already tell the redness and old spots are already going away!!</li>
            <li> it burns a liltle bit but after u get used to it and it does help u with acne scars! :)</li>
            <li> The acne.org system is the ONLY thing that helps keep my skin clear. I use the AHA every other night (it does sting at first, but after the 2nd week you don&#x27;t notice it!), the BP Gel every morning and every other night. Love these two products!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. Not too fancy but downright effective. After a few months of use, I notice my skin to be softer and more radiant.  Will keep on using this.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I use it on my back and shoulders where I had acne for many years growing up. I&#x27;m 25, and have finally found the right regimen that will keep me clear on my face and back. After using this at night for 1 week, I could tell it was working already. After 3 weeks of daily use, my back and shoulders are visibly clear and the texture of the skin is noticeably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this to people for clearing up spots and aftermath of acne. Just keep in mind that the \\&quot;directions\\&quot; on any product are only a guideline, as are any treatments for acne. Try different combinations, quantities, and frequencies of products that you think are best. Many of the directions on the bottles are excessive to keep you at the store, or not enough to make you need a follow-up.</li>
            <li> I already use the acne treatment and it works good. I thought this product would be an advance type of product for acne. I have very sensitive skin. I started using it and it started to burn a little. If you have any open sores on your face I wouldn&#x27;t use this on your face. I used it a couple of times. I stopped using it because I started breaking out more. Again that doesn&#x27;t mean this will happen to you. I tried to return this item and I waited to long? Oh well on to the next product. I think with any product after a while they just don&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li> Love acne.org products but this one make me scars even worse. After use they look red and continued to until I stopped use. I only did a tiny amount like suggested but even that broke me out. Too bad</li>
            <li> This product is amazing... It cleared up all my post acne marks, if you&#x27;re looking for the one that really works, this is the real deal!</li>
            <li> This product truly does work. It helps keep my skin radiant and reduces redness from acne. If applied to a small break out, it accelerates the healing process and helps bring the inflammation down.</li>
            <li> This works great for getting all that dry skin off and making your skin glow and that even complextion, makes your skin also feel baby soft</li>
            <li> Awesome product it helped dried up my break out. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Clears up scars extremely fast. I love this so much that I think you&#x27;re stupid for not using it with DK&#x27;s regimen. It gets rid of your flakes, and after a while benzoyl peroxide messes with your skins natural ability to heal--or prolongs it, I&#x27;m a victim of this and I only noticed a week ago or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some bad scars, and by bad I mean a hole in my face that you can stick 2 toothpicks in, and 2 other holes that looked terrible that just weren&#x27;t healing right and it wasn&#x27;t even from terrible pimples or anything, just BP&#x27;s fault. I felt terribly bad about them, but after a couple days of using this stuff the redness of the scars faded a lot and they also are in the process of healing completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My red marks are fading away fast, red marks that I&#x27;ve had for a while are fading within days. My skin looks nicer with AHA on, I feel like it masks your marks a bit and makes them lighter which is also a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a miracle cream guys.. use it if you think you need it, I know I do.</li>
            <li> I like the acne.org products and I was using this for exfoliating and moisturizing.  I think it&#x27;s best for those with normal to dry skin because of the lotion texture.  It might be too heavy for oily or combo skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going into my sophomore year of high school, and I have struggled with acne since fifth or sixth grade. I remember feeling so awkward because I was the only kid in my grade who had really bad acne. I never had cysts, just really unattractive whiteheads that wouldn&#x27;t go away, especially on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About halfway through my ninth grade year (after 3+ years of constant disappointments with the brand name products) I discovered acne.org and figured, What the hell, nothing else has worked. I&#x27;m not kidding--this was probably the best careless purchase I have ever made in my life. I started using the BP treatment in December, and by March my acne was 95% gone, and my skin was beautiful as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as effective as the BP is, it isn&#x27;t quite perfect because it makes your skin very dry and I even started to develop wrinkles in my forehead area (despite the fact that I&#x27;m only 15). When I went to order a new bottle of BP, I saw the new AHA+ treatment and figured I would give it a try. I purchased both, and adjusted my daily routine like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I wash with Neutrogena Grapefruit cleanser and then put on the BP. I do the same thing at night, except every other night I use the AHA+ instead of BP. After hearing that AHA+ works on bacne and my keratosis pilaris, I started to put it on those areas after showering. You see, I&#x27;m a runner, and sports bras (as wonderful as they are) cause me to break out very badly on my chest, especially during the summer. I had one huge ugly pimple right splat on my chest that just wouldn&#x27;t go away, and it was visible in just about every shirt I own. The AHA+ cleared my chest completely up in a week--right in time for the first day of school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel Kern, you are a god amongst men. I have complete and utter faith in you, and the best day of my life (as far as cosmetic discoveries go) was the day I blindly stumbled upon acne.org.</li>
            <li> It is my second time to buy this product. The only thing in the market that i&#x27;ve tried and believed in because it really does remove disgusting pimples on my back. I don&#x27;t use it for my face. For some reason, it only works on my back. I use it just like how I would use lotion. I don&#x27;t put on clothes until it has dried completely. Try it out, it definitely works. I love it so much</li>
            <li> I noticed significant peeling of skin, which I guess meant exfoliation worked. But it was irritating, especially in use with the rest of Dan&#x27;s regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the product has a color and smell that reminds of mustard. And smearing mustard on my face was a bit unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I wouldn&#x27;t say the product is for everyone, but I&#x27;m sure it works for some. It does exfoliation, but I&#x27;m happy with just the normal 3 step regimen.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I have looked for killer product for long long time. Finally, my face is clear by using Acne.org products. I am from Hong Kong. the postage fee for the products (from US) is like 1/3 of the product price. But it is worth to buy!!!</li>
            <li> Cheaper AHA I &#x27;ve comes across. A great product to lighten acne erythematous mark. A bit watery in consistency, better come with a warning so that the first time user would not squeeze it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about everything for adult acne treatment: hormone medication, antibiotics, topical prescription and non prescription treatments. The hormone medication is the most effective, but once I stopped taking it, the acne comes back. The Acne.org regime actually makes a difference. All the other topical treatments I&#x27;ve tried have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glycolic acid lotion promotes skin cell turnover, so I have flaking - but I&#x27;d take that any day to lesions. I add a couple drops of jojoba oil to the lotion to get extra moisture. The Acne.org regime will not cure your acne. Nothing can. But it controls it very effectively.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! great product, especially for the price. I love Acne.orgs products, they are simle, easy to use, and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> During this winter I was mortified every time I went to take a shower and caught a glimpse of my back. It seemed like no matter what I tried, my skin was going to just keep breaking out. I tried a variety of things -- washing undergarments and sheets, using benzoyl peroxide, using a cleanser with salicylic acid, the oil cleansing method -- and discovering AHA was the only thing that helped! Along with a pair of exfoliating shower glove things and a bar of Cetaphil antibacterial soap, this AHA+ cleared up my back in about a week. Just in time for me to be able to be poolside on vacation without so much embarrassment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t been great on my face, but has done wonders for stubborn body acne!</li>
            <li> Definitely helps clear my skin. Can sting a bit upon application, but that fades quickly. Skin looks more healthy and moisturized as usage continues. WARNING: can make skin shiny and sensitive to sunlight with overuse.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have tried for acne! I use it along with the Treament as suggested and I think it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine at exfoliating.  Stings a little at first.  I don&#x27;t use every day, just a few times a week.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST acne cream, hands down. Don&#x27;t waste your money on any other products, just buy this one. It does not stain your clothes, or your bed sheets, and adsorbs quickly. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Whenever I notice a blemish forming, I just put on this cream and the next day it is gone. Works like magic.</li>
            <li> Great product! Highly recommend for anyone who is suffering from adult acne.</li>
            <li> Bought the kit. Decent price for the size! Didn&#x27;t help my acne. Went to another brand that is all natural that worked for me. But this is my skin and everyone is different.</li>
            <li> I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> I use the whole acne.org regimen and I&#x27;ve had great results. My skin is finally clear and beautiful. All the cystic acne is gone- finally after years and years of dealing with it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use this to spot treat when the pimple is in its beginning stages...sometimes if you catch the pimple early enough with this, the pimple will disappear before it fully forms. good stuff!</li>
            <li> I used to use the whole acne.org regimen, and it worked GREAT for years. But my skin started drying out, and my dermatologist advised I should cut back to just a small (pea-sized) amount of this, twice daily. It works pretty well! I still break out here and there, but for the most part this keeps it in check amazingly well...and for CHEAP! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!! Skin is clear and bright!! I highly recommend this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the miracle cure for like 5 years, no joke. I became insecure about my skin since it masked my beauty. I did not believe the reviews since it seemed so good to be true. And I thought the price might be a bit too \\&quot;pricey\\&quot; but let me tell you. It&#x27;s worth every single penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally saw results after one day. I did not purchase the moisturizer/daily cleanser since I have the cetaphil daily cleanser and Dan says that works too since they are very similar. And then I use the cetaphil SPF moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen: wash my face with the daily cleanser gently, wait for my face to dry, then I put on the BP \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;, and then I wait for that to dry, and then I put on the AHA+ which helps with scars and mini moisturizing. If my skin gets super dry then I will put on the cetaphil moisturizer. Then I repeat these steps whenever I feel a pimplo coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to get rid of their acne. Don&#x27;t doubt this product.</li>
            <li> Personally, I dont think it creates acne for me but I do think it inflames any acne I have. If I have a pimple and I use this stuff by the next day the pimple is huge and red. For this resaon I havent used it consistenly enough to know if it actually exfoliates like it says it does.</li>
