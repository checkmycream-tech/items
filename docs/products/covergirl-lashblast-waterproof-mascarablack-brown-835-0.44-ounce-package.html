            <li>This is the brand I use for beautiful lashes and to cover the gray hair along my edges!!</li>
            <li>Out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, this on holds my lash curls the best and the longest.</li>

            <li>I always loved this company, specifically the type of brush that the LashBlast mascara makes.</li>

            <li>Makes my lashes full and look beautiful.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I just keep another mascara handy to use that wand to separate lashes that clump.  </li>
            <li>Very waterproof, nice wand, great volume, and holds a lash curl!</li>

            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li>my favorite waterproof mascara (i swim every day)</li>
            <li>love this product, love the applications, the thickness, no clumps,no need for re-application.</li>
            <li>but it is just OK  </li>
            <li>It is definitely my favorite waterproof mascara and you can&#x27;t beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Love it - been using for years.</li>
            <li>love it, will recommend.</li>
            <li>Waterproof makes sure that the mascara isn&#x27;t rubbed off by sweat or humidity.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was a cheap as I&#x27;d found it once all the time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than what used to  be available</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very wet and goes on perfect.</li>
            <li>It stays put all day without flaking and easily comes off with makeup remover or lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake or bleed, but comes off easily with water.  </li>
            <li>I like the color just fine.</li>
            <li>The brush was huge, couldn&#x27;t apply correctly.</li>
            <li>Th mascara does the job but nothing fantastic for me.</li>
            <li>but its not clumpy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Gives great coverage without clumping , if you allow to dry between coats.</li>
            <li>Definitely gives good volume, though, even in the black-brown color.  </li>
            <li>Makes my lashes so full and luscious, people asked if I had on falsies.</li>
            <li>I like it but do not find it exactly clump free.</li>
            <li>Works great, didn&#x27;t run down my face once.</li>
            <li>I used oil to remove it, which did take a little work, lol.  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>The big brush helps the mascara to go on easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Better use a regular soap for it.</li>
            <li>I only wear it on my top lashes since I end up with racoon eyes when I wear mascara on my lower lashes.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve become very adept at removing tiny splotches with a piece of folded toilet tissue, so that won&#x27;t stop me from buying it again.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it very much.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just one step too many for me at the end of a long day, so I would try something else.  </li>
            <li>and Full and Soft would be my go-to mascaras.</li>
            <li>Very Black would be very striking</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the color dark brown mascara, it actually looks nice and more natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about make-up</li>
            <li>i also like how it doesn&#x27;t clump and its really water proof.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>It does not run, no matter how much my eyes water or if I am in the pool.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash off in the pool which is what I really like about it.</li>
            <li>And the best part is that I have long thick lashed again!</li>
            <li>I love that it is waterproof as my eyes do water due to allergies.</li>
            <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t provide much length, and clumps, but the main reason I bought it is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed recently that my eyelashes aren&#x27;t as full as they once were, which saddens me as it&#x27;s probably a sign of aging.</li>
            <li>It is a dark brown and will work well with more neutral eye-makeup during the day.</li>
            <li>Wow i really like this mascara</li>
            <li>They last forever, but are theBIGGEST pain to remove, which, I suppose is what makes them long lasting...and they both legthen your lashes better than this mascara.</li>
            <li>Nice thick brush.</li>
            <li>Just wish the bottle didn&#x27;t dry out so quick....</li>
            <li>This stuff is definitely waterproof, but its really runny and too much comes off onto the wand every time.</li>
            <li>I have previously used this product prior to using and so I knew I would love it.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes and clumps really show!</li>
            <li>I love the brush, it&#x27;s so thick and separate each lashes.</li>
            <li>Forget any smooth coverage &amp; if I&#x27;m not careful it gets on my eyelid or face &amp; is a mess to remove.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s long lasting and adds great volume to the lashes, it tends to get very clumpy and is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little watery but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for all especially if you curl you lashes and want them to stay curled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde, and this brown mascara looks both natural and allows me to get down to the very roots.</li>
            <li>The great thing about it is that the wand is so wet with mascara that it doesn&#x27;t miss a lash when applying; and that is also the bad thing because it does get on my eyelids, etc.</li>

            <li> The great thing about it is that the wand is so wet with mascara that it doesn&#x27;t miss a lash when applying; and that is also the bad thing because it does get on my eyelids, etc.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark eyelashes if not particularly thick.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this after wearing the same pink brand mascara for years.</li>
            <li> At the same time, there is a slight amout of clumping for the same reason.</li>
            <li> This is the first waterproof mascara I have used in at least 15 years!  </li>
            <li> If not letting coats dry between coats, it will clump and glob, as will any mascara.  </li>
            <li> , just remember to let it dry between coats.</li>
            <li> The upside is that the spider eyed look doesn&#x27;t last all day because this stuff flakes off leaving you looking like half a spider.</li>
            <li> Just as expected and just as described.  </li>
            <li> I never use any other mascara.  </li>
            <li> Unless you trust your makeup remover a lot, this can potentially rip out some eyelashes (which sucks if youre like me and already have a scarce amount...)</li>
            <li> but on the plus side it won&#x27;t run down your face.</li>
            <li> so I could wear it at a theme park, and it does the job of not running down my face when soaked.</li>
            <li> The wand is also a little thick and the bristles are short.</li>
            <li> Not too black for me.</li>
            <li> I received color brown and I ordered color black...</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered the black non waterproof</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 8.99 at CVS and closer to half that when ordered as an add on.</li>
            <li> so I use the brush from my previous mascara.</li>
            <li> I was previously using another Covergirl mascara, but it was only for lengthening and my lashes still looked thin.</li>
            <li> Seemed a little dried out.</li>
            <li> On poor side, it lays very thick, and requires thorough combing, that is very time consuming.</li>
            <li> Minus 1 star for difficult removal only.</li>
            <li> This is not black/brown, it is plain brown.</li>
            <li> I have this mascara in very black and it does wonder on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with</li>
            <li> I have used this product basically every day for the past two years.</li>
            <li> If you apply a normal amount it flakes off during the day, but is then impossible to get off at night.  </li>
            <li> The previous mascara I purchased claimed to be waterproof, and was not at all!!  </li>
            <li> It was extremely hard to get off which Is the point I guess</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with the color, but I&#x27;m used to black/black and gave this a try.  </li>
            <li> I like the thick brush</li>
            <li> not good since my eyelashes fall out a lot.</li>
            <li> To wash the mascara away when I removing make-up at night, is also take a lot of time, and it&#x27;s slightly irritating my eyes while being washed out with a make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I routinely use waterproof mascaras, and never have had one work so poorly.  </li>
            <li> Clumps terribly, even when it was brand new!  </li>
            <li> When applying this mascara I get two options, barely there or clumps--the tip is terrible.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s extremely difficult to remove at the end of the day...</li>
            <li> This mascara is rather a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>

            <li> This is my go to mascara. Apply once in the morning and you&#x27;re good to go all day!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this mascara and will probably buy this brand and color again when replacements are needed.</li>
            <li> The best the manufacturer makes.</li>
            <li> Cover Girl is perfect for me... opens lashes perfectly without clumps and filling color</li>
            <li> :) Favorite mascara of all time. Just wish the bottle didn&#x27;t dry out so quick....</li>
            <li> Love Covergirl products!</li>
            <li> I need hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> One of the best mascara that I have ever used. Last all day and makes my lashes longer and fuller. Highly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Great product, helps keep my eyelashes stay up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the tip. Blotchy😞</li>
            <li> It is a non-expensive water-resistant mascara, the color is matching my eyelashes and eyebrows : I am a brown-blonde, and always using a brown dye for my lashes. On poor side, it lays very thick, and requires thorough combing, that is very time consuming. To wash the mascara away when I removing make-up at night, is also take a lot of time, and it&#x27;s slightly irritating my eyes while being washed out with a make-up remover. Better use a regular soap for it. I recommend with some reservations.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara - lasts all day and so smudging!  &amp;#34;Thank you for this freebie to try!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the way it applies too much - overall okay.</li>
            <li> Nice thick brush. Works great</li>
            <li> Was looking for a waterproof mascara, I have allergies that make my eyes water, at times.  The previous mascara I purchased claimed to be waterproof, and was not at all!!  The days of running mascara were gone, or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Gave this one a try, and am happy with it&#x27;s waterproofness.  I used oil to remove it, which did take a little work, lol.  If not letting coats dry between coats, it will clump and glob, as will any mascara.  I am very happy with it so far, just remember to let it dry between coats.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pain to get this mascara off....regular soap doesn&#x27;t work. but on the plus side it won&#x27;t run down your face.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t have gotten the waterproof.  If you apply a normal amount it flakes off during the day, but is then impossible to get off at night.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> This was my wifes purchase, and she loves this stuff.  My daughter uses the same one too I think.  I don&#x27;t know much about make-up but I know they stock up whenever they find a good deal on it so it has to be good if they want to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes full and look beautiful.  &amp;#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions stated are 100% my own&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This mascara is rather a disappointment.  I have long, dark eyelashes if not particularly thick.  When applying this mascara I get two options, barely there or clumps--the tip is terrible. I routinely use waterproof mascaras, and never have had one work so poorly.  So not digging the spider eyed look. The upside is that the spider eyed look doesn&#x27;t last all day because this stuff flakes off leaving you looking like half a spider.</li>
            <li> This is the first waterproof mascara I have used in at least 15 years!  It&#x27;s better than what used to  be available and I really like it very much.  EXCEPT when it gets on my skin when I&#x27;m applying it!  The great thing about it is that the wand is so wet with mascara that it doesn&#x27;t miss a lash when applying; and that is also the bad thing because it does get on my eyelids, etc. However, I&#x27;ve become very adept at removing tiny splotches with a piece of folded toilet tissue, so that won&#x27;t stop me from buying it again.  At the same time, there is a slight amout of clumping for the same reason. I just keep another mascara handy to use that wand to separate lashes that clump.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> my favorite waterproof mascara (i swim every day)</li>
            <li> Gives great coverage without clumping , if you allow to dry between coats. I apply two coats for great coverage and length to my lashes. I love that it is waterproof as my eyes do water due to allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied,,,no running or smuding...no burning eyes....yet I can wash it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> love this product, love the applications, the thickness, no clumps,no need for re-application. lasts through all day then a sweaty workout. only mascara i use!!</li>
            <li> By far my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot from this mascara but it is just OK  hence the 3 star rating. Th mascara does the job but nothing fantastic for me.</li>
            <li> Made my lashes look amazing. Did not bother my eyes. Not too black for me.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of CoverGirl mascaras over the years and I like the look this wand gives you but it&#x27;s extremely difficult to remove at the end of the day... even with waterproof eye makeup remover.  Probably would not purchase again for that reason alone. If you use eye makeup remover every night anyway, than it&#x27;s a good purchase.  That&#x27;s just one step too many for me at the end of a long day, so I would try something else.  Definitely gives good volume, though, even in the black-brown color.  A great choice for daytime wear.  Very Black would be very striking and I would save that for evening use only.</li>
            <li> This is not black/brown, it is plain brown. So disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have used it for years.  It is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes so full and luscious, people asked if I had on falsies. Only problem is getting it off. I&#x27;ll still buy it though. Great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe the one I got had expired but I&#x27;m going to throw it away.  It&#x27;s clumpy, with a big glob on the end of the wand, when it&#x27;s pulled out &amp; the product on the brush goes on in bits &amp; pieces.  Forget any smooth coverage &amp; if I&#x27;m not careful it gets on my eyelid or face &amp; is a mess to remove.  I would definitely never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s long lasting and adds great volume to the lashes, it tends to get very clumpy and is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara based on a recommendation from my friend. I was previously using another Covergirl mascara, but it was only for lengthening and my lashes still looked thin. This one lengthens and thickens my lashes. It wears all day without issues. I will definitely continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> The brush was huge, couldn&#x27;t apply correctly.Returned</li>
            <li> I got this because I needed a waterproof mascara. It&#x27;s okay...gets flaky as the day progresses, and may smudge (sometimes I rub my eyes, etc.). Besides the &amp;#34;water-resistant&amp;#34; part, it does nothing else to my lashes. It doesn&#x27;t lengthen them or volumize them. If you want long-lasting, try REvlon 24-hour mascara line, or the CoverGirl Bombshell Mascara. They last forever, but are theBIGGEST pain to remove, which, I suppose is what makes them long lasting...and they both legthen your lashes better than this mascara.</li>
            <li> I received color brown and I ordered color black...</li>
            <li> Mascara stays on well.  It takes time to remove it.  I am used to &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; mascara.  But, this mascara looked very nice , separated my lashes and added length.  Minus 1 star for difficult removal only.</li>
            <li> I always loved this company, specifically the type of brush that the LashBlast mascara makes. I&#x27;m blonde, and this brown mascara looks both natural and allows me to get down to the very roots. Too bad I didn&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; label though...Unless you trust your makeup remover a lot, this can potentially rip out some eyelashes (which sucks if youre like me and already have a scarce amount...)</li>
            <li> Not pleased with it&#x27;s clumpy texture.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the color. It was extremely hard to get off which Is the point I guess but my eyes hurt for a couple days after removing it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product basically every day for the past two years. It is definitely my favorite waterproof mascara and you can&#x27;t beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;Only two coats and my eyelashes look instantly thicker and longer. It stays put all day without flaking and easily comes off with makeup remover or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;5/5 I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Brittles are very short and fat so I find that it doesn&#x27;t grab my bottom lashes well.  Clumps terribly, even when it was brand new!  I have long lashes and clumps really show!</li>
            <li> Love it - been using for years.</li>
            <li> Wow i really like this mascara, it&#x27;s very wet and goes on perfect. I love the brush, it&#x27;s so thick and separate each lashes. i also like how it doesn&#x27;t clump and its really water proof. This is my first time using the color dark brown mascara, it actually looks nice and more natural. love it, will recommend.</li>
            <li> I never use any other mascara.  This is the best, and cheap!</li>
            <li> This is the brand I use for beautiful lashes and to cover the gray hair along my edges!! Waterproof makes sure that the mascara isn&#x27;t rubbed off by sweat or humidity.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered the black non waterproof but I got the opposite. brown and waterproof. not good since my eyelashes fall out a lot. so definitely need makeup remover to take off this product. but its not clumpy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> gave it to a friend and they love it!</li>
            <li> Very waterproof, nice wand, great volume, and holds a lash curl! I have this mascara in very black and it does wonder on my eyes. I would highly recommend this for all especially if you curl you lashes and want them to stay curled. Out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, this on holds my lash curls the best and the longest. Plus, the mascara never clumps!</li>
            <li> Just as expected and just as described.  I have previously used this product prior to using and so I knew I would love it.</li>
            <li> Brush causes it to go on clumpy.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!!!  The big brush helps the mascara to go on easily and quickly.  Seperates the lashes and makes them stand out.  No problem at all with smudging and if you get a clump on the wand, you just pump it in the tube to get it off.  There is nothing about this mascara not to like.  I&#x27;ve already purcahsed 3 more tubes of this great mascara:)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my trip to England. Works great, didn&#x27;t run down my face once.</li>
            <li> Seemed a little dried out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little watery but not bad for the price. It&#x27;s 8.99 at CVS and closer to half that when ordered as an add on.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  It does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> Worst mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Wearing contacts, having a waterproof mascara that is really actually waterproof is a MUST.  Love this mascara!  It does not run, no matter how much my eyes water or if I am in the pool.  Just wish it was a cheap as I&#x27;d found it once all the time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.  It goes on easily and stays on all day.  It doesn&#x27;t wash off in the pool which is what I really like about it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake or bleed, but comes off easily with water.  I like the color just fine.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite mascaras! I like the thick brush and it makes my lashes look amazing without making them feel brittle or look spidery.&lt;br /&gt;This and Full and Soft would be my go-to mascaras.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, my daughter and I always use this one!</li>
            <li> Only Mascara I buy! Great quality! Only I wish it lasted a bit longer. ..</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely waterproof, but its really runny and too much comes off onto the wand every time. The wand is also a little thick and the bristles are short. This mascara doesn&#x27;t provide much length, and clumps, but the main reason I bought it is so I could wear it at a theme park, and it does the job of not running down my face when soaked. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again though because of the cons.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after wearing the same pink brand mascara for years. It helped that Amazon had a virtual coupon to clip for it. I like it but do not find it exactly clump free. I still have to work my lashes with the wand so none stick together. I only wear it on my top lashes since I end up with racoon eyes when I wear mascara on my lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! I&#x27;ve noticed recently that my eyelashes aren&#x27;t as full as they once were, which saddens me as it&#x27;s probably a sign of aging. sigh Anyhow, this mascara goes on so easily, the brush is perfectly tufted to make application a breeze. And the best part is that I have long thick lashed again!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  doesn&#x27;t make my lashes spidery, but stays on well all day without flaking.  I&#x27;m not thrilled with the color, but I&#x27;m used to black/black and gave this a try.  It is a dark brown and will work well with more neutral eye-makeup during the day.</li>
            <li> Item is dryed out...cant use. Going to return it.</li>
            <li> Goes on very nice, not lumpy at all. Very nice brown color.</li>
            <li> Still looking for the best way to take it off, but it is really great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the brush that came with it so I use the brush from my previous mascara.</li>
            <li> Great price on a mascara that is great for sports wear</li>
            <li> Love covergirl products! Great mascara</li>
