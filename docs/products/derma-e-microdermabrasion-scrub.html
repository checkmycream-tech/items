            <li>I recieve a deluxe sample from ipsy and have fallen in love with this scrub!</li>
            <li>This scrub keeps my skin clean and beautiful</li>
            <li>This is a fine microdermabrasion and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks smoother, brighter, and it feels amazing...</li>
            <li>My skin look amazing after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply derma ePeptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Creme and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel amazing and it stays that way for the days in between using it.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>AND IT IS JUST WHAT I WANTED; DOES A GREAT JOB OF EXFOILATING AND LEAVES MY SKIN SO SMOOTH; ALSO SMELLS SO NICE;</li>
            <li>and i really feel my skin looks very good!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard good things about microdermabrasion, and the beauty attendant at the store (who had incredible skin) swore by it.</li>
            <li>I liked this scrub</li>
            <li>even though I liked the scrub because of what it did for my face</li>
            <li>this stuff is the best skin treatment I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire intelligent 20 years of life as a face wash power women.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that does what it&#x27;s meant to do and gently.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also nice and not overpowering.      </li>
            <li>I always apply a nice moisturizer after using it.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like it is a nice treat when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>but the state of it kind of took the wind out of my sails.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t think of any cons.</li>
            <li>Be kind to you skin and it will be kind to you.  </li>
            <li>but it is extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>nice feel to the skin after use.</li>
            <li>This Scrub really works well and is the best I&#x27;ve used ever to make your skin smooth!</li>
            <li>The top #1 microdermabrasion product from TOP BEAUTY award ratings for a reason!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good home microdermabrasion kit since the one I used before is no longer available here in the US.</li>
            <li>Very happy so far.</li>
            <li>The best one I tried so far</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful natural lemon scent.</li>
            <li>This is the best one as far as I an concerned.</li>
            <li>Highly Effective and works better than drug store brands.</li>
            <li>Derma e&#x27;s Microdermabrasion Scrub is much more effective.</li>
            <li>This is the best over the counter microdermabrasion I&#x27;ve found thus far.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural, and I was truly impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth, and looks good.</li>
            <li>The scrub is very fine and smells like lemon pie.  </li>
            <li>The texture is made up of very very fine granules.</li>
            <li>The sand is very fine, and I don&#x27;t feel like I am sand-blasting my face off.  </li>
            <li>The grains are very fine and not abrasive...</li>
            <li>this stuff is good to clean off and scrub skin</li>
            <li>I use it once a week, very lightly</li>
            <li>but I just use a very light touch when scrubbing my face.  </li>
            <li>For a natural products, the price is very good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply the scrub with water still on my face and this works much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using it for now, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll look for another product every once in a while.</li>
            <li>Besides the yummy citrus scent, there is a LOT to love about this scrub.</li>
            <li>The product in the sample packs was more granular which I wanted, while the one that I ordered was more creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I LOVE DermaE products</li>
            <li>Top</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly fabulous !</li>
            <li>No redness afterwards and lotions sink in better.</li>
            <li>5 minutes is all you need for a better complexion.</li>
            <li>Better then most chemical dermabrasion that take off layers and layers of skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was also impressed by the following Derma E face and body creams:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the way my face looks and feels after using the scrub.  </li>
            <li>If you want to look younger, this is an awesome product.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for many years</li>
            <li>Much better than any of the runny drug store brands with one exception by booth</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m def not buying it again unless they give more info on the ingrediants.</li>
            <li>Love all Derma E products.</li>
            <li>You may have a better result though.</li>
            <li>It is a magical product.</li>

            <li>I have tried many.</li>
            <li>It feels really refreshing</li>
            <li>but I like another brand better than this</li>
            <li>ABsolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Works great, really smooths my skin.</li>
            <li>I love all Derma a products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Like lemon drops :)</li>
            <li>Wish they were more than 1oz each</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the great selection of merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;Andrea</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>but I love using this stuff after I shave, as it smooths and softens my skin so well.  </li>
            <li>And as always, you gotta love the subscribe and save option...</li>
            <li>Most days I use it alone, but sometimes I also use my spinning exfoliator brush.  </li>
            <li>After trying the product, I felt this product was better than the one I&#x27;ve been using and switched without hesitation.  </li>
            <li>This is my second jar and it really is an excellent exfoliant.</li>
            <li>This one I will keep buying for sure.</li>
            <li>while showering and I love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better than ever.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the best luck with this brand in liking their facial cleansers and lotions</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Been using for years, I am 69, and receive many compliments on my skin,</li>
            <li>I love the Derma E line of products.  </li>
            <li>my bf asked me so many times are you wearing makeup</li>
            <li>im like no :-).</li>
            <li>Now that my skin looks a lot better</li>
            <li>I Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li>Out of all the microdermabrasion products I have used this one is my favorite</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels after using this.</li>
            <li>Once a week seems to be perfect, and i find that using minimal water makes the scrub more effective.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t recommend using it more that once a week</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Like this derma e product the most.</li>
            <li>Washes clean easily and leaves my face looking bright and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>actually am able to use it every day with no irritation...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This works better than any exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY scrubs over the years.</li>
            <li>When I could no longer find my favorite, I got a sample of this in the mail.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I felt that I would need a more agressive abrasion scrub</li>
            <li>but I am more discerning than others.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes your face feel.</li>
            <li>This provides a nice 3xs a week polishing to give a glow and clean out the pores.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I loved this scrub the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Gentle but highly effective!</li>
            <li>I use this 2 to 3 times a week after cleansing and it does a great job keeping my skin smooth and ready for treatment products.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually really great and super cheap and a mild alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love that derma e is cruelty free and all their products are healthy.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite features of this scrub is the fine granule size.</li>
            <li>and my face is so smooth and have seen a huge difference in my skin tone!</li>
            <li>I love the light citrus</li>
            <li>Other Derma e products to try are the Antioxidant Gel, also a great product!!!!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t clean makeup off though so make sure to wash your face either before or after.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>

            <li>It washes off easily without leaving residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is easy on my face</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am prone to breakout with many moisturizers but so far this line has been good.  </li>

            <li>I loved it so much, that I purchased a full size on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The grains are really fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like rubbing fine, fine sand on your face.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as a professional microdermabrasion session at a spa and for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>This scrub doesn&#x27;t cost too much either, which makes it even better!</li>
            <li>The grain is fine and works best using little water.</li>
            <li>The immediate gratification was nice, but the lasting results have been even better!</li>
            <li>Immediately my face looks smooth and polished with a visible improvement in the fine lines that are around the eye area.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial scrub!</li>

            <li>so pleased with This product that I now have a new Favorite with Derma e Microdermabrasion scrub!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like Derma E products and was not disappointed by this one.</li>
            <li>This scrub is comparable to higher end scrubs that cost 3 times as much or more.  </li>
            <li>I started out with the scrub first and was pleased, then purchased the night cream and moisteurizer to compliment the scrub.</li>
            <li>I really love derma e because it is the first product line I have used that has helped me get rid of my acne, and I was contemplating accutane before I found this line.</li>
            <li>This product is worth it at twice the price!  </li>
            <li>Def worth it!</li>
            <li>This scrub leaves my face feeling so fresh!  </li>
            <li>My first jar was plastic which made it more comforting to keep in the shower, this one is glass</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I received this originally in an ipsy bag</li>
            <li>I had a favorite scrub that was pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>but I keep buying it so it must be worth it!</li>
            <li>I really like that the crystals are very fine and not overly abrasive.</li>
            <li>Also gradually shrinks large pores and lessens fine lines!      </li>
            <li>I use it once to twice a week and it makes my skin glow and feel so clean.</li>
            <li>So it feels both more effective and gentler at the same time.</li>
            <li>I like it, helps to clean my skin</li>
            <li>I used this for only 2 days so far and more than 75% of my acne is gone !!!!!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really clean</li>
            <li>I also use a few more products from this company and it&#x27;s all amazing!</li>
            <li>Refined material with effective dermabrasion action.</li>
            <li>To say the least, I was very impressed with this products performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that it really brightened my skin and brought out a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Nice fine crystals to polish the skin and left my face feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li>This product performs like magic; it is not too scratchy and I can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like I&#x27;ve been slapped with a wire brush.  </li>
            <li>Please send me another full jar of the product immediately to honor our agreement.</li>
            <li>My face feels wonderfully smooth and fresh afterward.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product several times and they both are good.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Not a bad scent either</li>
            <li>This scrub is excellent for very dry sensitive skin, like mine.</li>
            <li>I still have a little bit of flakiness after I use it for 3-4 minutes, but for the most part it works fairly well.</li>
            <li>I love its light smell of lemon and how it doesn&#x27;t scratch up my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Scrubs your face well and leaves it smooth,  not too harsh also has a great smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cleared up considerably, and my skin feels lovely and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub is simply the best facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that makes my skin smooth and preps my skin nicely for makeup.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m not as consistent with the use, it still makes a huge difference .</li>
            <li>Has a sweet fresh lemony scent.</li>
            <li>I cant say if its just because of this product, since I have all new products, but its part of a winning team!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love trying new products.</li>
            <li>So basically this scrub really does work!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few weeks of use, I am noticing that breakouts heal quickly and that redness is reduced, which is great.</li>
            <li>Clears off dead cells and reveals a great new healthy layer.</li>
            <li>and I really started noticing the fine lines and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use very often but helps smooth texture/exfoliate in a pinch</li>
            <li>It is a very scrubby scrub (tons of scrubbing particles), but it leaves your face smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>amazing ivery had acne for 15 years and it had never left my face</li>
            <li>Amazing product that delivers medical grade results.</li>
            <li>I love all the derma e products for their natural ingredients and their effectiveness in cleansing, toning or moisturizing my 60</li>
            <li>I was thinking that most of it was natural.</li>
            <li>But this scrub has Stearic Acid and Aluminum Oxide in it  like most non natural scrubs</li>
            <li>but I read the reviews and decided to give this brand one last shot as I was looking for a nice Microdermabrasion Scrub.</li>
            <li>Natural and good for sensitive types.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s obviously not going to be as effective as a microdermabrasion machine</li>
            <li>I do this a couple times a week, and feel so fresh when I do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have a big issue with milia around my chin, and this has not proved to be effective at helping to remove them.</li>
            <li>I also use several other Derma E products and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Anyway - this particular microdermabrasion scrub is the least priced but the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d not found any other product that was good.</li>
            <li>Right after using it you can see a difference.</li>
            <li>The crystal blend is just the right size.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it did what it said and made my skin feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>It has a light sweet lemon scent, tiny beads, and it rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I have been using a clarifying cleanser by another brand, the derma e Soothing Toner, Hydrating Serum, and Hydrating Mist, and all of these are very pure and non-irritating/non-acne-causing.</li>
            <li>and my night creams absorbed into my skin super fast after</li>
            <li>These soft yet mighty pearls do a real number on any peeling skin!!</li>
            <li>and I originally tried this to review on there, but I&#x27;ve been buying it steadily ever since.  </li>
            <li>This does a good job of scrubbing off the dead dry skin and leaving you with fresh nice skin</li>
            <li>So far the results are looking good, so I would definitely recommend this for any skin type!</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and have gotten several comments on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>They are less money and good quality https://www.amazon.com/review/review-your-purchases/ref&#x3D;pe_6680_116681230_cm_add_2_star3?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asins&#x3D;B0000CCW1N%3A3%2CB000SAR2DK&amp;channel&#x3D;ec_phy&amp;crAuthToken&#x3D;gE5G%2BbF%2BtR%2F%2FDLIYTBMMZXn6AJjlFXJDtX902p0AAAADAAAAAFNfV%2BByYXcAAAAA&amp;customerId&#x3D;A1PANSXLPBGVNG#top.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer this come in a tube form as I feel this will be wasted somewhat in a jar, but very happy with the product overall and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I got a good deal on this product and decided to compare my results to the Dr. Brandt product (since this is much less</li>
            <li>and I tend to be super gentle when using it</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling very soft, smooth.  </li>
            <li>It works well on my sensitive skin, getting everything nice and smooth without any strange sensations or overpowering smells.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle.</li>
            <li>You dont have to use very much.</li>
            <li>High-Potency Night-A-Mins which has a very gentle peel effect at night.</li>
            <li>i use it twice a week-no miracles in the fine lines, etc., but it does leave your face soft.</li>
            <li>When I first used the scrub it burned my face very much</li>
            <li>I have always had great skin, hardly ever any breakouts or blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different microdermabrasion products.  </li>
            <li>I was hooked after the first use and bought myself a jar.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back here today , buying this again for a much better price than it was when I first bought it 4 years ago here on Amazon .&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Best face scrub around, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I do it as gently as I can, but it&#x27;s powerful stuff....</li>
            <li>Using twice a week and leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>and we use once or twice a week for soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have found that the all-natural stuff works so much better on my skin overall.  </li>
            <li>It is a lil pricy at first, however you do not need to use a lot of product.</li>
            <li>I am now almost finished with my first bottle and already have ordered my replacement as well as extras to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>I really like this scrub for my brown combination skin!  </li>
            <li>scrub is more like the &#x27;big guns&#x27; of exfoliation-</li>
            <li>This is exactly like the one that my dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need much at all!</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;m sure others have said a similar thing.)</li>
            <li>Yes, it will make your facial complexion better</li>
            <li>My skin also felt soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>The results that you get from using this product should cost so much more, this is such a steal!</li>
            <li>I noticed softer skin after the first use, and pores minimize with continual use.  </li>
            <li>With 2-3 uses per week, this will last you a month or more.</li>
            <li>A good product to help remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>feels good on the skin and its not too harsh.</li>
            <li>I have tried a coupe other Derma E products, one was the acne moisturizer, but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with them.  </li>
            <li>The last couple years I&#x27;ve been using Darphin&#x27;s microdermabrasion, which I really like the consistency of (in fact, it&#x27;s perfect), but it&#x27;s $80 for a small jar.</li>
            <li>I have found other Derma e products to be shockingly effective.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best &amp;#34; at home&amp;#34; micro scrub, and costs a small percent of what I&#x27;ve paid at a spa!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as my primary cleanser on my very acne prone, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry me out and leaves my face feeling clean and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is left feeling so smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It definitely gives a good scrub, but the beads feel like tiny pieces of glass shards.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very clean and smooth and not over dried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many salt scrubs and while they have their unique purpose, this is a product that \\&quot;seriously\\&quot; removes dead skin cells that can clog your pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product, but I think it works really well.</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels better than its looked in a long time.  </li>
            <li>The microdermabrasion is super; my skin is hardly young.</li>
            <li>Its super soft.</li>
            <li>My face always feels super soft and firmer after using this</li>
            <li>I resisted products like this for a long time because I have skin that&#x27;s kind of sensitive.</li>
            <li>Great for scrubbing away dead skin, mature skin &amp; helping the new skin cells come to the surface.</li>
            <li>The scrubbing particles are very fine, which is easier on the skin than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love this scrub, I use it twice a week and it smooths out all the dry skin and helps unclog pores!</li>
            <li>Each time you use this product, you really only need a tiny amount to do an amazing job.</li>
            <li>Up until last week the one thing I was missing was a great microderm scrub and now I found it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is REALLY scrubby.  </li>
            <li>Very scratchy.  </li>
            <li>The scrub really does the job, leaving my skin super-smooth and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps.</li>
            <li>When you consider the price of one spa visit, this cream is very affordable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had really flaky skin on the tip of my nose.</li>
            <li>daughter has moderate to light acne</li>
            <li>We really like this.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>It was very affordable via Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like Derma e products.</li>
            <li>oil free daily face wash</li>
            <li>I like how this product doesn&#x27;t have much chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months (1 or 2x a week) and it works really well to keep my hyperpigmentation at bay.  </li>
            <li>I also am really liking derma-e products.</li>
            <li>Very salty.</li>
            <li>and it really helps with the appearance.</li>
            <li>makes skin feel as though i got a real  microdermabrasion</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell, maybe a hint of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m not a fan of gentle scrubs by any means, but this consistency doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer with a smoother texture.  </li>
            <li>It is very close to what you would experience at a clinic for about $350.00 per treatment.</li>
            <li>Depending on where you buy it, it can cost as much as 24.99.</li>
            <li>Very textured.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable</li>
            <li>I attribute much of that to this product.</li>
            <li>use it twice a week between my every 6 month real microdermabrasion / peel .</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much either.</li>
            <li>I have acne scars and it really helps them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice until after a year</li>
            <li>I also use it for my whole body.</li>
            <li>spent so much looking for something better .</li>
            <li>I recently tried a similar product from Dr. Brandt, though, after receiving it in a subscription box, and I ended up loving it.</li>
            <li>Have been using the scrub for several years - I love the citrus-y smell and the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>When I use this scrub I always make sure to wash with facial soap after, then I use a toner and natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I also just purchased the Very Clear Spot Treatment, and the ingredient list looks very promising and non-irritating as well.</li>
            <li>Love the mild citrus fragrance (and I usually prefer fragrance-free products).</li>
            <li>BUT - if you have very fine wrinkles around your lips - even with using Retin A (Tretinoin), you STILL need to slightly exfoliate this area -</li>
            <li>sure if all of those compliments are due to the Microderm scrub, but hey, the connection is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably okay for other areas, like elbows or heels.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used many other products.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of their other skincare lines may have overwhelming floral scent, or paste like texture.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other face scrub I have used.</li>
            <li>The granular of the product is extremely fine compared to other similarly priced products that claim to have fine crystals but end up being large and ineffective.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle, no breakouts even with my sensitive combo skin.</li>
            <li>super expensive stuff that I loved.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fine and thick and the results are visible right after your routine.</li>
            <li>I use this scrub on average 2 times a week, sometimes more</li>
            <li>I used this scrub twice a week, and it abrades old, dead skin cells wonderfully without being too harsh or scratchy.</li>
            <li>I usually refuse to use microdermabrasion scrubs of any kind.</li>
            <li>When I was 28, I became pregnant with my first child and suddenly I was like a 13 year old going through puberty.  </li>
            <li>Thinking back to how my skin looked this time last year, there is huge amount of improvement!</li>
            <li>Less is more with this product.</li>
            <li>It gets rid of stray visible bits of dry skin and makes the surface of my skin smooth (and not oily).</li>
            <li>Your skin is left feeling sooooo soft and clean afterward, really glowing.</li>
            <li>A decent scrub, it nonetheless did nothing to minimize my acne scarring.  </li>
            <li>Also, my skin is smoother, softer, and vibrant looking.</li>
            <li>I first was introduced to this product through a health store who was giving out small sample packets and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have acne prone skin, and am getting a bit older.</li>
            <li>However, this scrub is not for acneic skin, as there is carrageenan in it, which is highly acnegenic.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use other products in the Derma E line, but this is by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li>Use just a tiny bit with a warm very wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, a little lemony maybe.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ts not irritating and your skin is soft.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this in my Ipsy bag a few months ago and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I normally break out with any face scrubs, but not with this.</li>
            <li>but I also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before.</li>
            <li>First discovered it at Whole Foods in their beauty/vitamin aisle where it was double the price!!  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone just make sure and use in moderations otherwise you may destroy your skin.</li>
            <li>I use it at least once or twice a week but could use it more often during hot summer months.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you scrub your face long enough.</li>
            <li>I had no negative reactions to this.</li>
            <li>if used on dry skin, it is a bit more \\&quot;rough\\&quot;, but if you wet the skin first, it will be gentler on the face.</li>
            <li>The fine volcanic sand makes all the difference between it and other scrubs.  </li>
            <li>it left my skin clearer and smoother than most of the stuff I bought on Amazon to get rid of milia bumps and dry skin</li>
            <li>Really live the feeling if my skin after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this.</li>
            <li>so when I buy new products I&#x27;m always concerned about what my skins reaction will be.</li>
            <li>Your skin looks so fresh the next day and feels so soft .</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>br /&gt;you past 40, are softened and smoothed and your skin looks healthy and supple.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this stuff when I got a facial done.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Sally because I have long-term kp and this product made my skin look different after trying it first night .</li>
            <li>After use, my skin feels amazingly soft!  </li>
            <li>I alternate between several different scrubs, and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>but I think when used properly its pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of Department store and spa only products and this one is just as effective, if not more so.</li>
            <li>Use caution with sensitive skin though, it&#x27;s pretty gritty!</li>
            <li>Fine particles and little to no scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first scrub I&#x27;ve found that exactly compares with the other product!</li>
            <li>What a quick way to gently remove dead surface cells and condition your face.  </li>
            <li>Believe me, I&#x27;m more than ashamed to admit I did use super expensive products -</li>
            <li>It has a faint lemon scent and leaves my skin super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>AS SUGGESTED ON THE CONTAINER, AND HAVE NOTICED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS.</li>
            <li>Just wait until you skin is clear to use this product as from my experience</li>
            <li>i just wash with this and my skin appears young and dewy...</li>
            <li>At the ripe old age of 36</li>
            <li>came across this product while shopping at a natural food store.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look nearly my age</li>
            <li>just wanted to write an updated review now that I&#x27;ve used this product for nearly a year.</li>
            <li>+ year old sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It washes off completely-</li>
            <li>Pond&#x27;s BB Cream - Luminous Finish&lt;br /&gt;evenings: bel essence all natural anti wrinkle cream</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 30 and have been struggling with cystic adult acne.</li>
            <li>No harsh grains, chemicals or drying.  </li>
            <li>Every time I use it my skin is baby soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin exfoliated and soft.</li>
            <li>pleased to report that this product performs quite well (at least as well as the competing product).</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after use.</li>
            <li>but that was only because I used too much.</li>
            <li>This scrub is made with natural ingredients</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>Works well for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not tested on animals, contains no animal ingredients and is all natural.</li>
            <li>I have a bit too sensitive skin and my skin did not tolerate it.</li>
            <li>so far, thank you.</li>
            <li>It has moisture emollients which leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li>but it leaves my skin feeling so so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so I bought the aluminum oxide crystals from IQ natural and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>Bonus: the skin recovers as you sleep, so you look extra fresh the next morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite product for removing (greasy or thick) waterproof zinc oxide sunscreens.</li>
            <li>The perfect combination of an exfoliating scrub with added minerals in a cream base.</li>
            <li>Take it easy, as the sea salt crystals are pretty tough.</li>
            <li>It seems harsh at first but after a few days you will notice a glow and the new skin looks fab:)  </li>
            <li>the best I&#x27;ve found so far, the granules are the right size and it&#x27;s not filled with the bad, unpronounceable stuff.</li>
            <li>I am a dark skinned black girl that had a nice amount of discoloration on my face after years of acne.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, face feels very smooth and is shiny after use.</li>
            <li>I have yet to see any other product remove dead skin cells quite so effectively in one application.</li>
            <li>I use the scrub only once a month mainly because I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for 40 and older and leave the sugar scrubs for teenagers.</li>
            <li>this reminds me of pumice soaps used to clean hands, and is very different than other scrubs made with seeds, etc.</li>
            <li>St Ives apricot scrub back in high school.</li>
            <li>And make sure hands and face are wet makes it way less scratchy.</li>
            <li>Works great and you only need to use a small dab of it everyday!</li>
            <li>St. Ives and other popular scrubs have larger pieces that feel clumsy and don&#x27;t seem to really reach your pores.</li>
            <li>have normal skin, but being in my mid 50&#x27;s ~ I am grateful to have a product that can help bring the glow of youth</li>
            <li>It is pretty rough on your skin</li>
            <li>Actually, it feels so good that I have to be careful not to rub it over and over for too long, because then it does irritate a little.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since last year I changed all of my face products and this is one of my new ones.</li>
            <li>I am a certified aesthetician and this stuff really left my skin feeling brand new.</li>
            <li>very similar to dr brandt scrub and smells the same but much cheaper</li>
            <li>I did not receive a full jar of the product and feel it is unfair to charge full price for a fraction of the product.</li>
            <li>in fact, maybe more so because you do use this type of product so it can get a little flaky if you aren&#x27;t SUPER careful (which, sometimes, it just plain does regardless).</li>
            <li>Originally found this product in a discount store and bought solely because my usual brand of dermabrasion products could no longer be shipped into the US.  </li>
            <li>Fine texture and only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty intense, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It really helps clear my complexion and erase dark spots.</li>
            <li>Scrub gently and for at least a minute to really get the dirt/dead skin off of your face!</li>
            <li>It also looks clear, a definite plus!</li>
            <li>She too said she suffered with skin-detox pimples after switching to natural lines and said this product was the only thing that worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Makes acne scars barely visible.</li>
            <li>The texture is gentle and exfoliates without harmful rough products.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical because i tried more expensive products that claimed to be good.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s also prone to break-outs and has a tendency to get dull quickly.  </li>
            <li>I recently began using only natural and organic products on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third container of this and don&#x27;t see myself using anything else in the near future.  </li>
            <li>I have replaced all my facial products with this brand as the old ones ran out and I will not be changing back again two thumbs way up!</li>
            <li>This one is far less expensive and does just as good of a job.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;d pay $30 for this, but at $16 it was worth it.</li>
            <li>First of all, do not use this scrub everyday.  </li>
            <li>Not amazing but not bad either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real fan of Derma-E products and this one doesn&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li>But, that doesn&#x27;t mean this isn&#x27;t a good exfoiliator, it just means the dermis of the skin is thick and exfoiliating isn&#x27;t necessarily going to get rid of something I&#x27;ve suffered with for years.</li>
            <li>Im 37 with oily, sensitive skin but have dry patches too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s for everyone, especially if you have very sensitive skin, as this product basically scrapes the old dermis completely off.</li>
            <li>Well first of all, I still have about half the jar left so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a large jar, so you should use it sparingly, and you don&#x27;t need to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>It is a small container, but you don&#x27;t need very much at all per scrubbing so it lasts for months.</li>

            <li> I recieve a deluxe sample from ipsy and have fallen in love with this scrub!</li>
            <li> This scrub keeps my skin clean and beautiful</li>
            <li> This is a fine microdermabrasion and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother, brighter, and it feels amazing...</li>
            <li> My skin look amazing after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply derma ePeptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Creme and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel amazing and it stays that way for the days in between using it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> AND IT IS JUST WHAT I WANTED; DOES A GREAT JOB OF EXFOILATING AND LEAVES MY SKIN SO SMOOTH; ALSO SMELLS SO NICE;</li>
            <li> and i really feel my skin looks very good!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard good things about microdermabrasion, and the beauty attendant at the store (who had incredible skin) swore by it.</li>
            <li> I liked this scrub</li>
            <li> even though I liked the scrub because of what it did for my face</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best skin treatment I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire intelligent 20 years of life as a face wash power women.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that does what it&#x27;s meant to do and gently.  </li>
            <li> The smell is also nice and not overpowering.      </li>
            <li> I always apply a nice moisturizer after using it.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like it is a nice treat when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> but the state of it kind of took the wind out of my sails.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t think of any cons.</li>
            <li> Be kind to you skin and it will be kind to you.  </li>
            <li> but it is extremely effective.  </li>
            <li> nice feel to the skin after use.</li>
            <li> This Scrub really works well and is the best I&#x27;ve used ever to make your skin smooth!</li>
            <li> The top #1 microdermabrasion product from TOP BEAUTY award ratings for a reason!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good home microdermabrasion kit since the one I used before is no longer available here in the US.</li>
            <li> Very happy so far.</li>
            <li> The best one I tried so far</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful natural lemon scent.</li>
            <li> This is the best one as far as I an concerned.</li>
            <li> Highly Effective and works better than drug store brands.</li>
            <li> Derma e&#x27;s Microdermabrasion Scrub is much more effective.</li>
            <li> This is the best over the counter microdermabrasion I&#x27;ve found thus far.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural, and I was truly impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth, and looks good.</li>
            <li> The scrub is very fine and smells like lemon pie.  </li>
            <li> The texture is made up of very very fine granules.</li>
            <li> The sand is very fine, and I don&#x27;t feel like I am sand-blasting my face off.  </li>
            <li> The grains are very fine and not abrasive...</li>
            <li> this stuff is good to clean off and scrub skin</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, very lightly</li>
            <li> but I just use a very light touch when scrubbing my face.  </li>
            <li> For a natural products, the price is very good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply the scrub with water still on my face and this works much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using it for now, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll look for another product every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Besides the yummy citrus scent, there is a LOT to love about this scrub.</li>
            <li> The product in the sample packs was more granular which I wanted, while the one that I ordered was more creamy texture.</li>
            <li> I LOVE DermaE products</li>
            <li> Top</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly fabulous !</li>
            <li> No redness afterwards and lotions sink in better.</li>
            <li> 5 minutes is all you need for a better complexion.</li>
            <li> Better then most chemical dermabrasion that take off layers and layers of skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was also impressed by the following Derma E face and body creams:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the way my face looks and feels after using the scrub.  </li>
            <li> If you want to look younger, this is an awesome product.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for many years</li>
            <li> Much better than any of the runny drug store brands with one exception by booth</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m def not buying it again unless they give more info on the ingrediants.</li>

            <li> Wish they were more than 1oz each</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for the great selection of merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;Andrea</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> but I love using this stuff after I shave, as it smooths and softens my skin so well.  </li>
            <li> And as always, you gotta love the subscribe and save option...</li>
            <li> Most days I use it alone, but sometimes I also use my spinning exfoliator brush.  </li>
            <li> After trying the product, I felt this product was better than the one I&#x27;ve been using and switched without hesitation.  </li>
            <li> This is my second jar and it really is an excellent exfoliant.</li>
            <li> This one I will keep buying for sure.</li>
            <li> while showering and I love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better than ever.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the best luck with this brand in liking their facial cleansers and lotions</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Been using for years, I am 69, and receive many compliments on my skin,</li>
            <li> I love the Derma E line of products.  </li>
            <li> my bf asked me so many times are you wearing makeup</li>
            <li> im like no :-).</li>
            <li> Now that my skin looks a lot better</li>

            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li> Out of all the microdermabrasion products I have used this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after using this.</li>
            <li> Once a week seems to be perfect, and i find that using minimal water makes the scrub more effective.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t recommend using it more that once a week</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Like this derma e product the most.</li>
            <li> Washes clean easily and leaves my face looking bright and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> actually am able to use it every day with no irritation...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This works better than any exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY scrubs over the years.</li>
            <li> When I could no longer find my favorite, I got a sample of this in the mail.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I felt that I would need a more agressive abrasion scrub</li>
            <li> but I am more discerning than others.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes your face feel.</li>
            <li> This provides a nice 3xs a week polishing to give a glow and clean out the pores.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I loved this scrub the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Gentle but highly effective!</li>
            <li> I use this 2 to 3 times a week after cleansing and it does a great job keeping my skin smooth and ready for treatment products.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually really great and super cheap and a mild alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love that derma e is cruelty free and all their products are healthy.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite features of this scrub is the fine granule size.</li>
            <li> and my face is so smooth and have seen a huge difference in my skin tone!</li>
            <li> I love the light citrus</li>
            <li> Other Derma e products to try are the Antioxidant Gel, also a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t clean makeup off though so make sure to wash your face either before or after.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Washed off really easily with no residue.  </li>
            <li> It washes off easily without leaving residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is easy on my face</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am prone to breakout with many moisturizers but so far this line has been good.  </li>
            <li> And my cheap Japanese exfoliating cloth is better and more effective!</li>
            <li> Very good product, exfoliating dead skin indeed and leave it a very young and bright after using it !</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Demra E makes some of the best skin care products on the market, hands down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> If used according to instructions you will be too.&lt;br /&gt;People comment on the smoothness of my skin, I&#x27;m over 70, and the fine lines around the mouth area, eyes, well, you know where they land once&lt;</li>
            <li> This is great for 30 something skin not dry yet and not oily everywhere anymore.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much, that I purchased a full size on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The grains are really fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like rubbing fine, fine sand on your face.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as a professional microdermabrasion session at a spa and for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> This scrub doesn&#x27;t cost too much either, which makes it even better!</li>
            <li> The grain is fine and works best using little water.</li>
            <li> The immediate gratification was nice, but the lasting results have been even better!</li>
            <li> Immediately my face looks smooth and polished with a visible improvement in the fine lines that are around the eye area.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial scrub!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it though because I like the roughness.</li>

            <li> I am used to using a fragrance free glycolic cleanser.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased again, as I found myself using the scrub excessively, as I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t comfortable to use and</li>

            <li> so pleased with This product that I now have a new Favorite with Derma e Microdermabrasion scrub!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like Derma E products and was not disappointed by this one.</li>
            <li> This scrub is comparable to higher end scrubs that cost 3 times as much or more.  </li>
            <li> I started out with the scrub first and was pleased, then purchased the night cream and moisteurizer to compliment the scrub.</li>
            <li> I really love derma e because it is the first product line I have used that has helped me get rid of my acne, and I was contemplating accutane before I found this line.</li>
            <li> This product is worth it at twice the price!  </li>
            <li> Def worth it!</li>
            <li> This scrub leaves my face feeling so fresh!  </li>
            <li> My first jar was plastic which made it more comforting to keep in the shower, this one is glass</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I received this originally in an ipsy bag</li>
            <li> I had a favorite scrub that was pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> but I keep buying it so it must be worth it!</li>
            <li> I really like that the crystals are very fine and not overly abrasive.</li>
            <li> Also gradually shrinks large pores and lessens fine lines!      </li>
            <li> I use it once to twice a week and it makes my skin glow and feel so clean.</li>
            <li> So it feels both more effective and gentler at the same time.</li>
            <li> I like it, helps to clean my skin</li>
            <li> I used this for only 2 days so far and more than 75% of my acne is gone !!!!!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really clean</li>
            <li> I also use a few more products from this company and it&#x27;s all amazing!</li>
            <li> Refined material with effective dermabrasion action.</li>
            <li> To say the least, I was very impressed with this products performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that it really brightened my skin and brought out a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> Nice fine crystals to polish the skin and left my face feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li> This product performs like magic; it is not too scratchy and I can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like I&#x27;ve been slapped with a wire brush.  </li>
            <li> Please send me another full jar of the product immediately to honor our agreement.</li>
            <li> My face feels wonderfully smooth and fresh afterward.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product several times and they both are good.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Not a bad scent either</li>
            <li> This scrub is excellent for very dry sensitive skin, like mine.</li>
            <li> I still have a little bit of flakiness after I use it for 3-4 minutes, but for the most part it works fairly well.</li>
            <li> I love its light smell of lemon and how it doesn&#x27;t scratch up my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Scrubs your face well and leaves it smooth,  not too harsh also has a great smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleared up considerably, and my skin feels lovely and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub is simply the best facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that makes my skin smooth and preps my skin nicely for makeup.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m not as consistent with the use, it still makes a huge difference .</li>
            <li> Has a sweet fresh lemony scent.</li>
            <li> I cant say if its just because of this product, since I have all new products, but its part of a winning team!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love trying new products.</li>
            <li> So basically this scrub really does work!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of use, I am noticing that breakouts heal quickly and that redness is reduced, which is great.</li>
            <li> Clears off dead cells and reveals a great new healthy layer.</li>
            <li> and I really started noticing the fine lines and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use very often but helps smooth texture/exfoliate in a pinch</li>
            <li> It is a very scrubby scrub (tons of scrubbing particles), but it leaves your face smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> amazing ivery had acne for 15 years and it had never left my face</li>
            <li> Amazing product that delivers medical grade results.</li>
            <li> I love all the derma e products for their natural ingredients and their effectiveness in cleansing, toning or moisturizing my 60</li>
            <li> I was thinking that most of it was natural.</li>
            <li> But this scrub has Stearic Acid and Aluminum Oxide in it  like most non natural scrubs</li>
            <li> but I read the reviews and decided to give this brand one last shot as I was looking for a nice Microdermabrasion Scrub.</li>
            <li> Natural and good for sensitive types.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s obviously not going to be as effective as a microdermabrasion machine</li>
            <li> I do this a couple times a week, and feel so fresh when I do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have a big issue with milia around my chin, and this has not proved to be effective at helping to remove them.</li>
            <li> I also use several other Derma E products and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Anyway - this particular microdermabrasion scrub is the least priced but the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d not found any other product that was good.</li>
            <li> Right after using it you can see a difference.</li>
            <li> The crystal blend is just the right size.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it did what it said and made my skin feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> It has a light sweet lemon scent, tiny beads, and it rinses clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using a clarifying cleanser by another brand, the derma e Soothing Toner, Hydrating Serum, and Hydrating Mist, and all of these are very pure and non-irritating/non-acne-causing.</li>
            <li> and my night creams absorbed into my skin super fast after</li>
            <li> These soft yet mighty pearls do a real number on any peeling skin!!</li>
            <li> and I originally tried this to review on there, but I&#x27;ve been buying it steadily ever since.  </li>
            <li> This does a good job of scrubbing off the dead dry skin and leaving you with fresh nice skin</li>
            <li> So far the results are looking good, so I would definitely recommend this for any skin type!</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and have gotten several comments on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> They are less money and good quality https://www.amazon.com/review/review-your-purchases/ref&#x3D;pe_6680_116681230_cm_add_2_star3?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asins&#x3D;B0000CCW1N%3A3%2CB000SAR2DK&amp;channel&#x3D;ec_phy&amp;crAuthToken&#x3D;gE5G%2BbF%2BtR%2F%2FDLIYTBMMZXn6AJjlFXJDtX902p0AAAADAAAAAFNfV%2BByYXcAAAAA&amp;customerId&#x3D;A1PANSXLPBGVNG#top.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer this come in a tube form as I feel this will be wasted somewhat in a jar, but very happy with the product overall and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I got a good deal on this product and decided to compare my results to the Dr. Brandt product (since this is much less</li>
            <li> and I tend to be super gentle when using it</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling very soft, smooth.  </li>
            <li> It works well on my sensitive skin, getting everything nice and smooth without any strange sensations or overpowering smells.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle.</li>
            <li> You dont have to use very much.</li>
            <li> High-Potency Night-A-Mins which has a very gentle peel effect at night.</li>
            <li> i use it twice a week-no miracles in the fine lines, etc., but it does leave your face soft.</li>
            <li> When I first used the scrub it burned my face very much</li>
            <li> I have always had great skin, hardly ever any breakouts or blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different microdermabrasion products.  </li>
            <li> I was hooked after the first use and bought myself a jar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back here today , buying this again for a much better price than it was when I first bought it 4 years ago here on Amazon .&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Best face scrub around, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I do it as gently as I can, but it&#x27;s powerful stuff....</li>
            <li> Using twice a week and leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> and we use once or twice a week for soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have found that the all-natural stuff works so much better on my skin overall.  </li>
            <li> It is a lil pricy at first, however you do not need to use a lot of product.</li>
            <li> I am now almost finished with my first bottle and already have ordered my replacement as well as extras to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I really like this scrub for my brown combination skin!  </li>
            <li> scrub is more like the &#x27;big guns&#x27; of exfoliation-</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the one that my dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need much at all!</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m sure others have said a similar thing.)</li>
            <li> Yes, it will make your facial complexion better</li>
            <li> My skin also felt soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li> The results that you get from using this product should cost so much more, this is such a steal!</li>
            <li> I noticed softer skin after the first use, and pores minimize with continual use.  </li>
            <li> With 2-3 uses per week, this will last you a month or more.</li>
            <li> A good product to help remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> feels good on the skin and its not too harsh.</li>
            <li> I have tried a coupe other Derma E products, one was the acne moisturizer, but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with them.  </li>
            <li> The last couple years I&#x27;ve been using Darphin&#x27;s microdermabrasion, which I really like the consistency of (in fact, it&#x27;s perfect), but it&#x27;s $80 for a small jar.</li>
            <li> I have found other Derma e products to be shockingly effective.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best &amp;#34; at home&amp;#34; micro scrub, and costs a small percent of what I&#x27;ve paid at a spa!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my primary cleanser on my very acne prone, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry me out and leaves my face feeling clean and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is left feeling so smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It definitely gives a good scrub, but the beads feel like tiny pieces of glass shards.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very clean and smooth and not over dried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many salt scrubs and while they have their unique purpose, this is a product that \\&quot;seriously\\&quot; removes dead skin cells that can clog your pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product, but I think it works really well.</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels better than its looked in a long time.  </li>
            <li> The microdermabrasion is super; my skin is hardly young.</li>
            <li> Its super soft.</li>
            <li> My face always feels super soft and firmer after using this</li>
            <li> I resisted products like this for a long time because I have skin that&#x27;s kind of sensitive.</li>
            <li> Great for scrubbing away dead skin, mature skin &amp; helping the new skin cells come to the surface.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing particles are very fine, which is easier on the skin than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub, I use it twice a week and it smooths out all the dry skin and helps unclog pores!</li>
            <li> Each time you use this product, you really only need a tiny amount to do an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Up until last week the one thing I was missing was a great microderm scrub and now I found it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is REALLY scrubby.  </li>
            <li> Very scratchy.  </li>
            <li> The scrub really does the job, leaving my skin super-smooth and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps.</li>
            <li> When you consider the price of one spa visit, this cream is very affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really flaky skin on the tip of my nose.</li>
            <li> daughter has moderate to light acne</li>
            <li> We really like this.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  </li>
            <li> It was very affordable via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like Derma e products.</li>
            <li> oil free daily face wash</li>
            <li> I like how this product doesn&#x27;t have much chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months (1 or 2x a week) and it works really well to keep my hyperpigmentation at bay.  </li>
            <li> I also am really liking derma-e products.</li>
            <li> Very salty.</li>
            <li> and it really helps with the appearance.</li>
            <li> makes skin feel as though i got a real  microdermabrasion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell, maybe a hint of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m not a fan of gentle scrubs by any means, but this consistency doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> My skin is much clearer with a smoother texture.  </li>
            <li> It is very close to what you would experience at a clinic for about $350.00 per treatment.</li>
            <li> Depending on where you buy it, it can cost as much as 24.99.</li>
            <li> Very textured.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable</li>
            <li> I attribute much of that to this product.</li>
            <li> use it twice a week between my every 6 month real microdermabrasion / peel .</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much either.</li>
            <li> I have acne scars and it really helps them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice until after a year</li>
            <li> I also use it for my whole body.</li>
            <li> spent so much looking for something better .</li>
            <li> I recently tried a similar product from Dr. Brandt, though, after receiving it in a subscription box, and I ended up loving it.</li>
            <li> Have been using the scrub for several years - I love the citrus-y smell and the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> When I use this scrub I always make sure to wash with facial soap after, then I use a toner and natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I also just purchased the Very Clear Spot Treatment, and the ingredient list looks very promising and non-irritating as well.</li>
            <li> Love the mild citrus fragrance (and I usually prefer fragrance-free products).</li>
            <li> BUT - if you have very fine wrinkles around your lips - even with using Retin A (Tretinoin), you STILL need to slightly exfoliate this area -</li>
            <li> sure if all of those compliments are due to the Microderm scrub, but hey, the connection is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably okay for other areas, like elbows or heels.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many other products.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of their other skincare lines may have overwhelming floral scent, or paste like texture.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other face scrub I have used.</li>
            <li> The granular of the product is extremely fine compared to other similarly priced products that claim to have fine crystals but end up being large and ineffective.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle, no breakouts even with my sensitive combo skin.</li>
            <li> super expensive stuff that I loved.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fine and thick and the results are visible right after your routine.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub on average 2 times a week, sometimes more</li>
            <li> I used this scrub twice a week, and it abrades old, dead skin cells wonderfully without being too harsh or scratchy.</li>
            <li> I usually refuse to use microdermabrasion scrubs of any kind.</li>
            <li> When I was 28, I became pregnant with my first child and suddenly I was like a 13 year old going through puberty.  </li>
            <li> Thinking back to how my skin looked this time last year, there is huge amount of improvement!</li>
            <li> Less is more with this product.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of stray visible bits of dry skin and makes the surface of my skin smooth (and not oily).</li>
            <li> Your skin is left feeling sooooo soft and clean afterward, really glowing.</li>
            <li> A decent scrub, it nonetheless did nothing to minimize my acne scarring.  </li>
            <li> Also, my skin is smoother, softer, and vibrant looking.</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to this product through a health store who was giving out small sample packets and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have acne prone skin, and am getting a bit older.</li>
            <li> However, this scrub is not for acneic skin, as there is carrageenan in it, which is highly acnegenic.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use other products in the Derma E line, but this is by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li> Use just a tiny bit with a warm very wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, a little lemony maybe.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts not irritating and your skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in my Ipsy bag a few months ago and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I normally break out with any face scrubs, but not with this.</li>
            <li> but I also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before.</li>
            <li> First discovered it at Whole Foods in their beauty/vitamin aisle where it was double the price!!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone just make sure and use in moderations otherwise you may destroy your skin.</li>
            <li> I use it at least once or twice a week but could use it more often during hot summer months.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you scrub your face long enough.</li>
            <li> I had no negative reactions to this.</li>
            <li> if used on dry skin, it is a bit more \\&quot;rough\\&quot;, but if you wet the skin first, it will be gentler on the face.</li>
            <li> The fine volcanic sand makes all the difference between it and other scrubs.  </li>
            <li> it left my skin clearer and smoother than most of the stuff I bought on Amazon to get rid of milia bumps and dry skin</li>
            <li> Really live the feeling if my skin after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this.</li>
            <li> so when I buy new products I&#x27;m always concerned about what my skins reaction will be.</li>
            <li> Your skin looks so fresh the next day and feels so soft .</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> br /&gt;you past 40, are softened and smoothed and your skin looks healthy and supple.  </li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this stuff when I got a facial done.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Sally because I have long-term kp and this product made my skin look different after trying it first night .</li>
            <li> After use, my skin feels amazingly soft!  </li>
            <li> I alternate between several different scrubs, and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> but I think when used properly its pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of Department store and spa only products and this one is just as effective, if not more so.</li>
            <li> Use caution with sensitive skin though, it&#x27;s pretty gritty!</li>
            <li> Fine particles and little to no scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first scrub I&#x27;ve found that exactly compares with the other product!</li>
            <li> What a quick way to gently remove dead surface cells and condition your face.  </li>
            <li> Believe me, I&#x27;m more than ashamed to admit I did use super expensive products -</li>
            <li> It has a faint lemon scent and leaves my skin super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> AS SUGGESTED ON THE CONTAINER, AND HAVE NOTICED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS.</li>
            <li> Just wait until you skin is clear to use this product as from my experience</li>
            <li> i just wash with this and my skin appears young and dewy...</li>
            <li> At the ripe old age of 36</li>
            <li> came across this product while shopping at a natural food store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look nearly my age</li>
            <li> just wanted to write an updated review now that I&#x27;ve used this product for nearly a year.</li>
            <li> + year old sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It washes off completely-</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s BB Cream - Luminous Finish&lt;br /&gt;evenings: bel essence all natural anti wrinkle cream</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 30 and have been struggling with cystic adult acne.</li>
            <li> No harsh grains, chemicals or drying.  </li>
            <li> Every time I use it my skin is baby soft.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin exfoliated and soft.</li>
            <li> pleased to report that this product performs quite well (at least as well as the competing product).</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after use.</li>
            <li> but that was only because I used too much.</li>
            <li> This scrub is made with natural ingredients</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> Works well for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Not tested on animals, contains no animal ingredients and is all natural.</li>
            <li> I have a bit too sensitive skin and my skin did not tolerate it.</li>
            <li> so far, thank you.</li>
            <li> It has moisture emollients which leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my skin feeling so so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so I bought the aluminum oxide crystals from IQ natural and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Bonus: the skin recovers as you sleep, so you look extra fresh the next morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite product for removing (greasy or thick) waterproof zinc oxide sunscreens.</li>
            <li> The perfect combination of an exfoliating scrub with added minerals in a cream base.</li>
            <li> Take it easy, as the sea salt crystals are pretty tough.</li>
            <li> It seems harsh at first but after a few days you will notice a glow and the new skin looks fab:)  </li>
            <li> the best I&#x27;ve found so far, the granules are the right size and it&#x27;s not filled with the bad, unpronounceable stuff.</li>
            <li> I am a dark skinned black girl that had a nice amount of discoloration on my face after years of acne.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, face feels very smooth and is shiny after use.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see any other product remove dead skin cells quite so effectively in one application.</li>
            <li> I use the scrub only once a month mainly because I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for 40 and older and leave the sugar scrubs for teenagers.</li>
            <li> this reminds me of pumice soaps used to clean hands, and is very different than other scrubs made with seeds, etc.</li>
            <li> St Ives apricot scrub back in high school.</li>
            <li> And make sure hands and face are wet makes it way less scratchy.</li>
            <li> Works great and you only need to use a small dab of it everyday!</li>
            <li> St. Ives and other popular scrubs have larger pieces that feel clumsy and don&#x27;t seem to really reach your pores.</li>
            <li> have normal skin, but being in my mid 50&#x27;s ~ I am grateful to have a product that can help bring the glow of youth</li>
            <li> It is pretty rough on your skin</li>
            <li> Actually, it feels so good that I have to be careful not to rub it over and over for too long, because then it does irritate a little.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since last year I changed all of my face products and this is one of my new ones.</li>
            <li> I am a certified aesthetician and this stuff really left my skin feeling brand new.</li>
            <li> very similar to dr brandt scrub and smells the same but much cheaper</li>
            <li> I did not receive a full jar of the product and feel it is unfair to charge full price for a fraction of the product.</li>
            <li> in fact, maybe more so because you do use this type of product so it can get a little flaky if you aren&#x27;t SUPER careful (which, sometimes, it just plain does regardless).</li>
            <li> Originally found this product in a discount store and bought solely because my usual brand of dermabrasion products could no longer be shipped into the US.  </li>
            <li> Fine texture and only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty intense, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It really helps clear my complexion and erase dark spots.</li>
            <li> Scrub gently and for at least a minute to really get the dirt/dead skin off of your face!</li>
            <li> It also looks clear, a definite plus!</li>
            <li> She too said she suffered with skin-detox pimples after switching to natural lines and said this product was the only thing that worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Makes acne scars barely visible.</li>
            <li> The texture is gentle and exfoliates without harmful rough products.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because i tried more expensive products that claimed to be good.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s also prone to break-outs and has a tendency to get dull quickly.  </li>
            <li> I recently began using only natural and organic products on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third container of this and don&#x27;t see myself using anything else in the near future.  </li>
            <li> I have replaced all my facial products with this brand as the old ones ran out and I will not be changing back again two thumbs way up!</li>
            <li> This one is far less expensive and does just as good of a job.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d pay $30 for this, but at $16 it was worth it.</li>
            <li> First of all, do not use this scrub everyday.  </li>
            <li> Not amazing but not bad either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real fan of Derma-E products and this one doesn&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li> But, that doesn&#x27;t mean this isn&#x27;t a good exfoiliator, it just means the dermis of the skin is thick and exfoiliating isn&#x27;t necessarily going to get rid of something I&#x27;ve suffered with for years.</li>
            <li> Im 37 with oily, sensitive skin but have dry patches too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s for everyone, especially if you have very sensitive skin, as this product basically scrapes the old dermis completely off.</li>
            <li> Well first of all, I still have about half the jar left so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a large jar, so you should use it sparingly, and you don&#x27;t need to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It is a small container, but you don&#x27;t need very much at all per scrubbing so it lasts for months.</li>
            <li> , 5 weeks later, my skin is completely clear, minus a couple of dark spots from the old break out, but those are fading now too!</li>
            <li> Fast, non-toxic, non-irritating and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The Derma E scrub sand is small so you can apply a little more pressure than other larger scrubs.  </li>
            <li> Some of my old acne pits are less obvious, now, too.</li>
            <li> I put half of the contents of the derma e microscrub in a sterile container and added the aluminum oxide crystals a little at at time until it was the right consistency.</li>
            <li> It is VERY grainy and usually while using, it can &#x27;hurt&#x27; somewhat....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again, but it won&#x27;t be for a while since it seems to be lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used one that I really liked, but it was very expensive</li>
            <li> A few weeks after my daughter was born, I stopped getting new breakouts</li>
            <li> I SAW THIS PRODUCT RECOMMENDED IN A HEALTH MAGAZINE AND TRIED IT SINCE I HAD NOT FOUND ANYTHING THAT WOULD HELP MY COMPLEXION FROM BEING OILY IN SOME PLACES AND DRY ENOUGH TO &#x27;SHED&#x27; IN OTHERS.  </li>
            <li> May be too harsh for those with very sensitive skin because it does feel like rubbing sand all over your face.  </li>
            <li> You use it just twice a week, on wet or dry skin, for approximately three minutes and your skin feels silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Still yet, don&#x27;t scrub too hard, your face is very delicate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a rotating cleansing brush with the scrub and it is not too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Too harsh granules on face wid sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Does the job without being overly aggressive and harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I will buy it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I no longer use any other product brands and am saving a lot of money while getting terrific results.</li>
            <li> Works great...better than any other  dermabrasion I&#x27;ve tried.....thoroughly cleans my facial pores.  </li>
            <li> I have been out of the scrub, and using other products for the last year.  </li>
            <li> Never again will I go so long without it!</li>
            <li> A tiny little bit goes quite a ways and, as I don&#x27;t scrub often, one jar of this will last me forever.  </li>
            <li> and she used this to remove the dry skin the acne cream caused</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels and looks after  using it and as soon as I pat my skin dry</li>
            <li> My skin produces a lot of combination dryness (oily surface level but actually dry)</li>
            <li> Like sanding off all the rough dead skin, except does not hurt and no down time.</li>
            <li> Almost all the red blotches and dark spots are gone.  </li>
            <li> Beauty is not worth the price if rabbits are going to be put in permanent head restraints that prevent them of any movements only be terrified and burned until they die.</li>
            <li> It can be slightly drying (depending on the weather) and skin can appear a tiny bit irritated immediately after use, but the moisturizer takes care of that.</li>
            <li> The texture of this product is slightly finer than a regular exfoliating gel/cream.</li>
            <li> but I do like this one and in the winter months when my skin is very dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a month, so I&#x27;m waiting to see the outcome in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Plant / coconut oil is ok but stearic acid from animal fat is bad .Theres</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I spent hundreds of dollars with an estatician with without noticable results.  </li>
            <li> Iagree that this scrub can be a somewhat rough</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like and smells like you&#x27;re rubbing crushed up Flintstones chewable vitamins on your face.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not really a cleanser.  </li>
            <li> so, just be careful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just got round to opening this.  </li>
            <li> It may get a bit red but it will go away after few minutes.</li>
            <li> I use a pea-sized amount, wet my fingers and cleanse away.</li>
            <li> be careful with the eyes thou.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s slowly helping to clear my scars.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had issues with acne, but when I stopped using harsh chemicals, my skin must&#x27;ve gone into detox mode, because for about 3 months my face was a pimple farm (especially on my cheeks and chin).</li>
            <li> Nice thick base like the Brasival of old.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with dark acne scars, dry patches, few cystic acne, and tiny skin color bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> and I got sick of paying top dollar for it.  </li>
            <li> I usually steer clear of heavy creams but this does the trick</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so the cost balances out.</li>
            <li> (Side note: a little goes a LONG way.)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As I often do tho , I started using all sorts of other products .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other exfoliater to compare it to</li>
            <li> One bottle last me 6 months of not more.</li>
            <li> other times a week:&lt;br /&gt;derma</li>
            <li> A small amount is all it takes to cover my entire face, too.  </li>
            <li> A homemade salt scrub would work the same if not better.</li>
            <li> Other scrubs feel so abrasive</li>
            <li> I use other Derma E products.  </li>
            <li> It puts other microdermabrasion scrubs to shame.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> After 6 months other people saw a noticeable difference and complimented me on my complexion.</li>
            <li> I really like this scrub because it actually works (without the dirty chemicals)</li>
            <li> how much active ingredients you get for the money and this brand won out again and again.  </li>
            <li> I found that using it dry on my face was not very good, so after I cleanse my face, I don&#x27;t dry off.</li>
            <li> some other ingrediants in it like Silica and Phenoxyethanol that sound like they could be bad too but haven&#x27;t looked them up yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only negative is the price for being over the counter.</li>
            <li> This scrub, with the help of washing/ moisturizing my skin with coconut oil and taking biotin, helps get rid of the rough skin, color bumps, and some of the uneven parts of my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please scroll down the product page for an ingredients list.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s like tiny particles of glass.  </li>
            <li> I use this every other day!</li>
            <li> I previously used a microdermabrasion scrub from MaryKay..</li>
            <li> Improves wrinkles and scars slightly.</li>
            <li> a month or less so the difference in my face whenever I use it is visible.</li>
            <li> I have used other products from high end cosmetic lines like Dior, Givenchy etc and prefer this product over all these other very expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about using a product with citrus oils in it</li>
            <li> It has TONS of little scrubbies and the grains are finer than with an apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> It makes my face tingle a little.  </li>
            <li> it says to use twice weekly, but in the winter when there&#x27;s little sun, I use it about 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for 2 oz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried another brand of microdermabrasion in the past but ended up sticking with this due to the price and lack of toxic chemicals.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but recommend you try it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like getting a professional microdermabrasion session but way less expensive.</li>
            <li> Skin doesn&#x27;t feel like its being pulled tight or dried out after use.</li>
            <li> I believe they can and have made some of my friends&#x27; pores larger and that they are very hard on the face.</li>
            <li> otherwise your face may burn like crazy and possibly get darker especially for people of color.</li>
            <li> Not to harsh.</li>
            <li> few tips...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few months ago because AVON disconntinued their Anew Microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> My skin was horribly broken out throughout my entire pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> Not too harsh to use once every day for me.</li>
            <li> It is a light cream, water-soluble base with the microcrystals in the cream.  </li>
            <li> I feel this product is too harsh for the face.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too harsh when your skin is not at</li>
            <li> Takes away all the dead skin and some of the bumps too.</li>
            <li> but it will thin out your facial layers</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference in my skin within a few days.</li>
            <li> I have bought this 3 times now and each one lasts a few months.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was significantly less than anywhere else!  </li>
            <li> I will order it from Amazon because sally is a little too pricy for me !</li>
            <li> plus I didn&#x27;t expect is the heavenly lemon scent - a little aroma therapy in the process!  </li>
            <li> But usually 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> Feels like a scrubber, have to use sparingly though because jar is small.</li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t be put off by the small size jar truly</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on a weekly basis for the past 6 months and am AMAZED at the difference I see.</li>
            <li> I like this product but not completely sure this is correct product for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about how well it works with wrinkles</li>
            <li> The granuale&#x27;s are small and don&#x27;t irritate my face when rubbing, but I can still feel it working.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it is getting rid of any wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for the past 4 months.</li>
            <li> My face used to peel after i applied tanning products if i didn&#x27;t exfoliate first and for some silly reason i never did!!</li>
            <li> The grains are large and fairly few, in a thick cream base.  </li>
            <li> The scrub can make you, initially, break out, but that is usually just your sking exfoliating and pushing out the dirty stuff from underneath.  </li>
            <li> Hard to justify to myself to keep paying that.</li>
            <li> I am in my late twenties</li>
            <li> Delicate on skin</li>
            <li> so I use it at least 3x a week.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find finer scrubbing like sand in other products.</li>
            <li> They are much less expensive buying them  through Amazon than going to the Deviate web site.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, try it-</li>
            <li> I like the way this product &#x27;wakes up&#x27; your skin.. not so abrasive that it is painful, but just enough to freshen up things..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked because now all my red marks and stuff from acne is GONE!</li>
            <li> Not good if you have fragrance sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> and that is not good.  </li>
            <li> It was devastating to say the least, but I did not want to turn back to those terrible chemicals; however, no other natural product seemed to help (including MyChelle acne</li>
            <li> This is disappointing after using other microdermabrasion products like iskin.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 2 years now.</li>
            <li> people have asked me my secret</li>
            <li> a very small amount does go along way!</li>
            <li> The results are dramatic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for a few years and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was left with terrible acne scars all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, non expensive.</li>
            <li> and the glass pump container makes it difficult to get all of the product out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the company gave me a fake one.</li>
            <li> Really uncomfortable to the point</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this company they seem to hit a home run for me again and again</li>
            <li> I am prone to breakouts and used this when I was broken out (bad decision).  </li>
            <li> There has been absolutely no change in my skin, I still have terrible scars.  </li>
            <li> I like that this does not contain any artificial dyes.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting crazy chemicals on your face.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;ve discontinued use!</li>
            <li> but I am going to have to pay shipping which is very expensive from Canada.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not be disappointed if you have acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> However, the quality of the product this time is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great facial scrub! Love it! Not to harsh.</li>
            <li> This works great, love the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is REALLY scrubby.  I mean, it&#x27;s like tiny particles of glass.  Very scratchy.  I enjoy using it though because I like the roughness.</li>
            <li> Good exfoliating properties. I have used many different microdermabrasion products.  I used one that I really liked, but it was very expensive and I got sick of paying top dollar for it.  This one is far less expensive and does just as good of a job.  I like Derma E products and was not disappointed by this one.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good home microdermabrasion kit since the one I used before is no longer available here in the US. I&#x27;m used to using a tool, so this took some getting used to (just using hands). I found that using it dry on my face was not very good, so after I cleanse my face, I don&#x27;t dry off. I apply the scrub with water still on my face and this works much better. I still have a little bit of flakiness after I use it for 3-4 minutes, but for the most part it works fairly well. I&#x27;ll continue using it for now, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll look for another product every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price on this scrub. I use it it a few times a week and really like it. I don&#x27;t know that my wrinkles have changed but I like the way my face feels afterwards. A little bit goes a long way. This is the second derma e product I have puchased. Very happy so far.</li>
            <li> Besides the yummy citrus scent, there is a LOT to love about this scrub. I have acne-prone skin and had been using a gritty walnut exfoliant that was damaging my skin (according to a derm and an aesthetician!). Gave this scrub a shot and what a difference! My skin looks smoother, brighter, and it feels amazing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked ... I&#x27;ve ordered a Derma e Sampler a while back and had a sample of the Microdermabrasion Scrub.  I was hooked after the first use and bought myself a jar.  I have aging, somewhat oily, acne prone skin and this stuff keeps my skin in check.  I use it once a week, very lightly and my skin immediately looks healthier and feels supersoft.  This scrub is comparable to higher end scrubs that cost 3 times as much or more.  The scent is very pleasant, too.  Other Derma e products to try are the Antioxidant Gel, also a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> I had initially used this product from the sample packs provided by my salon aesthetician. I had loved it then. Then I ordered the product from Amazon. And realised there is a big difference. The product in the sample packs was more granular which I wanted, while the one that I ordered was more creamy texture. I was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> The top #1 microdermabrasion product from TOP BEAUTY award ratings for a reason! Saves money on derm visits and youthifies skin. Like sanding off all the rough dead skin, except does not hurt and no down time. I use at night before bed because my skin stays red for a couple hours after using. Lol (User of product for approx 4 years only I forget to do it weekly.)</li>
            <li> Refined material with effective dermabrasion action. Less is more with this product.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product &#x27;wakes up&#x27; your skin.. not so abrasive that it is painful, but just enough to freshen up things.. I&#x27;m 50+  and recommend this DermaE products - they have a great line for skin care.</li>
            <li> I LOVE DermaE products and i think this one is my favorite!! Excellent product with fantastic ingredients! Makes a wonderful prep for any sunless tanning product! My face used to peel after i applied tanning products if i didn&#x27;t exfoliate first and for some silly reason i never did!! These soft yet mighty pearls do a real number on any peeling skin!! I use it all over my upper body and my skin has never ever looked this great!! I&#x27;m 57 and i really feel my skin looks very good!! Whenever i get any sort of scaling on my face i just wash with this and my skin appears young and dewy...i have lots of sun damage from years in the sun without sunscreen (ouch!) and this scrub is helping reverse it! Great price as well!!! Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy this,use it often and stock up when it&#x27;s on sale!! Top stars!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info :&lt;br /&gt;I am now 61 , almost 62 . I used this for years and my skin looked terrific . As I often do tho , I started using all sorts of other products . I&#x27;m back here today , buying this again for a much better price than it was when I first bought it 4 years ago here on Amazon .&lt;br /&gt;But this today at this low price ! It&#x27;s truly fabulous !&lt;br /&gt;I spent so much looking for something better . Why?&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea ! This is one of the best there is!&lt;br /&gt;Love it ;)</li>
            <li> A decent scrub, it nonetheless did nothing to minimize my acne scarring.  Am being patient and working on a second jar to see if I see progressive results.</li>
            <li> this reminds me of pumice soaps used to clean hands, and is very different than other scrubs made with seeds, etc. out there on the market. it does work great. if used on dry skin, it is a bit more \\&quot;rough\\&quot;, but if you wet the skin first, it will be gentler on the face. i use it twice a week-no miracles in the fine lines, etc., but it does leave your face soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real fan of Derma-E products and this one doesn&#x27;t let you down. Great for scrubbing away dead skin, mature skin &amp; helping the new skin cells come to the surface.No redness afterwards and lotions sink in better. This gets the complexion smooth and clean. Fast, non-toxic, non-irritating and a little goes a long way.  A must if you use tanning creams or retinoid skin products.  5 minutes is all you need for a better complexion. I&#x27;m on my second jar.</li>
            <li> It has a light sweet lemon scent, tiny beads, and it rinses clean. Very gentle, no breakouts even with my sensitive combo skin. Clears off dead cells and reveals a great new healthy layer. A little goes a long way so the cost balances out.</li>
            <li> Love the mild citrus fragrance (and I usually prefer fragrance-free products). I use this 2-3 times per week before bed, followed by derma e&#x27;s Pycnogenol moisturizing creme. The scrub really does the job, leaving my skin super-smooth and feeling refreshed. It can be slightly drying (depending on the weather) and skin can appear a tiny bit irritated immediately after use, but the moisturizer takes care of that. By morning, my skin looks fresh, healthy, almost glowing.</li>
            <li> I bought the scrub, moisteurizer and night cream and I&#x27;m amazed at what it has done for my skin.  If used according to instructions you will be too.&lt;br /&gt;People comment on the smoothness of my skin, I&#x27;m over 70, and the fine lines around the mouth area, eyes, well, you know where they land once&lt;br /&gt;you past 40, are softened and smoothed and your skin looks healthy and supple.  I started out with the scrub first and was pleased, then purchased the night cream and moisteurizer to compliment the scrub.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily and prone to breakouts. I usually steer clear of heavy creams but this does the trick</li>
            <li> This is great for 30 something skin not dry yet and not oily everywhere anymore.  I am prone to breakout with many moisturizers but so far this line has been good.  This scrub is good your skin feels good after a bit tingly but what do you expect. Better then most chemical dermabrasion that take off layers and layers of skin.  Dont think that is what nature intended. This does a good job of scrubbing off the dead dry skin and leaving you with fresh nice skin</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in my Ipsy bag a few months ago and fell in love. It is very gentle. I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t break me out at all. My skin look amazing after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips...Scrub gently and for at least a minute to really get the dirt/dead skin off of your face! And only use once or MAYBE twice a week!</li>
            <li> The best one I tried so far</li>
            <li> Who needs to get a microderm when you can use this stuff. Best face scrub around, and a little goes a long way! I love its light smell of lemon and how it doesn&#x27;t scratch up my sensitive skin. At the ripe old age of 36 I&#x27;m in need a good scrub to keep away the early lines of worry and distress caused by my children....and husband. This stuff really helps.</li>
            <li> When you consider the price of one spa visit, this cream is very affordable. Each time you use this product, you really only need a tiny amount to do an amazing job. The texture of this product is slightly finer than a regular exfoliating gel/cream. The results are dramatic. I have yet to see any other product remove dead skin cells quite so effectively in one application. To say the least, I was very impressed with this products performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Steam distilled water, aluminum oxide, silica, pumice, pearl powder, sunflower oil, cetearyl glucoside, glyceryl stearate, lime oil, lemon oil, orange oil, vegetable gylcerine, grapeseed oil, almond oil, caprylic acid, glycine, potassium sorbrate, jojoba oil, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, xanthan gum, tangerine oil, tocopherol, lecithin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Ingredient list may have changed - see comments section for update.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will you notice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improved skin texture&lt;br /&gt;Immediate improvement in skin appearance&lt;br /&gt;Diminished scars and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this state-of-the-art microdermabrasion scrub all over your body and this is a perfect scrub for awakening your skin and sloughing off dead skin cells. I&#x27;ve used many salt scrubs and while they have their unique purpose, this is a product that \\&quot;seriously\\&quot; removes dead skin cells that can clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also impressed by the following Derma E face and body creams:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree&lt;br /&gt;Astazanthin and Pycnogenol&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Day Creme&lt;br /&gt;Alpha Lipoderm Alpha Lipoic/Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product as a freebie with another purchase.  I found that it really brightened my skin and brought out a healthy glow.  I liked the sample so much I ordered a jar.  It isn&#x27;t a large jar, so you should use it sparingly, and you don&#x27;t need to use it everyday.  What a quick way to gently remove dead surface cells and condition your face.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I recently began using only natural and organic products on my skin. My skin is oily/combination. I&#x27;ve never really had issues with acne, but when I stopped using harsh chemicals, my skin must&#x27;ve gone into detox mode, because for about 3 months my face was a pimple farm (especially on my cheeks and chin). It was devastating to say the least, but I did not want to turn back to those terrible chemicals; however, no other natural product seemed to help (including MyChelle acne products).&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product while shopping at a natural food store. I&#x27;d heard good things about microdermabrasion, and the beauty attendant at the store (who had incredible skin) swore by it. She too said she suffered with skin-detox pimples after switching to natural lines and said this product was the only thing that worked.&lt;br /&gt;I found it cheaper at Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Well, 5 weeks later, my skin is completely clear, minus a couple of dark spots from the old break out, but those are fading now too! Also, my skin is smoother, softer, and vibrant looking. I actually had a waitress ask me how I got such a beautiful glow to my skin... that it looked so fresh and \\&quot;dewy\\&quot;.  :-D&lt;br /&gt;I tell all my friends about it now. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s for everyone, especially if you have very sensitive skin, as this product basically scrapes the old dermis completely off. Also, I would recommend doing it only at night, as it can cause temporary redness. Bonus: the skin recovers as you sleep, so you look extra fresh the next morning.</li>
            <li> I SAW THIS PRODUCT RECOMMENDED IN A HEALTH MAGAZINE AND TRIED IT SINCE I HAD NOT FOUND ANYTHING THAT WOULD HELP MY COMPLEXION FROM BEING OILY IN SOME PLACES AND DRY ENOUGH TO &#x27;SHED&#x27; IN OTHERS.  I USE IT TWICE A WEEK AS SUGGESTED ON THE CONTAINER, AND HAVE NOTICED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS.</li>
            <li> Love the way my face looks and feels after using the scrub.  It is VERY grainy and usually while using, it can &#x27;hurt&#x27; somewhat....I do it as gently as I can, but it&#x27;s powerful stuff....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really flaky skin on the tip of my nose. This is great for keeping that in check.  The scrub is very fine and smells like lemon pie.  I will definitely keep getting this product and will probably try some of their others as well.</li>
            <li> If you want to look younger, this is an awesome product.  I don&#x27;t look nearly my age and this has a lot to do with it.  Been using it for many years and so happy that I found it online at a greatly reduced price.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating products from the grocery store &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; almost as soon as I rub them on my skin with some water. This one does not and actually feels like it exfoliates, so it&#x27;s all I use now.</li>
            <li> Nice thick base like the Brasival of old. Much better than any of the runny drug store brands with one exception by booth</li>
            <li> Great product! My skin does not peel and get flaky when putting on my makeup when I use this brasion...</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. Im 37 with oily, sensitive skin but have dry patches too. I was a little worried about using a product with citrus oils in it but I have had no irritation at all. This product smooths my skins and balances it. The texture is made up of very very fine granules. You dont have to use very much. I use it on my face, neck and chest and it is wonderful. I have used a lot of Department store and spa only products and this one is just as effective, if not more so. I totally recommend this product for someone with skin like mine.</li>
            <li> UPDATE-7/16/11&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to write an updated review now that I&#x27;ve used this product for nearly a year. Well first of all, I still have about half the jar left so it lasts a long time. I use this scrub on average 2 times a week, sometimes more and sometimes I forget to do it all. But usually 2 times a week. Thinking back to how my skin looked this time last year, there is huge amount of improvement! I&#x27;m shocked because now all my red marks and stuff from acne is GONE! So basically this scrub really does work!! and I still recommend it highly!!&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample of this product and immediately wanted to buy it! Right after using it you can see a difference. it makes your skin smooth and glowing. I am using it because i have red marks left over from zits, which is why i started using the product. I have only used it a few times but i can already see a difference.  Also this is a great price, and i didnt have to pay shipping. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have used this product about 8 times, i am noticing a difference in my skin already. will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Really live the feeling if my skin after using this cleanser. Using twice a week and leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few months ago because AVON disconntinued their Anew Microdermabrasion. I was skeptical because i tried more expensive products that claimed to be good.  I was out $ and the end results were poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured i would give this a try for $20 and let me tell you it works really good.  It seems harsh at first but after a few days you will notice a glow and the new skin looks fab:)  DONT FORGET to put your sunblock on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my daughter has moderate to light acne and she used this to remove the dry skin the acne cream caused and she is really happy with results.  i&#x27;m upgrading my shipments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** Star Rating! Great Service  (auto delivery) , Great Price $20 !</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a week as a complement to derma e glycolic facial cleanser.  I use a rotating cleansing brush with the scrub and it is not too harsh for my sensitive skin. I love all the derma e products for their natural ingredients and their effectiveness in cleansing, toning or moisturizing my 60+ year old sensitive skin.  I no longer use any other product brands and am saving a lot of money while getting terrific results.</li>
            <li> I will buy again. A good product to help remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I have always had great skin, hardly ever any breakouts or blemishes.  When I was 28, I became pregnant with my first child and suddenly I was like a 13 year old going through puberty.  My skin was horribly broken out throughout my entire pregnancy.  A few weeks after my daughter was born, I stopped getting new breakouts but I was left with terrible acne scars all over my face.  I bought this product and used it twice a week for 4 or 5 months.  There has been absolutely no change in my skin, I still have terrible scars.  For me, this did not work at all.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product, but I think it works really well. You use it just twice a week, on wet or dry skin, for approximately three minutes and your skin feels silky and smooth. It also looks clear, a definite plus! The container is smaller than I thought it would&#x27;ve been, but you only need a dab, to lather it into your skin. I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a month, so I&#x27;m waiting to see the outcome in a couple of months. So far the results are looking good, so I would definitely recommend this for any skin type!</li>
            <li> The scrub worked well, but the scent is too perfumey for me.  Not good if you have fragrance sensitivities.  I am used to using a fragrance free glycolic cleanser.  Who needs to put fragrance on their face?!!  I don&#x27;t like it on my body either.</li>
            <li> Gives a really great scrub and doesn&#x27;t leave me irritated...doesn&#x27;t clean makeup off though so make sure to wash your face either before or after. May be too harsh for those with very sensitive skin because it does feel like rubbing sand all over your face.  Will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple weeks now and I am very pleased with the results.  My skin seems smoother and I like how it exfoliates.  Not too harsh to use once every day for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Derma e products for years.  The microdermabrasion is super; my skin is hardly young.</li>
            <li> Not amazing but not bad either. Its not for you if you have moderate acne this stuff is good to clean off and scrub skin</li>
            <li> I liked this scrub it left my skin clearer and smoother than most of the stuff I bought on Amazon to get rid of milia bumps and dry skin but I&#x27;m a lil freaked out about the ingredients in it. I was thinking that most of it was natural. But this scrub has Stearic Acid and Aluminum Oxide in it  like most non natural scrubs do - aluminum crystals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stearic acid causes cancer AT LOW LEVELS plus does damage to your nervous system, brain and can give you respiratory problems. They don&#x27;t say if the stearic acid comes from plant/coconut oil or animal fat. Because it doesn&#x27;t say &#x27;from plant/coconut oil&#x27; I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s probably from animal fat.  Plant / coconut oil is ok but stearic acid from animal fat is bad .Theres some other ingrediants in it like Silica and Phenoxyethanol that sound like they could be bad too but haven&#x27;t looked them up yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even though I liked the scrub because of what it did for my face I&#x27;m def not buying it again unless they give more info on the ingrediants. That&#x27;s why its getting 2 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best skin treatment I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire intelligent 20 years of life as a face wash power women.</li>
            <li> Very good product, exfoliating dead skin indeed and leave it a very young and bright after using it ! 5 * product</li>
            <li> I really love derma e because it is the first product line I have used that has helped me get rid of my acne, and I was contemplating accutane before I found this line. However, this scrub is not for acneic skin, as there is carrageenan in it, which is highly acnegenic. It is a wonderful polish, but it made me break out so I could not make it part of my regimen. I am 26 with break-out prone skin. I have been using a clarifying cleanser by another brand, the derma e Soothing Toner, Hydrating Serum, and Hydrating Mist, and all of these are very pure and non-irritating/non-acne-causing. I also just purchased the Very Clear Spot Treatment, and the ingredient list looks very promising and non-irritating as well. Read ingredients always if you struggle with acne!</li>
            <li> I spent hundreds of dollars with an estatician with without noticable results.  I have used this three times a week for 2 weeks and have the best skin I have had in years!  Almost all the red blotches and dark spots are gone.  I am 66 years old and have gotten several comments on how good my skin looks.  This product is worth it at twice the price!  I will no be without it.</li>
            <li> My favorite!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great and you only need to use a small dab of it everyday! I will continue to buy this product for my children and myself.</li>
            <li> I normally break out with any face scrubs, but not with this. Skin feels amazing after! Love all Derma E products.</li>
            <li> Feels like a scrubber, have to use sparingly though because jar is small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 months now and i&#x27;m so glad i found this product!  Even though I hit the big 40 I still have&#x27;t gotten out of puberty yet! This is the only product that has actually helped prevent break outs and dries up break outs that have already occurred.  Also gradually shrinks large pores and lessens fine lines!      Iagree that this scrub can be a somewhat rough but I just use a very light touch when scrubbing my face.  Also don&#x27;t be put off by the small size jar truly a very small amount does go along way! I use about a pea sized amount on my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like and smells like you&#x27;re rubbing crushed up Flintstones chewable vitamins on your face.</li>
            <li> This scrub keeps my skin clean and beautiful - I use it once a week and it makes my skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> We really like this. It has a wonderful natural lemon scent. Just watch that you don&#x27;t over-do it with the scrub. Take it easy, as the sea salt crystals are pretty tough.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this stuff when I got a facial done. The esthetician raved about it, so I thought I would give it a try. I love it! Fine texture and only a small amount is needed. I use it once to twice a week and it makes my skin glow and feel so clean. I use other products in the Derma E line, but this is by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I highly recommend it!! I don&#x27;t even need to get facials anymore to get a good exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I loved this scrub the first time I used it. Nice fine crystals to polish the skin and left my face feeling super smooth. The second time I used it, I had some sort of allergic reaction and my face got hot/red/itchy. Needless to say I&#x27;ve discontinued use! You may have a better result though.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it works well and we use once or twice a week for soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li> For those of you who aren&#x27;t familiar with derma-e, they make wonderful products that us all-natural ingredients.  Over the years I have found that the all-natural stuff works so much better on my skin overall.  This product works really well.  It is a light cream, water-soluble base with the microcrystals in the cream.  Easy to use and you don&#x27;t need a ton of it each time.  Washed off really easily with no residue.  Doesn&#x27;t lather and it&#x27;s not really a cleanser.  But it&#x27;s great for exfoliation.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for 2 weeks; it did improve the clarity and softness, but I found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well, seemed to have a sticky feel.  Since then, I found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called Microdermx by Nikkel Holistic Skincare. This product performs like magic; it is not too scratchy and I can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like I&#x27;ve been slapped with a wire brush.  I can do the treatment 2-3x&#x27;s a week, (like your supposed to) but I also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before. It is a magical product. &lt;br /&gt;Bette Hampton,  Chicago, IL</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it does.  I like the way my skin feels and looks after  using it and as soon as I pat my skin dry I apply derma ePeptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Creme and the difference is amazing.  I love the feel of my skin now.  The moisture lasts through out the day and when I go to do it again at night my skin is just as moist as it was that morning.  These are very nice products and I have made them my daily routine now.</li>
            <li> This Scrub really works well and is the best I&#x27;ve used ever to make your skin smooth! Love it and I will continue to buy this and also give to my sisters and girlfriends as gifts!</li>
            <li> Love this.  Scrubs your face well and leaves it smooth,  not too harsh also has a great smell.  Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other exfoliater to compare it to but I do like this one and in the winter months when my skin is very dry it does the trick and freshens up my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this scrub alot. Leaves your face feeling very soft, smooth.  I would buy this product again. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great scrub! I initially received a sample out of my Ipsy subscription. I loved it so much, that I purchased a full size on Amazon. It was very affordable via Amazon. I have not purchased again, as I found myself using the scrub excessively, as I liked it so much. May buy again once i gain some self control :-)</li>
            <li> Best scrub I have EVER...... And I&#x27;ve tried tons!!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel amazing and it stays that way for the days in between using it. I would recommend buying!</li>
            <li> My favorite microdermabrasion scrub. I use it in my shower once or twice a week. It is a lil pricy at first, however you do not need to use a lot of product. One bottle last me 6 months of not more. Def worth it!</li>
            <li> This is disappointing after using other microdermabrasion products like iskin.  The grains are large and fairly few, in a thick cream base.  wasn&#x27;t comfortable to use and my skin did not feel exfoliated after using.</li>
            <li> Love this exfoliator for my face!  First discovered it at Whole Foods in their beauty/vitamin aisle where it was double the price!!  So happy it&#x27;s for sale here on Amazon at a reasonable price.  My teenage daughter uses it too!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Sally because I have long-term kp and this product made my skin look different after trying it first night . I love it ! My kp almost gone and my skin feels softer. I will order it from Amazon because sally is a little too pricy for me !</li>
            <li> I previously used a microdermabrasion scrub from MaryKay.. super expensive stuff that I loved. I wanted to find a cheaper alternative! This derma e scrub is fantastic! It&#x27;s the first scrub I&#x27;ve found that exactly compares with the other product! It has a faint lemon scent and leaves my skin super soft and smooth! I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! It&#x27;s so much better than the apricot scrubs I used to use. It has TONS of little scrubbies and the grains are finer than with an apricot scrub. So it feels both more effective and gentler at the same time. It also has a wonderful pineapple scent. It washes off completely- no residue. This is it- the only scrub I will ever use again. I really like Derma e products.</li>
            <li> I love this. I use it 2 times a week. The mornings after I use it my skin is softer than a baby&#x27;s bum. Im not kidding either. Its super soft. I even make my friends touch it, if there are any around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since last year I changed all of my face products and this is one of my new ones. Ive gotten several compliments on my skin since then. I cant say if its just because of this product, since I have all new products, but its part of a winning team!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compliments I received were:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;your complexion looks great, your skin has really cleared up\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;you look younger\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;your skin looks great\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;you look rested\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;you are so talented.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;you are a great friend.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^not sure if all of those compliments are due to the Microderm scrub, but hey, the connection is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my products:&lt;br /&gt;neutrogena oil free daily face wash&lt;br /&gt;neutrogena oil eliminating toner&lt;br /&gt;mornings: derma e moisturizing gel (with vitamin A, oil-free)&lt;br /&gt;morning: Pond&#x27;s BB Cream - Luminous Finish&lt;br /&gt;evenings: bel essence all natural anti wrinkle cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 times a week:&lt;br /&gt;indian healing clay mask&lt;br /&gt;2 other times a week:&lt;br /&gt;derma e microdermabrasion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 30 and have been struggling with cystic adult acne. But with these products its all under control. :-)</li>
            <li> I will always use this one because it&#x27;s the best I ever use. I&#x27;ts not irritating and your skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I did not receive a full jar of the product and feel it is unfair to charge full price for a fraction of the product. Why did the company send me a jar unsealed with only a portion of the product ordered? Please send me another full jar of the product immediately to honor our agreement. I can send you the one back with only a fraction of the product but I am going to have to pay shipping which is very expensive from Canada. Please tell me how you are prepared to compensate or correct the issue.</li>
            <li> I have tried many. Expensive, non expensive. Name brands and so on. This scrub smells good, does not burn your face like some with peppermint in the ingredients. This is the best one as far as I an concerned.</li>
            <li> I like how this product doesn&#x27;t have much chemicals in it. It feels really refreshing but I like another brand better than this but this is still a good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use very often but helps smooth texture/exfoliate in a pinch</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample of this in my IPSY bag and loved it!  The price on Amazon was significantly less than anywhere else!  This is a fine microdermabrasion and it smells great.  I will repurchase this again in the future!</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  The granular of the product is extremely fine compared to other similarly priced products that claim to have fine crystals but end up being large and ineffective.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! Works just as good as a professional microdermabrasion session at a spa and for a fraction of the cost! I have been using this product on a weekly basis for the past 6 months and am AMAZED at the difference I see. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a microdermabrasion but don&#x27;t want to pay the spa cost!</li>
            <li> Best scrub I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to this product through a health store who was giving out small sample packets and immediately fell in love with it. I noticed a difference after just one use. I am now almost finished with my first bottle and already have ordered my replacement as well as extras to give as gifts. This is a wonderful product and worth the money. It has a nice fresh clean smell and leaves my skin feeling fresh and brighter looking. ABsolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This scrub leaves my face feeling so fresh!  It smells great, and I can actually feel it working.  It makes my face tingle a little.  I put the scrub all over my face and neck, and then I use my Sonic face brush to exfoliate my skin. My face feels wonderfully smooth and fresh afterward.  This scrub doesn&#x27;t cost too much either, which makes it even better!</li>
            <li> I really like this scrub for my brown combination skin!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months (1 or 2x a week) and it works really well to keep my hyperpigmentation at bay.  After use, my skin feels amazingly soft!  I also like the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d pay $30 for this, but at $16 it was worth it. It&#x27;s pretty intense, so a little goes a long way. If you are looking for a softer daily scrub, you might want to try using baking soda- it&#x27;s actually really great and super cheap and a mild alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub is more like the &#x27;big guns&#x27; of exfoliation- it says to use twice weekly, but in the winter when there&#x27;s little sun, I use it about 4 times a week. It really helps clear my complexion and erase dark spots. I feel like this is spa quality and I will probably use this instead of MD Formulations which is quite pricey.</li>
            <li> Smooths my skin, cleans my pours.</li>
            <li> Works great, really smooths my skin.</li>
            <li> For the price you cannot beat it.  It clears my complexion and makes my face smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> Love using this as part of my skin care regimen! I love all Derma a products I have tried. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Originally found this product in a discount store and bought solely because my usual brand of dermabrasion products could no longer be shipped into the US.  What a great find.  My first jar was plastic which made it more comforting to keep in the shower, this one is glass so, just be careful.  Excellent product that does what it&#x27;s meant to do and gently.  No harsh grains, chemicals or drying.  I get beautifully radiant skin day after day with compliments to boot !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already reviewed this--absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> My acupuncturist for my face uses this on his patients and work wonderfully! It makes your face smoother and tighter</li>
            <li> I used this scrub twice a week, and it abrades old, dead skin cells wonderfully without being too harsh or scratchy. My skin is left feeling so smooth and fresh.  A small amount is all it takes to cover my entire face, too.  A plus I didn&#x27;t expect is the heavenly lemon scent - a little aroma therapy in the process!  I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again, but it won&#x27;t be for a while since it seems to be lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for 2 oz but you only need a dab! This scrub has helped with my hormonal acne around my chin. I use this every other day! I recieve a deluxe sample from ipsy and have fallen in love with this scrub!</li>
            <li> Smells so yummy! Like lemon drops :)</li>
            <li> I like this product but not completely sure this is correct product for my skin.</li>
            <li> Devita products are great. Wish they were more than 1oz each and the glass pump container makes it difficult to get all of the product out. They are much less expensive buying them  through Amazon than going to the Deviate web site.  I also am really liking derma-e products. They are less money and good quality https://www.amazon.com/review/review-your-purchases/ref&#x3D;pe_6680_116681230_cm_add_2_star3?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asins&#x3D;B0000CCW1N%3A3%2CB000SAR2DK&amp;channel&#x3D;ec_phy&amp;crAuthToken&#x3D;gE5G%2BbF%2BtR%2F%2FDLIYTBMMZXn6AJjlFXJDtX902p0AAAADAAAAAFNfV%2BByYXcAAAAA&amp;customerId&#x3D;A1PANSXLPBGVNG#top.  Also a lot cheaper through Amazon!  Thanks Amazon for the great selection of merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;Andrea</li>
            <li> I feel this product is too harsh for the face.  Probably okay for other areas, like elbows or heels.  Very salty.</li>
            <li> Highly Effective and works better than drug store brands. I use this 2x a week and it really helps with the appearance.</li>
            <li> makes skin feel as though i got a real  microdermabrasion</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the one that my dermatologist recommended. I love the light citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;i have acne prone skin, and am getting a bit older. This provides a nice 3xs a week polishing to give a glow and clean out the pores.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much at all!</li>
            <li> I usually refuse to use microdermabrasion scrubs of any kind. I believe they can and have made some of my friends&#x27; pores larger and that they are very hard on the face. BUT - if you have very fine wrinkles around your lips - even with using Retin A (Tretinoin), you STILL need to slightly exfoliate this area - in fact, maybe more so because you do use this type of product so it can get a little flaky if you aren&#x27;t SUPER careful (which, sometimes, it just plain does regardless). Anyway - this particular microdermabrasion scrub is the least priced but the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Believe me, I&#x27;m more than ashamed to admit I did use super expensive products - I believe I&#x27;ve tried almost everything over the last 15-20 years (Obviously didn&#x27;t have my values together/so vain, ya think?!)! Use just a tiny bit with a warm very wet wash cloth. It is great. Okay, I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> My face looks great afther use it, it is wonderfull, it helps to reduce my pores and balance my oil skin face.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about how well it works with wrinkles but I love using this stuff after I shave, as it smooths and softens my skin so well.  There is definitely a sort of &#x27;glow&#x27; it brings after using it.  I believe it to be especially essential in the winter, as it seems to help the facial lotion absorb faster.  The smell is also nice and not overpowering.      I&#x27;m on my third container of this and don&#x27;t see myself using anything else in the near future.  (Side note: a little goes a LONG way.) I&#x27;ve tried another brand of microdermabrasion in the past but ended up sticking with this due to the price and lack of toxic chemicals.  (Just beware: wear some type of sun screen after using, as it makes your skin especially susceptible to the sunlight.)    And as always, you gotta love the subscribe and save option...</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months.  Every time I use it my skin is baby soft.  I can definitely tell a difference!</li>
            <li> I like it, helps to clean my skin</li>
            <li> Works great...better than any other  dermabrasion I&#x27;ve tried.....thoroughly cleans my facial pores.  A little pricey but recommend you try it...even once a week!</li>
            <li> Too harsh granules on face wid sensitive skin but if u cn take d harshness thn u will get a good cleaned face in d end&lt;br /&gt;Too pricy</li>
            <li> I bought this product several times and they both are good. However, the quality of the product this time is horrible. I don&#x27;t know if the company gave me a fake one. Can&#x27;t even use it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my primary cleanser on my very acne prone, sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve cleared up considerably, and my skin feels lovely and smooth.  Most days I use it alone, but sometimes I also use my spinning exfoliator brush.  Some of my old acne pits are less obvious, now, too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scrub. Makes my skin soft. I have oily skin and it  works wonders</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a faithful 7-day-scrub user for 30+ years and received a sample of this locally.  After trying the product, I felt this product was better than the one I&#x27;ve been using and switched without hesitation.  I would prefer this come in a tube form as I feel this will be wasted somewhat in a jar, but very happy with the product overall and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Derma E has some great products, this is one of them. Leaves the skin exfoliated and soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as a microdermabrasion scrub would do. It feels and works as a low quality scrub, that&#x27;s all. I didn&#x27;t like using it, I didn&#x27;t like how it feels after washing it off. A homemade salt scrub would work the same if not better.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar and it really is an excellent exfoliant. My skin glows after using it. It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I alternate between several different scrubs, and this one is my favorite.  I love the smell, a little lemony maybe.  The granuale&#x27;s are small and don&#x27;t irritate my face when rubbing, but I can still feel it working.  Actually, it feels so good that I have to be careful not to rub it over and over for too long, because then it does irritate a little.  I have acne prone skin (cystic acne) and this scrub does not seem to worsen that at all.  My face always feels super soft and firmer after using this and I like to think it looks brighter too.  I use this scrub about 1x a week.  I always apply a nice moisturizer after using it.  I have tried a coupe other Derma E products, one was the acne moisturizer, but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with them.  This one I will keep buying for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub, I use it twice a week and it smooths out all the dry skin and helps unclog pores! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was floored by how well this product worked. The immediate gratification was nice, but the lasting results have been even better! The grains are really fine so it&#x27;s gentle enough to use a few times a week. Seriously, try it- you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the feeling of my skin after using this product - I still feel like I have to rinse something off. And my cheap Japanese exfoliating cloth is better and more effective!</li>
            <li> I resisted products like this for a long time because I have skin that&#x27;s kind of sensitive. I recently tried a similar product from Dr. Brandt, though, after receiving it in a subscription box, and I ended up loving it. I got a good deal on this product and decided to compare my results to the Dr. Brandt product (since this is much less expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased to report that this product performs quite well (at least as well as the competing product). I use it about 3 times a week (suggested frequency is twice a week) while showering and I love the way my skin feels afterwards. It gets rid of stray visible bits of dry skin and makes the surface of my skin smooth (and not oily). I have not found it irritating although I would suggest only pressing lightly as you rub it in. It washes off easily without leaving residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please scroll down the product page for an ingredients list. I like that this does not contain any artificial dyes. I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell, maybe a hint of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of use, I am noticing that breakouts heal quickly and that redness is reduced, which is great. I never saw a need for a product like this until I tried one. Now I don&#x27;t think I will ever stop using them. My skin is looking better than ever.</li>
            <li> Do what the directions say and use only twice a week because this is a cleansing. I haven&#x27;t used many other products.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this. I received this originally in an ipsy bag and I have never stopped buying it since. Amazon seems to have the best price on it. This smells wonderful, and makes my face feel very nice, smooth and happy :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. I haven&#x27;t had the best luck with this brand in liking their facial cleansers and lotions but I read the reviews and decided to give this brand one last shot as I was looking for a nice Microdermabrasion Scrub. It smells wonderful like lemon and I feel like it is a nice treat when I put it on.  My skin feels soft after use. I am prone to breakouts and used this when I was broken out (bad decision).  Just wait until you skin is clear to use this product as from my experience it&#x27;s too harsh when your skin is not at it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite features of this scrub is the fine granule size. St. Ives and other popular scrubs have larger pieces that feel clumsy and don&#x27;t seem to really reach your pores. Derma e&#x27;s Microdermabrasion Scrub is much more effective.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it did what it said and made my skin feel refreshed and clean. would recommend to my family and friends.  I alrdy use the skinbiotics and antiseptic.  Love both of them as they do wonders for my family! Will definitely buy this product again.....</li>
            <li> Notice no change with my face with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Have been using the scrub for several years - I love the citrus-y smell and the natural ingredients.  My skin always feels great after I use it, too.  It&#x27;s my favorite product for removing (greasy or thick) waterproof zinc oxide sunscreens.</li>
            <li> The derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub is simply the best facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. I have been out of the scrub, and using other products for the last year.  My order arrived yesterday. I used the scrub last night and have been marveling at the difference in my skin after just one use. Never again will I go so long without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just got round to opening this.  My jar arrived unsealed and looked like it had been used.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet but the state of it kind of took the wind out of my sails.</li>
            <li> Perfect for light exfoliation. My face feels smooth and clean after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big microdermabrasion fan, starting with that St Ives apricot scrub back in high school. The last couple years I&#x27;ve been using Darphin&#x27;s microdermabrasion, which I really like the consistency of (in fact, it&#x27;s perfect), but it&#x27;s $80 for a small jar. Hard to justify to myself to keep paying that. So I found derma e&#x27;s product on Amazon, figured I&#x27;d try it. It definitely gives a good scrub, but the beads feel like tiny pieces of glass shards. Really uncomfortable to the point i thought I should review it to let others know. (i&#x27;m sure others have said a similar thing.) Again, I&#x27;m not a fan of gentle scrubs by any means, but this consistency doesn&#x27;t work either. So back to Darphin in the meantime until I find a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> I had a favorite scrub that was pretty pricey. I was hesitant to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;But so pleased with This product that I now have a new Favorite with Derma e Microdermabrasion scrub!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin, but being in my mid 50&#x27;s ~ I am grateful to have a product that can help bring the glow of youth&lt;br /&gt;and smoothness to my skin.This is the best combination of effective microdermabrasion and cream in a lovely and comfortable scrub ~ LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I run a beauty blog (Beautifile.com) and I originally tried this to review on there, but I&#x27;ve been buying it steadily ever since.  Mind you, this is not for the meek.  It is a very scrubby scrub (tons of scrubbing particles), but it leaves your face smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Been using for years, I am 69, and receive many compliments on my skin,</li>
            <li> I love the Derma E line of products.  The microdermabrasion scrub is a great exfoliant for the face and neck.  Does the job without being overly aggressive and harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  It leaves my skin feeling very clean and smooth and not over dried.  I also use several other Derma E products and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that makes my skin smooth and preps my skin nicely for makeup. Takes away all the dead skin and some of the bumps too. Improves wrinkles and scars slightly. I have been using this product forever.</li>
            <li> When I first used the scrub it burned my face very much but that was only because I used too much. All you need is a dime size amnt. And make sure hands and face are wet makes it way less scratchy. I am a dark skinned black girl that had a nice amount of discoloration on my face after years of acne. This product made my skin beautiful my bf asked me so many times are you wearing makeup im like no :-). I probably used this product abt 10 times now 2 times once a week. Now that my skin looks a lot better I use the scrub only once a month mainly because I have really sensitive skin. I recommend this product to anyone just make sure and use in moderations otherwise you may destroy your skin. P.S. wear sunscreen before going outside otherwise your face may burn like crazy and possibly get darker especially for people of color.</li>
            <li> First of all, do not use this scrub everyday.  Yes, it will make your facial complexion better and you face will feel smooth but it will thin out your facial layers and that is not good.  I use this scrub once or twice a week.  This scrub is made with natural ingredients so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting crazy chemicals on your face.  It smells great, isn&#x27;t overpowering, and after you wash it off your face smells and feels.  The sand is very fine, and I don&#x27;t feel like I am sand-blasting my face off.  Other scrubs feel so abrasive and I tend to be super gentle when using it but afterwards I don&#x27;t feel so \\&quot;exfoliated\\&quot;.  The Derma E scrub sand is small so you can apply a little more pressure than other larger scrubs.  Still yet, don&#x27;t scrub too hard, your face is very delicate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not be disappointed if you have acne prone skin and you start breaking out after you start using this.  The scrub can make you, initially, break out, but that is usually just your sking exfoliating and pushing out the dirty stuff from underneath.  When I use this scrub I always make sure to wash with facial soap after, then I use a toner and natural moisturizer.  I am in my late twenties and I really started noticing the fine lines and blemishes.  I really like this scrub because it actually works (without the dirty chemicals) and it is easy on my face (I have sensitive skin).  For a natural products, the price is very good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Exfoliates well.&lt;br /&gt;2. Natural and good for sensitive types.&lt;br /&gt;3. Delicate on skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. I honestly can&#x27;t think of any cons.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED THIS AT A GREAT PRICE AND IT IS JUST WHAT I WANTED; DOES A GREAT JOB OF EXFOILATING AND LEAVES MY SKIN SO SMOOTH; ALSO SMELLS SO NICE;</li>
            <li> Great product, but I have no idea when I should use it. I apply it on either acne breakout or acne scars. Makes acne scars barely visible.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works so well. The perfect combination of an exfoliating scrub with added minerals in a cream base. Gentle but highly effective! I use it at least once or twice a week but could use it more often during hot summer months. This scrub is excellent for very dry sensitive skin, like mine. I have used other products from high end cosmetic lines like Dior, Givenchy etc and prefer this product over all these other very expensive ones. Everybody skin reacts to products differently so I cannot talk about how this will react to your skin, personally, I adore this scrub. Great for the face and neck area.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. A tiny bit goes a long way. I use it morning and night. I can tell the difference in my skin within a few days. I get a lot of compliments on my skin all the time since i started using this.</li>
            <li> the best I&#x27;ve found so far, the granules are the right size and it&#x27;s not filled with the bad, unpronounceable stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Have used it as recommended since I got it and my face is so smooth and have seen a huge difference in my skin tone! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great for my skin twice a week.</li>
            <li> This is the best scrub I have ever used. It really does work. It&#x27;s very fine and thick and the results are visible right after your routine. Make sure that you scrub your face long enough. It may get a bit red but it will go away after few minutes. I also love that derma e is cruelty free and all their products are healthy.</li>
            <li> Love love !!!  The lemon smell is so tasty.. The grains are very fine and not abrasive... your skin will glow after and smell delicious.. I use it two to three times a week and can see a difference.</li>
            <li> This is a great scrub.  Fine particles and little to no scent.  Leaves your skin feeling great!  Definitely recommend for 40 and older and leave the sugar scrubs for teenagers.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, face feels very smooth and is shiny after use. Skin doesn&#x27;t feel like its being pulled tight or dried out after use. Will definelty get this again.</li>
            <li> Face feels great after using.  Not sure it is getting rid of any wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is the best scrub, microdermabrasion is an accurate description.  The texture is gentle and exfoliates without harmful rough products.  Be kind to you skin and it will be kind to you.  I use other Derma E products.  This is one of my favorites.  I have used it for several years.  I have great skin for my age.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  It works well on my sensitive skin, getting everything nice and smooth without any strange sensations or overpowering smells.</li>
            <li> I am a certified aesthetician and this stuff really left my skin feeling brand new. Out of all the microdermabrasion products I have used this one is my favorite, it&#x27;s obviously not going to be as effective as a microdermabrasion machine but I think when used properly its pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. It makes my face glow. I use it twice a week. This is a great brand and product. It is also cheaper on e-bay than at the heath store.</li>
            <li> Works well for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with skin care but cannot stomach someone else touching my face. Therefore I do everything to myself from chemical peels to clay masks. Up until last week the one thing I was missing was a great microderm scrub and now I found it. This super fine yet abrasive crystal scrub manages to sooth fine lines and leave the skin looking supple and glowing. No redness or blotchy side effect and my night creams absorbed into my skin super fast after and since I have used this.  Not tested on animals, contains no animal ingredients and is all natural. Demra E makes some of the best skin care products on the market, hands down.</li>
            <li> A good product and good ingredients. I have a bit too sensitive skin and my skin did not tolerate it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scrub!  The fine volcanic sand makes all the difference between it and other scrubs.  Leaves my skin silky smooth and polished.  This is the only scrub I will use from now on.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after using this. Not a bad scent either</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 2 years now. Maybe twice a week and every time I do, I get compliments on my complexion.....people have asked me my secret and I always tell them about this product. A little goes a long way. I use a pea-sized amount, wet my fingers and cleanse away. My skin comes out smooth as a baby.....glowing!  Have had no allergic reaction whatsoever......will continue to use....</li>
            <li> Just used it once, and already noticed that my lines are softer and diminished. Product advises to use twice a week, so I expect great results with continuous use. My skin also felt soft and smooth after use. Very happy so far, thank you.</li>
            <li> Looooove how it makes my face feel.  Doesn&#x27;t dry me out and leaves my face feeling clean and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> very good product. be careful with the eyes thou.</li>
            <li> feels good on the skin and its not too harsh. very similar to dr brandt scrub and smells the same but much cheaper</li>
            <li> The best product I ever used.</li>
            <li> I visibly see a difference and feel the difference with my skin&#x27;s texture.  Great product. Even though I&#x27;m not as consistent with the use, it still makes a huge difference .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s just like getting a professional microdermabrasion session but way less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best &amp;#34; at home&amp;#34; micro scrub, and costs a small percent of what I&#x27;ve paid at a spa!!  Once a week seems to be perfect, and i find that using minimal water makes the scrub more effective.</li>
            <li> amazing ivery had acne for 15 years and it had never left my face I have tried every cream every dermatologist nothing has ever worked I used this for only 2 days so far and more than 75% of my acne is gone !!!!! I also bougot the derma roller and it helped create pores on my face and now my sweat canot escape. I&#x27;m on day 3 today and I&#x27;m very very very happy and thankful :-*</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s also prone to break-outs and has a tendency to get dull quickly.  I have used this scrub religiously 2x/week for almost a year now.  It has never irritated my skin (beyond momentary redness afterward), and it definitely makes a difference!  My skin is much clearer with a smoother texture.  I only wish it would scrub away the hyperpigmentation from pregnancy!  I always buy this from Amazon because it&#x27;s the best price I&#x27;ve found.  I highly recommend trying it.  It is a small container, but you don&#x27;t need very much at all per scrubbing so it lasts for months.</li>
            <li> Awesome productâ€¦I also use it during the day.</li>
            <li> I had a sample packet and fell in love with this product immediately! The scrubbing particles are very fine, which is easier on the skin than other products I have tried. It has moisture emollients which leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is pretty rough on your skin so I don&#x27;t recommend using it more that once a week but it leaves my skin feeling so so soft.</li>
            <li> I have bought this 3 times now and each one lasts a few months. I love it. I always get comments about my skin on weeks that I use it.</li>
            <li> Like this derma e product the most. Unlike some of their other skincare lines may have overwhelming floral scent, or paste like texture. This scrub has the perfect balance, and works.</li>
            <li> This is the best over the counter microdermabrasion I&#x27;ve found thus far. It is very close to what you would experience at a clinic for about $350.00 per treatment. The crystal blend is just the right size. I use it without wetting my skin for the best abrasiveness. The only negative is the price for being over the counter. Depending on where you buy it, it can cost as much as 24.99.</li>
            <li> Skin feels so smooth after using this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for a few years and have never been disappointed. A tiny little bit goes quite a ways and, as I don&#x27;t scrub often, one jar of this will last me forever.  Washes clean easily and leaves my face looking bright and refreshed.  My girlfriend is also now using this after she tried it once.  I follow the scrub with a toner and rub in some collagen elastin; let that absorb a bit then follow up with moisturizer.  I use the scrub maybe once a month or less so the difference in my face whenever I use it is visible.</li>
            <li> This clears my skin up, it isn&#x27;t too harsh but super effective, smells good, and I love using it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It makes my skin feel really clean and it smells lovely!  This jar will last for a while.</li>
            <li> My gf won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Very textured. It&#x27;s pricey but I keep buying it so it must be worth it! It puts other microdermabrasion scrubs to shame. I&#x27;ve loved every derma e product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use this 2 to 3 times a week after cleansing and it does a great job keeping my skin smooth and ready for treatment products.  A little bit goes a long way!  Great value</li>
            <li> I use it with a DermaNew resurfacing tool. You can feel it working when using it and it&#x27;s slowly helping to clear my scars.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this product online when looking for something else.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a microdermabrasion product from LOREAL but they discontinued it and I&#x27;d not found any other product that was good. The price was reasonable so I decided to try it. The ingredients are all natural, and I was truly impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I actually am able to use it every day with no irritation... after I cleanse my face, I apply the product.  Immediately my face looks smooth and polished with a visible improvement in the fine lines that are around the eye area. I know this product my not work the same for everyone, but I&#x27;m happy with it. I even ordered one for my mom.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite derma-e product ever! I use all of their products and this is a star above the rest! Your skin is left feeling sooooo soft and clean afterward, really glowing. The results that you get from using this product should cost so much more, this is such a steal! Best product and I will buy it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> great price great product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years now. I love it. I have sensitive skin so I was concerned how a dermabrasion product would affect me. I do not get any redness when I use it but it is extremely effective.  My skin is smooth and I get a lot of compliments on my skin. I attribute much of that to this product. I also like the lemon he sent. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works better than any exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used. I really like that the crystals are very fine and not overly abrasive. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with extended redness from using it either. I use it in the shower in the evening, apply moisturizer after, and go to bed with no redness in the morning. I do this a couple times a week, and feel so fresh when I do.&lt;br /&gt;I have a big issue with milia around my chin, and this has not proved to be effective at helping to remove them. But, that doesn&#x27;t mean this isn&#x27;t a good exfoiliator, it just means the dermis of the skin is thick and exfoiliating isn&#x27;t necessarily going to get rid of something I&#x27;ve suffered with for years.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome way to get the dead skin off your face. It&#x27;s like rubbing fine, fine sand on your face. But after you wash it off your skin looks and feels great. I have been unable to find finer scrubbing like sand in other products. Highly recommend it. I bought this after trying a sample in the local health food store.</li>
            <li> Love this microdermabrasion scrub!!  My face looks and feels better than its looked in a long time.  Feels like a baby&#x27;s butt after using this product and the vitamins A anti-wrinkle creme.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with dark acne scars, dry patches, few cystic acne, and tiny skin color bumps on my face. This scrub, with the help of washing/ moisturizing my skin with coconut oil and taking biotin, helps get rid of the rough skin, color bumps, and some of the uneven parts of my face. It&#x27;s just smooth now.</li>
            <li> Great scrub! My skin feels smooth, and looks good. I appreciate Derma e NOT using plastic beads in their scrubs, which end up in the ocean FOREVER! I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer</li>
            <li> This scrub is awesome.  I noticed softer skin after the first use, and pores minimize with continual use.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> LOVE derma e product! and this microdermabrasion cream is the best of the best! use it twice a week between my every 6 month real microdermabrasion / peel .</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY scrubs over the years. When I could no longer find my favorite, I got a sample of this in the mail. This is SOOOOO good! It&#x27;s hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for the past 4 months. With 2-3 uses per week, this will last you a month or more. You don&#x27;t need much either. I also use a few more products from this company and it&#x27;s all amazing!</li>
            <li> Another great product from this brand that works well and is cost efficient.  I did quite a bit of research on face products and how much active ingredients you get for the money and this brand won out again and again.  You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this company they seem to hit a home run for me again and again I have replaced all my facial products with this brand as the old ones ran out and I will not be changing back again two thumbs way up!</li>
            <li> nice feel to the skin after use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product that delivers medical grade results. Easy to use. I have found other Derma e products to be shockingly effective. I am a person who spares no expense when it comes to skin care. This stuff is the best microdermabrasion ever.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I felt that I would need a more agressive abrasion scrub so I bought the aluminum oxide crystals from IQ natural and it works wonders. I put half of the contents of the derma e microscrub in a sterile container and added the aluminum oxide crystals a little at at time until it was the right consistency. My husband calls it the sand blaster and that works for me. I have acne scars and it really helps them. It&#x27;s not as instantaneous as an acid peel but it works. I use it twice a week and on the off days I use Origins High-Potency Night-A-Mins which has a very gentle peel effect at night. After 6 months other people saw a noticeable difference and complimented me on my complexion. I didn&#x27;t really notice until after a year but I am more discerning than others. I like this product because it&#x27;s cruelty free whereas Oil of olay is not. Beauty is not worth the price if rabbits are going to be put in permanent head restraints that prevent them of any movements only be terrified and burned until they die.</li>
            <li> Love this , great value. Your skin looks so fresh the next day and feels so soft .</li>
            <li> Love how it makes your face feel.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other face scrub I have used. Has a sweet fresh lemony scent. Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> no irritation seems to work</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my skin feel fantastic! I have acne prone skin so when I buy new products I&#x27;m always concerned about what my skins reaction will be. I had no negative reactions to this. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love this exfoliator! I used to work as an Esthetician and I love trying new products. This is a great non-toxic product and works great. The grain is fine and works best using little water. Use caution with sensitive skin though, it&#x27;s pretty gritty! My skin produces a lot of combination dryness (oily surface level but actually dry) so I use it at least 3x a week. I also use it for my whole body. Wish it came in a larger container!</li>
