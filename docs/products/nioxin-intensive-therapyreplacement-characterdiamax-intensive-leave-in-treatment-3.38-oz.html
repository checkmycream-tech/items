            <li>as described, received quickly</li>
            <li>so will have a more accurate review in the future.</li>
            <li>Great product for super thin, fine hair</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>My hair has better texture and seems to be not as flat.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very particular about it, and</li>
            <li>Smells so much of fragrance</li>
            <li>I really like the results and scent</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a difference in the thickness of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and all this did was weight it down and make it feel really gunky at the root by the end of the day.</li>

            <li>The product feels like you&#x27;re applying a mint based product to your scalp, it&#x27;s refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look to your hair as some products will to thin hair either.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my hair appear full and thick.</li>

            <li> seems to be working ...we will see in a month or 2</li>
            <li> Helps where the hair is thin on the brow</li>
            <li> Too soon tell but I think its starting to work.  My hair has better texture and seems to be not as flat.  Will continue to use and see what happens</li>
            <li> Smells so much of fragrance I could not use it and by the time I would ship it back at my expense was hardly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;They now offer one in CVS by pantene that is almost identical in packaging and ingredients but still had the perfume smell.&lt;br /&gt;If it works, I wouldn&#x27;t know but the texture and smell were a turn off.</li>
            <li> I was given a free full size bottle of this item on Facebook. I have thyroid issues that cause my hair to thin and fall out frequently, and I&#x27;ve had gastric bypass, which causes the same issues. I have very long hair, that is chemically lightened at a salon and I&#x27;m very particular about it, and I have to say, I was VERY impressed with this product! It gave almost instant results! Within a couple of uses I noticed a much fuller look to my hair and my hair wasn&#x27;t tangled, dry or dull looking. I really like the results and scent is nice also. The product feels like you&#x27;re applying a mint based product to your scalp, it&#x27;s refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look to your hair as some products will to thin hair either. I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s great!</li>

            <li> Makes hair look thicker. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and perfect product....Great way to do biz</li>
            <li> Works for me.  I also use the shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> Does nothing to improve my hair, at all!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference in the thickness of my hair.  It feels soft.  This was recommended by my dermatologist.  I am not seeing the results.</li>
            <li> Very good product will order again</li>
            <li> This purports to be the answer to thinning hair. I have fine hair and all this did was weight it down and make it feel really gunky at the root by the end of the day. I did not notice any &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; going on. Disappointing, especially since my hairdresser swears by it.</li>
            <li> awesome product for fine hair</li>
            <li> Best product yet for fine hair, makes it look much thicker.</li>
            <li> Really works! My hair looked much thicker with this product!!!! The only problem I&#x27;ve always had with Nioxin products, they do fade my hair color even though they may say for color treated hair! Still, a great product. Just don&#x27;t use it every day!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure at this point.  I started losing hair due to a prescription drug that I have to take.  I&#x27;ve been using Minoxidil along with the Nioxin.  My hair at the back of my head (the thinnest area) feels thicker but I&#x27;m unsure which product is working best.  Just quit the minoxidil so will have a more accurate review in the future.</li>
            <li> Not the best. Feel like I wasted my money</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product. My hair is oily and thin so most products weigh it down, but not this gel.</li>
            <li> I use this product whenever I wash my hair (with Nioxin shampoo &amp; conditioner) and stay at home especially at night.. I put a few drops in my hand rub it in comb through and blow dry. The next evening when I wash my hair I do my regular routine, such as Nioxin scalp treatment #4 and either the thickening spray or bodifying foam, blow dry, style and use Nioxin regular hair spray.</li>
            <li> Great product for super thin, fine hair</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. I saw no change at all. I love other Nioxin products, but this was a waste if my money.</li>
            <li> this product definitely makes your hair feel thick. However, it leaves your feel a little rough.</li>
