            <li>I was looking for a trimmer from Seiko because the Seiko cleancut shaver is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>There is no equivalent for this kind of product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice if you like electric shavers rather then</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling super clean and makes my skin flawless!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the performance as it trims excellent when compared to lower priced models.</li>

            <li>Ithis transaction went very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>i would recommend this product to all who wanted to feel care free!</li>
            <li>This trimmer did not nick me even once, even on the most challenging parts of skin.  </li>
            <li>- &amp; I&#x27;m happy to say it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Like any trimmer battery powered, make sure you use good fresh batteries to keep it from pulling hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I had a silver one that was a lot better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a bit more then a month now.</li>
            <li>I will have to go on looking for a really good trimmer that&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Even the most tender areas.</li>
            <li>Most didn&#x27;t serve the purpose, one broke immediately, another broke in a month or so.</li>
            <li>but I wish it moved the blades faster for a more blazing cut.</li>
            <li>But it works great especially on sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>The shape is awesome because you can get into all personal areas without having to be a contortionist.</li>
            <li>Good shaver for intimate areas.  </li>
            <li>This razor has also been noted on another site as being able to be easily used by those with &amp;#34;special needs,&amp;#34; as it is light &amp; easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer after reading a review somewhere else on how the Seiko S-Yard product line was very good in general, and that this item in particular is great because of the unusual shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do wish the blades were available for purchase, as they are easy to remove install, but you can&#x27;t buy them anywhere.</li>
            <li>There are no nicks or bumps, which is a huge relief.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems really cheap...</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to keep things tidy, not to get a fully shaved look, but this really didn&#x27;t work well at all.  </li>
            <li>Based solely on that fact, I purchased this shaver and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of pros; I love this product because it is quick and pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really cut hair well, pulls it out better.</li>
            <li>and I like it tremendously.  </li>
            <li>not to cheap but not expensive.</li>
            <li>I received my merchandise earlier than expected and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>It never nicks the skin and can be used in the most sensitive places</li>
            <li>Start with the area freshly washed (right out of the shower</li>
            <li>After one use I love this shaver more than the other one I have by Seiko.</li>
            <li>This razor has not always been rated as well in the past, when rated as a woman&#x27;s shaver, yet I noticed men seemed to be happy with it.</li>
            <li>(you have to because it only shaves really short hairs) and I am still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Big handle so very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t get the exact one here.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that initially, so I took off more than I had planned to and had to then give myself a closer shave all over to even things out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use lotion or electrolysis or any other kind of hair removal because I break out from those products.  </li>
            <li>-- this is NOT a wet/dry trimmer), make sure it&#x27;s dry, and dust the area with some kind of baby powder or other talcum-powder-like product to make the going smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>AA batteries last a decent amount of time, but the better/fresher the batteries, the better this Femini does.  </li>
            <li>The battery runs out quickly, it seems that the contact points (in the space for the battery) are not well adjusted, and it&#x27;s made of light, cheap plastic material, and I do not think it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>That said, it trims very close to the skin, so this is not a product to use if you&#x27;re trying to get a certain length of hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t use it because it \\&quot;pulls\\&quot; on the hair too much.  </li>
            <li>It does pull hair and does not cut very well.  </li>
            <li>It took awhile And was 90% effective after many tries and a few sessions.</li>
            <li>Much better than all those other cheapies out there.</li>
            <li>no advantage more than the other in the market, but be aware that it is good only for the SOFT hair not strong hair , so if your hair is strong and heavy ,you should use full shaver</li>
            <li>Would of been better off with a more expensive model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many different iterations via different brands of this sort of appliance.</li>
            <li>I have normal hair was attempting to use this on pubic</li>
            <li>I got the seiko personal shaver as gift for my wife, she had had a different brand before but has said the seiko is by far the better product.</li>
            <li>shaver though (it&#x27;s not a trimmer, like another customer review states) is just a normal shaver.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product, didn&#x27;t nick me or anything and gave options for how long or short you want the hair to be...but it died after only three uses!  </li>
            <li>this went into the trash, and I&#x27;m looking for something new.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I live without this thing.  </li>
            <li>After reading quite a few positive reviews for this, I was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted about ten years.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle &amp; quiet motor; that is probably why.</li>
            <li>Also, according to my friend and other reviewers, this product is a trimmer as opposed to a shaver, but I can attest to the fact that this particular shape does indeed give a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The Shavy Femini has a flat, toothbrush-like head, and is easy to maneuver in tight spots.  </li>
            <li>baggie for traveling and offers a close trim for personal body and&lt;br /&gt;facial hairs.  </li>
            <li>The hair grows back soft, so there isn&#x27;t any chafing, either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but just know that if you buy this shape, and you only want a trim, go slow or</li>
            <li>The only down part is that it uses batteries up so fast and&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a long time, changed the blades recently, using it daily</li>
            <li> needs replacement blades or at least one with initial purchase otherwise nice little razor for delicate areas..</li>
            <li> Seriously, buy it if you have ever had issues grooming the butt crack area ;)</li>
            <li> Long head.</li>
            <li> read lots of amazon reviews and everyone recommended the T-shaped one for men especially because it gets the harder to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it definitely does pull at longer hairs a little bit.</li>
            <li> one will not even cut a single hair on my arms as a test.  </li>
            <li> After less than a month, the blades seemed to stop moving quickly enough to cut hair, and rather grabbed and pulled it out, or did nothing at all, which had nothing to do with the battery.</li>
            <li> If you are worried about your hair growing back darker and quicker, my dermatologist states that that is not true.    </li>
            <li> This was used by a male - to shave that &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; area in the back area (how else can you say it delicately?)</li>
            <li> I have facial hair that I was using a razor for everyday.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes to do this in the morning</li>
            <li> Sharp blades.</li>
            <li> The japanese people have certainly got grooming and cutting figured out.  </li>
            <li> this was definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> Honestly not worth the money-</li>
            <li> the battery is not fresh - the trimmer does not run as efficient and&lt;br /&gt;catches</li>
            <li> I like the little trimmers - this little trimmer fits in the quart&lt;br /&gt;size</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> It pulls quite a bit and takes forever to even trim a small section.  </li>
            <li> Shaving always results in itchy stubble growing back and is very difficult to do on that uneven terrain down there.  </li>
            <li> but seriously this product is not very good.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t painful, but at times it was mildly uncomfortable and kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> Unlike other razors and shavers that make you think you might cut something off with one bad move.</li>
            <li> All of them have been - well - lousy.</li>
            <li> I changed out the batteries since the ones provided are useless.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find out that I paid 50 euro&#x27;s (shipping from UK to Europe included) for an average shaver.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed, find another product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really liked this product, didn&#x27;t nick me or anything and gave options for how long or short you want the hair to be...but it died after only three uses!  I changed the battery and did everything I could, just for $25 this was definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have facial hair that I was using a razor for everyday.  The Seiko lets you skip a day and does not hurt like a plastic razor does.    If you are worried about your hair growing back darker and quicker, my dermatologist states that that is not true.    I don&#x27;t use lotion or electrolysis or any other kind of hair removal because I break out from those products.  I do not break out with this product.      It only takes a few minutes to do this in the morning and you are done.    Good product.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t use it because it \\&quot;pulls\\&quot; on the hair too much.  Would of been better off with a more expensive model.</li>
            <li> After reading quite a few positive reviews for this, I was excited to try it out.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m not using it correctly or what, but it does not trim my hair at all.  It pulls quite a bit and takes forever to even trim a small section.  I tried moving in different directions and holding the shaver at different angles, but nothing seemed to help.  I finally gave up and went back to clippers.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item.  Doesn&#x27;t trim hair well at all and has a tendency to pull hair instead.  I probably should have returned it.  It&#x27;s sitting in a drawer and will eventually end up in the trash.</li>
            <li> I truly value reviews but I dont add my 2 cents often but seriously this product is not very good.  It does pull hair and does not cut very well.  It just doesnt!  I have normal hair was attempting to use this on pubic hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems really cheap...like dollar store cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money!</li>
            <li> Flimsily put together, it does the job, but not without occasionally yanking and pulling on hairs, rather than trimming them. I was looking for something to keep things tidy, not to get a fully shaved look, but this really didn&#x27;t work well at all.  After less than a month, the blades seemed to stop moving quickly enough to cut hair, and rather grabbed and pulled it out, or did nothing at all, which had nothing to do with the battery. Honestly not worth the money- this went into the trash, and I&#x27;m looking for something new.</li>
            <li> I got the seiko personal shaver as gift for my wife, she had had a different brand before but has said the seiko is by far the better product.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using Seiko Femini for years great product.</li>
            <li> no advantage more than the other in the market, but be aware that it is good only for the SOFT hair not strong hair , so if your hair is strong and heavy ,you should use full shaver</li>
            <li> Ithis transaction went very smoothly.  I received my merchandise earlier than expected and in excellent condition.  I would definitely transact business with this seller again.</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling super clean and makes my skin flawless! i would recommend this product to all who wanted to feel care free!</li>
            <li> Made in Japan by Seiko! There is no equivalent for this kind of product. Silent. Sharp blades. Long head. Cuts perfectly. Low price.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after reading a review somewhere else on how the Seiko S-Yard product line was very good in general, and that this item in particular is great because of the unusual shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a day now and I like it tremendously.  Please note that it is a TRIMMER, and not a SHAVER.  That said, it trims very close to the skin, so this is not a product to use if you&#x27;re trying to get a certain length of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the bikini area, female private parts, and the *ahem* \\&quot;rear door\\&quot; it&#x27;s perfect for me. Shaving always results in itchy stubble growing back and is very difficult to do on that uneven terrain down there.  The Shavy Femini has a flat, toothbrush-like head, and is easy to maneuver in tight spots.  This trimmer did not nick me even once, even on the most challenging parts of skin.  Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trim my pubic area for comfort rather than looks, and this trimmer is excellent for that.  Start with the area freshly washed (right out of the shower is good -- this is NOT a wet/dry trimmer), make sure it&#x27;s dry, and dust the area with some kind of baby powder or other talcum-powder-like product to make the going smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes one AA battery (included), but I would recommend using rechargeable NIMH or NiCd batteries such as those made by Duracell or Energizer, and not disposable batteries.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for intimate areas.  Does not knick or hurt.  AA batteries last a decent amount of time, but the better/fresher the batteries, the better this Femini does.  I do wish the blades were available for purchase, as they are easy to remove install, but you can&#x27;t buy them anywhere.</li>
            <li> This was used by a male - to shave that &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; area in the back area (how else can you say it delicately?) - &amp; I&#x27;m happy to say it worked very well. This razor has not always been rated as well in the past, when rated as a woman&#x27;s shaver, yet I noticed men seemed to be happy with it. This razor has also been noted on another site as being able to be easily used by those with &amp;#34;special needs,&amp;#34; as it is light &amp; easy to handle. It has a gentle &amp; quiet motor; that is probably why.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. My first one lasted about ten years. Like any trimmer battery powered, make sure you use good fresh batteries to keep it from pulling hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I had a silver one that was a lot better. This one pulls now and then.</li>
            <li> This is not a Seiko trimmer, nor shaver. The brand name is neither on the product, nor on the package it was wrapped in. I was very disappointed to find out that I paid 50 euro&#x27;s (shipping from UK to Europe included) for an average shaver. I was looking for a trimmer from Seiko because the Seiko cleancut shaver is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve had it for a long time, changed the blades recently, using it daily (you have to because it only shaves really short hairs) and I am still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver though (it&#x27;s not a trimmer, like another customer review states) is just a normal shaver. I&#x27;ve been using it for a bit more then a month now. The battery runs out quickly, it seems that the contact points (in the space for the battery) are not well adjusted, and it&#x27;s made of light, cheap plastic material, and I do not think it will last for a long time. I will have to go on looking for a really good trimmer that&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these before that worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one will not even cut a single hair on my arms as a test.  It will not cut ANY hair at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I live without this thing.  Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This product works well for any part of the male body. Even the most tender areas. I was surprised at the performance as it trims excellent when compared to lower priced models. The shape is great for use. Very light in weight, easy to use, safe, and efficient!</li>
            <li> needs replacement blades or at least one with initial purchase otherwise nice little razor for delicate areas.. That&#x27;s all I have.</li>
            <li> It hurt, even after all the prep work. I would bleed when I used it. It took awhile And was 90% effective after many tries and a few sessions.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really cut hair well, pulls it out better. Really disappointed, find another product. Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> The japanese people have certainly got grooming and cutting figured out.  I have a japanese set of nail trimmers and they are the nicest things you&#x27;ve ever used.  Based solely on that fact, I purchased this shaver and it is fantastic.  However, I didn&#x27;t get the exact one here.  I have the same brand but the T-shaped one seen here.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141DEAC/ref&#x3D;as_li_ss_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00141DEAC&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;stupisms-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read lots of amazon reviews and everyone recommended the T-shaped one for men especially because it gets the harder to reach areas.  It never nicks the skin and can be used in the most sensitive places *ahem*.  Unlike other razors and shavers that make you think you might cut something off with one bad move.</li>
            <li> I like the little trimmers - this little trimmer fits in the quart&lt;br /&gt;size baggie for traveling and offers a close trim for personal body and&lt;br /&gt;facial hairs.  The only down part is that it uses batteries up so fast and&lt;br /&gt;if the battery is not fresh - the trimmer does not run as efficient and&lt;br /&gt;catches on hairs from time to time.  If you take your time and go with the&lt;br /&gt;flow of the hair it cuts beautifully.  I have several for home and travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice if you like electric shavers rather then the blade-kind.  I like it because&lt;br /&gt;it is easy and does not cut the skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many different iterations via different brands of this sort of appliance. All of them have been - well - lousy. Most didn&#x27;t serve the purpose, one broke immediately, another broke in a month or so. This one works, doesn&#x27;t seem to threaten me with breakage - hurrah! Only downside: no cover over the teeth, so travel requires putting it into another covering item.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t even last a year.  I think it may be a defect where the battery goes in the handle.  I have to keep pulling out the metal contact so there is contact, but it no longer does the trick.</li>
            <li> not to cheap but not expensive. Works great but I wish it moved the blades faster for a more blazing cut. But it works great especially on sensitive areas.  Much better than all those other cheapies out there. Big handle so very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I tried using it but it wouldn&#x27;t work. I changed out the batteries since the ones provided are useless. I tried to use it as described on the website and it didn&#x27;t work as advertised. I contacted the company and mailed back the product as asked to switch it out, but never received a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;So two issues, 1) doesn&#x27;t work as advertised; 2) was not replaced as was told. Lost money and packaging cost. Good luck to you if you do buy it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price! After one use I love this shaver more than the other one I have by Seiko. Seriously, buy it if you have ever had issues grooming the butt crack area ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my friend recommended it to me. There are a lot of pros; I love this product because it is quick and pretty easy to use. The shape is awesome because you can get into all personal areas without having to be a contortionist. There are no nicks or bumps, which is a huge relief. The hair grows back soft, so there isn&#x27;t any chafing, either. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it definitely does pull at longer hairs a little bit. It isn&#x27;t painful, but at times it was mildly uncomfortable and kind of annoying. I would recommend using baby powder for a gentler glide. Also, according to my friend and other reviewers, this product is a trimmer as opposed to a shaver, but I can attest to the fact that this particular shape does indeed give a very close shave. I didn&#x27;t expect that initially, so I took off more than I had planned to and had to then give myself a closer shave all over to even things out. It&#x27;s fine, but just know that if you buy this shape, and you only want a trim, go slow or you will end up with a shorter style than you wanted.</li>
