            <li>Best blush ever.</li>
            <li>I use it as blush and it is perfect...  </li>
            <li>and it is the PERFECT shade for fair skin...</li>
            <li>: It looks best on fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great anytime</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s one of the quickest pick-me-ups I have, great for those mornings when you look in the mirror and wonder how the heck the bride of Frankenstein got into your bathroom.</li>
            <li>I am mediteranean and a medium and it looks great on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Benefit is a good quality line.  </li>
            <li>Checking the seller feedback might help in choosing a good seller.  </li>
            <li>I too have fair skin</li>
            <li>Perfect shade, light but buildable.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it smells so good too.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this powder!  </li>
            <li>Goes with any kind of look.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li>I have very fair oily skin with sallow undertones and this helps even it out and give me a nice, pretty flush.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, flawless pink skin -</li>
            <li>Beautiful color and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>great, just perfect, not too pink or red.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>the powder&#x27;s color is not as bright as it shows in the store, and the powder is not as fine as the one I used to buy.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect, subtle, touch of radiance that looks like your own!!!</li>
            <li>Plus it has a mild scent that&#x27;s divine!!  </li>
            <li>This blush is very light and flattering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ideal for fair, pink people.  </li>
            <li>I realized however, that it worked better as a highlighter.</li>
            <li>This Benefit Dandelion blush was a winner last year, in all the comparison reviews, and it looked great on Nicole Kidman with her fair complexion.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a more pigmented powder/blush, then I don&#x27;t think this is for you.</li>
            <li>but i love this on days</li>
            <li>All my friends are using it now too:)</li>
            <li>I love blush but can never use it because my skin tends to get flush a lot</li>
            <li>and so it is OK for me</li>
            <li>I have light skin, not ivory but not tan!</li>
            <li>ANd love the Benefit cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I am fair-skinned but I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the packaging of this blush.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a good choice for the girl as one of her first cosmetics.</li>
            <li>The color barely shows up &amp; I have fair skin!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it for blush alone because it is so light you&#x27;d have to whack on a healthy amount for it to be noticeable.</li>
            <li>And it has a light scent that is perfectly lovely.  </li>
            <li>Perfect pink</li>
            <li>Easy application with the brush and tray inside.</li>
            <li>I have a really light complexion and I apply it over the top of a light gel tinted blush (Pixie from Target)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to over do it though so go easy.</li>
            <li>to say, it&#x27;s a good product to make you look young and healthy.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using any product from Benefit, but it won&#x27;t be my last - this is really great!  </li>
            <li>received a sample of this product and loved it so much purchased the full size.&lt;br /&gt;smells</li>
            <li>when i&#x27;m in a rush cause i can apply it quickly without looking in the mirror and know that it will still look cute and not overdone.</li>
            <li>For me, this is the perfect everyday blush color.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that some people claimed that they didn&#x27;t receive the genuine product.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my cheeks and just lightly on the rest of my face for a \\&quot;awakened\\</li>
            <li>Also looks really nice under the eyes, it&#x27;s just a soft light, softens everything, like being in candle light!</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a sparkle, but not too much, it is light catching and a color that is very complementing to the skin.</li>
            <li>I also love the brush, which deposits just the right amount of powder.  </li>
            <li>just gives you a very naturally good complexion, and in such a small box,it contains a mirror and an excellent brush which makes it so portable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is my 4th purchase in over 5 years, so you can see that you get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>There is also a significant amount of product in this box.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a nice little brush that works well with the packaging, as well as doing a good job of applying this blusher.  </li>
            <li>Awesome to use in the place of foundation if you want a little color, but a clean fresh faced look.</li>
            <li>It gives more of a natural looking healthy glow than anything.  </li>
            <li>She was so right!</li>
            <li>Get a nice natural color on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>but the color is so light and just makes your skin look fresh and awake.  </li>
            <li>It softens the face kind of like when you switch from florescent lighting to soft bulb lighting.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the other Benefit blush products, but this works great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Subtle but awesome.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite light and natural looking blush and has been for 10 years.</li>
            <li>A quick application</li>
            <li>Benefit dandelion is the perfect light pink for many skin tones and adds just a slight flush of color and shimmer to your skin.</li>
            <li>and it looks very natural with my very light complexion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, I have a fair complexion &amp; tend to look pale somewhat but by using it, my face looks refreshed &amp; glowing without being too much.</li>
            <li>far as this blush goes, I highly recommend it for fair skin.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a fresh, new brush each time.  </li>
            <li>It really nicely extenuates/highlights my face (especially the T zone).</li>
            <li>It makes it look fresh.</li>
            <li>The price isn&#x27;t even worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light pink color that can be used to highlight and give you a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light powder with a nice, wide brush.  </li>
            <li>It is seriously the perfect blush for people who really can&#x27;t wear blush but want to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient and saves time to have the brush right there in box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like clean looking make-up</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fade much and the color stays true all day, which can be a problem for me because I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>But it lasts a long time and is really effective in giving your face a bit of color besides just using blush.</li>
            <li>I first tried this face highlighter in Sephora, the lady there tried it on for me &amp; said it would brighten my face &amp; give it a glow.</li>
            <li>I love it enough to bother writing about it!</li>
            <li>I have had this product (the same) for many years purchased at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re still on the fence, go to Sephora and sample it first.</li>
            <li>It adds a realistic flush to my cheeks that is fresh and youthful.  </li>
            <li>When done right, it&#x27;s got a really nice flushed look, a little cutesy.</li>
            <li>, the price (although, again, a little goes a long way) and the brush (although to be fair, including a decent face brush would make it bulky and even more</li>
            <li>but on the flip side it&#x27;s probably good that it&#x27;s hard paperboard</li>
            <li>The color is more peach than pink.</li>
            <li>And it is really unreliable.</li>
            <li>I really like Benefit products.  </li>
            <li>but, you really can&#x27;t even tell that it is on.</li>
            <li>really?</li>
            <li>so it is not too intense for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like Benefit blush.  </li>
            <li>This color works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to whether this seller is offering the real thing or not.</li>
            <li>Very flattering, easy, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Once I ordered some benefit foundation that had a strong, strange smell that never went away.</li>
            <li>Perhaps they could go back to the original size and leave out the brush.</li>
            <li>As a mature woman, that&#x27;s exactly the look</li>
            <li>fast, packaged well and new unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>Although I am fair-ish, I can see others benefitting from this light pink colour.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping for a genuine benefit product, however, the packaging was not real.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft, light to medium pink color.  </li>
            <li>It even has a nice subtle scent to it.  </li>
            <li>This is a true pink without any peachy undertones.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone is pretty light, so when I applied the blush (to my surprise) it was actually hard to notice it on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and love the slight glow it gives.  </li>
            <li>I look naturally flushed, maybe as if I just came in from the sun, without a potential burn, or real exertion.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it was old product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural it doesn&#x27;t make you feel at all</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s environmentally conscious -</li>
            <li>I got this as a soft highlighter, they label this as a face powder, not a blush, coralista for example is labeled as a blush, I see from some reviews that some may not realize this.</li>
            <li>This is a natural blush and this can be worn with any coloring or complexion.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about it, you can always get the real thing from Sephora online for about the same price.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product (the real thing that is).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty natural girl and this makes me look alive and somewhat awake without looking like a drag queen.</li>
            <li>It has buildable tint that gives a subtle healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s long lasting as a blush and when used as a finishing powder, it makes my face look a little more natural (as natural as it can be with makeup on).</li>
            <li>I have a very light peachy/orange one (that&#x27;s sadly been discontinued) that I got years ago (and still have) that I really like</li>
            <li>It looks pretty and brightens the complexion but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>It probably wouldn&#x27;t be dark enough for someone who is very tan or has darker skin.</li>
            <li>If I had anything negative to say I wish the box was a little more durable</li>
            <li>I use this as an all over powder if I want a bit of a flush, and because it is so light, then I can add as much as I want, and I wont look crazy.  </li>

            <li> A quick application</li>
            <li> Benefit dandelion is the perfect light pink for many skin tones and adds just a slight flush of color and shimmer to your skin.</li>
            <li> and it looks very natural with my very light complexion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, I have a fair complexion &amp; tend to look pale somewhat but by using it, my face looks refreshed &amp; glowing without being too much.</li>
            <li> far as this blush goes, I highly recommend it for fair skin.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a fresh, new brush each time.  </li>
            <li> It really nicely extenuates/highlights my face (especially the T zone).</li>
            <li> It makes it look fresh.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t even worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light pink color that can be used to highlight and give you a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light powder with a nice, wide brush.  </li>
            <li> It is seriously the perfect blush for people who really can&#x27;t wear blush but want to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient and saves time to have the brush right there in box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like clean looking make-up</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fade much and the color stays true all day, which can be a problem for me because I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> But it lasts a long time and is really effective in giving your face a bit of color besides just using blush.</li>
            <li> I first tried this face highlighter in Sephora, the lady there tried it on for me &amp; said it would brighten my face &amp; give it a glow.</li>
            <li> I love it enough to bother writing about it!</li>
            <li> I have had this product (the same) for many years purchased at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re still on the fence, go to Sephora and sample it first.</li>
            <li> It adds a realistic flush to my cheeks that is fresh and youthful.  </li>
            <li> When done right, it&#x27;s got a really nice flushed look, a little cutesy.</li>
            <li> , the price (although, again, a little goes a long way) and the brush (although to be fair, including a decent face brush would make it bulky and even more</li>
            <li> but on the flip side it&#x27;s probably good that it&#x27;s hard paperboard</li>
            <li> The color is more peach than pink.</li>
            <li> And it is really unreliable.</li>
            <li> I really like Benefit products.  </li>
            <li> but, you really can&#x27;t even tell that it is on.</li>
            <li> really?</li>
            <li> so it is not too intense for me.  </li>
            <li> I really like Benefit blush.  </li>
            <li> This color works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to whether this seller is offering the real thing or not.</li>
            <li> Very flattering, easy, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Once I ordered some benefit foundation that had a strong, strange smell that never went away.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they could go back to the original size and leave out the brush.</li>
            <li> As a mature woman, that&#x27;s exactly the look</li>
            <li> fast, packaged well and new unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> Although I am fair-ish, I can see others benefitting from this light pink colour.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping for a genuine benefit product, however, the packaging was not real.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft, light to medium pink color.  </li>
            <li> It even has a nice subtle scent to it.  </li>
            <li> This is a true pink without any peachy undertones.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone is pretty light, so when I applied the blush (to my surprise) it was actually hard to notice it on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and love the slight glow it gives.  </li>
            <li> I look naturally flushed, maybe as if I just came in from the sun, without a potential burn, or real exertion.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it was old product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so natural it doesn&#x27;t make you feel at all</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s environmentally conscious -</li>
            <li> I got this as a soft highlighter, they label this as a face powder, not a blush, coralista for example is labeled as a blush, I see from some reviews that some may not realize this.</li>
            <li> This is a natural blush and this can be worn with any coloring or complexion.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about it, you can always get the real thing from Sephora online for about the same price.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product (the real thing that is).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty natural girl and this makes me look alive and somewhat awake without looking like a drag queen.</li>
            <li> It has buildable tint that gives a subtle healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s long lasting as a blush and when used as a finishing powder, it makes my face look a little more natural (as natural as it can be with makeup on).</li>
            <li> I have a very light peachy/orange one (that&#x27;s sadly been discontinued) that I got years ago (and still have) that I really like</li>
            <li> It looks pretty and brightens the complexion but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It probably wouldn&#x27;t be dark enough for someone who is very tan or has darker skin.</li>
            <li> If I had anything negative to say I wish the box was a little more durable</li>
            <li> I use this as an all over powder if I want a bit of a flush, and because it is so light, then I can add as much as I want, and I wont look crazy.  </li>
            <li> A box will last me a year of everyday use, all over my face, but I use it right down to the dust.</li>
            <li> The most recent purchase was disappointing because the product is now 30% smaller.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a universal color and therefore would work equally well on yellow or pink undertones.  </li>
            <li> I am light, but not fair, with neutral undertones, hazel eyes and dark blond hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and subtle for day but can be layered on for a more dramatic look if you desire.  </li>
            <li> Feels soft and luxurious rather than heavy or cakey.</li>
            <li> , I feel I wasted $21.79.When ordering the same product it should be the same.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Dandelions\\&quot; aren&#x27;t PINK, but</li>
            <li> It gives me a kiss of color without being too pink.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost empty but not quite.</li>
            <li> The blush was not real benefit blush and it fell out after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> and once I&#x27;ve used it up (a few years from now) I will definitely purchase another one.  </li>
            <li> In the past, it was often difficult for me to find a blush color that wasn&#x27;t overpowering, too light, or orangy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It blends well with my other face makeup.  </li>
            <li> This is at least my second box of this blush.  </li>
            <li> My only complaints are the clumsy packaging (a box?</li>
            <li> This color is a very pale pink in the box but is a brighter pink once on the cheek.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get trashed around in my makeup bag and look slightly worn towards its life end,</li>
            <li> This color would work on any skin tone except very dark ones, because it wouldn&#x27;t show up at all.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one is nearly clear on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I use quite a few of them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dandelion for the past 8 years and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other blush!</li>
            <li> It is a brightener that is impossible to over-use; it gives a very natural look to the face and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to over do it.</li>
            <li> Benefit&#x27;s Dandelion is a subtle all-over face color.  </li>
            <li> Price is less expensive on Amazon also.</li>
            <li> I purchased Benefit Dandelion (much less expensive).</li>
            <li> Although the packaging and brush were different than what I have seen from the Benefit store, the worst thing was that there was an extremely unfortunate spelling error (a racial slur) on the back of the package.</li>
            <li> It is so obvious, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Anyone over 30 understands what I mean by that!!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be purchasing my Benefit products from beautyhaus again.</li>
            <li> Product is fake.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel so bad when I finish it and throw it away.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cosmetic before but was quite shocked at how pricey it is now.  </li>
            <li> Never buy this unless you want a fake one!!!</li>
            <li> It looks really fake!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite light and natural looking blush and has been for 10 years. Easy application with the brush and tray inside. I always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> the powder&#x27;s color is not as bright as it shows in the store, and the powder is not as fine as the one I used to buy. Suggest to buy things from stores instead of online.</li>
            <li> Benefit&#x27;s Dandelion is a subtle all-over face color.  It&#x27;s ideal for fair, pink people.  It is a perfect, subtle, touch of radiance that looks like your own!!!</li>
            <li> The color is more peach than pink. It looks pretty and brightens the complexion but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good choice for the girl as one of her first cosmetics. It doesn&#x27;t care about the place you use on your face. It is helpful for your complexion.</li>
            <li> I just received this product. My skin tone is pretty light, so when I applied the blush (to my surprise) it was actually hard to notice it on my cheeks. I realized however, that it worked better as a highlighter. I have to admit I do like this as a highlighter, therefore I gave this products 5 stars. It really nicely extenuates/highlights my face (especially the T zone). It makes it look fresh. Sooooo... yes, get this product, but don&#x27;t be surprise if its not going to work for you as a blush, but rather as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> For me, this is the perfect everyday blush color.  It&#x27;s a soft, light to medium pink color.  In the past, it was often difficult for me to find a blush color that wasn&#x27;t overpowering, too light, or orangy.  This is at least my second box of this blush.  I love that it comes with a fresh, new brush each time.  It&#x27;s so convenient and saves time to have the brush right there in box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefit is a good quality line.  I noticed that some people claimed that they didn&#x27;t receive the genuine product.  Checking the seller feedback might help in choosing a good seller.  Once I ordered some benefit foundation that had a strong, strange smell that never went away. Perhaps it was old product.  I don&#x27;t recall the seller offhand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this blush goes, I highly recommend it for fair skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years, every day. Part of my make-up routine.</li>
            <li> This Benefit Dandelion blush was a winner last year, in all the comparison reviews, and it looked great on Nicole Kidman with her fair complexion.  I too have fair skin so I finally got it and it is the PERFECT shade for fair skin...buy it now!</li>
            <li> Benefit dandelion is the perfect light pink for many skin tones and adds just a slight flush of color and shimmer to your skin. I use it on my cheeks and just lightly on the rest of my face for a \\&quot;awakened\\&quot; look. Love it!</li>
            <li> Just want to tell who want to buy this product, dont buy from this seller. The product is not exactly same as in benefit store. When I open the box, I cant express how upset I am. It looks really fake!!!! And it is really unreliable. The price isn&#x27;t even worth it</li>
            <li> I ordered Benefit Cosmetics Dandelion blush for my sister and found that it was not the same as the Dandelion being sold in Benefit stores. Although the packaging and brush were different than what I have seen from the Benefit store, the worst thing was that there was an extremely unfortunate spelling error (a racial slur) on the back of the package. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing my Benefit products from beautyhaus again.</li>
            <li> This by all means its not a blush.  I use this as an all over powder if I want a bit of a flush, and because it is so light, then I can add as much as I want, and I wont look crazy.  If you are looking for a more pigmented powder/blush, then I don&#x27;t think this is for you.</li>
            <li> The color barely shows up &amp; I have fair skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty natural girl and this makes me look alive and somewhat awake without looking like a drag queen. Very flattering, easy, lasts a long time. Goes with any kind of look. Subtle but awesome.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with seller&#x27;s service and products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;needless to say, it&#x27;s a good product to make you look young and healthy.</li>
            <li> I like using Benefits&#x27; Dandelion Powder Blush. Get a nice natural color on my cheeks.  Price is less expensive on Amazon also.</li>
            <li> use this all the time to perk up my complexion. great anytime but i love this on days when i&#x27;m in a rush cause i can apply it quickly without looking in the mirror and know that it will still look cute and not overdone.</li>
            <li> If you could have only one product for use on your face, this would be the one! It is a brightener that is impossible to over-use; it gives a very natural look to the face and it lasts all day. This is my 4th purchase in over 5 years, so you can see that you get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I first tried this face highlighter in Sephora, the lady there tried it on for me &amp; said it would brighten my face &amp; give it a glow. She was so right! I bought it &amp; ever since then (5 years ago) I haven&#x27;t stopped using it! It&#x27;s amazing, I have a fair complexion &amp; tend to look pale somewhat but by using it, my face looks refreshed &amp; glowing without being too much. It&#x27;s so natural it doesn&#x27;t make you feel at all made up. All my friends are using it now too:)</li>
            <li> This is my first time using any product from Benefit, but it won&#x27;t be my last - this is really great!  It comes with a nice little brush that works well with the packaging, as well as doing a good job of applying this blusher.  It&#x27;s a light pink color that can be used to highlight and give you a nice glow.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this and it looks very natural with my very light complexion.</li>
            <li> Although I am fair-ish, I can see others benefitting from this light pink colour.  It has buildable tint that gives a subtle healthy glow.  I apply it to the apples of my cheeks with the awesome included brush, a dab on my forehead, nose and chin, and Hey, Presto!  I look naturally flushed, maybe as if I just came in from the sun, without a potential burn, or real exertion.  I never suffer from that over-blushed appearance either.  Does any of this make sense?  I just love this stuff and am happy I sprung for it. Plus it has a mild scent that&#x27;s divine!!  \\&quot;Dandelions\\&quot; aren&#x27;t PINK, but so what? I love it enough to bother writing about it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Best blush ever!  I love blush but can never use it because my skin tends to get flush a lot and so I wind up looking like a clown.  This blush though is just perfect.  I totally took a gamble buying it but the color is so light and just makes your skin look fresh and awake.  It even has a nice subtle scent to it.  It is seriously the perfect blush for people who really can&#x27;t wear blush but want to.</li>
            <li> I really like Benefit products.  I use quite a few of them.  Unfortunately this one is nearly clear on your skin.  I really like clean looking make-up and so it is OK for me but, you really can&#x27;t even tell that it is on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dandelion for the past 8 years and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other blush! Perfect shade, light but buildable.</li>
            <li> Product is fake. It is so obvious, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had this product (the same) for many years purchased at Macy&#x27;s. I purchased Benefit Dandelion (much less expensive). The product is horrible it turns into power when you touch it.This is not the same product. I would like to return it, I feel I wasted $21.79.When ordering the same product it should be the same.  jc[[ASIN:B000FBK5IQ Benefit Cosmetics Dandelion]]</li>
            <li> From the reviews that I read on this product, I thought that it was going to change my world. I probably needed something to change my world at the time, so I bought this. I tried it and promptly gave it away. It did nothing for me. I have no use for it. I think that I was hoping for something that it isn&#x27;t. You may like it, but I am sorry that I threw away money on a need to feel better. My feedback is not the same as that which convinced me to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other Benefit blush products, but this works great on my skin.  It gives me a kiss of color without being too pink. It has a matte finish, no glitter and isn&#x27;t t shiny which is perfect for the daytime.  It blends well with my other face makeup.  I like the brush that&#x27;s enclosed in the box.  If I had anything negative to say I wish the box was a little more durable so it doesn&#x27;t get trashed around in my makeup bag and look slightly worn towards its life end, but on the flip side it&#x27;s probably good that it&#x27;s hard paperboard so it&#x27;s environmentally conscious - I don&#x27;t feel so bad when I finish it and throw it away.  I would buy this blush again.</li>
            <li> I have light skin, not ivory but not tan! I got this as a soft highlighter, they label this as a face powder, not a blush, coralista for example is labeled as a blush, I see from some reviews that some may not realize this. Anyway, I tried it as a blush because I have a lot of red in my skin so I feel overwhelmed with a lot of color. This is perfect because it has buildable color!! It&#x27;s hard to over do it. Also looks really nice under the eyes, it&#x27;s just a soft light, softens everything, like being in candle light! Anyone over 30 understands what I mean by that!!  Great product! I bought it at sephora, same price, it&#x27;s set by the retailer.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a staple. I have a really light complexion and I apply it over the top of a light gel tinted blush (Pixie from Target), it&#x27;s the cutest.</li>
            <li> This powder is great! I use it as a blush and a finishing powder. I find that it&#x27;s long lasting as a blush and when used as a finishing powder, it makes my face look a little more natural (as natural as it can be with makeup on). It softens the face kind of like when you switch from florescent lighting to soft bulb lighting. I hope that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a blush, it&#x27;s easy to over do it though so go easy. When done right, it&#x27;s got a really nice flushed look, a little cutesy. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best face powder I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very fair oily skin with sallow undertones and this helps even it out and give me a nice, pretty flush. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for blush alone because it is so light you&#x27;d have to whack on a healthy amount for it to be noticeable. If you just want blush I&#x27;d go for Benetint instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years and it&#x27;s almost empty but not quite. My only complaints are the clumsy packaging (a box? really? and no mirror), the price (although, again, a little goes a long way) and the brush (although to be fair, including a decent face brush would make it bulky and even more expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: It looks best on fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still on the fence, go to Sephora and sample it first. But it&#x27;s one of the quickest pick-me-ups I have, great for those mornings when you look in the mirror and wonder how the heck the bride of Frankenstein got into your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years. ANd love the Benefit cosmetics.  This is a natural blush and this can be worn with any coloring or complexion.  I am mediteranean and a medium and it looks great on.</li>
            <li> This blush is very light and flattering. It probably wouldn&#x27;t be dark enough for someone who is very tan or has darker skin. As a redhead however, this product is perfect. It has a bit of a sparkle, but not too much, it is light catching and a color that is very complementing to the skin.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a genuine benefit product, however, the packaging was not real. The blush was not real benefit blush and it fell out after a couple uses. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> This is simply amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It just gives you a very naturally good complexion, and in such a small box,it contains a mirror and an excellent brush which makes it so portable and easy to use. Oh, and it smells so good too. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, and have been using it for years. A box will last me a year of everyday use, all over my face, but I use it right down to the dust. Beautiful, flawless pink skin - I never use blush, just brush this all over.</li>
            <li> received a sample of this product and loved it so much purchased the full size.&lt;br /&gt;smells great, just perfect, not too pink or red.&lt;br /&gt;in summer i used all over face.  now fall is here I am useing as blush, highlighter on cheeck, chin, nose forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received fast, packaged well and new unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned but I love this product.  It is a light-colored blush so it is not too intense for me.  A quick application and it gives my cheeks some color but not enough to make me look too &#x27;made-up&#x27; or flushed.  It gives more of a natural looking healthy glow than anything.  It is a matte blush, so it is perfect to wear to work or during the day.  And it has a light scent that is perfectly lovely.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this cosmetic before but was quite shocked at how pricey it is now.  But it lasts a long time and is really effective in giving your face a bit of color besides just using blush. I use this all over, then apply blush.  It&#x27;s a light powder with a nice, wide brush.  Would not be without this in my make up arsenal.</li>
            <li> Best blush ever. Perfect pink</li>
            <li> Awesome to use in the place of foundation if you want a little color, but a clean fresh faced look.</li>
            <li> Love this powder!  I use it as blush and it is perfect...  it&#x27;s soft and subtle for day but can be layered on for a more dramatic look if you desire.  Feels soft and luxurious rather than heavy or cakey.</li>
            <li> Never buy this unless you want a fake one!!! Compare it with one bought from Sephora, lots of spelling mistakes (benefilcosmelics.com) and \\&quot;peel here\\&quot; you got nothing!</li>
            <li> I really like Benefit blush.  I have a very light peachy/orange one (that&#x27;s sadly been discontinued) that I got years ago (and still have) that I really like so I decided to try another one.  This color is a very pale pink in the box but is a brighter pink once on the cheek.  I am light, but not fair, with neutral undertones, hazel eyes and dark blond hair.  This color works very well for me.  It doesn&#x27;t fade much and the color stays true all day, which can be a problem for me because I have oily skin.  I love the packaging of this blush.  There is also a significant amount of product in this box.  I also love the brush, which deposits just the right amount of powder.  This color would work on any skin tone except very dark ones, because it wouldn&#x27;t show up at all.  This is a true pink without any peachy undertones.  It&#x27;s a universal color and therefore would work equally well on yellow or pink undertones.  All in all, it&#x27;s a nice product and once I&#x27;ve used it up (a few years from now) I will definitely purchase another one.  It adds a realistic flush to my cheeks that is fresh and youthful.  As a mature woman, that&#x27;s exactly the look I&#x27;m going for! I purchased mine at Sephora so I can&#x27;t speak to whether this seller is offering the real thing or not. If you&#x27;re worried about it, you can always get the real thing from Sephora online for about the same price.  I definitely recommend this product (the real thing that is).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and love the slight glow it gives.  The most recent purchase was disappointing because the product is now 30% smaller.  That is a big change for the same price.  Perhaps they could go back to the original size and leave out the brush.</li>
