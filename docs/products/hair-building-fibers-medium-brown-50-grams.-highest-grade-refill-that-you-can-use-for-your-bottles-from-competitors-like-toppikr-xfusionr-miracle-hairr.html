            <li>Great product .</li>
            <li>or I just feel better for doing it, but this is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>The product itself gives good coverage, however, it clumps on the head after a while which becomes itchy at times.  </li>
            <li>It is not, in my opinion, as good as Toppik.  </li>
            <li>This one is by far the best, and is much, much more affordable.</li>
            <li>and I think I like this better.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order another package right now before it sells out on me!!  </li>
            <li>The seller was great super fast shipping</li>
            <li>Yes, of course, the price makes it worth it!</li>
            <li>The caboki brand is still a little bit better but it gets the job done and no one is staring at my scalp!! :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to many of my clients.</li>
            <li>Product saves me a lot of money and is a good substitute for other leading brands</li>
            <li>excellent product- better than the more expensive name-brands!!!</li>
            <li>The only issue is the most recent batch are more like a fine powder and doesn&#x27;t look like the fibers in the previous shipments.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really worked</li>
            <li>Work excelente for me thanks</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something very close to Cabooki, this is it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have a lot of thin spots and I love being able to leave the house without worrying about my scalp showing.  </li>
            <li>I was anxious to see if it would last two days and happily it does.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I go to the gym every other day so lasting two days is nice.  </li>
            <li>This is just good, not great.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I use Coboki normally and that one has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>No problems at the gym so far -- it stays put even when you sweat.  </li>
            <li>Toppik has harmful ingredients, this refill content does NOT have anything but natural fibers.</li>
            <li>It may work better when the hair is dry as it says, not sure.</li>
            <li>Performs much like other name brand products.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s more like dark brown..makes my hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> It covers extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I used Toppik for years, and tried a couple of other hair-fiber products.</li>
            <li> sorry to say i had some kind of allergic reaction to this product - it makes my scalp itch like crazy and almost burns</li>
            <li> The brown is very dark, so I had to mix it with a bit of lighter color, as it seems to turn black on me.  </li>
            <li> It is very dark color</li>
            <li> it makes your hair look thicker but messy applying it.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> As a hairdresser having balding hair is the worst, but not anymore.</li>

            <li> Excellent product! Stays in place when set with hairspray, even in rain and humidity. Definitely a good buy, I will reorder!</li>
            <li> it does not go a long way like the one in the bottle. All it is is powder-will not buy again</li>
            <li> Great product.  Good deal!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I read a review from a user who stated it was &amp;#34;just powder&amp;#34; so when I received mine, I re-filled my Toppik bottle only halfway and shook it so air could &amp;#34;fluff up&amp;#34; the fibers.  I don&#x27;t know if it really worked or I just feel better for doing it, but this is a wonderful product.  I have a lot of thin spots and I love being able to leave the house without worrying about my scalp showing.  It covers extremely well.  The only fiber product I have used is Toppik and I think I like this better.  (Or maybe the money I saved is influencing that decision!!)  I was anxious to see if it would last two days and happily it does.  I go to the gym every other day so lasting two days is nice.  No problems at the gym so far -- it stays put even when you sweat.  I&#x27;m going to order another package right now before it sells out on me!!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product and works well. Performs much like other name brand products. The only issue is the most recent batch are more like a fine powder and doesn&#x27;t look like the fibers in the previous shipments.</li>
            <li> it makes your hair look thicker but messy applying it.</li>
            <li> It is very dark color it&#x27;s more like dark brown..makes my hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it doesnt work as well as it should because the person uses it after showering and it clumps up.  It may work better when the hair is dry as it says, not sure.</li>
            <li> The product itself gives good coverage, however, it clumps on the head after a while which becomes itchy at times.  Will I continue to use it?  Yes, of course, the price makes it worth it!</li>
            <li> Product saves me a lot of money and is a good substitute for other leading brands</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than  $15,000 in hair transplant operations.</li>
            <li> Just refill the Topik container, and you&#x27;re back in business</li>
            <li> Work excelente for me thanks</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Does the job if you have time to waste. Tends to stick and agglomerate...</li>
            <li> This works really great for hiding my bald spots. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I use Coboki normally and that one has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> sorry to say i had some kind of allergic reaction to this product - it makes my scalp itch like crazy and almost burns so i won&#x27;t be using it at all - The seller was great super fast shipping but it&#x27;s just not for me</li>
            <li> As a hairdresser having balding hair is the worst, but not anymore. This is an awesome product and great price. Gives the best coverage of all the fibers out there. I can&#x27;t live without this product. I highly recommend this to many of my clients.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something very close to Cabooki, this is it. Toppik has harmful ingredients, this refill content does NOT have anything but natural fibers. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product . Great price !</li>

            <li> This is just good, not great.  It is not, in my opinion, as good as Toppik.  The brown is very dark, so I had to mix it with a bit of lighter color, as it seems to turn black on me.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again, but don&#x27;t be discouraged if you like a finer powder than Toppik, this may just work for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product..excellent service!</li>
            <li> So far so good! Thanks</li>
            <li> Works great! The caboki brand is still a little bit better but it gets the job done and no one is staring at my scalp!! :)</li>
