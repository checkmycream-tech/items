    <ol>
            <li>I was very happy to have found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>They work great!</li>
            <li>The cloth featured on this page was once a double-sided exfoliating cloth and it was excellent.  </li>
            <li>I think the best part is,</li>
            <li>These Bath Clothes are the best.  </li>
            <li>The best of both worlds.  </li>
            <li>Love these bath cloths!!!!</li>
            <li>They handle it all and still look and perform great!</li>
            <li>It exfoliates my skin perfectly!</li>
            <li>Great, well made bath cloths that work beautifully when showering.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>These are awesome, they need to make them in more colors!</li>
            <li>but they are great for the body.  </li>
            <li>This bath cloth makes for lots of suds and does a great job exfoliating without being scratchy-painful.  </li>
            <li>Still, if I can&#x27;t get that one,  I would happily buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>These are very nice and efficient wash cloths.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as sisal.  </li>
            <li>Good exfoliator for the body, not the face though.</li>
            <li>This one is equally as good and has the bonus of a terry cloth side.</li>
            <li>This is the best for liquid soaps and a clean body.</li>
            <li>I love how you can use either liquid body wash or bar soap and the cloth produces a great lather.</li>
            <li>After forgetting them after visits with family, I have gotten calls to find out where to buy their own.  </li>
            <li>It works great and can not&lt;br /&gt;imagine getting clean without it.</li>
            <li>They are high quality and work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It lathers soap nicely, and gives a nice meaningful scrub without scraping your skin off.</li>
            <li>By far the best thing to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I love this mesh cloth.</li>
            <li>It is WAY BETTER than a terry wash cloth, loofah or a puff.</li>
            <li>I love this type of bath \\&quot;sponge\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I love these cleansing cloths.  </li>
            <li>: I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this washcloth, as it does have terry cloth on one side.</li>
            <li>I love these bath cloth.</li>
            <li>So glad I found them online.</li>
            <li>I will probably have to order more as I use it all the time.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend used to always use mine because he was in love with the dual side soft/roughness.</li>
            <li>Even though I like this one better, the description of the product sold here is incorrect.</li>
            <li>i really love these bath cloths .</li>
            <li>Love this product, as it has the woven fabric on both sides of the wash cloth.</li>
            <li>These lather-up your cleanser well, and rinse easily...</li>
            <li>I am soooooo happy I was able to find these cloths on Amazon and the price is such a steal too!!!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that I could use for a good facial scrub every few days, and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>They are great for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This product exfoliates skin, leaving it silky smooth and drys quickly on the towel bar too.</li>
            <li>These are rough on the skin which I love since you can get a good exfoliation from them.  </li>
            <li>Great product to use for dry skin areas</li>
            <li>Its perfect for ex foliating in those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more economic version of the 2 sided washcloths they sell at Walmart</li>
            <li>The rough side is fantastic for exfoliation, gives you that good clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Other than that, They&#x27;re GREAT.</li>
            <li>My experience with this type of cloth is that they quickly fall apart or mildew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also quickly dries hanging in the shower.</li>
            <li>these cloths, gently, with a mild, natural, sulfate-free soap for optimum skin condition.</li>
            <li>The soft terry side is perfect for the more delicate/sensitive areas that you wouldn&#x27;t want to scrub hard on.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these amazing bath cloths at Walmart; that was the only place I could find them.</li>
            <li>It is very durable and a good price, especially with free shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to rinse and fast drying.</li>
            <li>It holds the soap or body wash really well, lathers up easy, and exfoliates everything as you go.  </li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is just the right amount of exfoliant texture on a washcloth, for my taste.</li>
            <li>I am very easy on washcloths, so I think the problem is with the product itself; it simply isn&#x27;t well-made.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re just looking for a facial cloth, this is ideal and should last much longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no choice but to find more to replace my worn out one and to get a few extras for him too :)</li>
            <li>the lather comes more easily from body wash, so I use a lot less.</li>
            <li>I hardly use body scrubs cause this is great at exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of abrasive action to feel clean and invigorated.</li>
            <li>exfoliation quality is effective without being too rough.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m bummed, because this was the only way for me to get my favorite washcloth, and now it seems I&#x27;ll have to do without.</li>
            <li>This washcloth is exactly what I need sometimes to wake up in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliating side is quite nice, not too rough on the skin and it works well.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite shower cloth.</li>
            <li>This order hasn&#x27;t actually arrived, but I love the one that I have had for years and can&#x27;t wait to have a spare to use while one is in the wash.</li>
            <li>and leave my body so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>They rinse easily and dry quickly</li>
            <li>love the way this feels on my skin, and the material lasts long even after I wash it in the washer.</li>
            <li>Also, easy to scrub my back.  </li>
            <li>These are very abrasive, which is what we were after.  </li>
            <li>but is also gentle.  </li>
            <li>The price seems reasonable, and I&#x27;ll probably order it again, assuming it won&#x27;t mildew as some reviewers have pointed</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like wash clothes because they don&#x27;t suds up very well.</li>
            <li>This product mildews fast and is not as pictured.</li>
            <li>They are very durable too.</li>
            <li>they really take the ded skin off of my body .</li>
            <li>It turns out to be very useful to have a terry cloth as well as an exfoliating side on the same cloth.</li>
            <li>The other side is nice and soft for gentle washing.</li>
            <li>Seems like I use less soap and get more out of it.</li>
            <li>Will be back to order more in the future.</li>
            <li>They are light weight and one side is soft and one is scratchy for the deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It also washes just fine in the machine with my other towels.</li>
            <li>In fact, they exfoliate so efficiently that care is required in their use when they are new.  </li>
            <li>The picture above is accurate, both sides are the same.</li>
            <li>They dry quickly and travel well.  </li>
            <li>This product from Aquasentials is very reasonably priced (cheaper than my local store!).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed this cloth a couple of times in a normal machine cycle - so far no visible damage to the textured side or the the hemming.</li>
            <li>much more so than the ordinary bath sponges.  </li>
            <li>The cloth is so flexible I can get narrow areas easily (i.e. between the toes, around the ears).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on facial cleansers, but find that with this cloth any inexpensive brand works fine.  </li>
            <li>It rinses clean and never really stinks (unless you leave it soaking wet in a puddle of water) As long as you wring it out and throw it in the wash with your white clothes every two weeks or so, you&#x27;ll have no problem.</li>
            <li>Definitely  get a couple of these cloths (which isn&#x27;t really a cloth).</li>
            <li>Does NOT have a soft side like the description states.....</li>
            <li>I like that it has a soft side as well</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very well made and last for years.  </li>
            <li>One side, exfoliates yet, not harshly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than the round balls made of nylon net.  </li>
            <li>Another plus is they dry quickly because of the open weave design.  </li>
            <li>I can no longer recommend this washcloth and advise not to order it, unless you don&#x27;t mind throwing it out after a short time, or are willing to sew the two sides back together.</li>
            <li>I could of course sew them back together, but no one should have to do that with a new product.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I dislike is that after about 3 months of use, I have to replace it with a new one.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of rough in the beginning, but soften after a few uses enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>The cloths last about as long as a sponge, and dry as quickly.</li>
            <li>It has just enough body to help you reach all your back areas yet pliable enough to scrub the rest of you for a very invigorating cleansing experience.</li>
            <li>They used to be available at Wal-Mart [and other such stores]; but suddenly, no more.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t think it may last as long.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend putting on a body lotion afterward otherwise your skin will dry out.</li>
            <li> It is only one side, the rough net type.</li>
            <li> I know that they wouldn&#x27;t last forever, so I expected that.</li>
            <li> Its not to harsh and it has a soft side on the reverse.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for facial quality, but this is quite rough.</li>
            <li> The picture shows weave mesh on the front and back of the product, yet when received it had a terry cloth on one side and the mesh on the other.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinse well when done and hang to dry - it dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I toss them in the washing machine, and either dry them on a rack or in the dryer depending on time.  </li>
            <li> They seems to get a little fragile.</li>
            <li> This product now has 2 rough sides like the picture shows.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit rough, but not to the point where it hurts.  </li>
            <li> Some are rough feeling for 1-2 days then softened a lot</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like shower puffs because I like a harder scrub.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look like rough fabric on 2 sides.</li>
            <li> Lathers up well and isn&#x27;t too rough on the face.</li>
            <li> When I am dirty from painting or working on cars, this scrubs me clean.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s exfoliating mesh on one side and terry on the other.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a terry cloth on one side and a nylon rougher fabric on the other side.</li>
            <li> but I do like the $4 one that I can buy at Walmart that has cloth on one side and mesh on the other because, well, I still need something to wash the parts I don&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; and that one does both.</li>
            <li> This is tough on your skin and gets really smelly after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> the picture and what was shipped are very two different things...very unhappy with this buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them on my face -- a little too rough for that --</li>
            <li> Previous review</li>
            <li> They take a little bit to get used to.</li>
            <li> Thick enough to handle well, wasn&#x27;t too hard on the skin, and it didn&#x27;t mildew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems snaggy and worn after just a few months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not \\&quot;heavy</li>
            <li> I think I will buy a few reserve.</li>
            <li> and we have never had trouble with mold or mildew.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loofahs are too harsh and awkward for me to use, but I really like these wash clothes.</li>
            <li> The fabric binding that connects the exfoliating side to the terry cloth side comes undone after very little usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these for years, and I was getting anxious as to where I would find its replacement.</li>
            <li> The cloths work like any bath-sponge; however, these cloths are seriously exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> When you need to get to those hard to reach places the loofah sponge can&#x27;t reach, these weave Terry Bath cloth are the supreme alternative!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find these in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> buyer beware it has a cloth behind the exfoilating part.</li>
            <li> your description is still wrong!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using these for years. They are great for my dry skin.  I don&#x27;t use them on my face -- a little too rough for that -- but they are great for the body.  Also, easy to scrub my back.  They dry quickly and travel well.  After forgetting them after visits with family, I have gotten calls to find out where to buy their own.  I was very happy to have found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are very abrasive, which is what we were after.  They work great!</li>
            <li> Not as good as sisal.  Don&#x27;t think it may last as long.  Seems snaggy and worn after just a few months.</li>
            <li> Good exfoliator for the body, not the face though.</li>
            <li> I love this mesh cloth. It is WAY BETTER than a terry wash cloth, loofah or a puff. Definitely  get a couple of these cloths (which isn&#x27;t really a cloth).</li>
            <li> product is as the picture shows....your description is still wrong!!!  This product now has 2 rough sides like the picture shows.  Does NOT have a soft side like the description states.....</li>
            <li> Found one of these while vacationing in Virginia.  Haven&#x27;t seen them anywhere in California and I&#x27;ve been looking for a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this cloth!  It holds either liquid or regular soap well and lathers it up well.  Seems like I use less soap and get more out of it. The cloth is so flexible I can get narrow areas easily (i.e. between the toes, around the ears).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse well when done and hang to dry - it dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliation quality is effective without being too rough.  This time, I&#x27;ll get one to save just for my face and use a a second one for the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just looking for a facial cloth, this is ideal and should last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; ... will start to unravel with time ... but to me... well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these for years, and I was getting anxious as to where I would find its replacement. YAY!</li>
            <li> the picture and what was shipped are very two different things...very unhappy with this buy. buyer beware it has a cloth behind the exfoilating part.</li>
            <li> This is the washcloth I&#x27;d lost sight of for over 2 years. It has just enough body to help you reach all your back areas yet pliable enough to scrub the rest of you for a very invigorating cleansing experience. Makes lots of lather, no matter what soap you choose - liquid or solid.</li>
            <li> The cloth featured on this page was once a double-sided exfoliating cloth and it was excellent.  Thick enough to handle well, wasn&#x27;t too hard on the skin, and it didn&#x27;t mildew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the photo hasn&#x27;t changed, the product has.  Now it&#x27;s exfoliating mesh on one side and terry on the other.  My experience with this type of cloth is that they quickly fall apart or mildew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed, because this was the only way for me to get my favorite washcloth, and now it seems I&#x27;ll have to do without.</li>
            <li> I love this type of bath \\&quot;sponge\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s so much better than the round balls made of nylon net.  This bath cloth makes for lots of suds and does a great job exfoliating without being scratchy-painful.  It also quickly dries hanging in the shower.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of abrasive action to feel clean and invigorated.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on facial cleansers, but find that with this cloth any inexpensive brand works fine.  Exfoliates but is also gentle.  Wish I had known about this years ago.</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates skin, leaving it silky smooth and drys quickly on the towel bar too.</li>
            <li> This is just the right amount of exfoliant texture on a washcloth, for my taste. Loofahs are too harsh and awkward for me to use, but I really like these wash clothes. I like that it has a soft side as well, so I can switch over if my skin needs a break! I think the best part is, the lather comes more easily from body wash, so I use a lot less. It&#x27;s easier to rinse out than a loofah or a sponge, as well. I&#x27;ve washed this cloth a couple of times in a normal machine cycle - so far no visible damage to the textured side or the the hemming. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This washcloth is exactly what I need sometimes to wake up in the shower.  It is a bit rough, but not to the point where it hurts.  My hubby also likes using it!</li>
            <li> I love these cleansing cloths.  They used to be available at Wal-Mart [and other such stores]; but suddenly, no more.  Thank goodness for this Dealer!  Prompt delivery, too!  The cloths work like any bath-sponge; however, these cloths are seriously exfoliating.  Probably not for the faint-hearted. But if you&#x27;re loofah-friendly, these are for you.  These lather-up your cleanser well, and rinse easily... much more so than the ordinary bath sponges.  The cloths last about as long as a sponge, and dry as quickly.</li>
            <li> Previous review: I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this washcloth, as it does have terry cloth on one side. It turns out to be very useful to have a terry cloth as well as an exfoliating side on the same cloth. The exfoliating side is quite nice, not too rough on the skin and it works well. The price seems reasonable, and I&#x27;ll probably order it again, assuming it won&#x27;t mildew as some reviewers have pointed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/2012 Update to earlier review above: I still like the feel of these washcloths, but having used them for awhile now, I am lowering my rating from a 5 to a 2. The problem is that they simply don&#x27;t last. The fabric binding that connects the exfoliating side to the terry cloth side comes undone after very little usage. These came as a 2-pack; the 1st one lasted a a couple of months before it started to come apart, but the 2nd one started to come apart after one usage. I am very easy on washcloths, so I think the problem is with the product itself; it simply isn&#x27;t well-made. I could of course sew them back together, but no one should have to do that with a new product. I can no longer recommend this washcloth and advise not to order it, unless you don&#x27;t mind throwing it out after a short time, or are willing to sew the two sides back together.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;One side weave texture cloth, Terry Cloth on the other&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIES. It is only one side, the rough net type. I was looking for a more economic version of the 2 sided washcloths they sell at Walmart but this is not it. The picture above is accurate, both sides are the same.</li>
            <li> These are rough on the skin which I love since you can get a good exfoliation from them.  Some are rough feeling for 1-2 days then softened a lot but these are still going well after 2 weeks of use. It is very hard to find these in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I love these bath cloth. The only thing that I dislike is that after about 3 months of use, I have to replace it with a new one. They seems to get a little fragile. I know that they wouldn&#x27;t last forever, so I expected that. Other than that, They&#x27;re GREAT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like shower puffs because I like a harder scrub. I don&#x27;t like wash clothes because they don&#x27;t suds up very well. This is the best for liquid soaps and a clean body. They rinse easily and dry quickly so they don&#x27;t get musty and stink. When I am dirty from painting or working on cars, this scrubs me clean. They do wear out and become smoother. I used to find them locally, but couldn&#x27;t find them anymore. So glad I found them online. My last one was wearing out but I didn&#x27;t want to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Great, well made bath cloths that work beautifully when showering.  Terry cloth side for regular bathing and the weave side for exfoliating those areas of the body that need it.  So convenient to have both cloths on hand at the same time without having to clutter up the shower with yet another item/product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one I had been using for years. It works great and can not&lt;br /&gt;imagine getting clean without it. It is very durable and a good price, especially with free shipping. I think I will buy a few reserve.</li>
            <li> This cloth is not as pictured. It&#x27;s got a terry cloth on one side and a nylon rougher fabric on the other side. The picture makes it look like rough fabric on 2 sides.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, they need to make them in more colors!</li>
            <li> The picture shows weave mesh on the front and back of the product, yet when received it had a terry cloth on one side and the mesh on the other. This product mildews fast and is not as pictured.</li>
            <li> This wash cloth is duel sided so you can cleanse all body parts. It&#x27;s easy to rinse and fast drying.</li>
            <li> Great product to use for dry skin areas and it is washable. Will be back to order more in the future.</li>
            <li> When you need to get to those hard to reach places the loofah sponge can&#x27;t reach, these weave Terry Bath cloth are the supreme alternative!</li>
            <li> These Bath Clothes are the best.  You have a loofah on one side and a soft washcloth on the other.  The best of both worlds.  I have one at home and one at the gym.  I would definitely buy again.  They are very durable too.</li>
            <li> Love these bath cloths!!!! Will continue to repurchase these again and again. They take a little bit to get used to. They&#x27;re kind of rough in the beginning, but soften after a few uses enough for daily use. I hardly use body scrubs cause this is great at exfoliating. Definitely recommend putting on a body lotion afterward otherwise your skin will dry out.</li>
            <li> Virtually unusable. Two ply cloth sewn together that rolls up when attempting to scrub.</li>
            <li> These are very nice and efficient wash cloths.  In fact, they exfoliate so efficiently that care is required in their use when they are new.  They wear well and we have never had trouble with mold or mildew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use these cloths, gently, with a mild, natural, sulfate-free soap for optimum skin condition.</li>
            <li> Its not to harsh and it has a soft side on the reverse. Its perfect for ex foliating in those hard to reach areas. I will probably have to order more as I use it all the time. Its holding up well and its made well.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these amazing bath cloths at Walmart; that was the only place I could find them. I moved to Chicago from LA and now I cant find them at Walmarts around here. My boyfriend used to always use mine because he was in love with the dual side soft/roughness. I had no choice but to find more to replace my worn out one and to get a few extras for him too :) The rough side is fantastic for exfoliation, gives you that good clean feeling. The soft terry side is perfect for the more delicate/sensitive areas that you wouldn&#x27;t want to scrub hard on. I love how you can use either liquid body wash or bar soap and the cloth produces a great lather. It rinses clean and never really stinks (unless you leave it soaking wet in a puddle of water) As long as you wring it out and throw it in the wash with your white clothes every two weeks or so, you&#x27;ll have no problem. I am soooooo happy I was able to find these cloths on Amazon and the price is such a steal too!!!</li>
            <li> Was hoping for facial quality, but this is quite rough.</li>
            <li> I did a hunt for these cloths after one I had been given finally wore out.  By far the best thing to use in the shower.  It holds the soap or body wash really well, lathers up easy, and exfoliates everything as you go.  Another plus is they dry quickly because of the open weave design.  They&#x27;re very well made and last for years.  I toss them in the washing machine, and either dry them on a rack or in the dryer depending on time.  They handle it all and still look and perform great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about these.  They are light weight and one side is soft and one is scratchy for the deep cleaning.  They are high quality and work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Not as described. There&#x27;s no terry cloth on this product. Even though I like this one better, the description of the product sold here is incorrect.</li>
            <li> love the way this feels on my skin, and the material lasts long even after I wash it in the washer. It exfoliates my skin perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite shower cloth. It lathers soap nicely, and gives a nice meaningful scrub without scraping your skin off. It also washes just fine in the machine with my other towels. My husband even likes to use it. It relieves the occasional itchiness that he gets from being so hairy.  I recommend this but I do like the $4 one that I can buy at Walmart that has cloth on one side and mesh on the other because, well, I still need something to wash the parts I don&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; and that one does both. Still, if I can&#x27;t get that one,  I would happily buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this might seem counter intuitive, but it doesn&#x27;t work so well with soaps that have physical exfoliators because the beads/scrubby stuff just get stuck in the mesh.</li>
            <li> This order hasn&#x27;t actually arrived, but I love the one that I have had for years and can&#x27;t wait to have a spare to use while one is in the wash.</li>
            <li> Like having the 2 sided options.  One side, exfoliates yet, not harshly.  The other side is nice and soft for gentle washing.</li>
            <li> I bought these when I bought the Elizabeth Spa Weave Wash Cloth. This one is equally as good and has the bonus of a terry cloth side. Plus, a 2 pack is the same price as one Elizabeth Spa Weave Wash Cloth.</li>
            <li> This is tough on your skin and gets really smelly after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> i really love these bath cloths . they really take the ded skin off of my body . and leave my body so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this at a local store, but they stopped carrying it.  This product from Aquasentials is very reasonably priced (cheaper than my local store!).  Love this product, as it has the woven fabric on both sides of the wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that I could use for a good facial scrub every few days, and this is perfect. Lathers up well and isn&#x27;t too rough on the face.</li>
