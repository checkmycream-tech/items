            <li>Happy shopping!</li>
            <li>Works just great!!!  </li>
            <li>have very fair Scandanavian skin</li>
            <li>Very good instructions on how to use it.</li>
            <li>Rolls beautifully, prompt shipping</li>
            <li>and I had the best result I love it</li>
            <li>This is a good product, I would recommend for purchase, is as described and works well,</li>
            <li>Do it before bed, and after don&#x27;t forget to apply cream with vitamin E, you will notice some good results.</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars because I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>the needles dont hurt and kind of tickles.</li>
            <li>so I will not disclose exactly what I am doing lol.  </li>
            <li>I love this roller.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the products.</li>
            <li>This rolled with combination of facial excersises just do a really wonderful job.</li>
            <li>love my roller, use it on my face.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And, I have to say the .5mm hurts more than 1.5mm</li>
            <li>The 1.5mm goes deeper, so to give the skin more time to recuperate I</li>
            <li>So this may take more time to see results.</li>
            <li>It stings more in some areas like the forehead and eyelids (once again, eyelids are not recommended).</li>
            <li>Wherever the skin is thinner tends to be more tender.</li>
            <li>Great price, great results for a fraction of the cost of other companies.</li>
            <li>Luckily, they refunded my money as soon as I requested a return, and told me to keep the 2 row roller for my troubles, which was nice.</li>
            <li>so it gets easily irritated and pinkish.  </li>
            <li>I first saw a video on the product and ordered it, was happy when I received it, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I apply my moisturizer and in the morning I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>I used it twice, lightly.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it that much but am using it very lightly about 3 times a week then applying vitamin C serum and retinol cream afterwards.</li>
            <li>So far I honestly can see no difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>too cool..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, when using a super magnifying mirror (and my glasses)</li>
            <li>It seems to help with fine lines just don&#x27;t use too much pressure, that would hurt.  </li>
            <li>Worth your money.</li>
            <li>It punctures the skin very nicely and you can hear a  little crackling and popping...</li>
            <li>I try to stick with natural products without too many ingredients right after I roll.</li>
            <li>It has sas more than twice as many needles as the cheap crap and has its own storage tube to keep it isolated from the environment and clean.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is by far the best skin care device I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Received exactly what was advertised and received it on time.  </li>
            <li>I first started using this Derma Roller around the first week of July</li>
            <li>And be aware-</li>
            <li>I believe with regular use it will give the results of smoothing wrinkles, along with making your skin look so much better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been receiving comments from friends and family who are definitely noticing a more youthful appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li>However, the line from the corner of the nose to the outside of the mouth were getting more pronounced.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re still reading, then you must be pretty interested but maybe concerned about the pain.</li>
            <li>so many good reviews on amazon are fake.</li>
            <li>the copper peptides and hydroxy work pretty well, but the skin rollers really make my regimen work much faster.</li>
            <li>so I think I can easily get multiple uses out of it.  </li>
            <li>The roller is very even and perfectly sharp and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This roller once I learned to use it properly has made a huge difference to my skin texture.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too much sagging there, but the lines I have are deeper.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t pierce the skin because I already have a nose piercing, how many other holes do I want in my face?</li>
            <li>Cheap and ships faster than I&#x27;ve expected...</li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>the above review was for a previous product that had more needles</li>
            <li>Used in combination with natural skin serums containing Vitamin C and K, I&#x27;m noticing much smoother looking skin, a decrease in forehead lines, and an overall &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; My skin tone has begun to even out</li>
            <li>I am 41 years old   </li>
            <li>So far I like this product.  </li>
            <li>Derma roller does not hurt and after 3rd try I can really feel my crows eye area, under eyes and forehead tighten.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 years old</li>
            <li>this is what I see after two weeks: the nasal lines are nearly gone.</li>
            <li>The research I&#x27;ve done prior to use, says it takes 3-4 months to really see results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit irritating at first but fun as you roll more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m working on a top secret invention</li>
            <li>I had severe acne starting in my teens to my mid 30&#x27;s and hoped this Derma Roller would help my acne scars and marks but no change so far.  </li>
            <li>I have minimal sagging for my age, and normal pore size.</li>

            <li> I have minimal sagging for my age, and normal pore size.</li>
            <li> I have been a bit lazy to use it as much as I should</li>
            <li> I swear the needles on this are 4 or 5mm long.</li>
            <li> Going to start using it every other day for awhile then cut back to a couple nights aweek.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for very long</li>
            <li> After a few hours, I&#x27;ll apply a commercial brand cream (actually, I use generic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s not like being kissed by puppies, but it&#x27;s not at all unpleasant.</li>
            <li> and I turn a little bit red.  </li>
            <li> The corners of my mouth have deeper wrinkles, and the jowl lines are minimal at this point.</li>
            <li> I have to say I don&#x27;t see much improvement on my eyelids or under eyes, but those are my worse areas.</li>
            <li> Well, the pain is really minimal.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment, thus far, is that it hasn&#x27;t helped with the few broken capillaries that I have on my cheeks, but perhaps more time is needed to break them</li>
            <li> me, this has proven to be a viable alternative to invasive and expensive cosmetic procedures and I would highly recommend the .05 or the 1.0 mm derm rollers for facial care.</li>
            <li> I use the .5mm every other day and the 1.5mm once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that the needle holes close up within an hour, so now I apply the Vitamin C immediately after I finish a section (forehead, one cheek, other cheek, etc).</li>
            <li> and I have some dark spots.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t had any affect on the dark spots (I&#x27;ve read you should use a lightener to work on those).</li>
            <li> and when I do use it, it feels a little tingely</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been dreaming about getting a little nip/tuck, forget-about-it and use a derma roller instead.</li>
            <li> maybe a little stinging for a few minutes when the product is applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> Both family and friends have complemented my skin after just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> but it disappears in a few hours.</li>
            <li> And, I have a few breakouts (three-four).</li>
            <li> Besides, my skin feels so firm and tight that I would care if it burned!</li>
            <li> Read the bad ones first.</li>
            <li> As a man in my mid 40s, I&#x27;m experiencing the usual skin issues - tired, dull skin, uneven skin tone, and noticeable pores.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re proactive and don&#x27;t mind a little discomfort, then giddy-up!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike a few of the other reviews, I don&#x27;t find the needles to be uncomfortable or create any burning sensations.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even see the holes; or, at least I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> And by deeper, I mean compared to the .5mm.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> it almost looks like a real bad sunburn at first</li>
            <li> when you see those needles is a little I&#x27;m going crazy</li>
            <li> My skin tingles a for a few minutes after use, but not at an uncomfortable or painful level.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that painful and does not draw blood.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this item three times and have not seen any results just yet.  Hopefully I will the get the results as advertised.</li>
            <li> Cheap and ships faster than I&#x27;ve expected...I&#x27;ve tried the product...It&#x27;s a little bit irritating at first but fun as you roll more. I would definitely recommend this product...</li>
            <li> I love this roller. It is painless to use, and the skin looks instantly rosey with a glow. I am 41 years old   Both family and friends have complemented my skin after just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I have been using the .5mm on my face and the 1.5mm on my abomen and lower body along with SRCP(copper peptides) and hydroxy acid therapy. the copper peptides and hydroxy work pretty well, but the skin rollers really make my regimen work much faster. the needles dont hurt and kind of tickles. maybe a little stinging for a few minutes when the product is applied to the skin. I will order my next rollers from here. I am pleased with the products.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product.  It isn&#x27;t that painful and does not draw blood.  I haven&#x27;t used it for very long but I think I&#x27;m starting to see some results.</li>
            <li> Received exactly what was advertised and received it on time.  Person I purchased it for has not started using it on a regular basis so no good/reliable feedback to give on performance of the product at this time.</li>
            <li> I first started using this Derma Roller around the first week of July so its about 6 weeks now.  I have been using this about two or three times a week, follow it afterwards by a vitamin E cream.  So far I honestly can see no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair Scandanavian skin so it gets easily irritated and pinkish.  I had severe acne starting in my teens to my mid 30&#x27;s and hoped this Derma Roller would help my acne scars and marks but no change so far.  Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> My friend is a beautician  and sells a similar product for a lot of money. I asked her for advice, and she said to get a skin roller size .5 needles. I thought that was in millimeters. I swear the needles on this are 4 or 5mm long. I used it twice, lightly. Didn&#x27;t pierce the skin because I already have a nose piercing, how many other holes do I want in my face? Don&#x27;t get this. Seriously. And be aware- so many good reviews on amazon are fake. Read the bad ones first. Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> Derma roller does not hurt and after 3rd try I can really feel my crows eye area, under eyes and forehead tighten. I also use derma roller on my neck.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I would recommend for purchase, is as described and works well, I hope to see results.</li>
            <li> I have had it a week! I have used it it every night but one and I &#x27;m starting to see a differece in the wrinkles on my face. Going to start using it every other day for awhile then cut back to a couple nights aweek. So far I really like it. Cant wait to see how my skin looks after three months. I only use the numbing cream around my mouth and chin area.</li>
            <li> It has sas more than twice as many needles as the cheap crap and has its own storage tube to keep it isolated from the environment and clean. it says one time use but at 0.5mm it does  not draw blood so I think I can easily get multiple uses out of it.  I don&#x27;t know what the maximum number of uses are yet as I have only used it twice(will update). It punctures the skin very nicely and you can hear a  little crackling and popping... too cool.. it almost looks like a real bad sunburn at first but it disappears in a few hours. I&#x27;m working on a top secret invention so I will not disclose exactly what I am doing lol.  UPDATE : the product changed ...the above review was for a previous product that had more needles</li>
            <li> I first saw a video on the product and ordered it, was happy when I received it, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars because I am very satisfied with it. I like that it doesn&#x27;t go deep and doesn&#x27;t cause any discomfort while rolling it on my face, but after skin get plump and it is glowing! Do it before bed, and after don&#x27;t forget to apply cream with vitamin E, you will notice some good results. This rolled with combination of facial excersises just do a really wonderful job.</li>
            <li> Works just great!!!  Rolls beautifully, prompt shipping, I was a bit skeptical and I am glad I tried it.  I have been a bit lazy to use it as much as I should and when I do use it, it feels a little tingely and I turn a little bit red.  I apply my moisturizer and in the morning I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> when you see those needles is a little I&#x27;m going crazy but I try and I had the best result I love it Thanks</li>
            <li> I have not used it enough to leave a review of how it is working for me. I would recommend the product by the way it comes and the extras you get with it. Very good instructions on how to use it. Worth your money. I believe with regular use it will give the results of smoothing wrinkles, along with making your skin look so much better.</li>
            <li> Have not had the courage to try this yet.  I am holding on to it in case I change my mind.</li>
            <li> love my roller, use it on my face. Great price, great results for a fraction of the cost of other companies.</li>
            <li> As a man in my mid 40s, I&#x27;m experiencing the usual skin issues - tired, dull skin, uneven skin tone, and noticeable pores. I ordered the Derm Rollar and have been using it faithfully for 3 weeks now. Used in combination with natural skin serums containing Vitamin C and K, I&#x27;m noticing much smoother looking skin, a decrease in forehead lines, and an overall &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; My skin tone has begun to even out and I&#x27;ve been receiving comments from friends and family who are definitely noticing a more youthful appearance to my skin. The only disappointment, thus far, is that it hasn&#x27;t helped with the few broken capillaries that I have on my cheeks, but perhaps more time is needed to break them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a few of the other reviews, I don&#x27;t find the needles to be uncomfortable or create any burning sensations. Sure, it&#x27;s not like being kissed by puppies, but it&#x27;s not at all unpleasant. My skin tingles a for a few minutes after use, but not at an uncomfortable or painful level. I use the roller 3-4 times per week and have noticed no adverse effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this has proven to be a viable alternative to invasive and expensive cosmetic procedures and I would highly recommend the .05 or the 1.0 mm derm rollers for facial care.</li>
            <li> It seems to help with fine lines just don&#x27;t use too much pressure, that would hurt.  I use Vitamin C serum after.</li>
            <li> So far so good... I haven&#x27;t used it that much but am using it very lightly about 3 times a week then applying vitamin C serum and retinol cream afterwards.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been dreaming about getting a little nip/tuck, forget-about-it and use a derma roller instead. Seriously, this is by far the best skin care device I have ever used. It&#x27;s not for everyone, though. If you&#x27;re one of &#x27;those&#x27; people that don&#x27;t like discomfort and are skidish about everything, then move on. However, if you&#x27;re proactive and don&#x27;t mind a little discomfort, then giddy-up! You&#x27;re going to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the .5mm and 1.5mm. And, I have to say the .5mm hurts more than 1.5mm (I&#x27;m unsure why that is; width of needles maybe?). I use the .5mm every other day and the 1.5mm once a week. The 1.5mm goes deeper, so to give the skin more time to recuperate I only do it once a week. And by deeper, I mean compared to the .5mm. But, people...we&#x27;re talking millimeters here. Millimeters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after I roll my face/neck/chest I use a Vitamin C serum followed with a Hyaluronic Acid. The Vitamin C serum does sting, but it&#x27;s brief. Besides, my skin feels so firm and tight that I would care if it burned! I&#x27;ve read that the needle holes close up within an hour, so now I apply the Vitamin C immediately after I finish a section (forehead, one cheek, other cheek, etc). And, again, by holes, we&#x27;re talking smaller than a pore. You can&#x27;t even see the holes; or, at least I can&#x27;t. But, you feel them when you apply the Vitamin C. Sometimes I put on Jojoba oil afterwards, too. I try to stick with natural products without too many ingredients right after I roll. After a few hours, I&#x27;ll apply a commercial brand cream (actually, I use generic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is what I have to work with...I&#x27;m 49 years old and I&#x27;m starting to get those dang smoker lines around my lips. I have minimal sagging for my age, and normal pore size. I&#x27;m still prone to break-outs and I have some dark spots. The corners of my mouth have deeper wrinkles, and the jowl lines are minimal at this point. However, the line from the corner of the nose to the outside of the mouth were getting more pronounced. And, of course, my eyelids are droopier and under the eyes are puffier than they were 10 years ago. Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, when using a super magnifying mirror (and my glasses) this is what I see after two weeks: the nasal lines are nearly gone. The lines around my lips are a bit shallower. It hasn&#x27;t had any affect on the dark spots (I&#x27;ve read you should use a lightener to work on those). That&#x27;s next. There&#x27;s still some blackheads on my nose. And, I have a few breakouts (three-four). I use the roller on my eyelids and lips, too. This is not recommended, but I&#x27;m going for it! I have to say I don&#x27;t see much improvement on my eyelids or under eyes, but those are my worse areas. I&#x27;m hoping with time they will improve too. My neck and chest feel tighter, but still look the same. I don&#x27;t have too much sagging there, but the lines I have are deeper. So this may take more time to see results. The research I&#x27;ve done prior to use, says it takes 3-4 months to really see results. But, OMG! The lips feel like I had collagen injections! Really. I want to roll them every morning before I leave the house (I haven&#x27;t yet, but I thought about it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A numbing creme came with my .5mm roller, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. Too much extra work and time. But, it&#x27;s an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still reading, then you must be pretty interested but maybe concerned about the pain. Well, the pain is really minimal. It stings more in some areas like the forehead and eyelids (once again, eyelids are not recommended). Wherever the skin is thinner tends to be more tender. The chest doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps, and I&#x27;ll try to follow up again in a couple weeks...</li>
            <li> This roller once I learned to use it properly has made a huge difference to my skin texture. The roller is very even and perfectly sharp and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works well with continued use.</li>
            <li> This roller came with 2 rows of pins not 8 rows, as in the photo. It was also a different color. Luckily, they refunded my money as soon as I requested a return, and told me to keep the 2 row roller for my troubles, which was nice. I wish they would have replaced it with an 8 row roller. I asked them about reordering but I haven&#x27;t heard back yet.</li>
