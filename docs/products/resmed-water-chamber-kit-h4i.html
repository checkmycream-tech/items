    <ol>
            <li> The bottom of the water chamber came off while cleaning.  They are not meant to be taken off and cannot be replaced by consumers.  It was a little old so I was not surprised.  The replacement fit perfectly.  If the CPAP machine continues to operate properly I would not hate to re-order one of these water chambers should I have a replay.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my machine!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works, and it doesn&#x27;t leak yet.  I can&#x27;t explain why my original Water chamber developed a leak at the bottom where the heat transfer plate is, so I replaced it with this unit..</li>
            <li> Everything was as pictured. Great delivery time.</li>
            <li> The lid won&#x27;t close and stay shut.  So I had to go back to my old chamber and lid.  I bought them together so they would fit together.  Not happy!</li>
            <li> as described, fast shipping</li>

            <li> We found this product to work well for us. It is easy to clean. it is very helpful to be able to order direct.</li>
            <li> Used this one for just a few weeks and it&#x27;s leaking out the bottom. I hope this is not the disposable one as it does not indicate that in the description.</li>
            <li> servicable replacement for the nicer dishwasher safe tank. Harder to clean.  I bought it as a spare for when the dishwasher safe tank (and it will) has a latch failure.</li>
            <li> Works great. Fits perfectly and doesn&#x27;t leak. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> No review necessary, perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke my previous one swishing it by hand with hot soapy water in it, and dropped it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be Careful!</li>
