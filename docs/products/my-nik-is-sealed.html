            <li> The tiny roll-on applicator dispenses a clear solution so you don&#x27;t have to worry about using messy styptic pencils that leave a white residue on your face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waster your time on trying to stem the arterial bleeding using toilet paper.</li>
            <li> My tile shower only has a single soap dish built in, so I got this to hold soap, shampoo and washcloth.</li>
            <li> I used it on little razor cuts on face - seals, stops the bleeding and doesn&#x27;t burn as much as some of the other products.</li>
            <li> It did sting, but not for long, however.</li>
            <li> dab onto the cut and hope I didn&#x27;t have everything so wet that the bleeding was not affected.  </li>
            <li> So, I knew that I would eventually need something to help with the occasional nick or small cut.  </li>
            <li> Does slightly sting as other reviewers mentioned though it&#x27;s nothing compared to the sting from rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I never liked a regular styptic pencil.</li>
            <li> This My Nik Is Sealed product takes all of that mess away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My only other complaints are minor: you have to put a little effort into getting the ball applicator wet and rollable, and if you bleed all over it, it gets kinda dirty, but it doesn&#x27;t affect its performance.</li>
            <li> little styptic roller stopped it immediately.</li>
            <li> I tried it again by pressing razor rock on it firmly for about two minutes.</li>
            <li> yourself a favor, buy this small, roll on product.</li>
            <li> It does a magnificaent job on those minor razor nicks that we seem unable to avoid.  </li>
            <li> I shave with a DE and every once in a while I&#x27;m careless and manage to cut myself.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> i have used this product for years.  I find it easier to use and more effective than a  standard styptic pencil.  it has not always been easy to find and not cheap but it works.</li>
            <li> I placed the order with the knowledge that the item was overpriced. I paid the high price because the product does the job the best of any that I have ever used. All in all, I&#x27;m satisified.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for minor nicks that just won&#x27;t stop bleeding. Roll on a bit and it just stops...plus it has great medication for quick healing.</li>
            <li> This product is the best on the market bar none for shaving mishaps and small cuts.</li>
            <li> Works great for small nicks. This is a replacement for my used up one.</li>
            <li> The stuff works. I used it on little razor cuts on face - seals, stops the bleeding and doesn&#x27;t burn as much as some of the other products.</li>
            <li> I just recently started DE shaving again, after a 30 year hiatus.  So, I knew that I would eventually need something to help with the occasional nick or small cut.  Yes, I have had the occasion to use this product.  I can say that I like the packaging.  It is much easier to use this tube/capped product than it was to use my old styptic pencil.  Just unscrew the cap and use the roller ball end to apply the product to the affected area...and the bleeding stops.  With the old styptic pencil, I had to moisten the stick...dab onto the cut and hope I didn&#x27;t have everything so wet that the bleeding was not affected.  This My Nik Is Sealed product takes all of that mess away.  I did find, however, that this product can also \\&quot;sting\\&quot; a bit when applied to a cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor shipped the product promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase from this vendor again...and I will likely continue to keep a tube of My Nik Is Sealed on hand for those occasions when I need to stop the blood flow!</li>
            <li> I shave with a DE and every once in a while I&#x27;m careless and manage to cut myself.  This is the perfect solution for those nicks.  It closes them right up with a little burning sensation.  My Nik is sealed.</li>
            <li> So much better than the messy steptic sticks.  Works quick, clean and easy.  LOVE IT and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I came across this product years ago and would not use anything else.  It does a magnificaent job on those minor razor nicks that we seem unable to avoid.  I thoroughly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I never liked a regular styptic pencil. Stung like all …… and left residue. The few times that I have needed to use &amp;#34;My Nik is Sealed&amp;#34; it was vastly superior. It has some aloe in it that helps the healing process and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your fingers or face as it is applied with a miniature liquid roller just as a deodorant. Really nice product.</li>
            <li> Does the trick in stopping nicks. The tiny roll-on applicator dispenses a clear solution so you don&#x27;t have to worry about using messy styptic pencils that leave a white residue on your face. I keep one in my shaving kit and one in my briefcase.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years (a decade or more) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Does slightly sting as other reviewers mentioned though it&#x27;s nothing compared to the sting from rubbing alcohol. It does a great job at immediately stopping the bleeding from shaving nicks.</li>
            <li> My tile shower only has a single soap dish built in, so I got this to hold soap, shampoo and washcloth. I does a great job.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waster your time on trying to stem the arterial bleeding using toilet paper. If you buy this you will no longer have to walk out the door looking like the mummy from Ancient Egypt. This seals cuts. Seals them like you used superglue, only not so toxic. I cannot believe it was 20 years into my shaving &#x27;regime&#x27; before I found this product. It you use a proper man&#x27;s razor, or a straight razor you may find yourself in need of this product. If you use a cheap disposable razor you will need this product. If you use your girlfriend razor that she uses to shave her legs you will need this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor, buy this small, roll on product. Your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> Stop the bleeding right now!</li>
            <li> I use it to stop the bleeding and/or \\&quot;weeping\\&quot; of facial wounds or acne. It seals up great and makeup goes on without a hitch! Better than anything else on the market!</li>
            <li> First of all I ordered this late on friday and it showed on saturday.&lt;br /&gt;This came at just the right time for me. I cut myself badley with a personna blade in EJ razor. It was a bloodbath. My brush and face were completely brown from the blood mixing with lather.&lt;br /&gt;I tried my razor rock alum, and it did nothing. I tried it again by pressing razor rock on it firmly for about two minutes. No dice. I thought I was going to need stitches.&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried styptic pencil and it still didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;This little styptic roller stopped it immediately. Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> I was hoping with the advertized aloe and vitamin E that this wouldn&#x27;t sting so much as a traditional styptic pencil. It did sting, but not for long, however. It worked as well or better than a styptic pencil, though, when I hacked up my adams apple on my first DE razor attempt. Since then, I have only needed it once, and it did well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other complaints are minor: you have to put a little effort into getting the ball applicator wet and rollable, and if you bleed all over it, it gets kinda dirty, but it doesn&#x27;t affect its performance. Neither is enough to remove a star, and those complaints would apply (moreso) to a styptic pencil anyway.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims and glad that I added it into my personal care regime. FYI it dries white so be sure to wipe off the residue so you don&#x27;t walk around with it on your face like I did the first time I used it.</li>
