            <li>When using, all my after products really seem to work better.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and breakout easily.</li>
            <li>Feels refreshing and again doesn&#x27;t bother my adult acne.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the fridge in the summer for a refresh on super hot, humid days.</li>
            <li>The price was right.  </li>
            <li>I use it right after cleansing my face before putting moisturizer on.  </li>
            <li>skin is very dry and this makes my moisturizer(Atopalm) work even better!</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and clear now.</li>
            <li>and will stick to it for a long time:)</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and not terribly pricey.</li>
            <li>and I use all kinds of products and rarely re-purchase anything because I&#x27;m always trying something new.</li>
            <li>The bottle is glass and quite large.</li>
            <li>First time using power peptide but I am expecting high results.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I am glad that the products are free of fragrance, since I react strongly to artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li>also find that most of these products don&#x27;t require heavy application, so I only purchase replacements every 5-6 months.</li>
            <li>The glass 6 ounce bottle is a little inconvenient , but it seems to mist perfectly.</li>

            <li> Just be careful when traveling with the large glass bottle, I&#x27;ve had a few bottles caps come loose</li>
            <li> This is one of my long standing favorites by bioelements.</li>
            <li> I typically use a couple of sprays at a time and the bottle seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Skin feels softer and look less red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> and I have less flair ups when I use this regularly after a shower or face wash.</li>
            <li> I have combination, sensitive skin, prone to breakouts - in my late 30s.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years, since having a facial person use it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any breakouts due to the product.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably due to the castor oil in La P.</li>
            <li> The 2 oz travel size comes out a little harder .</li>

            <li> It leaves your face feeling a little tingling for a minute.  </li>
            <li> Tone and elasticity has improved, those annoying dark spots are significantly reduced, and my pores are tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I get quite a few complements about the appearance of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Actual Peptide listed here is outdated and needs to be UPDATED.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and was disappointed when it arrived in a broken box and most of the liquid gone.</li>
            <li> If this continues I will become annoyed and will let the seller know.</li>
            <li> Although I wish this product wasn&#x27;t so expensive for me</li>

            <li> Great toner especially for aging.  It leaves your face feeling a little tingling for a minute.  Feels refreshing and again doesn&#x27;t bother my adult acne. I don&#x27;t get any breakouts due to the product.  Bioelements products are the best for me.</li>
            <li> This is a nice toner!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this item.  My complexion has actually cleared!  I wish I had bought the travel size, too.  The bottle is glass and quite large.</li>
            <li> I use this after cleaning my face with Bioelements Flash Foam cleanser. Spray on face, pay a few times then add Bioelements Advanced C Complex. My face looks so much younger and I get quite a few complements about the appearance of my face. My wrinkles have diminished and no one can tell my age.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and was disappointed when it arrived in a broken box and most of the liquid gone. Amazon did a great job sending out a replacement as quickly as possible. I love this product and find that Amazon keeps an eye on the products I need and informs me when the product  is for sale.&lt;br /&gt;This product is so refreshing and helps my face before I put on the other bio-elements items I use.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for keeping your skin hydrated and youthful.  It is a maintenance beauty product, not a miracle cure. But, it does work!</li>
            <li> I have been using Bioelements products for just over a year, on the recommendation of a friend who is an esthetician, and have seen a notable change in my skin. Tone and elasticity has improved, those annoying dark spots are significantly reduced, and my pores are tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that the products are free of fragrance, since I react strongly to artificial fragrance. I use the toner morning and night, as well as the daytime moisturizer and the night cream, and intend to continue this regimen. I&#x27;m in my late sixties and am consistently taken for 10-15 years younger (it doesn&#x27;t hurt that I&#x27;ve always had a &amp;#34;baby-face&amp;#34; look, so I can&#x27;t say that everyone would have this kind of results) and am very happy with the product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that most of these products don&#x27;t require heavy application, so I only purchase replacements every 5-6 months. That makes them quite affordable for someone without a lot of money. All in all, this is excellent skincare at a reasonable cost. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> its great  try it you will love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year and absolutely love it.  After cleansing my face the mist is so refreshing and replenishing.  A definite part of my morning regimen!</li>
            <li> Great product! Package arrived very timely and nicely packaged.  I&#x27;ve been using the product and it sprays very nicely onto the face.  It gives my face a smooth and refreshed feeling.  It absorbs nicely into the skin.  I would definitely order again from this seller and this product.  Great experience.  Good price and the only peptide toner I could find at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I use Bioelements Power Peptide after every face washing, after my toner and before any serums or moisturizers.  I can tell a difference between using and not.  When using, all my after products really seem to work better.  It also provides a nice moist surface to make some products easier to apply, or at least use less and feel more incorporated into the skin.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> I always look for the lowest price with free shipping.  Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work out.  The price was right.  The box slightly damaged with the item in it.</li>
            <li> Actual Peptide listed here is outdated and needs to be UPDATED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.  I use it twice a day (morning and evening).  It&#x27;s a great product and always arrives very quickly after I place my order</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to every women with aging concerns. What a wonderful product…….I have bought this product for friends and also my doctor asked what happened to my wrinkles I had to admit it was this product ,thank you so much for such a wonderful discovery.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and brand. I use it before moisturizing with a cotton pad. I also lightly spray my face after&lt;br /&gt;applying makeup to set it.  Nice price, thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. ...gives nice moisture to my skin plus diminishes the wrinkles! I highly recommend it.  I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottle already. and will stick to it for a long time:)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years, since having a facial person use it.  This eliminates dryness after washing face and leaves my skin feeling dewy.  I love the smell of BioElements, as well.  Very clean...</li>
            <li> Petides ! this is it!! we all need it . Us twice a day.</li>
            <li> This has many many great ingredients! This rivals La Prairie cellular skin softening lotion. Not as emollient but that&#x27;s probably due to the castor oil in La P. so I&#x27;m happy with Bio Elements and it actually has anti-aging properties. La P has none.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very dry and this makes my moisturizer(Atopalm) work even better!</li>
            <li> Love this peptide. Highly recommend it ! The glass 6 ounce bottle is a little inconvenient , but it seems to mist perfectly. The 2 oz travel size comes out a little harder . I bought hr travel size to with hopes to use that and refill , but I find myself liking the way the glass bottle mists. Just be careful when traveling with the large glass bottle, I&#x27;ve had a few bottles caps come loose and it spills everywhere :( I now use the 2 oz for travel and just deal with the way it spritz.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It smells great and is such a good value in comparison to getting it at a salon.</li>
            <li> Can not say enough about this product. It is light, it is easy to use, refreshing, and it does a great job while smelling amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and ordered it on Amazon for the convenience and price.  This spray just makes your skin feel good!  I use it right after cleansing my face before putting moisturizer on.  I typically use a couple of sprays at a time and the bottle seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle because it hydrates my skin and makes it glow, and seems like it promotes healing as well. I&#x27;m an esthetician and I use all kinds of products and rarely re-purchase anything because I&#x27;m always trying something new. So for me to be on my 3rd bottle of something says a lot. Combined with peels, retinoids, vitamin C, and sunscreen, this stuff is anti-aging gold.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and breakout easily. I recently went through an hormone imbalance which cause major breakouts on my face. After the prescriptions the doctor gave (4 different ones) me stopped working I purchased this and bye bye breakouts. My skin is smooth and clear now. Although I wish this product wasn&#x27;t so expensive for me it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Bottle was packaged and legit, loved the price!  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my long standing favorites by bioelements. It tones and moisurizes and has peptides. Lasts a long time and not terribly pricey. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> First time using power peptide but I am expecting high results. The one complaint that I do have is that the spray pump is not working properly. I have to keep pumping before toner will spray. If this continues I will become annoyed and will let the seller know.</li>
            <li> I love all the bio elements products but this one in particular is very useful .I have used it as a toner and also to refresh my make up.</li>
            <li> My friend who is a wonderful esthetician who uses natural products, recommended this and I have used for a year or more. My skin is much less dry and flakey and for older skin that is a great news!! The spray mechanism is well made and lasts for the whole bottle use - a plus for me.</li>
            <li> love this peptide spray. I cleanse my face and spray it on immediately afterwards. Wonderful smell and very refreshing. I use this before applying my serums and facial oils. Will continue to use this in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> This product seems to lighten my skin and prep it for moisturizing. Skin feels softer and look less red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> I have combination, sensitive skin, prone to breakouts - in my late 30s. On my second bottle. Great stuff! Not sure if it&#x27;s a miracle worker, but I can say my skin tone is more even and I have less flair ups when I use this regularly after a shower or face wash. I keep it in the fridge in the summer for a refresh on super hot, humid days.</li>
