            <li>and I&#x27;m wearing shorts again :)</li>
            <li>Until one day I fell madly in love with  LA Skinny.</li>
            <li>Love the product and its results.  </li>
            <li>Surely their sales would be better.</li>
            <li>others and is priced better.  </li>
            <li>She has been using it 2 months now and has been pleased with her results.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but this product helped me overcome my shyness and become a more outgoing person.</li>
            <li>I am also fond of the fact that this product  was made using only the best ingredients, and nothing that would cause short-term or long-term effects to the body.</li>
            <li>So upset that I didn&#x27;t read these reviews before I bought it and even more upset at how deceptive this company is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken before and after pics and going to ask some close friends for their opinion to make sure</li>
            <li>For the most part I&#x27;ve applied it 2x a day.</li>
            <li>Def, worth a try!!</li>
            <li>it was super effective, i do not know what was holding me to buy this product.</li>
            <li>and I was really excited that this was working because I wasn&#x27;t really expecting this and am so happy with the results and myself.</li>
            <li>So far this had been great.</li>
            <li>I had purchased one for my mother and ended up keeping it when I began noticing it was working to give it a fair chance to really work.</li>
            <li>But im glad i bought this product, because of this, im not afraid to go to the beach, wear skinnier clothes, and improe my image!</li>
            <li>Have attempted other item before and this one has without a doubt turned out to be the best.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loved to try these new creams just so she can say they don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>After purchasing this I&#x27;ve seen very quick results.</li>
            <li>Every woman has cellulite, and if you don&#x27;t, well then lucky you!</li>
            <li>Very fresh and lightly hinted with citrus</li>
            <li>We originally split the cost</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been losing a lot of weight over the last 6 Months, It&#x27;s quite a successful adventure</li>
            <li>It is soothing to the skin, and leaves my skin feeling great after just a single application.</li>
            <li>I will give this cream one month and re-write a true review.</li>
            <li>and luckily it works like a treat</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it....</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to live in LA to love this product.</li>
            <li>but I actually went back and bought my own!!</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this product a week ago with reluctance due to how stubborn my cellulite is, but to my surprise this product has effectively reduced the appearance of cellulite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done w/ my first bottle and unless my eyes are playing tricks one me, this stuff is working!</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant smell unlike other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this like a few weeks ago and the result was great.</li>
            <li>It really made my skin smooth</li>
            <li>and i definite loving it till now.</li>
            <li>I say that this is worth a try not everything works for everyone but my motto is do not knock it until you try it.</li>
            <li>If they came out with this in a twice as large container and simply advertised it as the best moisturizer for dry winter skin ...</li>
            <li>(right under my butt) were smoother after using this product.</li>
            <li>thighs (right under my butt) were smoother after using this product.</li>

            <li>and it worked for me since I liked it so much she actually bought me some of it as a gift.</li>
            <li>Ive tried so many and this one actually works ive had great results in such a short period of time using It.</li>
            <li>For me, working out and eating healthy was not enough to get rid of persistent cellulite on my abdomen.</li>
            <li>I tried everything from hot yoga to pilates, I still never saw any changes to my belly...</li>
            <li>I bought this product the first time I walked into LaserAway.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife after seeing the amount of positive reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>I will not say that this cream will give you baby like skin again, let us face it, pass a certain age and that thought is history.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of applying and massaging LA Skinny onto my tummy, I noticed cellulite just disappear and the sides of my abdomen firm each day (buh-bye muffin top)!</li>
            <li>Exercise is not enough but using LA Skinny makes a huge difference ..  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really displeasing to have it.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>After 2 months of using this, I can finally say I feel comfortable about my legs.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>There is so much out there</li>
            <li>Overall, she has enjoyed the product immensely, and we&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>They applied it daily for about 2 weeks and after that they could see significant improvements in the treated areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will buy again and highly recommend this product for people who want fast results without the cost of surgery.</li>
            <li>, read some reviews and decided to get it, I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone whose been losing weight but also needs to get rid of all that cellulite</li>
            <li>She loves it and highly recommend it....</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>i was wondering if this product was worth it, i last</li>
            <li>After trying similar products she says this one works as good if not better then</li>
            <li>My girlfriend and I always try these new cellulite creams just so we can say they don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I am very surprised that this product works as well as it does.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easier than other products and actually works.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue using this, I don&#x27;t have much more weight to lose</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this product would work in the beginning but after a few weeks, it started paying off as I was seeing tremendous results!.</li>
            <li>I have patches of cellulite  on the back of my thighs, and no matter how much weight I lose it still remains.</li>
            <li>The cellulite is almost completely gone, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the result.</li>
            <li>i recommend this product because of its fast acting treatment and affordability.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I noticed the back of my thighs</li>
            <li>Sooo she was very surprised when I noticed the back of here</li>
            <li>Considering other comparable product reviews I definitely think its worth giving LA Skinny a chance.</li>
            <li>I lost weight over a 2 month period, and since then I&#x27;ve been feeling self conscious because of the way my body looked with all the dimples on my lower thighs and legs, I couldn&#x27;t even wear shorts in the summer as it was too embarrassing, this product was my last hope</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the new secret to getting bikini ready!!</li>

            <li> Sooo she was very surprised when I noticed the back of here</li>
            <li> Considering other comparable product reviews I definitely think its worth giving LA Skinny a chance.</li>
            <li> I lost weight over a 2 month period, and since then I&#x27;ve been feeling self conscious because of the way my body looked with all the dimples on my lower thighs and legs, I couldn&#x27;t even wear shorts in the summer as it was too embarrassing, this product was my last hope</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the new secret to getting bikini ready!!</li>
            <li> Almost every single one of these reviews was written during the same one-week period and the reviewers have no other product reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Although a bit skeptical as first, the price was decent enough for a gamble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for a good named product, as I&#x27;m usually skeptical about these types of creams, but this one did the trick and gave me and my gf&#x27;s smoother legs that feel skinnier.</li>

            <li> Yippy, ok ill try it!</li>
            <li> I had a bit of loose skin after loosing some weight</li>
            <li> It firms a tiny bit but not significantly.</li>
            <li> Though maybe that&#x27;s due to the 30 seconds per area your supposed to roughly massage the area...  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about all those other reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, don&#x27;t get suckered by those other reviews.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and naturally one is skeptical obout their results</li>
            <li> I had no side effects or at least none that I noticed.</li>

            <li> It took about a week or so for the effects to being, but now it seems like it is vanishing in thin air!</li>
            <li> If you can name it I have tried it: diets, supplements, crazy work outs, nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> It never accured to me that the ppl righting the reviews could be fake!</li>
            <li> , so I wasn&#x27;t too disappointed when the $@\\&quot;£ thing didn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Bought it almost two months ago and I&#x27;m disappointed!</li>

            <li> My girlfriend and I always try these new cellulite creams just so we can say they don&#x27;t work!Sooo I was very surprised when I noticed the back of my thighs (right under my butt) were smoother after using this product. We originally split the cost but I actually went back and bought my own!! I love it and highly recommend it....I love the name too!!</li>
            <li> I have had cellulite since my teens, and have tried everything to lose it. If you can name it I have tried it: diets, supplements, crazy work outs, nothing has worked. I was skeptical to say the least after a good friend recommended L.A. Skinny.  She urged and urged me to try it, I finally gave in. I am so happy that I did. I am proud to say after a month that I am already seeing incredible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should try L.A. Skinny!!!!!</li>
            <li> The name says it all - LA Skinny - and who doesn&#x27;t want to feel that? You don&#x27;t have to live in LA to love this product. Every woman has cellulite, and if you don&#x27;t, well then lucky you! But for the majority of women we constantly try and get rid of this one thing on the back of our thighs. I&#x27;m a sucker for a good named product, as I&#x27;m usually skeptical about these types of creams, but this one did the trick and gave me and my gf&#x27;s smoother legs that feel skinnier. Give it a try... its awesome!!</li>
            <li> So far this had been great. There has been less cellulite, and this is only my second time trying a product like this. Although a bit skeptical as first, the price was decent enough for a gamble. This is great, I won&#x27;t think twice about this product again.</li>
            <li> I lost weight over a 2 month period, and since then I&#x27;ve been feeling self conscious because of the way my body looked with all the dimples on my lower thighs and legs, I couldn&#x27;t even wear shorts in the summer as it was too embarrassing, this product was my last hope and luckily it works like a treat, I feel more confident after using this treatment, Would Recommend 100%</li>
            <li> I have patches of cellulite  on the back of my thighs, and no matter how much weight I lose it still remains. As a work from home mom, I am unable to afford the cost and downtime of surgery. I decided to purchase this product a week ago with reluctance due to how stubborn my cellulite is, but to my surprise this product has effectively reduced the appearance of cellulite! It also has a pleasant smell unlike other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again and highly recommend this product for people who want fast results without the cost of surgery.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the ingredients that are used in this product. Do your research and see if they are good yourself, or just believe me when I say this..! All of the ingredients used are top-of-the-line ingredients that are safe for you, and if you are trying to lose weight, you want to do whatever is safest..!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust this product, it will help you in so many ways and most importantly, it is safe for your body!</li>
            <li> Almost every single one of these reviews was written during the same one-week period and the reviewers have no other product reviews on Amazon. Its quite suspicious and definitely engenders distrust in the brand/company.</li>
            <li> Did a research before buying this item and thought i should give it a try. It came in within a week and i used ever since and i definite loving it till now. It helped me lose weight super fast and the best thing of it is that its safe to be used.</li>
            <li> Recently lost a lot of weight, have a LOT of cellulite left over. It&#x27;s really displeasing to have it. After purchasing this I&#x27;ve seen very quick results. It&#x27;s begun to reduce A LOT! and I love it, I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars for being so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for everything!</li>
            <li> The cellulite on my thighs stayed despite all kinds of treatment that I&#x27;ve tried! But that is when I found skinny. Skinny has been the only product that I&#x27;ve come across that actually shows signs of progress and is actually working! I am really excited to continue using skinny so that my cellulite will disappear!!</li>
            <li> Almost every woman has them and of those, all of you want them gone. I will not say that this cream will give you baby like skin again, let us face it, pass a certain age and that thought is history. But, we can still have beautiful skin by how we take care of ourselves. Bought this like a few weeks ago and the result was great. It really works. WIll recommend this to friends and coworkers</li>
            <li> After 2 months of using this, I can finally say I feel comfortable about my legs. The cellulite is almost completely gone, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the result. Just apply this regularly and you won&#x27;t have any issues at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been losing a lot of weight over the last 6 Months, It&#x27;s quite a successful adventure but no matter what I couldn&#x27;t get rid of all the cellulite! Like Most people I can&#x27;t afford expensive Surgery, so I looked around and I found this, read some reviews and decided to get it, I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone whose been losing weight but also needs to get rid of all that cellulite</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one thing to lose weight and quite another to lose the cellulite.  I purchased this product on the recommendation of a friend for a family member and the results have been phenomenal.  Outside of surgery, this is the best you will get. Just follow the directions(don&#x27;t skimp) and you will be pleased.  If you have a cellulite problem this is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! I ordered my L.A. Skinny last month and couldnt be happier! I have noticed my cellulite almost disappearing. It took about a week or so for the effects to being, but now it seems like it is vanishing in thin air! Great product, recommend to both men and women!</li>
            <li> I actually tried a friend of mines L.A. Skinny and it worked for me since I liked it so much she actually bought me some of it as a gift. I love my results and I wish that I could have had this sooner but I am glad that I have it now. I will continue to use it and hopefully I will continue to have results. I say that this is worth a try not everything works for everyone but my motto is do not knock it until you try it. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This works really well. I had cellulite on some spots of my body and I had trouble dealing with them. Within a week of using this product, the cellulite on my body was going away and I was really excited that this was working because I wasn&#x27;t really expecting this and am so happy with the results and myself.</li>
            <li> Wow! I am very surprised that this product works as well as it does. I gave this to a friend and they said that they noticed the difference only after a couple of weeks. It works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it! I had bought this recently for my girlfriend thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work. Turns out.. It did work! I&#x27;m gonna buy this product once again. I recommend just TRYING to use this at least 1 time! Its unbelievable !</li>
            <li> Its crap! I bought it on groupon and it&#x27;s just terrible... don&#x27;t waste your money. The 5 star ratings on here are BOGUS!</li>
            <li> I didnt believe in these products untill I saw my friend using the LA skinny and then ordering it myself. I&#x27;m certain that you wont regret buying it and would get good results out of it! Good luck</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about getting this, but at its cheap price, I decided, why not? After purchasing this for a family member, I have never seen something work so well, so I had to get another one for myself. I truly recommend this to everyone as it is a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this!&lt;br /&gt;so approximately 3 months ago my friend showed me this product she had been using after I asked about all the weight she had dropped and recommended it to me, I decided why not so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;In just 3 months I&#x27;ve already drop 23 pounds, 12 in the last 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;It is easier than other products and actually works.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue using this, I don&#x27;t have much more weight to lose but I wish to continue looking as slim as I do now.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about all those other reviews. I found that this worked for my cousin and still continues to work. I&#x27;ve recently bought some an found it to be effective too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, don&#x27;t get suckered by those other reviews. Try it out for yourself and see the results.</li>
            <li> i was wondering if this product was worth it, i last i bough it and i  want to say, it was super effective, i do not know what was holding me to buy this product. if someone is hesitating buy or not, i should say, You must buy it! This product need little time to see the difference and progress. It is getting better day by day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using LA Skinny for over a couple of months now and I&#x27;ve already lost a solid 3 inches on my waist and my inner thighs. I haven&#x27;t gained the weight back. I had no side effects or at least none that I noticed. I&#x27;m a lil embarrassed to share this but I haven&#x27;t worn shorts in over 3 years and I&#x27;m wearing shorts again :) Def, worth a try!!</li>
            <li> Bought it almost two months ago and I&#x27;m disappointed! Rip off I say. Since I saw no results I decided to use it as a moisturizer. Waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cure for that pesky cellulite on your tummy or back of thighs, LA Skinny is the answer! For me, working out and eating healthy was not enough to get rid of persistent cellulite on my abdomen. I tried everything from hot yoga to pilates, I still never saw any changes to my belly... Until one day I fell madly in love with  LA Skinny. After two weeks of applying and massaging LA Skinny onto my tummy, I noticed cellulite just disappear and the sides of my abdomen firm each day (buh-bye muffin top)! I recommend this product to everyone! It&#x27;s the new secret to getting bikini ready!!</li>
            <li> Does not work. These reviews are all BS. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Same person must have wrote them all. Smh.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing . Ive tried so many and this one actually works ive had great results in such a short period of time using It. It really made my skin smooth im gonna put all my friends onto it.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of loose skin after loosing some weight and I was looking for a product to tighten my skin. I didn&#x27;t think this product would work in the beginning but after a few weeks, it started paying off as I was seeing tremendous results!.</li>
            <li> I bought this product the first time I walked into LaserAway. I was skeptic about purchasing it, but once I started using it, I couldn&#x27;t stop.... I also started using Velashape with LA skinny and results have shown to work! LA skinny also made a perfect gift for my mom.</li>
            <li> Love the product and its results.  Exercise is not enough but using LA Skinny makes a huge difference ..  I stongly recommend it.. There is so much out there and naturally one is skeptical obout their results but LA Skinny does provide results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for 19.99 on groupon, because hey, why not? First of all, it smells AMAZING!!!! Very fresh and lightly hinted with citrus, so I wasn&#x27;t too disappointed when the $@\\&quot;£ thing didn&#x27;t work as advertised. Great all over body moisturizer, though pricey if you use it that way..  Some tightening... Though maybe that&#x27;s due to the 30 seconds per area your supposed to roughly massage the area...  If they came out with this in a twice as large container and simply advertised it as the best moisturizer for dry winter skin ... Surely their sales would be better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother to use and she has been very happy with the results.  After trying similar products she says this one works as good if not better then others and is priced better.  She has been using it 2 months now and has been pleased with her results.  Will be continuing to use this product</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved to try these new creams just so she can say they don&#x27;t work! Sooo she was very surprised when I noticed the back of here thighs (right under my butt) were smoother after using this product. She loves it and highly recommend it....she love the name too!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for a loved on. I bought this product for someone who was having problems with cellulite. They applied it daily for about 2 weeks and after that they could see significant improvements in the treated areas. This product gets rid of the cellulite but it&#x27;s biggest asset is the confidence they have gained back by using this product. Would highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I love this product. it helped me lose 20 pounds. i recommend this product because of its fast acting treatment and affordability. When I saw this product, i had my doubts. But im glad i bought this product, because of this, im not afraid to go to the beach, wear skinnier clothes, and improe my image! Not only that, but this product helped me overcome my shyness and become a more outgoing person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been utilizing this item for several weeks and I saw a huge cellulite diminishment, incredible item! Have attempted other item before and this one has without a doubt turned out to be the best. Obviously, my cellulite is not totally gone yet it looks so much better! I am so fulfilled by the results. I truly prescribe this item and I will unquestionably keep requesting this item!</li>
            <li> I love this product! This is one of the greatest moisturizers I have ever used. It is soothing to the skin, and leaves my skin feeling great after just a single application. It also makes my skin look and feel younger. I love this product and will recommend this to any of my friends!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after seeing the amount of positive reviews on this product. After a month of using this, she has seen reduced amount of cellulite. I am also fond of the fact that this product  was made using only the best ingredients, and nothing that would cause short-term or long-term effects to the body. Overall, she has enjoyed the product immensely, and we&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> Just bought this and could not see how someone could lose \\&quot;3 inches\\&quot; from this. It firms a tiny bit but not significantly. So upset that I didn&#x27;t read these reviews before I bought it and even more upset at how deceptive this company is.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product I read the reviews and everyone said it worked. Yippy, ok ill try it! It just arrived in the mail yesterday. It never accured to me that the ppl righting the reviews could be fake! Come on american people, we have enough problems. I will give this cream one month and re-write a true review.</li>
            <li> I had never tried using any creams to help w/ my cellulite so I was hopeful but nevertheless skeptic. I&#x27;m almost done w/ my first bottle and unless my eyes are playing tricks one me, this stuff is working! I&#x27;ve taken before and after pics and going to ask some close friends for their opinion to make sure lol. I had purchased one for my mother and ended up keeping it when I began noticing it was working to give it a fair chance to really work. For the most part I&#x27;ve applied it 2x a day. I&#x27;m also not exercising or eating any differently. Considering other comparable product reviews I definitely think its worth giving LA Skinny a chance.</li>
