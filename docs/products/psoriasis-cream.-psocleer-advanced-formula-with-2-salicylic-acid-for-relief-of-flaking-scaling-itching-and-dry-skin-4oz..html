            <li>/&gt;I was fortunate to receive this for trial and testing in exchange for an honest, 100 % opinion and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work so well for me as I need something more moisturising.</li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it has a nice clean odor.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>really effective.&lt;br /&gt;i purchased this with big discount in exchanged of my honest review and experience!</li>
            <li>It feels cool to the touch because my psoriasis is hot.</li>
            <li>This is a great cream that helps to clear or psoriasis rashes quiet well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived very fast and was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It looks and smells like regular non scented lotion, but the results tell me it&#x27;s more than just another lotion.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a product you should buy if you are in need for one .I am definitely glad to have this product to give to my daughter&#x27;s school librarian as it has been really helpful with her Psoriasis .</li>
            <li>Certainly does not do what it is promoted to do.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t enjoy walking around smelling like tar or something equally stinky.  </li>
            <li>first three days he can see the difference from the old cream he got!</li>
            <li>says it is very creamy and rubs right in without leaving her skin feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;She has only been using this for about 5 days</li>
            <li>I have a very good friend who suffers from psoriasis</li>
            <li>horribly so when i was offered this product during a promotion for my honest review I was happy to let her test it</li>
            <li>Seems to be no better than most creams.</li>
            <li>She mentioned that she had tried so many creams in the past</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helping to clear it up, along with some meds</li>
            <li>Another product that doesn&#x27;t help clear my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>but she wasnt expecting it to this early.</li>
            <li>but this is the only one that started working really well .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Paid full price not worth it  </li>
            <li>I am hoping with continued use it will be completely gone since it has started to clear up quiet well.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from psoriasis since my late teen&#x27;s, mostly on my elbows and my head.  </li>
            <li>I tend to stick to non scented, moisturizing lotions, and while they help a little bit they certainly are not the answer I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>

            <li> still waiting for it to work.....</li>
            <li> It works lika a dream. It keeps the skin softer and the scales are much less.  The best part is that&lt;br /&gt;it has a nice clean odor.</li>
            <li> I can feel this working on my psoriasis as soon as i put it on. It feels cool to the touch because my psoriasis is hot. It&#x27;s helping to clear it up, along with some meds I had ordered Vit K from you. Thank you!</li>
            <li> As expected. Another product that doesn&#x27;t help clear my psoriasis. Still searching for a good over the counter psoriasis medication.</li>
            <li> I received the package on time. The packaging is good and the product is pretty effective. I&#x27;m trying to wait supposed to be like a week to see how effective it is and for 2 days it works well. I definitely recommend it.</li>

            <li> I gave this Psoriasis cream to my daughter&#x27;s School Librarian as soon as I saw that she has Psoriasis. After 1 week , I saw her and she was so happy to inform me that this cream really worked well. She showed me her Psoriasis on her elbow that eventually is fading away . She mentioned that she had tried so many creams in the past but this is the only one that started working really well .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate to receive this for trial and testing in exchange for an honest, 100 % opinion and unbiased review. Definitely a product you should buy if you are in need for one .I am definitely glad to have this product to give to my daughter&#x27;s school librarian as it has been really helpful with her Psoriasis .

            <li> Very great cre works really well to soothe and clear psoriasis would recommend this great product I received I. Exchange for review</li>
            <li> This is a great cream that helps to clear or psoriasis rashes quiet well. It works very well and is easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or oily. It helps relieve the itch and flaking of psoriasis and it really does clear it up well making it not look so bad. I am hoping with continued use it will be completely gone since it has started to clear up quiet well. I received this product to share my honest thoughts and opinions about it.</li>
            <li> My wife had bad result after use it one week.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work so well for me as I need something more moisturising. Might suit someone who doesn&#x27;t have dry skin.</li>
            <li> For me it did not work but for others it may.</li>
            <li> Certainly does not do what it is promoted to do. I was so disappointed. I thought I had found the &amp;#34;perfect product&amp;#34;. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from psoriasis since my late teen&#x27;s, mostly on my elbows and my head.  Thankfully my hair covers my head, but my elbows can be downright embarrassing.  Last week at the doctor&#x27;s office the nurse thought I had hurt my elbow and that my psoriasis was scabs from wounds it was so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of a lot of psoriasis creams out there....they smell really bad and I don&#x27;t enjoy walking around smelling like tar or something equally stinky.  I tend to stick to non scented, moisturizing lotions, and while they help a little bit they certainly are not the answer I&#x27;m looking for.  I had never heard of PsoCleer, but after the doctor&#x27;s visit I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using it for 4 days, applying it in the morning and before bed and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.  The fact that I&#x27;m even seeing results after 4 days says volumes about the quality of this product.  But the absolute best part is that is has no scent whatsoever.  Finally, a product that works well and doesn&#x27;t make me cringe at the smell! It looks and smells like regular non scented lotion, but the results tell me it&#x27;s more than just another lotion.  Don&#x27;t take my word for it, I took pictures the day I got the PsoCleer before I applied, and another tonight before I wrote this and you can see the results yourself.  Now, if only they would make a shampoo that works just as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li> My husband been using this psoriasis cream for a week today! He&#x27;s been using cream that he bought in the store, but this cream has soothing effect he claimed!&lt;br /&gt;The first three days he can see the difference from the old cream he got! it moisten psoriasis and corrects the skin integrity! and relieves itchiness!&lt;br /&gt;Its really effective.&lt;br /&gt;i purchased this with big discount in exchanged of my honest review and experience!</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my psoriasis</li>
