            <li>good thing is it produces GREAT curls compared to regular clamp curlers.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Just wish it were more reliable.  </li>

            <li>but you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li>waves are deep and beautiful!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this Curling Iron</li>
            <li>not joking I&#x27;ve used it tooo many times</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m actually pleased that it creates a uniform wave/curl.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments...</li>
            <li>even from my nieces who I thought would know better than me on how to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways I love the curl this product produces.</li>
            <li>Love the way it curls my hair.</li>
            <li>so make sure you do not touch skin to the barrel and make sure you always wear the glove.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>, I am so happy with this purchase and will highly recommend to friends.</li>
            <li>she loved it so much that we ordered her one for her birthday!</li>
            <li>This thing get super hot!!!!</li>
            <li>Now, I am in love with the curls it makes and it is fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are nice tools but extremely hot so it&#x27;ll be better if they came with something to hold irons while doing hair...</li>
            <li>Great for creating deep waves and those \\&quot;bombshell\\&quot; sexy curls.</li>
            <li>I own many curling irons, but this is by far the most dificult to use.</li>
            <li>The curls last for days and are amazingly beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>and when I did her hair it looked fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and it makes it look shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have tried it on short hair and the curls don&#x27;t look as great.</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to style hair.  </li>
            <li>You can use this without the gloves but its very easy to get burned because it heats up very quckly</li>
            <li>It comes in an original le angelique box with the gloves and even two clips for sectioning your hair.  </li>
            <li>It gets pretty hot and I&#x27;ve burned my hands multiple times but the curls are awesome!</li>
            <li>I used this wand for special occations including my wedding.</li>
            <li>but the top is relatively straight.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and makes great curls that don&#x27;t go flat.  </li>
            <li>Other than the heat this iron works great</li>
            <li>WELL SPENT MONEY... and the shipping was amazing :))</li>
            <li>It gets your hair done really quickly is just a matter of getting used to the type of curling iron.</li>
            <li>It gets VERY hot</li>
            <li>Gets very hot, but the provided glove protects my hand.</li>
            <li>YES, it gets very hot</li>
            <li>This product was really worth the money it heats up so quickly..</li>
            <li>This is my second curling iron from this brand, the first one lasted a good 5 years before it stopped working.</li>
            <li>but the results are so worth it.</li>
            <li>I also have used the hot steam rollers and this product is far more better!!!:)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>not only last all day they are beautiful.</li>
            <li>like others say, it does get pretty hot!</li>
            <li>The curls last all day and even look nice after being slept on (a softer, more beachy look the second day).</li>
            <li>This works just as good for less money.</li>
            <li>but it makes a nice curl and they look natural and full and seem to last.</li>
            <li>Beautiful curls &amp; last very long.</li>
            <li>and I could not keep my fingers on the iron for more than a second without them getting so hot.</li>
            <li>I would not of bought this as her first iron</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t burn your ear ;)</li>
            <li>It definately gets hot.  </li>
            <li>Even with the glove on, it is still HOT.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I burnt my shoulder.</li>
            <li>You just need to section of the crown first.</li>
            <li>I like this curling iron better than the traditional ones.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot so wear the protective glove that comes with it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it wasn&#x27;t the easiest thing to use.</li>
            <li>The curling iron does get extremely hot</li>
            <li>This is my first curling wand</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and the curls are gorgeous,,, and really long lasting..</li>
            <li>on the mostly positive reviews of this item, it seems as though I got a lemon...</li>
            <li>, you can create diferent kinds of curls, the loose beachy kind, or the taylor swift tight ones, &amp; the best part of it, is that they last pretty long</li>
            <li>It seems to be very high quality</li>
            <li>- I would of bought one with a lower heat setting - but it has help up to the abuse to a teenager very well.</li>
            <li>I have the type of  straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls that much, but this one DOES make the trick to hold them.</li>
            <li>and therefore it curls hair really fast.</li>
            <li>Add a light hair spray and your hair will be wavy the next day.  </li>
            <li>and it really works well</li>
            <li>Hotter than heck but works very well.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s the main reason I used it that much</li>
            <li>Everything is brand new!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, when I went to use it for the first time, the heat lasted for only 10 minutes and then it went lukewarm on me and nothing would bring it up to a higher heat</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li>When I take my time and curl my hair in smaller sections the curls last for a week, of course they become loose but they are still good looking.  </li>
            <li>.this is the only one that workig right on my hair.love</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I learned, and how I keep discovering new ways of using it.</li>
            <li>Just be careful, it gets pretty hot using a clampless</li>
            <li>I have also order other different sizes of wands from Le Angelique because of this, but out of all this the one I use the most.</li>
            <li>I tried turning it off and unplugging it, but it just won&#x27;t get hot enough anymore after just 10 mins of use.&lt;br /&gt;Based</li>
            <li>It usually takes me 25-40 minutes to curl my hair depending on how curly I want it and how many sections I do.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money, but if you have trouble with it at first, don&#x27;t immediately give up, keep trying and you will get it.</li>
            <li>and I thought the shape of this would be better than the ones that seem to be upside down, but really this one is upside down and incredible awkward to use.</li>
            <li>It takes me only 10-15 minutes to do my hair which is fine, mid back length and layered.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone who really enjoys having different hair styles.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>My hair is also naturally wavy on the bottom</li>
            <li>When the curls fall my hair looks like a natural wave.</li>
            <li>that it comes with the professional hair clips and heat protecting glove.</li>
            <li>we have used so many curling irons to curl my daughters hair and her hair is always too heavy that the curls dont last.</li>
            <li>It is just way to hot and the glove they provide is not much help either.</li>
            <li>but with this one they stay for a long long time and they looks very pretty</li>
            <li>I was looking for my first wand and after reading the reviews on this product I took a chance and purchased this (pink one).</li>
            <li>i know a lot of people are interested in buying it but are not really sure if its real or not.</li>
            <li>I have long straight thin hair and this makes it look like I have so much more hair</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>I have only used it 6 times so far but</li>
            <li>I have super straight thin hair and this curling iron gives my hair life.  </li>
            <li>During the time I&#x27;ve had it, about 5 other friends have ordered it, just because they have seen my hair, and they always get surprinse of how much this cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a GREAT buy for the money and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>the first few times you use it</li>
            <li>As I pretty much expected (from reading all the other reviews)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Now, I am in love with the curls it makes and it is fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are nice tools but extremely hot so it&#x27;ll be better if they came with something to hold irons while doing hair...</li>
            <li> Great for creating deep waves and those \\&quot;bombshell\\&quot; sexy curls.</li>
            <li> I own many curling irons, but this is by far the most dificult to use.</li>
            <li> The curls last for days and are amazingly beautiful.  </li>
            <li> I have really fine hair</li>
            <li> and when I did her hair it looked fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and it makes it look shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried it on short hair and the curls don&#x27;t look as great.</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy to style hair.  </li>
            <li> You can use this without the gloves but its very easy to get burned because it heats up very quckly</li>
            <li> It comes in an original le angelique box with the gloves and even two clips for sectioning your hair.  </li>
            <li> It gets pretty hot and I&#x27;ve burned my hands multiple times but the curls are awesome!</li>
            <li> I used this wand for special occations including my wedding.</li>
            <li> but the top is relatively straight.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and makes great curls that don&#x27;t go flat.  </li>
            <li> Other than the heat this iron works great</li>
            <li> WELL SPENT MONEY... and the shipping was amazing :))</li>
            <li> It gets your hair done really quickly is just a matter of getting used to the type of curling iron.</li>
            <li> It gets VERY hot</li>
            <li> Gets very hot, but the provided glove protects my hand.</li>
            <li> YES, it gets very hot</li>
            <li> This product was really worth the money it heats up so quickly..</li>
            <li> This is my second curling iron from this brand, the first one lasted a good 5 years before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> but the results are so worth it.</li>
            <li> I also have used the hot steam rollers and this product is far more better!!!:)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> not only last all day they are beautiful.</li>
            <li> like others say, it does get pretty hot!</li>
            <li> The curls last all day and even look nice after being slept on (a softer, more beachy look the second day).</li>
            <li> This works just as good for less money.</li>
            <li> but it makes a nice curl and they look natural and full and seem to last.</li>
            <li> Beautiful curls &amp; last very long.</li>
            <li> and I could not keep my fingers on the iron for more than a second without them getting so hot.</li>
            <li> I would not of bought this as her first iron</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t burn your ear ;)</li>
            <li> It definately gets hot.  </li>
            <li> Even with the glove on, it is still HOT.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I burnt my shoulder.</li>
            <li> You just need to section of the crown first.</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron better than the traditional ones.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot so wear the protective glove that comes with it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it wasn&#x27;t the easiest thing to use.</li>
            <li> The curling iron does get extremely hot</li>
            <li> This is my first curling wand</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and the curls are gorgeous,,, and really long lasting..</li>
            <li> on the mostly positive reviews of this item, it seems as though I got a lemon...</li>
            <li> , you can create diferent kinds of curls, the loose beachy kind, or the taylor swift tight ones, &amp; the best part of it, is that they last pretty long</li>
            <li> It seems to be very high quality</li>
            <li> - I would of bought one with a lower heat setting - but it has help up to the abuse to a teenager very well.</li>
            <li> I have the type of  straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls that much, but this one DOES make the trick to hold them.</li>
            <li> and therefore it curls hair really fast.</li>
            <li> Add a light hair spray and your hair will be wavy the next day.  </li>
            <li> and it really works well</li>
            <li> Hotter than heck but works very well.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s the main reason I used it that much</li>
            <li> Everything is brand new!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, when I went to use it for the first time, the heat lasted for only 10 minutes and then it went lukewarm on me and nothing would bring it up to a higher heat</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> When I take my time and curl my hair in smaller sections the curls last for a week, of course they become loose but they are still good looking.  </li>
            <li> .this is the only one that workig right on my hair.love</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I learned, and how I keep discovering new ways of using it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, it gets pretty hot using a clampless</li>
            <li> I have also order other different sizes of wands from Le Angelique because of this, but out of all this the one I use the most.</li>
            <li> I tried turning it off and unplugging it, but it just won&#x27;t get hot enough anymore after just 10 mins of use.&lt;br /&gt;Based</li>
            <li> It usually takes me 25-40 minutes to curl my hair depending on how curly I want it and how many sections I do.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money, but if you have trouble with it at first, don&#x27;t immediately give up, keep trying and you will get it.</li>
            <li> and I thought the shape of this would be better than the ones that seem to be upside down, but really this one is upside down and incredible awkward to use.</li>
            <li> It takes me only 10-15 minutes to do my hair which is fine, mid back length and layered.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone who really enjoys having different hair styles.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li> My hair is also naturally wavy on the bottom</li>
            <li> When the curls fall my hair looks like a natural wave.</li>
            <li> that it comes with the professional hair clips and heat protecting glove.</li>
            <li> we have used so many curling irons to curl my daughters hair and her hair is always too heavy that the curls dont last.</li>
            <li> It is just way to hot and the glove they provide is not much help either.</li>
            <li> but with this one they stay for a long long time and they looks very pretty</li>
            <li> I was looking for my first wand and after reading the reviews on this product I took a chance and purchased this (pink one).</li>
            <li> i know a lot of people are interested in buying it but are not really sure if its real or not.</li>
            <li> I have long straight thin hair and this makes it look like I have so much more hair</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> I have only used it 6 times so far but</li>
            <li> I have super straight thin hair and this curling iron gives my hair life.  </li>
            <li> During the time I&#x27;ve had it, about 5 other friends have ordered it, just because they have seen my hair, and they always get surprinse of how much this cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a GREAT buy for the money and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> the first few times you use it</li>
            <li> As I pretty much expected (from reading all the other reviews)</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint would be that even if I turn it on, the wiring/ cord has to be in the right alignment in order to stay on.  </li>
            <li> I would only recommend this for medium/ long hair.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone with thick or coarse hair because it might add too much curl and take forever to curl as well.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair</li>
            <li> The iron works Great!!The curls last a long time and take less time then using an iron with a clamp.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that to get my entire head done completely takes about 40-45 minutes because the wand requires you to use such small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> The only bad things about it is that it is VERY hot and will burn you if your not careful and even through the glove</li>
            <li> and it use to be impossible for my hair to hold a curl for more than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Only a slight learning curve in the beginning.</li>
            <li> and it also brings a heat glove for your hand and two petty pink clips to help you hold your hair up while you are in the process of curling your hair...</li>
            <li> Have spent time trying to learn to use with no real success.  </li>
            <li> So you have to be careful with that.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s why you have to be careful</li>
            <li> I would never buy this for a teenager or anyone else unless they were extremely skilled at using this - even then not sure I would order it - just way to dangerous.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has twice now barley touched this to her skin, once on her neck and other time</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but after using it a couple of times, I was amazed.</li>
            <li> Please be very careful though</li>
            <li> (I learned the hard way) if not used properly.  </li>
            <li> after a week i have it now down packed and use it like a pro.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and very thin</li>
            <li> ] dollars less than [...]</li>
            <li> It literally takes less than 30 seconds to heat up.</li>
            <li> and when I curled with another curling iron, it fell in less than an hour,</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re tight spiral curls.  </li>
            <li> When I received the iron, the box looked like it had been previously opened and a clip was missing from the two that were to be included.  </li>
            <li> it takes a little while to get used to</li>
            <li> It heats up in less than a minute and styles your hair in less than 10 seconds!</li>
            <li> but I caution you that you may end up with a few burns.</li>
            <li> The people saying that is hard to use, is really not!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> a piece of meat cooking - gross and dangerous.  </li>
            <li> Had no problems whatsoever with the delivery or the product... not yet at least...</li>
            <li> Still not entirely thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> Just know before you buy that if is unforgiving  - if you accidentally touch skin - it will leave a serious burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful using though cause it can burn you badly</li>
            <li> /&gt;dont get me wrong regualr curling irons do work well</li>
            <li> it may be difficult</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> If you are not happy with the curl, correction almost impossible.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching everywhere for this leangelique product and i finally found one.  Not only is this product [...] dollars less than [...] but it&#x27;s actually AUTHENTIC. i know a lot of people are interested in buying it but are not really sure if its real or not. But im telling you it is! It comes in an original le angelique box with the gloves and even two clips for sectioning your hair.  Everything is brand new! I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  Might even loook into purchasing the 25mm or the 1 inch later on. great product!</li>
            <li> i have very naturally curly hair but wanted the perfect kim kardashian curl look&lt;br /&gt;read many reviews on how to get her hair style and came across the clipless curler.&lt;br /&gt;ened up buying this one and im in love!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;dont get me wrong regualr curling irons do work well but with out the clip my curls come out perfect and i feel better looking. the first few times you use it it may be difficult you just have to figure out whats the best way to use it for yourself. after a week i have it now down packed and use it like a pro.&lt;br /&gt;i get so many compliments on my hair daily!!!&lt;br /&gt;i use curly sexy hair 24/7 curl activator on my hair before i use the curler and my curls last all day!!!</li>
            <li> If this iron had adjustable heat settings I would rate it 5 stars.  If you are a beginner at using the clipless curlers I would NOT buy this.  My daughter has twice now barley touched this to her skin, once on her neck and other time it hit her arm, and it has caused 3rd degree burns. I think it heats up to 450 so beware.  Her skin was actually stuck on the iron - sizzling -like a piece of meat cooking - gross and dangerous.  It is just way to hot and the glove they provide is not much help either. I tried to curl her hair and I was wearing the glove and I could not keep my fingers on the iron for more than a second without them getting so hot. I am going to order her another one today that has adjustable heat settings.  I would never buy this for a teenager or anyone else unless they were extremely skilled at using this - even then not sure I would order it - just way to dangerous.  Other than the heat this iron works great and when I did her hair it looked fantastic.  Just know before you buy that if is unforgiving  - if you accidentally touch skin - it will leave a serious burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - my daughter has been using this for about a year now and loves it.  She does not burn herself anymore.  If I had to do it over again I would not of bought this as her first iron - I would of bought one with a lower heat setting - but it has help up to the abuse to a teenager very well.</li>
            <li> i love this cruling iron.i have 3 different cruling cruling iron .this is the only one that workig right on my hair.love it.i strongly suggest this cruling iron.works wonderful.</li>
            <li> Had no problems whatsoever with the delivery or the product... not yet at least... but you get a lifetime warranty anyways :)&lt;br /&gt; Comes with the glove already so no need to purchase it. Heats up quickly and the curls are gorgeous,,, and really long lasting.. I also have used the hot steam rollers and this product is far more better!!!:)&lt;br /&gt; Totally a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter and it works wonderfully.  It gets VERY hot so you have to take your time but the results are so worth it.</li>
            <li> This product was really worth the money it heats up so quickly.. N the curls that your hair receives is AMAZING ..... and it also brings a heat glove for your hand and two petty pink clips to help you hold your hair up while you are in the process of curling your hair... WELL SPENT MONEY... and the shipping was amazing :))</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint would be that even if I turn it on, the wiring/ cord has to be in the right alignment in order to stay on.  I find myself having to twist and turn the curler in order for it to stay on, switching the on/off button repeatedly to try to get a good electrical connection.  Such a pain!!  It might be because I bought it back in 2009.  If you have electrical difficulty, don&#x27;t hesitate to contact the seller immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is it produces GREAT curls compared to regular clamp curlers.  They&#x27;re tight spiral curls.  I love it.  I think that it looks best when you volumize your hair and either A) curl the bottom 3/4 length of your entire head or) curl like 25-50% of your strands, interspersed evenly over and under layers.  Just be careful, it gets pretty hot using a clampless curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it were more reliable.  :/</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS INVERTED CURLING IRON!!!!  The price is an amazing deal for this excellent product.  I would recommend it for anyone who really enjoys having different hair styles.  The curls last for days and are amazingly beautiful.  It gives your hair a wonderful spiral look.  All women should have one of these!</li>
            <li> This iron came with gloves and clips for a great price.The iron works Great!!The curls last a long time and take less time then using an iron with a clamp.Just don&#x27;t burn your ear ;)</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use.  Have spent time trying to learn to use with no real success.  Still not entirely thrilled with it.  It definately gets hot.  It definately curls.  Even with the glove on, it is still HOT.  If you are not happy with the curl, correction almost impossible.  I am not a hair stylist so maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to get it to do what I want. Bought a regular curling iron &amp; get the same style I want everytime.  If you don&#x27;t know how to use this- I would suggest thinking twice about it because you can get 2 regular curling irons for the same price. Meeting with my hair person to teach me how to use this.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and makes great curls that don&#x27;t go flat.  The only bad things about it is that it is VERY hot and will burn you if your not careful and even through the glove and I thought the shape of this would be better than the ones that seem to be upside down, but really this one is upside down and incredible awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I love this iron.  I can curl my hair using big sections and the curl last 2 days.  When I take my time and curl my hair in smaller sections the curls last for a week, of course they become loose but they are still good looking.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been using this style of curling wand for &gt;5 years and when my old one died I was so happy to find this one at a great price. Great for creating deep waves and those \\&quot;bombshell\\&quot; sexy curls. Wouldnt recommend for short hair. It&#x27;ll take some time to get used to but you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and definitely a good buy for the money!!  As I pretty much expected (from reading all the other reviews) it takes a little while to get used to but it makes a nice curl and they look natural and full and seem to last.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand!!! waves are deep and beautiful!!! BEWARE!!!! This thing get super hot!!!! Must wear protection on your hands if your doing your own hair.</li>
            <li> They are nice tools but extremely hot so it&#x27;ll be better if they came with something to hold irons while doing hair...</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand! It gets pretty hot and I&#x27;ve burned my hands multiple times but the curls are awesome! It literally takes less than 30 seconds to heat up. I used this for all the girls at a friends bachelorette party and they loved it! I have pretty long hair and it makes it look shiny and smooth. I have tried it on short hair and the curls don&#x27;t look as great. This could also be because I&#x27;m not used to styling short hair. I totally recommend this product to anyone but I caution you that you may end up with a few burns.</li>
            <li> love this! it comes with clips and heat glove - Good price!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product! we have used so many curling irons to curl my daughters hair and her hair is always too heavy that the curls dont last. I bought this product for my daughter to try and her curls not only last all day they are beautiful. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This definitely holds my curls all day.  It works great! It is quick and easy to style hair.  I got tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this Curling Iron this is definitely my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this wand in 2010! it still works like new.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not joking I&#x27;ve used it tooo many times and I&#x27;ve even discovered diferent ways of using it to create diferent kind of curls. This curling iron definetly need some tutoring if your not used to clipless wands, but that can be resolved really easy, YouTube! That&#x27;s how I learned, and how I keep discovering new ways of using it. The people saying that is hard to use, is really not! I think its easier than the ones that have a clip is just getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Just like others say, it does get pretty hot! So you have to be careful with that. I&#x27;ve probably burned my forehead once and one of my fingers about 3 times while using it, that&#x27;s why you have to be careful and I suggest to ALWAYS use the protetive glove and make sure you don&#x27;t lose it.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this wand is amazing, you can create diferent kinds of curls, the loose beachy kind, or the taylor swift tight ones, &amp; the best part of it, is that they last pretty long and I&#x27;m I have the type of  straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls that much, but this one DOES make the trick to hold them. I think that&#x27;s the main reason I used it that much, you can go party all night, sweat alot and still have gorgeous hair. This is a must for the ladies. During the time I&#x27;ve had it, about 5 other friends have ordered it, just because they have seen my hair, and they always get surprinse of how much this cost. I have also order other different sizes of wands from Le Angelique because of this, but out of all this the one I use the most.</li>
            <li> Great! Gets very hot, but the provided glove protects my hand. No issues, great curl, holds for two days!</li>
            <li> This hair product is awesome! It heats up in less than a minute and styles your hair in less than 10 seconds! the hair style lasts for days!</li>
            <li> I own many curling irons, but this is by far the most dificult to use. Maybe an instructional video would help. I burned myself numerous times when using it. I no longer use it.</li>
            <li> I love this! I get the curls I&#x27;ve been wanting every time I use it. My hair doesn&#x27;t like to hold curl, but it does with this. I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after I saw someone on youtube use it and I love it! I used this wand for special occations including my wedding.Everytime I curl my hair with this wand I get tons of compliments because of the type of curl it gives.You can use this without the gloves but its very easy to get burned because it heats up very quckly and therefore it curls hair really fast. I would only recommend this for medium/ long hair. I have long straight thin hair and this makes it look like I have so much more hair so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone with thick or coarse hair because it might add too much curl and take forever to curl as well.</li>
            <li> It is a great product once I figured out how to use it.</li>
            <li> Although I purchased mine at a local discount store I wanted to share my satisfaction with this wand. YES, it gets very hot so use all precaution necessary to prevent any burns. The first time I used it I burnt my shoulder. I have only used it 6 times so far but I&#x27;M IN LOVE with this wand!!! I too thought the shape would generate a bigger curl on the bottom but I&#x27;m actually pleased that it creates a uniform wave/curl. It&#x27;s a GREAT buy for the money and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Only a slight learning curve in the beginning. It takes me only 10-15 minutes to do my hair which is fine, mid back length and layered. You just need to section of the crown first. My hair is also naturally wavy on the bottom but the top is relatively straight. I don&#x27;t use ANY PRE-CURLING PRODUCTS and only a bit of hairspray to help keep fly-aways to a minimum. I get many compliments...even from my nieces who I thought would know better than me on how to use it. So now I&#x27;m gonna give them a lesson on how to use it. :D</li>
            <li> Last me years have compliment all the time I curl my hair</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing hair curler I have every used. I have really fine hair and it use to be impossible for my hair to hold a curl for more than 3 hours. However, this hair curler holds my curls all day. Its very easy to use.</li>
            <li> When I received the iron, the box looked like it had been previously opened and a clip was missing from the two that were to be included.  There was a scratch on the Teflon part of the wand and it made me think that it had been returned from another buyer.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, when I went to use it for the first time, the heat lasted for only 10 minutes and then it went lukewarm on me and nothing would bring it up to a higher heat (as you can&#x27;t adjust the heat setting).  I tried turning it off and unplugging it, but it just won&#x27;t get hot enough anymore after just 10 mins of use.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the mostly positive reviews of this item, it seems as though I got a lemon...</li>
            <li> This is my second curling iron from this brand, the first one lasted a good 5 years before it stopped working. I love the size for my medium-long hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and very thin and when I curled with another curling iron, it fell in less than an hour, but with this one they stay for a long long time and they looks very pretty and cute!!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely I recommend it</li>
            <li> it is a good curling iron, comes with the glove and two hair clips. It gets your hair done really quickly is just a matter of getting used to the type of curling iron. Use YOUR GLOVE especially if you are not used to this types of curling irons.  I like this curling iron better than the traditional ones.</li>
            <li> I love this product leaves hair looking great! Simple to use and I am so happy I bought this. I get compliments about the curls looking so nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.  I have super straight thin hair and this curling iron gives my hair life.  The curls bounce beautifully and stay.  Add a light hair spray and your hair will be wavy the next day.  Be careful using though cause it can burn you badly (I learned the hard way) if not used properly.  It takes some getting used to learning how to handle the curling iron in the proper direction and not burn yourself but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I was looking for my first wand and after reading the reviews on this product I took a chance and purchased this (pink one). I was skeptical at first but after using it a couple of times, I was amazed. The wand works wonders on my hair, I use it at night since I don&#x27;t have to time to do my hair in the mornings and it looks great in the mornings and even stays curly all day! I have thick straight hair and it really works well, I am so happy with this purchase and will highly recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I had this product for like 3 days &amp; I absolutely love it. It gets really hot so wear the protective glove that comes with it. I already burnt myself 2xs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I love the curl this product produces. I don&#x27;t have to re curl my hair for about 3 days. When the curls fall my hair looks like a natural wave. I totally recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: can&#x27;t control the heat setting</li>
            <li> I have this curling iron and we did my moms hair with it. she loved it so much that we ordered her one for her birthday! She loves it!</li>
            <li> Hotter than heck but works very well. Love the way it curls my hair. Please be very careful though, I gave myself a second degree burn!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron a couple of months ago and it came with a heat-resistant glove. The first time I used it, it wasn&#x27;t the easiest thing to use. The next time, it got easier and so on and so forth. Now, I am in love with the curls it makes and it is fairly easy to use. I get so many compliments on my hair and it makes me feel great. It is well worth the money, but if you have trouble with it at first, don&#x27;t immediately give up, keep trying and you will get it. The curling iron does get extremely hot so make sure you do not touch skin to the barrel and make sure you always wear the glove. I have brown hair and it is semi-fine but I have a lot of hair. It usually takes me 25-40 minutes to curl my hair depending on how curly I want it and how many sections I do. I highly recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I love it. Beautiful curls &amp; last very long.</li>
            <li> This is my first curling wand and I absolutely love it and found it very easy to get the hang of from the get go! It seems to be very high quality and I like that it comes with the professional hair clips and heat protecting glove. The glove serves its purpose well-I have never been burned by the device. The curls last all day and even look nice after being slept on (a softer, more beachy look the second day). My only complaint is that to get my entire head done completely takes about 40-45 minutes because the wand requires you to use such small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected! Love it. I had one before and it was a diff brand. This works just as good for less money.</li>
