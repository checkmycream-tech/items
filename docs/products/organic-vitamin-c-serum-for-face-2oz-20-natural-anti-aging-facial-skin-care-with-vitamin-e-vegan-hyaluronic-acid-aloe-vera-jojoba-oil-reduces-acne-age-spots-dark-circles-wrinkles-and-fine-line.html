            <li>ever so quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I loved how it felt in my skin as soon as I tried for the first time; the smell is very pleasant and not overpowering.</li>

            <li>The smell is alright, very light.</li>
            <li>put it on at night and my face was very Smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li>This stuff feels very light.</li>
            <li>If you use Vitamin C Serums I would give this one a try for sure.  </li>
            <li>More of a nourished feeling.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My face seem more radiant than before after using the product.</li>
            <li>I love this serum because it makes my skin healthy and toned.</li>

            <li>I love this serum ...</li>
            <li>but I love the way my skin feels after using it.</li>

            <li>I received this for free in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Planning to order more.</li>

            <li>but this one smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>I had many sun spot and discoloration that&#x27;s associated with my freckles.</li>
            <li>LOVE the way my face feels...</li>
            <li>I use the serum for dryness and irritation and just love it.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free and vegan!</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the method for applying it, and more often then not find myself skipping this step in my get ready routine because it doesn&#x27;t do anything all that great.</li>
            <li>Shopping around, I stumbled on this serum by Healthy Wiser on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I will leave more review in transit:)</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful treatment serum and at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I want to be &amp;#34;Forever 27.&amp;#34; Brains, class and SKIN! &#x3D;)&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>so... this is not a serum its more like water than a glossy thicker liquid.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results and</li>
            <li>This serum is okay.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of reducing fine lines and wrinkles, has a pleasant fragrance, and is relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly, it is as described, has a great fresh smell.</li>
            <li>this product is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;i am loving it really:) thank you!</li>
            <li>Seems this economically priced serum is doing more for my skin than many of the $75 (and up!)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this brand, and I&#x27;ve found it is a wonderful Anti aging product and has high quality organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Excited to continue using it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super thrilled about.</li>
            <li>IS MORE LIGHT.</li>
            <li>The reviews were good and the price was reasonable</li>
            <li>I had purchased another brand of serum and really liked it, almost out I was ready to purchase another on Amazon when I saw Healthy Wiser Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>So easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and feels like silk.</li>
            <li>It also has a strong citrus scent to it, which I don&#x27;t mind, but someone else</li>
            <li>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way for truly good products to differentiate themselves from the pack, when reviews are both the main basis for evaluating claims as well as easily manipulable.</li>
            <li>Healthy Wiser was very prompt and kind with everything.</li>
            <li>the results are pretty nice.</li>
            <li>It has helped diminish fine wrinkles and has evened out my skin.</li>
            <li>Best of all, the serum improved the texture of my skin and eased up the discoloration of the remaining sun spots ever so slightly.</li>
            <li>I love the soothing feeling and quick absorption of this serum.</li>
            <li>It was on sale, great deal, I hope I can afford it at its regular price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that this problem is uniquely relevant ro</li>
            <li>So light and the citrus fragrant.</li>
            <li>actually today my mother commented that my skin looked really great.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li>The texture of my skin is now silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>But like I said, once I finish the bottle and see that it&#x27;s keeping up the good work I will change my rating and possibly order more of this product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>Fabulous product, I have been using for one month and see a significant lightening in my sun spots and pigmentations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of natural products and this serum on my list!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves pleasant feeling on skin, smells good</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft, but doesn&#x27;t do much else, still a great product.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>I love it so much, it&#x27;s so nourashing!</li>
            <li>but i went from loving it to looking for a new product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the benifits so far:)</li>
            <li>It smells citrus-y and is super light.</li>
            <li>I also am a skin product junkie and have used and tried many products, from drugstore to very high end.  </li>
            <li>I am nit sure how often to use it or how much.</li>
            <li>My face always looks rejuvenized after a good night&#x27;s rest, and in the morning if I need extra moisture/help.</li>
            <li>Take some time to really help it absorb into your skin and get some blood flowing :)</li>
            <li>I can only say good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s Pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean, I like it....smooth.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best stuff!!!</li>
            <li>This product is soothing to the skin and absorbs quickly with no residue.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is so light-weight and mild on the skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a greasy feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every so often I run across a merchant or site that I feel are extraordinary and this seller is one of them.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly in sealed container.</li>
            <li>After a mild laser post-op, my dermatologist recommended adding a Vitamin C serum to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li>you so much Healthy Wiser Natural Skin Care!</li>
            <li>Really helpful!!</li>
            <li>Second bottle in and my face feels Fantastic!!</li>
            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>The aroma wasn&#x27;t strong for my taste, though it&#x27;s important to know I like naturally scented (by the ingredients, not perfume) products, as it&#x27;s part of the experience for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels much softer and I&#x27;ve started to notice a reduction in the fine wrinkles around my eyes and mouth that were beginning to form.</li>
            <li>Oh wow I am glad I did because I have brighter complection with pretty glow, with a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>Goes on nice, not tacky, no heavy scents, absorbs into skin very well.  </li>
            <li>Easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>However, it is quickly absorbed into your skin and after application my skin glows and feels smoother and tighter.</li>
            <li>but thats only because it leaves a kind of film on your face when it dries.</li>
            <li>My face felt soft the whole day.very nice product .</li>
            <li>Its light on the skin but provides the same outstanding results.</li>
            <li>My skin tone looks more even and it feels soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Skin is fresh and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Seeing as it isn&#x27;t doing anything, it probably isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>My skin felt like a lizard before I began using this serum, and now it&#x27;s soft to the touch, glows, and the breakouts have mostly subsided.  </li>
            <li>The product is very gentle and safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>out right</li>
            <li>This is non greesy and absorb right away into my face.</li>
            <li>Packed with vitamins you&#x27;ll feel a glow and shine right away.</li>
            <li>but they contacted me right away</li>
            <li>Love this product-still on first bottle, but nothing I dislike so far.</li>
            <li>This really worked wonders right away!</li>
            <li>but I wanna wait till I use the whole bottle before I give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a short time but my skin looks great and</li>
            <li>Im pretty sure it is just as good as the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and absorbs in very fast.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen the amazing results that other reviewers are raving about, but perhaps my skin is already in very good condition and there&#x27;s not much improvement to be done-I only have some forehead wrinkles that concern me.</li>
            <li>I hope other users are having better results than me!</li>
            <li>Second, the smell of this lovely product in my opinion is divine.  </li>
            <li>this product;this is the product that made me aware of the problem.</li>
            <li>It looks clearer, brighter, and feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This serum makes my face feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Even after I&#x27;ve had it on all day when I wash my face in the evening it still feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this serum and my mom tested it first.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I needed for my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>They are very customer oriented company!</li>
            <li>I especially like to use it under my eye and mix it with my moisturizer at times which seems to help even more.</li>
            <li>What is crucial in my case, is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel itchy like many face products i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Like it so much!</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews of similar products before purchasing and I&#x27;m glad I ended up buying this one.</li>
            <li>I think I did invested my money in something I really think works !  </li>
            <li>i do believe these reviews were all written by the company… just be aware</li>
            <li>Liked the old oil feel my last bottle had from Nov.</li>
            <li>On the first 4 bottles I used there wasn&#x27;t much of a smell</li>
            <li>but this last batch has a strong citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>I can see that my large pores have visibly tightened.</li>
            <li>The label says Vitamin C  and 20% in large writing.</li>
            <li>Never going back to other non effective brands again!</li>
            <li>skin is smoother on occasion but frown lines are still present and fine lines around my eyes are also still there...</li>
            <li>Certain spots on my face got very irritated and red/itchy.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in the deep creases between my eyebrows within a week of using this.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I noticed softer skin after about a week of using this product, but the truly amazing part is that it is helping with my few spots of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the reviews are from real purchasers.</li>
            <li>am giving this product 5 stars because it works very well.</li>
            <li>I like it that is not sticky and it slide on very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Once I found Vitamin C, I knew I had found something that really works.</li>
            <li>I give all the thanks to the vitamin c</li>
            <li>This really works with my skin&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
            <li>After applying the vitamin c serum last night I woke up feeling refreshed and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Really helped my skin and my face.</li>
            <li>Very misleading.</li>
            <li>On another note I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I am very oily skin</li>
            <li>I was really optimistic when I got this product like everyone I think because of the reviews...</li>
            <li>and this is just not enough moisture for me, but I do enjoy under my vitamin c lotion.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in my complexion or the brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum!</li>
            <li>This really could be just water with a vitamin dissolved at the bottom.</li>
            <li>A few things on this:&lt;br /&gt;-Overall, quite nice</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, on the plus side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon features many &amp;#34;brands&amp;#34; that aren&#x27;t sold anywhere else, and I&#x27;m beginning to think that the claims vs performance of many of these overwhelm - negatively - the same for the few good ones.</li>
            <li>I saw results pretty quickly, and my friends and family were all asking what I was doing differently.</li>
            <li>This product is soo amazing on your skin, highly recommend to woman or men who start to notice wrinkles on your skin, out of 6 different products used this is the ONE, noticed differences within a week, face feels lighter, brighter, and much younger.</li>
            <li>I started off using the product very inconsistently because I honestly did not expect much, but for the past two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day</li>
            <li>And it can be worn daily underneath the Elta MD Broad Spectrum sunblock plus makeup on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a week and a half, and so far I love it!  </li>
            <li>Recomended: If you have tired skin, expression lines, open pores, etc... well this serum works perfect, leaves my skin smooth, soft, close my pores, my fine lines are tight now, wow</li>
            <li>more than one person has made comments about how smooth and delicate my skin looks , which I never received those type of compliments before I started using this serum !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for the first time for about 3 weeks now and, thus far, I like the results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments about my skin, which feels like silk now instead of sand paper, with less lines.</li>
            <li>and I am loathe to put anything on my face especially during this hot hot summer.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>all the product does what it says and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>will highly recommended this to any one.</li>
            <li>I lean toward high end</li>
            <li>Also, my skin feels soft after using it - sometimes I&#x27;ll skip the moisturizer and go straight to the foundation primer.</li>
            <li>I rated this product 3 stars because so far it&#x27;s working really well</li>
            <li>I use this serum on my face and really like it so far.</li>
            <li>So far the product is gentle on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and it really has made a difference in my 40-something year old complexion.  </li>
            <li>not least, I noticed improvement the moment I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I noticed within a few day that my skin tone was much better, and my acne scars did lighten a bit.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for new Vitamin C products to try out for my skin.</li>
            <li>I am always looking to try new products</li>
            <li>On personal preference I wish it weren&#x27;t liquid, but more of a gel, because I feel like it&#x27;s harder to apply because of this.</li>
            <li>I have larger pores on my nose, and I havent noticed much in terms of the serum doing much to minimize those pores, and its been about a month.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived filled up to the rim and should last me at least 6 months if not more, so I&#x27;m really happy about that.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft and seems brighter also.</li>
            <li>This is a product that my (still) acne prone, (very) sensitive, (beginning) to wrinkle skin will respond well to.  </li>
            <li>I live in a wet, cool climate, so breakouts and dryness occur during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually more of a fan of harder chemical facial treatments, I tend to stay clear of &amp;#34;All Natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; ones</li>
            <li>the first night.my face felt oily the next morning.</li>
            <li>First, this company actually cares about it&#x27;s customers.  </li>
            <li>Immediately after using it for the first time, my face felt firmer, skin is smoother especially the lines on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Silky and soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delightfully surprised, and grateful (so so grateful!)</li>
            <li>After trying so many products to help with occasional acne and the dark spots that remain, I stumbled upon healthywiser.</li>
            <li>Delighted, as the dry heat and winter weather are always hard on my aging complexion.  </li>
            <li>I bought it 3 times already and every time I have same positive results.</li>
            <li>your skin will start to clear up.</li>
            <li>It has really improved my skin in the short time I have used it.</li>
            <li>I have tried a pleather of products.&lt;br /&gt;Avalon, Insta Natural, Radha Beauty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They said I look much younger than I really am.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and within two days all of my adult acne started to clear up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far thinner in consistency than any serum I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at the difference it makes.</li>
            <li>I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND ROSACEA</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling silky soft, unlike others which can be sticky or oily.</li>
            <li>Makes a 30 year old man look 24</li>
            <li>It really brightens your face and gives it that extra boost it needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 40 year old woman with severe sun spots and hyperpigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li>When you put it on overnight, be prepared to wake up with AMAZINGLY soft supple skin.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it has a lot of Organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a week-10 days, along with my fairly high quality moisturizer, and Retina A product, and have seen a marked improvement in my acne and, dare I say, skin texture, firmness, and overall quality!  </li>
            <li>I am not sure it does anything for fine lines</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used dozens of skincare products, mostly high priced lines from sephora such as ole Hendrickson, Claudelie, Peter Thomas Roth</li>
            <li>And this product put a major dent in fighting these spots!</li>
            <li>My skin which is always oily can finally be described as normal.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 50&#x27;s and my skin has become dull along with fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It is light and penetrates quickly, no oily residue!!  </li>
            <li>Also, the consistency is a bit watery, so you have to be careful to catch the product in your hand appropriately, otherwise it will spill, and boo-hoo, your product will be wasted.  </li>
            <li>You must have your skin damp before applying because it  uses the water to plump your skin up and thus make you appear a little younger, more refreshed, give you the appearance of decreased fine lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making any significant changes to my skin</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for about 10 days and have had more breakouts in that 10 days than in the past 5 years!</li>
            <li>My tissue appeared dry, fine lines were more apparent and little, irritating bumps began to reappear.  </li>
            <li>No change in moisture, or sensitivity, or just general wakefulness.</li>
            <li>But I could feel my face was soft a second</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d actually prefer a slightly more thick consistency anyway, simply because it feels so luxurious.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a scent, not a strong scent, but it does disappear once absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already noticed my skin feeling softer and hope to see more dramatic results with continued use.</li>
            <li>I noticed that within 1 use my face felt smoother and my face was not only clear but actually brighter too.</li>
            <li>At 70, nothing will be a miracle cure, but every little improvement is appreciated!</li>
            <li>It has became a major part of my daily routine!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early for me to confirm any long term use changes on my skin, but it gives me the filling of improvement with my day by day use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the high price tags don&#x27;t always mean I&#x27;m using a quality product, so, I decided to search through Amazon for highly rated serums.  </li>

            <li> I use the serum for dryness and irritation and just love it.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free and vegan!</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the method for applying it, and more often then not find myself skipping this step in my get ready routine because it doesn&#x27;t do anything all that great.</li>
            <li> Shopping around, I stumbled on this serum by Healthy Wiser on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I will leave more review in transit:)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful treatment serum and at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I want to be &amp;#34;Forever 27.&amp;#34; Brains, class and SKIN! &#x3D;)&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> so... this is not a serum its more like water than a glossy thicker liquid.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results and</li>
            <li> This serum is okay.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of reducing fine lines and wrinkles, has a pleasant fragrance, and is relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, it is as described, has a great fresh smell.</li>
            <li> this product is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;i am loving it really:) thank you!</li>
            <li> Seems this economically priced serum is doing more for my skin than many of the $75 (and up!)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this brand, and I&#x27;ve found it is a wonderful Anti aging product and has high quality organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excited to continue using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super thrilled about.</li>
            <li> IS MORE LIGHT.</li>
            <li> The reviews were good and the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> I had purchased another brand of serum and really liked it, almost out I was ready to purchase another on Amazon when I saw Healthy Wiser Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> So easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> easy to apply and feels like silk.</li>
            <li> It also has a strong citrus scent to it, which I don&#x27;t mind, but someone else</li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way for truly good products to differentiate themselves from the pack, when reviews are both the main basis for evaluating claims as well as easily manipulable.</li>
            <li> Healthy Wiser was very prompt and kind with everything.</li>
            <li> the results are pretty nice.</li>
            <li> It has helped diminish fine wrinkles and has evened out my skin.</li>
            <li> Best of all, the serum improved the texture of my skin and eased up the discoloration of the remaining sun spots ever so slightly.</li>
            <li> I love the soothing feeling and quick absorption of this serum.</li>
            <li> It was on sale, great deal, I hope I can afford it at its regular price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that this problem is uniquely relevant ro</li>
            <li> So light and the citrus fragrant.</li>
            <li> actually today my mother commented that my skin looked really great.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li> The texture of my skin is now silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Non-greasy and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> But like I said, once I finish the bottle and see that it&#x27;s keeping up the good work I will change my rating and possibly order more of this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, I have been using for one month and see a significant lightening in my sun spots and pigmentations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of natural products and this serum on my list!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves pleasant feeling on skin, smells good</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft, but doesn&#x27;t do much else, still a great product.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> I love it so much, it&#x27;s so nourashing!</li>
            <li> but i went from loving it to looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the benifits so far:)</li>
            <li> It smells citrus-y and is super light.</li>
            <li> I also am a skin product junkie and have used and tried many products, from drugstore to very high end.  </li>
            <li> I am nit sure how often to use it or how much.</li>
            <li> My face always looks rejuvenized after a good night&#x27;s rest, and in the morning if I need extra moisture/help.</li>
            <li> Take some time to really help it absorb into your skin and get some blood flowing :)</li>
            <li> I can only say good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have to say it&#x27;s Pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean, I like it....smooth.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This product is soothing to the skin and absorbs quickly with no residue.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream is so light-weight and mild on the skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a greasy feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every so often I run across a merchant or site that I feel are extraordinary and this seller is one of them.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly in sealed container.</li>
            <li> After a mild laser post-op, my dermatologist recommended adding a Vitamin C serum to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li> you so much Healthy Wiser Natural Skin Care!</li>
            <li> Really helpful!!</li>
            <li> Second bottle in and my face feels Fantastic!!</li>
            <li> thanks!!</li>
            <li> The aroma wasn&#x27;t strong for my taste, though it&#x27;s important to know I like naturally scented (by the ingredients, not perfume) products, as it&#x27;s part of the experience for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels much softer and I&#x27;ve started to notice a reduction in the fine wrinkles around my eyes and mouth that were beginning to form.</li>
            <li> Oh wow I am glad I did because I have brighter complection with pretty glow, with a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> Goes on nice, not tacky, no heavy scents, absorbs into skin very well.  </li>
            <li> Easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> However, it is quickly absorbed into your skin and after application my skin glows and feels smoother and tighter.</li>
            <li> but thats only because it leaves a kind of film on your face when it dries.</li>
            <li> My face felt soft the whole day.very nice product .</li>
            <li> Its light on the skin but provides the same outstanding results.</li>
            <li> My skin tone looks more even and it feels soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Skin is fresh and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Seeing as it isn&#x27;t doing anything, it probably isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> My skin felt like a lizard before I began using this serum, and now it&#x27;s soft to the touch, glows, and the breakouts have mostly subsided.  </li>
            <li> The product is very gentle and safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> out right</li>
            <li> This is non greesy and absorb right away into my face.</li>
            <li> Packed with vitamins you&#x27;ll feel a glow and shine right away.</li>
            <li> but they contacted me right away</li>
            <li> Love this product-still on first bottle, but nothing I dislike so far.</li>
            <li> This really worked wonders right away!</li>
            <li> but I wanna wait till I use the whole bottle before I give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a short time but my skin looks great and</li>
            <li> Im pretty sure it is just as good as the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and absorbs in very fast.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the amazing results that other reviewers are raving about, but perhaps my skin is already in very good condition and there&#x27;s not much improvement to be done-I only have some forehead wrinkles that concern me.</li>
            <li> I hope other users are having better results than me!</li>
            <li> Second, the smell of this lovely product in my opinion is divine.  </li>
            <li> this product;this is the product that made me aware of the problem.</li>
            <li> It looks clearer, brighter, and feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This serum makes my face feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Even after I&#x27;ve had it on all day when I wash my face in the evening it still feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum and my mom tested it first.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I needed for my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> They are very customer oriented company!</li>
            <li> I especially like to use it under my eye and mix it with my moisturizer at times which seems to help even more.</li>
            <li> What is crucial in my case, is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel itchy like many face products i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Like it so much!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews of similar products before purchasing and I&#x27;m glad I ended up buying this one.</li>
            <li> I think I did invested my money in something I really think works !  </li>
            <li> i do believe these reviews were all written by the company… just be aware</li>
            <li> Liked the old oil feel my last bottle had from Nov.</li>
            <li> On the first 4 bottles I used there wasn&#x27;t much of a smell</li>
            <li> but this last batch has a strong citrus smell.  </li>
            <li> I can see that my large pores have visibly tightened.</li>
            <li> The label says Vitamin C  and 20% in large writing.</li>
            <li> Never going back to other non effective brands again!</li>
            <li> skin is smoother on occasion but frown lines are still present and fine lines around my eyes are also still there...</li>
            <li> Certain spots on my face got very irritated and red/itchy.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in the deep creases between my eyebrows within a week of using this.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I noticed softer skin after about a week of using this product, but the truly amazing part is that it is helping with my few spots of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the reviews are from real purchasers.</li>
            <li> am giving this product 5 stars because it works very well.</li>
            <li> I like it that is not sticky and it slide on very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Once I found Vitamin C, I knew I had found something that really works.</li>
            <li> I give all the thanks to the vitamin c</li>
            <li> This really works with my skin&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
            <li> After applying the vitamin c serum last night I woke up feeling refreshed and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Really helped my skin and my face.</li>
            <li> Very misleading.</li>
            <li> On another note I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li> I am very oily skin</li>
            <li> I was really optimistic when I got this product like everyone I think because of the reviews...</li>
            <li> and this is just not enough moisture for me, but I do enjoy under my vitamin c lotion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in my complexion or the brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum!</li>
            <li> This really could be just water with a vitamin dissolved at the bottom.</li>
            <li> A few things on this:&lt;br /&gt;-Overall, quite nice</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, on the plus side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon features many &amp;#34;brands&amp;#34; that aren&#x27;t sold anywhere else, and I&#x27;m beginning to think that the claims vs performance of many of these overwhelm - negatively - the same for the few good ones.</li>
            <li> I saw results pretty quickly, and my friends and family were all asking what I was doing differently.</li>
            <li> This product is soo amazing on your skin, highly recommend to woman or men who start to notice wrinkles on your skin, out of 6 different products used this is the ONE, noticed differences within a week, face feels lighter, brighter, and much younger.</li>
            <li> I started off using the product very inconsistently because I honestly did not expect much, but for the past two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day</li>
            <li> And it can be worn daily underneath the Elta MD Broad Spectrum sunblock plus makeup on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a week and a half, and so far I love it!  </li>
            <li> Recomended: If you have tired skin, expression lines, open pores, etc... well this serum works perfect, leaves my skin smooth, soft, close my pores, my fine lines are tight now, wow</li>
            <li> more than one person has made comments about how smooth and delicate my skin looks , which I never received those type of compliments before I started using this serum !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for the first time for about 3 weeks now and, thus far, I like the results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments about my skin, which feels like silk now instead of sand paper, with less lines.</li>
            <li> and I am loathe to put anything on my face especially during this hot hot summer.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> all the product does what it says and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> will highly recommended this to any one.</li>
            <li> I lean toward high end</li>
            <li> Also, my skin feels soft after using it - sometimes I&#x27;ll skip the moisturizer and go straight to the foundation primer.</li>
            <li> I rated this product 3 stars because so far it&#x27;s working really well</li>
            <li> I use this serum on my face and really like it so far.</li>
            <li> So far the product is gentle on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and it really has made a difference in my 40-something year old complexion.  </li>
            <li> not least, I noticed improvement the moment I put it on.  </li>
            <li> I noticed within a few day that my skin tone was much better, and my acne scars did lighten a bit.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for new Vitamin C products to try out for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am always looking to try new products</li>
            <li> On personal preference I wish it weren&#x27;t liquid, but more of a gel, because I feel like it&#x27;s harder to apply because of this.</li>
            <li> I have larger pores on my nose, and I havent noticed much in terms of the serum doing much to minimize those pores, and its been about a month.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived filled up to the rim and should last me at least 6 months if not more, so I&#x27;m really happy about that.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft and seems brighter also.</li>
            <li> This is a product that my (still) acne prone, (very) sensitive, (beginning) to wrinkle skin will respond well to.  </li>
            <li> I live in a wet, cool climate, so breakouts and dryness occur during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually more of a fan of harder chemical facial treatments, I tend to stay clear of &amp;#34;All Natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; ones</li>
            <li> the first night.my face felt oily the next morning.</li>
            <li> First, this company actually cares about it&#x27;s customers.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after using it for the first time, my face felt firmer, skin is smoother especially the lines on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Silky and soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delightfully surprised, and grateful (so so grateful!)</li>
            <li> After trying so many products to help with occasional acne and the dark spots that remain, I stumbled upon healthywiser.</li>
            <li> Delighted, as the dry heat and winter weather are always hard on my aging complexion.  </li>
            <li> I bought it 3 times already and every time I have same positive results.</li>
            <li> your skin will start to clear up.</li>
            <li> It has really improved my skin in the short time I have used it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a pleather of products.&lt;br /&gt;Avalon, Insta Natural, Radha Beauty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They said I look much younger than I really am.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and within two days all of my adult acne started to clear up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far thinner in consistency than any serum I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the difference it makes.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND ROSACEA</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling silky soft, unlike others which can be sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> Makes a 30 year old man look 24</li>
            <li> It really brightens your face and gives it that extra boost it needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old woman with severe sun spots and hyperpigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li> When you put it on overnight, be prepared to wake up with AMAZINGLY soft supple skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it has a lot of Organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a week-10 days, along with my fairly high quality moisturizer, and Retina A product, and have seen a marked improvement in my acne and, dare I say, skin texture, firmness, and overall quality!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure it does anything for fine lines</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of skincare products, mostly high priced lines from sephora such as ole Hendrickson, Claudelie, Peter Thomas Roth</li>
            <li> And this product put a major dent in fighting these spots!</li>
            <li> My skin which is always oily can finally be described as normal.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s and my skin has become dull along with fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It is light and penetrates quickly, no oily residue!!  </li>
            <li> Also, the consistency is a bit watery, so you have to be careful to catch the product in your hand appropriately, otherwise it will spill, and boo-hoo, your product will be wasted.  </li>
            <li> You must have your skin damp before applying because it  uses the water to plump your skin up and thus make you appear a little younger, more refreshed, give you the appearance of decreased fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making any significant changes to my skin</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for about 10 days and have had more breakouts in that 10 days than in the past 5 years!</li>
            <li> My tissue appeared dry, fine lines were more apparent and little, irritating bumps began to reappear.  </li>
            <li> No change in moisture, or sensitivity, or just general wakefulness.</li>
            <li> But I could feel my face was soft a second</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually prefer a slightly more thick consistency anyway, simply because it feels so luxurious.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a scent, not a strong scent, but it does disappear once absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already noticed my skin feeling softer and hope to see more dramatic results with continued use.</li>
            <li> I noticed that within 1 use my face felt smoother and my face was not only clear but actually brighter too.</li>
            <li> At 70, nothing will be a miracle cure, but every little improvement is appreciated!</li>
            <li> It has became a major part of my daily routine!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early for me to confirm any long term use changes on my skin, but it gives me the filling of improvement with my day by day use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the high price tags don&#x27;t always mean I&#x27;m using a quality product, so, I decided to search through Amazon for highly rated serums.  </li>
            <li> and then my face becomes super tight for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few new products recently and this is the only one that has provided a noticeable improvement to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Like many customers before me, I was slightly skeptical but figured what the heck, the price is fairly moderate compared to the going rates by other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dry sun damaged hands are beginning to look younger and the texture is improving.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have not seen any improvement in the appearance of fine lines</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as a serum should be, but it is still thick enough to where it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> so well, i have tried everything (cheap, expensive products, etc)</li>
            <li> Its not actually tightening your face, not that I expected it to.</li>
            <li> so I am extra careful to choose any cosmetic.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had reactions to vitamin C serums in the past.</li>
            <li> factor that I&#x27;ve gotten from several other serums</li>
            <li> I can feel it immediately tightening my skin, but not that dry, just-washed-with-soap tightness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry skin.</li>
            <li> I mean, just a bit more viscous than water, really thin and runny.</li>
            <li> It absorbs a bit slow, but it does absorb unlike other serums I have tried, which was a real turn off.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the serum very long yet, but I had to post about the seller!</li>
            <li> It feels so relaxing when I put it on at night, and in the morning my skin (especially the area under my eyes) looks a lot less scary/tired.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any breakouts (normal nor cystic acne) from this serum, which was my initial concern before purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and already notice positive results as a reduction in small lines around my eyes, decreased redness and improvement in general skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not doing anything.  </li>
            <li> was only using it for a few days when people started complimenting my skin.</li>
            <li> I apply a few drops on my face but don&#x27;t see the different of skin.</li>
            <li> but after 3 weeks of using it I have seen no real difference...</li>
            <li> About two weeks ago, I ran out of this product, and about a week later, my skin appeared to have aged a few years.  </li>
            <li> I am not certain I will repurchase.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other serums (some quite pricey)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d add a smell to a simple product like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure about any other benefits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and just putting on concealer and cover up.</li>
            <li> but I will continue to use it for its other benefits.</li>
            <li> I was never interested in using C serum products until I used Estee Lauder overnight recovery serum.</li>
            <li> Having said that it seems to last a while even in a small bottle.</li>
            <li> just need 5 drops mix with a little water and leave to dry for a while before using your face</li>
            <li> It is a dropper... Not real easy to apply.</li>
            <li> If your face is too wet when you apply it you will get a slightly slimy feeling to your face, also throughout the day I feel like I can feel this pulling out of my pores almost giving a shine to my face or a wetness, it&#x27;s odd.</li>
            <li> Dark spots are visibly lighter and complexion is brighter.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smell like a wierd citrus not a fresh citrus you would expect.</li>
            <li> (At least for me, with the simple routine I use.)</li>
            <li> Forced to reduce my beauty budget, I decided to try this product with low expectations.  </li>
            <li> lines have become less noticeable and skin does look healthier.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I have has occasional breakouts and trouble spots but have not had any since using this!</li>
            <li> I am a harsh critic and have tried all kinds of vitamin C serums from Obagi, Murad and on down the line.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots are fading and my skin is smoother and looks noticeably brighter!</li>
            <li> so I was a little leary about putting it on my face</li>
            <li> It smelss a little medicinal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the eastiest product to apply and I do end up with a few drops on my countertop.  </li>
            <li> I has been used just for few weeks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skins tone and texture in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> what your pours were missing.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it to see it may get a result after a few months maybe.</li>
            <li> I cant believe the money that I have wasted trying to get the results that I have gotten in just 2 weeks that I have been using this vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> Imagine a few months down!!</li>
            <li> I had a few small acne scars which have lightened as well as some sun damage.  </li>
            <li> I see very little to no change.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it works, long-term, but in a couple of weeks, it seems to have hydrated my skin.</li>
            <li> Every night before bed I would usually apply vitamin C caplets to my skin that are sticky and clog my pores.</li>
            <li> serums I&#x27;ve used in the past.    </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell</li>
            <li> When it came late (not their fault)</li>
            <li> at least show some change...</li>
            <li> With continuos use, the wrinkles would slowly diminish.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I bought it to help with my dull tired skin.  </li>
            <li> The serum I usually use is really expensive</li>
            <li> and I hate when people tell me I look tired because of the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I received a bad batch or if the formula was changed</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of water, which makes it difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of any beauty product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that the plethora of beaming reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> Obsessed!</li>
            <li> I now use it on my and haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is just not for me :(</li>
            <li> You guys won&#x27;t be disappointed with this!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this serum!  Reminds me a lot of the skinceuticals CE Ferulic. Have noticed a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s not sticky and absorbs in very fast.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Vitamin C Serum&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased/tried.  Goes on nice, not tacky, no heavy scents, absorbs into skin very well.  I&#x27;ve tried other serums (some quite pricey) but this one has done great and I have only used for about a week.  Packaging and shipping also 5 stars.  If you use Vitamin C Serums I would give this one a try for sure.  I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is just amazing.It works wonders on your face and neck area.&lt;br /&gt;It smooths your skin while getting ride of wrinkles and giving you that younger looking skins.&lt;br /&gt;You just need 5 drops mix with a little water and leave to dry for a while before using your face moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Then it does the amazing work on your face. I saw results in just 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much Healthy Wiser Natural Skin Care!</li>
            <li> Great product will order agsin</li>
            <li> Very good product I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Reviews are scam.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a second bottle.  This stuff is great.  My skin feels amazing after using it.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Great Product!! Recommend for all kind of skin!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month and did not see any difference..</li>
            <li> Eh. Smells kind of like when flowers start to get moldy in the vase. Did nothing for my face at all. I wonder if the reviews are from real purchasers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a week and a half, and so far I love it!  I can feel it immediately tightening my skin, but not that dry, just-washed-with-soap tightness.  More of a nourished feeling.  Also, my skin feels soft after using it - sometimes I&#x27;ll skip the moisturizer and go straight to the foundation primer.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has really improved my skin in the short time I have used it. I can see myself using it forever. Worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not doing anything.  I&#x27;ve used it twice daily for almost a month.  Nothing.  Going  back to Clarins.</li>
            <li> I rated this product 3 stars because so far it&#x27;s working really well but I wanna wait till I use the whole bottle before I give it a full 5 stars. I&#x27;m usually more of a fan of harder chemical facial treatments, I tend to stay clear of &amp;#34;All Natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; ones BUT I&#x27;ve had a noticeable  difference with the size of my pores, especially on my nose where they tend to be larger. Also I noticed that I haven&#x27;t had cloged pores (blackheads) in my nose area either which I&#x27;m super thrilled about. But like I said, once I finish the bottle and see that it&#x27;s keeping up the good work I will change my rating and possibly order more of this product. I&#x27;m enjoying the benifits so far:)</li>
            <li> I like the smell of citrus.  Supposedly it&#x27;s all organic ingredients.  My face seem more radiant than before after using the product.</li>
            <li> I think this is going to be a great product.  I&#x27;ve been using a week-10 days, along with my fairly high quality moisturizer, and Retina A product, and have seen a marked improvement in my acne and, dare I say, skin texture, firmness, and overall quality!  It was on sale, great deal, I hope I can afford it at its regular price.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, I have been using for one month and see a significant lightening in my sun spots and pigmentations.  Plus it smells great and feels weightless on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service :)</li>
            <li> I love this serum because it makes my skin healthy and toned. It helps me to minimize acne and oiliness on my face, especially around t-zone. I use it before going to bed and before putting make-up. This serum is perfect for someone who wants to achieve healthy and glowing-looking skin. It doesn&#x27;t help to get rid of wrinkles though. I bought it 3 times already and every time I have same positive results.</li>
            <li> Love this company! Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Liked the old oil feel my last bottle had from Nov. This one feels like water</li>
            <li> A few things on this:&lt;br /&gt;-Overall, quite nice but I definitely didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor that I&#x27;ve gotten from several other serums (Kiehls Midnight Recovery is my favorite so far)&lt;br /&gt;-Bottom Line:Will continue to use because of the ACE + hyaluronic acid combination is good for me but the search will continue for a product with the results of Kiehls without the price</li>
            <li> This is a great vitamin C serum. I notice a visible difference in my skin in a short period of time. Complexion is moist and glowing and lines are smoothed. Dark spots are visibly lighter and complexion is brighter. People have commented to me on several occasions how good my skin looks, so it is not just my imagination. Another good product is the eye creme. Comes in a pump dispenser to avoid contamination and does not irritate the eyes at all. Easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning and evening. I have not seen any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is soothing to the skin and absorbs quickly with no residue.  It has helped diminish fine wrinkles and has evened out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and already notice positive results as a reduction in small lines around my eyes, decreased redness and improvement in general skin tone.  Delighted, as the dry heat and winter weather are always hard on my aging complexion.  At 70, nothing will be a miracle cure, but every little improvement is appreciated!</li>
            <li> When I rece it, the seal was broke. I still applied it on my face. Hasn&#x27;t noticed any improvement yet.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in the deep creases between my eyebrows within a week of using this.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but my skin became firmer, clearer and the tone evened out quite a bit. I felt like I had a face lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 5 stars because it works very well. On personal preference I wish it weren&#x27;t liquid, but more of a gel, because I feel like it&#x27;s harder to apply because of this. It also has a strong citrus scent to it, which I don&#x27;t mind, but someone else might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all the product does what it says and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for new Vitamin C products to try out for my skin. So I thought I&#x27;ll  give this a try. I noticed that within 1 use my face felt smoother and my face was not only clear but actually brighter too. Within a week people around me were noticing the change too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> excellent product it works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now and can tell a difference in the appearance of my skin.  I had a few small acne scars which have lightened as well as some sun damage.  It&#x27;s not the eastiest product to apply and I do end up with a few drops on my countertop.  However, it is quickly absorbed into your skin and after application my skin glows and feels smoother and tighter.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, it is as described, has a great fresh smell. I&#x27;ve already noticed my skin feeling softer and hope to see more dramatic results with continued use. The seller was awesome to deal with. They followed the order during every step, making sure I received the product and that I was happy with it... I am, and I&#x27;m very happy with the level of service from the seller!</li>
            <li> Great product but shake well before each use.</li>
            <li> Only used this for two days but my skin already feels softer, smoother and I&#x27;m looking forward to daily use to see the results over time.</li>
            <li> Only used it for a week so it&#x27;s hard to tell but my doing seems to look lighter and smoother. Will post again...</li>
            <li> This eye cream is so light-weight and mild on the skin. I&#x27;m seeing improvement and I&#x27;ll continue to use it. I highly recommend it. Will definitely but it again.</li>
            <li> I have used Vitamin C serum before although not this brand. This serum is kind of runny. Yes your face feels tighter after you put it on but thats only because it leaves a kind of film on your face when it dries. Its not actually tightening your face, not that I expected it to. If you were to rinse it off after applying it the tightness would go away as well. The smell is alright, very light. Maybe for some people this product rocks but honestly I wasn&#x27;t impressed. The serum I usually use is really expensive but I like the results a lot better.</li>
            <li> It is working for me. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I love the soothing feeling and quick absorption of this serum. With the awesome benefits of pure vitamin C smoothing all those soon to be fine lines. I am applying this twice a day before I use my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Seems as though THIS Vitamin C Serum has some &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to it, compared to others I have purchased. I would say that this one, and the Watts Beauty Peptide Serum have given me the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of them irritated my skin, and I noticed a definite tightening effect. Not sure how it works, long-term, but in a couple of weeks, it seems to have hydrated my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this serum ... I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making any significant changes to my skin but I love the way my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a pleather of products.&lt;br /&gt;Avalon, Insta Natural, Radha Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;Healthy Wiser is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;The results are amazing, and its 72% organic.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like it that is not sticky and it slide on very well.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on at night and my face was very Smooth in the morning. The only problem is that it said on the lable that is not a moisturizer.I put the moisturizer on top of the serum the first night.my face felt oily the next morning. So I decided to only put the serum. My face felt soft the whole day.very nice product .</li>
            <li> I received this for free in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying all sorts of different products to make my face look younger. Once I found Vitamin C, I knew I had found something that really works. This organic Vitamin C serum has a really nice texture. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a scent, not a strong scent, but it does disappear once absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was only using it for a few days when people started complimenting my skin. They said I look much younger than I really am. I give all the thanks to the vitamin c serum!&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Uyr_WvJQii8</li>
            <li> I wish I could say it is making a big difference in my complexion but I fear it is not.  I have used for a couple of weeks now - daily - based on instructions.  I see very little to no change.  I am not certain I will repurchase.  I hope other users are having better results than me!</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean, I like it....smooth.</li>
            <li> amazing product !! I can&#x27;t believe the results within a week working perfectly, myself and my wife very satisfied. Thanks healthy wiser for the best products.</li>
            <li> It is an awesome Serum! I has been used just for few weeks and I can start see the change on my face!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smell like a wierd citrus not a fresh citrus you would expect. Makes my hadns and face feel sticky and then my face becomes super tight for a few minutes. Burns around my eyes</li>
            <li> with a good moisturizer that have vitamin C your skin will start to clear up. I love it. I have been using it for almost a month, and notice a change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now but the last batch seems very different.  On my last order the consistency, color and smell changed.  On the first 4 bottles I used there wasn&#x27;t much of a smell but this last batch has a strong citrus smell.  I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d add a smell to a simple product like this.  Not sure if I received a bad batch or if the formula was changed but i went from loving it to looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft and seems brighter also. Thank you</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the amazing results that other reviewers are raving about, but perhaps my skin is already in very good condition and there&#x27;s not much improvement to be done-I only have some forehead wrinkles that concern me. However, I&#x27;m three weeks in and I don&#x27;t see any noticeable changes. I have been contacted by Amazon about 7 times to review this product-I felt it was premature, but what the hell. I was going to wait until the bottle was USED to write my review. Consider this a preview of 3 weeks in.</li>
            <li> Just got this product and put it on this morning. It has the consistency of water, which makes it difficult to put on. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Certain spots on my face got very irritated and red/itchy. Will stop using.</li>
            <li> Like orange juice for my skin! So refreshing!</li>
            <li> What a find!  First, this company actually cares about it&#x27;s customers.  Second, the smell of this lovely product in my opinion is divine.  Last but not least, I noticed improvement the moment I put it on.  I am a harsh critic and have tried all kinds of vitamin C serums from Obagi, Murad and on down the line.  This really works with my skin&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t lie when they say it&#x27;s the BEST! I started using this product and within two days all of my adult acne started to clear up. My skin which is always oily can finally be described as normal. I can see that my large pores have visibly tightened. I&#x27;m a big freak for anything organic so that is a big plus for me. I even use it on the backs of my hands which are sun damaged from driving in the car. My dry sun damaged hands are beginning to look younger and the texture is improving. I will continue to use and purchase this product and tell all my friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far thinner in consistency than any serum I&#x27;ve used before. I mean, just a bit more viscous than water, really thin and runny. No moisturizing properties. I&#x27;m unsure about any other benefits. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, on the plus side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon features many &amp;#34;brands&amp;#34; that aren&#x27;t sold anywhere else, and I&#x27;m beginning to think that the claims vs performance of many of these overwhelm - negatively - the same for the few good ones. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way for truly good products to differentiate themselves from the pack, when reviews are both the main basis for evaluating claims as well as easily manipulable. I don&#x27;t know that this problem is uniquely relevant ro this product;this is the product that made me aware of the problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife, and she loves it! Planning to order more. Happy wife &#x3D; happy life:))</li>
            <li> It did not work.nothing happened as mentioned on the review.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! You can see a  change in appearance of skin. It looks clearer, brighter, and feels smooth and soft. I&#x27;m surprised at the difference it makes. Really love it!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft, but doesn&#x27;t do much else, still a great product.</li>
            <li> I think this is probably the best skin product that I have ever tried .. It has made my skin look so much better &amp; the skin tone is definitely much more even then before ..</li>
            <li> VERY NICE, EXCELLENT PRODUCT, AND I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND ROSACEA BUT THIS SERUM NOT IRRITATING SKIN, IN FEW DAYS I HAVE SEEN IMPROVEMENTS IN MY SKIN IS MORE LIGHT.</li>
            <li> It helped me reduce pimples and my face looked brighter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of natural products and this serum on my list!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves pleasant feeling on skin, smells good and no greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely must have!</li>
            <li> I love this serum! It leaves my skin feeling silky soft, unlike others which can be sticky or oily. I started with night application only, but now use it in the mornings too.  I bought it to help with my dull tired skin.  It&#x27;s been two weeks and I see glowing skin now! Excited to continue using it!</li>
            <li> Every night before bed I would usually apply vitamin C caplets to my skin that are sticky and clog my pores. With this product I can have the same results and moisturization without all that stickiness.  Its light on the skin but provides the same outstanding results. Love love love. See for yourself</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvements. Its safe around the eyes. I only use 5 drops to cover my face. Even though I want to use more than that!</li>
            <li> After applying the vitamin c serum last night I woke up feeling refreshed and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! Really helpful!! Buy it!! Love this Serum! Second bottle in and my face feels Fantastic!! Imagine a few months down!!</li>
            <li> This serum makes my face feel so soft and smooth. Even after I&#x27;ve had it on all day when I wash my face in the evening it still feels soft and smooth. A little bit goes a long way. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> My freckles and pigmentation are getting lighter after using it continuously over the course of 3 months. So light and the citrus fragrant.</li>
            <li> Great recommendation from a friend! I am always looking to try new products and I love this one. My skin tone looks more even and it feels soft to the touch. I love to put in on before bed, it feels like a treat for my face!</li>
            <li> Immediately after using it for the first time, my face felt firmer, skin is smoother especially the lines on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this serum!</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth and silky! I will use this forever! I look 5 years younger. Plus it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!!! It has became a major part of my daily routine!!! I love it and would recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Best vit C serum I found so far. Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this serum and my mom tested it first. I made her my guinea pig hahahaha!&lt;br /&gt;She used it at night and in the morning, she was amazed at effect of it on her skin. Her skin became supple to touch. With continuos use, the wrinkles would slowly diminish.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a paid review!!!</li>
            <li> I order a lot online, I must confess. Every so often I run across a merchant or site that I feel are extraordinary and this seller is one of them.  Great service, great follow up emails, that almost lost feeling of the customer really matters which I love.  I also am a skin product junkie and have used and tried many products, from drugstore to very high end.  This serum feels better to me than any others I have tried, I love the silky feel of it and the smell is great.  Often serums don&#x27;t smell great but this one smells lovely.  I have only used it a short time but my skin looks great and actually today my mother commented that my skin looked really great.  I&#x27;m in my 50s so love hearing that !</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I needed for my skin care routine. I have oily skin and I am loathe to put anything on my face especially during this hot hot summer.  I use my clarisonic to cleanse my face and then apply this serum. It is light and penetrates quickly, no oily residue!!  My complexion already seems brighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry skin. I tried it and love it! I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments about my skin, which feels like silk now instead of sand paper, with less lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of skincare products, mostly high priced lines from sephora such as ole Hendrickson, Claudelie, Peter Thomas Roth etc. I have very sensitive skin and have had reactions to vitamin C serums in the past. The product is very gentle and safe for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been applying this serum at night under my night cream and morning under sunscreen (always use sunscreen with C serums during the day!) and I&#x27;ve seen great benefits. My skin is definitely brighter and firmer, and it&#x27;s been helping my hyper pigmentation noticeably diminish. I recommend this to anyone with sun spots or signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I had many sun spot and discoloration that&#x27;s associated with my freckles. And this product put a major dent in fighting these spots! I&#x27;ve tried other products and just putting on concealer and cover up. But this product really works the best!!! Never going back to other non effective brands again! So pleased!!</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best stuff!!! I could spend all day just smelling the refreshing citrus scent! Also, the box is adorable, and makes a great present/gift. The bottle arrived filled up to the rim and should last me at least 6 months if not more, so I&#x27;m really happy about that. It feels so relaxing when I put it on at night, and in the morning my skin (especially the area under my eyes) looks a lot less scary/tired. I also like the fact that this was made in the USA. I will definitely be buying more of this in the future. It beats all of the bigger name brands that sell vitamin c serums at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:cd85299c1be34edadaf133a5979a7408]] Obsessed! Tightens my skin and leaves me with a healthy glow! I&#x27;m 32 and I hate when people tell me I look tired because of the dark circles under my eyes. I put on the vitamin c serum and I instantly look younger. I would recommend the vitamin c serum to anyone.</li>
            <li> LOVE the way my face feels... I don&#x27;t know if it is my imagination but it seems the darkness around my eyes has diminished.  Would recommend and will continue to use! LOVE!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth.  I use the serum for dryness and irritation and just love it.</li>
            <li> This product is soo amazing on your skin, highly recommend to woman or men who start to notice wrinkles on your skin, out of 6 different products used this is the ONE, noticed differences within a week, face feels lighter, brighter, and much younger. Makes a 30 year old man look 24</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product! Not greasy or heavy, but works very well. I saw results pretty quickly, and my friends and family were all asking what I was doing differently.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this brand, and I&#x27;ve found it is a wonderful Anti aging product and has high quality organic ingredients. Im pretty sure it is just as good as the more expensive brands! Shipping was on time too.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  I saw results almost immediately! Skin is fresh and hydrated.  Cruelty free and vegan!</li>
            <li> I had purchased another brand of serum and really liked it, almost out I was ready to purchase another on Amazon when I saw Healthy Wiser Vitamin C serum. After researching I decided to give it a try. So happy I did. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see a difference in my skin but I can honestly say that it goes on like silk and my face looks dewy and so healthy. Thank you for bringing it to Amazon!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Really helped my skin and my face. Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few new products recently and this is the only one that has provided a noticeable improvement to my skin.  The texture of my skin is now silky smooth.  Unfortunately, I have not seen any improvement in the appearance of fine lines but I will continue to use it for its other benefits.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels very light. Not sticky or gooey at all. And the light citrus scent is great. The best part is the seller though. Healthy Wiser was very prompt and kind with everything. When it came late (not their fault) they responded immediately and sent another one out right away.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the serum very long yet, but I had to post about the seller!</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of any beauty product.  I am in my early 50&#x27;s and my skin has become dull along with fine wrinkles.  It took a few weeks to notice the difference. lines have become less noticeable and skin does look healthier.  I apply in the AM and follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a product that my (still) acne prone, (very) sensitive, (beginning) to wrinkle skin will respond well to.  It is not a miracle cure, but it is the best product I have found for my skin.  It exfoliates my skin without drying it out.  There is a difference when I do not use it.  I order a bottle every month and use it on my face and neck every morning.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! It works.</li>
            <li> I use this serum on my face and really like it so far. It smells wonderful and goes on easily. It absorbs a bit slow, but it does absorb unlike other serums I have tried, which was a real turn off. It&#x27;s not as thick as a serum should be, but it is still thick enough to where it is easy to apply. I do intend to continue using this serum and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this, it was not a promo or anything, and have used it religiously morning and night. I see neither any benefit immediately after applying nor over the multiple weeks of use with needling device. So…. Idk what the purpose is, tbh.</li>
            <li> I have to say... the results are pretty nice. I have been told that my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> This product actually works! My skin feels better, my pores tighter, and my sun spots are going away! Very nice.</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months now.  It smells nice and it feels good going on.  But I can&#x27;t say that it has had any impact on the appearance or texture of my skin. Also, the dropper applicator just drips all over.</li>
            <li> Very misleading. The label says Vitamin C  and 20% in large writing. Read below the big  &amp;#34;20% &amp;#34; and it is 20 % vitamin E. I wanted a VITAMIN C serum.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for about 10 days and have had more breakouts in that 10 days than in the past 5 years!</li>
            <li> After trying so many products to help with occasional acne and the dark spots that remain, I stumbled upon healthywiser. The reviews were good and the price was reasonable so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I started off using the product very inconsistently because I honestly did not expect much, but for the past two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and woooowww the results are amazing! I&#x27;m in love with my skin. My dark spots are fading and my skin is smoother and looks noticeably brighter! It&#x27;s been an amazing addition to my skincare regimen. I&#x27;ve actually replaced my moisturizer with this serum as it hydrates so well and keeps my skin supple. My face actually glows now. Will continue to use. Can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin will continue to improve.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and applies smoothly. My skin absorbs it like a sponge. I put it on before makeup and again at bedtime. My skins loves it!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  It didn&#x27;t come with directions and/or in a box plus the bottle itself didn&#x27;t have a seal so I was a little leary about putting it on my face therefore I started on the inside of my wrists to check for any reactions. I now use it on my and haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions.  I am nit sure how often to use it or how much. I have been using 10 drops on face and neck.  On another note I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  It smelss a little medicinal.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I saw no difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my face. Used it for over a month. Maybe it is just not for me :( oh and I just have to say this.. I am really happy with their customer service. They are very customer oriented company! So easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> Recomended: If you have tired skin, expression lines, open pores, etc... well this serum works perfect, leaves my skin smooth, soft, close my pores, my fine lines are tight now, wow i didn&#x27;t expect this to work so well, i have tried everything (cheap, expensive products, etc) and i tell you for the price this product is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;i am loving it really:) thank you!</li>
            <li> I was never interested in using C serum products until I used Estee Lauder overnight recovery serum. I liked the estee lauder serum but since that is way too pricey, I started looking for affordable ones on Amazon. Oh wow I am glad I did because I have brighter complection with pretty glow, with a fraction of the cost! Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin was looking cracked and needed help. I thought I would give this product a shot and see if it works. IT FEELS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> You guys won&#x27;t be disappointed with this!! I really love the way it feels and the results are perfect! Great!</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any breakouts (normal nor cystic acne) from this serum, which was my initial concern before purchasing this. It really brightens your face and gives it that extra boost it needs. I especially like to use it under my eye and mix it with my moisturizer at times which seems to help even more. My face always looks rejuvenized after a good night&#x27;s rest, and in the morning if I need extra moisture/help.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly in sealed container. It is a dropper... Not real easy to apply. You must have your skin damp before applying because it  uses the water to plump your skin up and thus make you appear a little younger, more refreshed, give you the appearance of decreased fine lines. The vitamin c is wonderful for your skin so that is a plus. I don&#x27;t like the method for applying it, and more often then not find myself skipping this step in my get ready routine because it doesn&#x27;t do anything all that great. If your face is too wet when you apply it you will get a slightly slimy feeling to your face, also throughout the day I feel like I can feel this pulling out of my pores almost giving a shine to my face or a wetness, it&#x27;s odd. I guess my point is, it was one of those products I had to try and now it is the product I can do without.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old woman with severe sun spots and hyperpigmentation on my face. After a mild laser post-op, my dermatologist recommended adding a Vitamin C serum to my skincare regimen. Shopping around, I stumbled on this serum by Healthy Wiser on Amazon. Like many customers before me, I was slightly skeptical but figured what the heck, the price is fairly moderate compared to the going rates by other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I just finished using 1 bottle, 2x a day and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This Vitamin C serum didn&#x27;t irritate my photosensitive skin which is prone to fragrances, allergens, parabens and the ilk. Best of all, the serum improved the texture of my skin and eased up the discoloration of the remaining sun spots ever so slightly. And it can be worn daily underneath the Elta MD Broad Spectrum sunblock plus makeup on top.</li>
            <li> This really worked wonders right away! I noticed within a few day that my skin tone was much better, and my acne scars did lighten a bit. As everyone is saying, the smell is rather pleasant! It smells citrus-y and is super light. I have larger pores on my nose, and I havent noticed much in terms of the serum doing much to minimize those pores, and its been about a month. But hopefully, continued use will help. I typically only use this at night, after cleansing and using toner. Then I use moisturizer after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, I recommend massaging the serum in when you use it, not just spreading it around. Take some time to really help it absorb into your skin and get some blood flowing :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend, just know that it Doesn&#x27;t Treat/Prevent acne!</li>
            <li> Feels Great! Silky and soft! Was recommended by a friend and I have to say it&#x27;s Pretty easy to use. Try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> I am very oily skin so I am extra careful to choose any cosmetic. This is non greesy and absorb right away into my face. I will leave more review in transit:) Love Love this!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful treatment serum and at such an affordable price. Most serums I&#x27;ve used containing these ingredients cost $80 or more! easy to apply and feels like silk. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skins tone and texture in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Being a self-confessed skincare junkie I&#x27;m thrilled to say, this stuff works! Tightens skin while still leaving my face feeling hydrated!</li>
            <li> This is a moisturizer, wrinkle reducer and skin quencher! When you put it on overnight, be prepared to wake up with AMAZINGLY soft supple skin. I am 27, and I ain&#x27;t getting any younger. This serum is going to make me look like I&#x27;m 27 FOREVER!! Forget &amp;#34;Forever 21&amp;#34; I want to be &amp;#34;Forever 27.&amp;#34; Brains, class and SKIN! &#x3D;)&#x3D;) GO buy one now!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have very sensitive, combination skin, therefore i&#x27;m very careful with what i put on my face. This serum is delicate and silky and it is instantly absorbed by the skin. The texture is perfect, non greasy or sticky. What is crucial in my case, is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel itchy like many face products i&#x27;ve tried. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love it so much, it&#x27;s so nourashing!</li>
            <li> Smells good and feel so refreshing. Like it so much!</li>
            <li> If your skin lacks FOOD--this is it!! Packed with vitamins you&#x27;ll feel a glow and shine right away. The serum \\&quot;feeds\\&quot; what your pours were missing. We need vitamins to keep up looking beautiful without make up on as well, so this product will give you that feel. Simple skin goodness!!!--what else do u need? )))) thanks!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product does what it says it will do for you!</li>
            <li> Excellent! I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for a month now and love it! I didn&#x27;t change any part of my daily routine, except adding the serum. I noticed softer skin after about a week of using this product, but the truly amazing part is that it is helping with my few spots of hyperpigmentation. In the past, I have has occasional breakouts and trouble spots but have not had any since using this! I read a lot of reviews of similar products before purchasing and I&#x27;m glad I ended up buying this one. Try it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I like the organic ingredients in this product.  But I could feel my face was soft a second I apply a few drops on my face but don&#x27;t see the different of skin. I have been using it for almost a month now. I will keep using it to see it may get a result after a few months maybe.</li>
            <li> I was really optimistic when I got this product like everyone I think because of the reviews...but after 3 weeks of using it I have seen no real difference...skin is smoother on occasion but frown lines are still present and fine lines around my eyes are also still there...im not gona give up quite yet for the results im after...I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Only 25 so thought my skin would be at least show some change...not for everyone I guess</li>
            <li> I can only say good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered in a Sunday and got delivered on the monday, ever so quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I loved how it felt in my skin as soon as I tried for the first time; the smell is very pleasant and not overpowering. It&#x27;s too early for me to confirm any long term use changes on my skin, but it gives me the filling of improvement with my day by day use.&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommended this to any one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for the first time for about 3 weeks now and, thus far, I like the results.  My skin feels much softer and I&#x27;ve started to notice a reduction in the fine wrinkles around my eyes and mouth that were beginning to form.</li>
            <li> Mk so... this is not a serum its more like water than a glossy thicker liquid. Having said that it seems to last a while even in a small bottle. I have super dry skin and this is just not enough moisture for me, but I do enjoy under my vitamin c lotion. it smells great. I am not sure it does anything for fine lines but I do feel it helps me heal my skin faster. ( I have a habbit of picking and popping) It seems to be good for reducing KP and acne.</li>
            <li> Great serum to use after derma rolling.</li>
            <li> Love this product-still on first bottle, but nothing I dislike so far. Came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Amazing orange citrus smell! Makes my skin glow bright and feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Love it I think I did invested my money in something I really think works !  I am pleased with the results and more than one person has made comments about how smooth and delicate my skin looks , which I never received those type of compliments before I started using this serum ! I am not saying what works for me will work for you this is only my personal opinion!</li>
            <li> i do believe these reviews were all written by the company… just be aware</li>
            <li> I like this product because it has a lot of Organic and natural ingredients. The five stars is for the great customer service that I received when I had a concern about the packaging but they contacted me right away and I am very happy with the way the company handled my concern. So far the product is gentle on my face and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after continual use!!</li>
            <li> Well I will start out with this vitamin c serum is the best that I have ever used. I cant believe the money that I have wasted trying to get the results that I have gotten in just 2 weeks that I have been using this vitamin c serum. I ordered another bottle dont want to run out of my fountain of youth. Thankyou healthwiser for this great vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> This serum is okay. I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in my complexion or the brightness of my skin. No change in moisture, or sensitivity, or just general wakefulness. Seeing as it isn&#x27;t doing anything, it probably isn&#x27;t worth the money. (At least for me, with the simple routine I use.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and it really has made a difference in my 40-something year old complexion.  I live in a wet, cool climate, so breakouts and dryness occur during the winter months.  My skin felt like a lizard before I began using this serum, and now it&#x27;s soft to the touch, glows, and the breakouts have mostly subsided.  Two downsides for me: The scent seems to wane a bit after a couple of weeks.  The aroma wasn&#x27;t strong for my taste, though it&#x27;s important to know I like naturally scented (by the ingredients, not perfume) products, as it&#x27;s part of the experience for me.  Also, the consistency is a bit watery, so you have to be careful to catch the product in your hand appropriately, otherwise it will spill, and boo-hoo, your product will be wasted.  I&#x27;d actually prefer a slightly more thick consistency anyway, simply because it feels so luxurious.  I lean toward high end, luxury product lines.  I&#x27;ve recently come to the conclusion the high price tags don&#x27;t always mean I&#x27;m using a quality product, so, I decided to search through Amazon for highly rated serums.  I&#x27;m happy I did, and came across this product.  UPDATE MARCH 3, 2015 Changing my former 4 star review to a 5.  About two weeks ago, I ran out of this product, and about a week later, my skin appeared to have aged a few years.  My tissue appeared dry, fine lines were more apparent and little, irritating bumps began to reappear.  Oh, and blackheads returned too.  Eww.  Seems this economically priced serum is doing more for my skin than many of the $75 (and up!) serums I&#x27;ve used in the past.    Forced to reduce my beauty budget, I decided to try this product with low expectations.  I&#x27;m delightfully surprised, and grateful (so so grateful!) for the affordable price point.  Nice work, HealthyWiser!</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully.  It does a great job of reducing fine lines and wrinkles, has a pleasant fragrance, and is relatively inexpensive.  I highly recommend this serum!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done a thing. Honestly, the consistency is like water. This really could be just water with a vitamin dissolved at the bottom. I see no evidence of any kind of oil or anything else. It&#x27;s literally smelly water. I&#x27;m guessing that the plethora of beaming reviews are fake. Waste of $$.</li>
