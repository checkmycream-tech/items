            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and it was shipped on time.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>Works great at roots for lift.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job with adding texture and volume.</li>
            <li>it is great for fine hair!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it...</li>
            <li>I have fine, but a fair amount of hair.</li>
            <li>This is far by the BEST root lifter I have used.  </li>
            <li>Just okay, don&#x27;t know that I would buy again,</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>but is more a gel consistency than a spray, so when it shoots out the nozzle, it&#x27;s too concentrated a gel to disperse evenly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is excellent, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I have tried many top of the line salon products and they do not even compare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this 5 times now, and while in some ways I like it as it smooths my hair a bit more, that&#x27;s not AT ALL</li>
            <li>I have tried many products like it</li>
            <li>I love Garnier Root Booster, and have  used it before.  </li>
            <li>Have not even tried the product because when I received it, there was no spray top, jus the tube that goes into the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to find another product that works as well as the Garnier Root Booster.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately at places I normally shop for it, so I was very happy to see it was offered as an add-on item on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so I can still get 2 days out of a wash (I have dry hair) with a great boost!</li>
            <li>Now I have to search for a top that will fit that sprays in order to even try the product.  </li>
            <li>Bought by my aunt thru me and did good on her use thanks</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do and smells really nice without being too strong.</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>Such a great price.</li>
            <li>So I hope Amazon will keep it available for awhile</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and was excited to try this product after reading some reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was excited.  </li>
            <li>Be careful how much you use though, I have noticed it creates kind of a waxy texture after blow drying (which is good for me because I have a pixie cut, but it might not be so nice if you&#x27;re going for soft silky hair)</li>
            <li>This really helps to give it more volume.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well on my fine straight hair and pumps up the roots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at giving a little lift.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite so far-</li>
            <li>Good news, this product has little or no scent at all.  </li>
            <li>Really lifts!</li>
            <li>This seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and most product are too heavy and just make my hair droop.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or obvious on my hair which is nice, but it just doesn&#x27;t add any volume at all.</li>
            <li>If I let it airdry I don&#x27;t get as much lift.</li>
            <li>My sister recommended it to me and I would absolutely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and Garnier.  </li>
            <li>A main product for my hair care</li>
            <li>Since it is no longer available at the stores, I expected to pay a little more.</li>
            <li>When I find a product I like, I usually keep a good supply of it to last me .</li>
            <li>and the price is fantastic compared to the other brands.</li>
            <li>It lifts my hair as it says and it also helps my hair to stay soft.  </li>
            <li>One small bottle lasts a very long time for me, since I have short hair, but it still needs a little something to give it some body as its very fine.  </li>

            <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my hair - still flat and lifeless after using this product.</li>
            <li> The product was okay but not impressed in comparison to other products.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick, coarse textured wavy hair, that I wash and blowdry mostly straight every other day.</li>
            <li> I use this on wet hair before I blow dry or when I shower at night and need a boost on my flat air dried hair the next morning.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair that little extra volume it needs at the roots without looking oily or like I&#x27;m overloaded with product.</li>

            <li> I like to tame all the frizz in my hair with my smoothing shampoo/conditioner, and then I miss some of that volume at the root, so I decided to try this.</li>

            <li> You have to use very little to get the job done.  </li>

            <li> Gives some volume only when I blowdry my hair. If I let it airdry I don&#x27;t get as much lift. Sometimes it can be a bit crunchy feeling until my hair loosens up. Just okay, don&#x27;t know that I would buy again, will continue the search for the perfect product!</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair on the top of my head. This really helps to give it more volume.</li>
            <li> Been using for years, cannot get in stores, they changed it into a mousse, dont like mousses, saw it on amazon and ordered 2 so I dont run out soon.  Works great at roots for lift.  Not oily.  A main product for my hair care</li>
            <li> Such a great product. Such a great price.</li>
            <li> works alright but is more a gel consistency than a spray, so when it shoots out the nozzle, it&#x27;s too concentrated a gel to disperse evenly. Spray with caution.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Really lifts!</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent, especially for the price. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and smells really nice without being too strong.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day.  It gives my hair that little extra volume it needs at the roots without looking oily or like I&#x27;m overloaded with product. My sister recommended it to me and I would absolutely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Garner Fructis products are often tutti fruit fragrant, while they smell great, it is annoying to wear &#x27;fruit salad&#x27; on your head all day.  Good news, this product has little or no scent at all.  Seems to work well on my fine straight hair and pumps up the roots.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and was excited to try this product after reading some reviews.  It didn&#x27;t work on my hair - still flat and lifeless after using this product.</li>

            <li> This is a wonderful product and it was shipped on time.</li>
            <li> This was a gift because it&#x27;s hard to find around here. My wife loves this product. She says it helps with her coloring and adds body</li>

            <li> This stuff is great! I have tried many products like it but this is my favorite so far- and the price is fantastic compared to the other brands. I use this on wet hair before I blow dry or when I shower at night and need a boost on my flat air dried hair the next morning. It&#x27;s a lighter weight formula so I can still get 2 days out of a wash (I have dry hair) with a great boost!</li>
            <li> I love this product and was disappointed to see that Garnier discontinued it.  When I found it online I was excited.  The order was shipped in a timely manner and was as described.  It was expensive for a hair product but that goes along with supply and demand.  Since it is no longer available at the stores, I expected to pay a little more.</li>
            <li> I love Garnier Root Booster, and have  used it before.  But unfortunately the product was broken when it got here -- it doesn&#x27;t spray, and a piece is missing from the spray part, so I spent money on something that is absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a few years then it disappeared off the shelves. I was thrilled to find it...I have thinning, fragile hair...it gives me the extra boost I need so it appears my hair is thicker.</li>
            <li> I have fine, but a fair amount of hair. I was look for something to add lasting volume. I only noticed very little difference in volume when I used this product. I used the entire bottle before forming an opinion.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately at places I normally shop for it, so I was very happy to see it was offered as an add-on item on Amazon. One small bottle lasts a very long time for me, since I have short hair, but it still needs a little something to give it some body as its very fine.
