            <li>I am happy with them.</li>
            <li>These do it very nicely and with polka dots.  </li>
            <li>Do the job at a good price.</li>
            <li>As good as those use and throw ones you get in hotels.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and with good elastic as well, can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li>These are good shower caps.</li>
            <li>Price is really good too.</li>
            <li>These are good quality.</li>
            <li>great shower caps in cute colors...</li>
            <li>They look cute for a plastic shower cap!  </li>
            <li>Very cheap.  </li>
            <li>good , quick.</li>
            <li>Pay more and get another type of cap.</li>
            <li>better quality plastic please.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast its great for hair treatments.</li>
            <li>She loves the cute colors.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Good reusable caps for color or hot treatment, not for water.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the service and product which arrived promptly and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Tear easily.</li>
            <li>The elastic is strong and holds my hair in place.</li>
            <li>That is fine for me.</li>
            <li>Cheap, cheap, cheap.</li>
            <li>Any woman with much hair at all will find minimal coverage at best.  </li>
            <li>but they fit my head just fine and hold up pretty well.</li>
            <li>These are perfect to use a few times when you do a hot conditioner on your hair.</li>
            <li>They are not the heavy kind that last, but perfect in certain situations.</li>
            <li>They are just thin and flimsy, but they will work super great for vacations and traveling!</li>
            <li>I find they fit very snug on my head and even my daughters.</li>
            <li>I wish they had been more clear about the size.</li>
            <li>fun &amp; practical</li>
            <li>so these are useful.</li>
            <li>Good but not super sturdy</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Still on the first one.  </li>
            <li>Slather on the conditioner, put on the cap, and wrap a hot towel around your head.</li>
            <li>Easy to pack if you are going to be someone&#x27;s houseguest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for deep conditioning your hair.</li>
            <li>These shower caps are really rather a disposable type.</li>
            <li>If you have a head which is smaller than any other human head on the planet, you&#x27;ll be happy with these.  </li>
            <li>I use them mainly for when I have oil in my hair</li>
            <li>I actually got this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer last christmas :)</li>
            <li>Too small for the amount of hair I have, but would probably work great on people with less hair.</li>
            <li>Wife says give them 4 stars because they are not perfect but they fit her long long hair and seem to last a long time, so she&#x27;s very happy with this bargain.  </li>
            <li>wow poofy ones</li>
            <li>slightly smaller round would be better because they eventually stretch out</li>
            <li>Thin plastic  works fine for what I needed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not for long term use, I wouldn&#x27;t think.</li>
            <li> They will work for my daughter, but they are definitely not adult sized if you are trying to keep your hair covered from the water in the shower.</li>
            <li> very small, it barely covers the head  of my 9 year old with below shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Please make it bigger and a little</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;d like to protect my hair from getting wet for longer.</li>
            <li> My hairline is wet after use.</li>
            <li> This has been an issue with other products.</li>
            <li> Be aware that these are the inexpensive, small, thin shower caps you sometimes get in hotel rooms.</li>
            <li> The caps are very small and don&#x27;t cover my entire head...</li>
            <li> Seriously, they are tiny.  </li>
            <li> few of them did rip after about 5 uses, but some are still holding on.</li>
            <li> My hair goes a few inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> These shower caps are a bit too small.</li>
            <li> These are extremely small.  </li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> And they are also thin.  </li>
            <li> These are thin almost like you&#x27;d find at a hotel.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless unless one has a very small head or wishes to use the cap for a child.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that it was a one time use shower cap</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My daughter loves the design. I find they fit very snug on my head and even my daughters. This has been an issue with other products. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR - THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Do the job at a good price.</li>
            <li> These shower caps are a bit too small. My hair goes a few inches past my shoulders. I wish they had been more clear about the size.</li>

            <li> good , quick. slightly smaller round would be better because they eventually stretch out and i&#x27;d like to protect my hair from getting wet for longer.</li>
            <li> These shower caps are really rather a disposable type. Not for long term use, I wouldn&#x27;t think. They are just thin and flimsy, but they will work super great for vacations and traveling!</li>

            <li> Very pleased with the service and product which arrived promptly and exactly as advertised. Thank you.</li>
            <li> As good as those use and throw ones you get in hotels. I should have ordered ones in pack of 30-40...</li>
            <li> If you have a head which is smaller than any other human head on the planet, you&#x27;ll be happy with these.  Seriously, they are tiny.  And they are also thin.  Think of the disposable shower caps found in motels.  These are the same, with polka dots.  Cheap, cheap, cheap.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless unless one has a very small head or wishes to use the cap for a child.  Any woman with much hair at all will find minimal coverage at best.  Pay more and get another type of cap.</li>
            <li> What can you say about show caps but that they do their job.  These do it very nicely and with polka dots.  Lightweight and with good elastic as well, can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> Still on the first one.  The elastic is strong and holds my hair in place.</li>
            <li> great shower caps in cute colors...fun &amp; practical</li>
            <li> Since it was a pack of 6 I was afraid that it was a one time use shower cap but I am still using it almost daily after about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> These are perfect to use a few times when you do a hot conditioner on your hair. They are not the heavy kind that last, but perfect in certain situations. They are similar to hotel shower caps. Easy to pack if you are going to be someone&#x27;s houseguest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for deep conditioning your hair. Slather on the conditioner, put on the cap, and wrap a hot towel around your head.</li>
            <li> These are good shower caps. I use them mainly for when I have oil in my hair but they fit my head just fine and hold up pretty well. Price is really good too.</li>
            <li> very small, it barely covers the head  of my 9 year old with below shoulder length hair. Please make it bigger and a little better quality plastic please.</li>
            <li> Too small for the amount of hair I have, but would probably work great on people with less hair.</li>
            <li> These are thin almost like you&#x27;d find at a hotel. That is fine for me. I just wanted simple. All I could find in stores wow poofy ones and they are bulky. These are good quality. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Good but not super sturdy</li>
            <li> Arrived fast its great for hair treatments.</li>
            <li> The caps are very small and don&#x27;t cover my entire head...I&#x27;m also a petite lady at only 5&#x27;2&amp;#34;.  They will work for my daughter, but they are definitely not adult sized if you are trying to keep your hair covered from the water in the shower.</li>
            <li> I actually got this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer last christmas :)&lt;br /&gt;She takes showers (she&#x27;s 4) and she has wavy hair that we do not wash every day so these are useful. She loves the cute colors.&lt;br /&gt;A few of them did rip after about 5 uses, but some are still holding on. I think it&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> They look cute for a plastic shower cap!  I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  Very cheap.  Tear easily.</li>
            <li> Very small. I have short hair, but it does not cover my head. My hairline is wet after use.</li>
            <li> These shower caps are made to fil children, not adults.  I will not buy anymore.</li>
            <li> These are extremely small.  I have very thick curly hair and they do not cover all of my hair.</li>
