            <li>The best brush that I&#x27;ve owned in a while!</li>
            <li>Brush is perfect for blow drying hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>Great brush...</li>
            <li>Works great, non-tangling.</li>
            <li>Great for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>Glad to have added it to the collection!</li>
            <li>Really nice hair brush for the price w/ handle</li>
            <li>Anyways is just the color, but a really nice tool.</li>
            <li>Very nice and light weight brush to use.</li>
            <li>It did create some static, but I am pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>I am sure she will love it!  </li>
            <li>This brush is by far the best we have tried.  </li>
            <li>Great brush nice grip and really shapes the hair and the core heats up</li>
            <li>Very comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t add static either.</li>
            <li>I love this brush for blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>It also appeared to have the thicker plastic bristles (for lack of a better description) but it also has some of the finer bristles with no beads at the end.</li>
            <li>It would be better if the handle was uniform.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>Ok so i got this brush today i didn&#x27;t order it on line</li>
            <li>and i wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s what i want</li>
            <li>It is not hollow inside, but it still is very good for blow-&lt;br /&gt;drying</li>
            <li>but my hair stayed straight and nice looking all day!</li>
            <li>It may just be my hair, and that may be since this brush seems to get good reviews - but the first time I used this brush it immediately became tangled in my hair and created a huge rats nest.</li>
            <li>that makes controlling easy.</li>
            <li>, it is easy to style your hair with this.</li>
            <li>This brush has the right weight and feels very comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a well priced perfect medium round brush for blowing out hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>However, with my short hair, it worked great</li>
            <li>It smooths and heats the hair on the inside allowing it to help the hair become shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I just noticed as I was attempting to clean the hair out of this Bed Head Porcupine Brush that the shorter bristles had melted.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has the soft bristles that grab all of my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know melting point of these nylon bristles; though, I&#x27;m sure that it is fine with low heat.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a purple brush like I expected, but it&#x27;s still a good brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really useful</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth trying to return, so I gave it to my sister to see if she could make use of it.</li>
            <li>Nice big brush.</li>
            <li>I just let it dry on its own then use a staightener</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted or thought I was getting</li>
            <li>Good quality product, it feels comfortable, but I got a pink one instead of purple, but that&#x27;s not big deal</li>
            <li>I have been using a T3 Bespoke Featherweight hairdryer, which does not have temp control and becomes extraordinarily hot.  </li>
            <li>Not only was the process easy</li>
            <li>but i diceded to give it a shot, This brush is better than hot tools blue ice round brush and am just so glad that i bought it.</li>
            <li>I got a pink one love it</li>
            <li>straight.</li>
            <li>It smooths my hair when blow drying and really decreases the frizz.</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t have much luck either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a way better price than any of the similar options and works just as well as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>grips my long fine hair</li>
            <li>feels good on your scalp, removes tangles in wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, which is also very long.</li>
            <li>I use a professional blow dryer which gets soo hot</li>
            <li>Brushes my curly hair easily when its wet.</li>
            <li>but this brush helps to smooth it out as I dry.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a decent brush.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush from Ross a couple of years ago, and I&#x27;m now shopping around for a new blow-out brush.  </li>
            <li>this hair brush and very soft</li>
            <li>This doesnt get stuck and smooths the curls naturally.</li>
            <li>Was surprised at the size and quality.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t hollow so the air can&#x27;t flow through the brush, which is a pretty substantial design flaw.</li>
            <li>But I will need a new one soon because I&#x27;ve used it so much the bristles have bent down.</li>

            <li> grips my long fine hair well. It&#x27;s a well priced perfect medium round brush for blowing out hair. I will definitely buy again. Doesn&#x27;t add static either.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush that I have ever owned. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair at all. It is lightweight and well made.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for blow drying my hair. I love the fact that it has the soft bristles that grab all of my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Hard abd heavy brush bug dissapointment</li>
            <li> If you are buying this brush to blow out your hair with some curl DONT BUY THIS BRUSH. It isn&#x27;t hollow so the air can&#x27;t flow through the brush, which is a pretty substantial design flaw. also all the tiny bristles are stupid and just make it so it doesn&#x27;t roll through the hair easily enough when blowing the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my punishment for being too lazy to go to the beauty supply store for a fatter round brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short this brush basically sucks.</li>

            <li> I bought this to use while blow-drying my hair. It&#x27;s a way better price than any of the similar options and works just as well as far as I&#x27;m concerned. The only issue I had is getting hair caught in the ring on the handle. It would be better if the handle was uniform. Otherwise, it works great!</li>
            <li> I got a pink one love it</li>
            <li> A friend got me this brush some years ago and this is the third one I&#x27;m on. Love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs!  The brush I received was actually green, not purple as pictured, but no big deal.  I like the size and the plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> Brushes my curly hair easily when its wet. Haven&#x27;t tried it while blow drying my yet. Very comfortable in hand. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE.  I have  rhick hair.  This doesnt get stuck and smooths the curls naturally.</li>

            <li> I have used this brush on my clients who have tight curls that need to be stretch when blow drying it  straight. It grips the hair wonderfully. It smooths and heats the hair on the inside allowing it to help the hair become shiny and smooth. I use a professional blow dryer which gets soo hot that I need a brush whose bristles can hold up to the heat. I found the finer bristles of the inside ended up bending after a while, and are not as efficient because of this. I like this brush But I will need a new one soon because I&#x27;ve used it so much the bristles have bent down.</li>
            <li> Great brush...my daughter will be getting in for a stocking stuffer....I am sure she will love it!  I would purchase this even for myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really useful this hair brush and very soft, it is easy to style your hair with this. But the only thing is that it&#x27;s shown in purple, but to me it came green. Anyways is just the color, but a really nice tool.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for me! I love it. It smooths my hair when blow drying and really decreases the frizz. I will definitely order again. The best brush that I&#x27;ve owned in a while!</li>
            <li> It may just be my hair, and that may be since this brush seems to get good reviews - but the first time I used this brush it immediately became tangled in my hair and created a huge rats nest. I have been using round brushes to style my hair for a long time, so it&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t know how to use one. I have medium-fine, medium-length hair. Wasn&#x27;t worth trying to return, so I gave it to my sister to see if she could make use of it. She didn&#x27;t have much luck either.</li>

            <li> Great brush nice grip and really shapes the hair and the core heats up so it actually gives a shape without having to use a curling iron! Just blast with cold air and it sets and holds</li>
            <li> Works great, non-tangling.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of this brush. Constantly left my hair with static and its impossible to brush wet hair with it.</li>
            <li> Nice big brush. Was surprised at the size and quality. Very nice and light weight brush to use. Great for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> Topical hair brush for my granddaughter on Christmas Day.She wanted that color.</li>
