            <li>Been using this for three years and love it.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I like this product as you can wear it alone or put foundation over it for more coverage.</li>
            <li>so blend with most skin tones....</li>
            <li>I use many of Dr. D. products, but never used this one.  </li>
            <li>Honestly love this Day Cream.  </li>
            <li>They seemed to have changed the formula to a bit lighter than the first I bought about two years ago which makes it very nice and light.</li>
            <li>And with the light coverage , many times,one doesn&#x27;t feel they need makeup.</li>
            <li>The tint perfectly blends in with my skin color and has replaced my other makeup foundation.  </li>
            <li>Very cost effective.</li>
            <li>this way I get great sun protection and moisturizer at the same time.</li>
            <li>Lightly tinted and unscented, the cream mimics foundation, but it is so lightweight you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>it will a little bronzer in the summer months for a warmer color and get many compliments!!!  </li>
            <li>THE ORIGINAL BB CREAM before there WERE BB creams....</li>
            <li>lightly tinted with melanin,your skins&#x27; own natural colorant....</li>
            <li>It is a PHYSICAL sunblock,which has been shown to be the most effective protectant.</li>
            <li>so I loyally buy this now.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone considering!!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love this day cream, it has a light tint so many days I use very little makeup with this.</li>
            <li>Dr. Denese does it right.</li>
            <li>Loved the slight coverage and evening of my skin tone!</li>
            <li>It has a much higher SPF than most foundations and moisturizers offer, and the SPF actually works really well.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite product in my entire beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li>skin looks very young and fresh with her Face Serum and SPF 30 Defense Day</li>
            <li>Forever a fan, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>, normally I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on face creams</li>
            <li>I live in Texas so sun screen is absolutely a must,</li>
            <li>Denese cosmetics are fantastic, especially for a mature woman like myself ( age 62 )&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Denese Defense Day Cream for a few years now and love it.</li>
            <li>To me it is a great value because you only use a small amount, a tube last me 6 to 7 months</li>
            <li>I live in the Southeast and want to protect my skin.</li>
            <li>Kept me matt and fresh all day (only had one day to try it so far).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even wash it off at night and my skin continues to look glowing and soft.</li>
            <li>only thing you have to be aware of is it staining white clothing or towels....</li>
            <li>A little spendy but well worth it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d think he&#x27;d pick a colored one after the first few times.</li>

            <li> I have used this for years and still love it.  The tint perfectly blends in with my skin color and has replaced my other makeup foundation.  Very light and weightless application. And the cream lasts a long, long time.  Very cost effective. Other companies have tried to mimic this product, but their tint does not blend in with every skin color.  Winds up looking like a masque.  Dr. Denese does it right.</li>
            <li> Great foundation&lt;br /&gt;loves the this on my face&lt;br /&gt;no drying feeling</li>
            <li> I love this day cream, it has a light tint so many days I use very little makeup with this. They seemed to have changed the formula to a bit lighter than the first I bought about two years ago which makes it very nice and light. I live in Texas so sun screen is absolutely a must, this way I get great sun protection and moisturizer at the same time. To me it is a great value because you only use a small amount, a tube last me 6 to 7 months and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite product in my entire beauty arsenal. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I have a light-fair color complexion, it blends into my skin perfectly. It has a much higher SPF than most foundations and moisturizers offer, and the SPF actually works really well. When I go hiking or am out in the sun all day I use only this cream on my face and I&#x27;ve never gotten burnt, even if sweating. My regular sunblock I put on my chest and shoulders will sweat off and I&#x27;ve gotten burnt, but this stuff stays put. I was given a tube of this as a gift about 5 years ago and was hooked, normally I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on face creams but it&#x27;s worth every penny. I&#x27;ve tried to find cheaper alternatives through the years but it just doesn&#x27;t exist so I loyally buy this now. I&#x27;m happy to of found this cheaper on Amazon than it is on that TV place. Forever a fan, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I should wear it more but I do like it</li>
            <li> Been using this for three years and love it. I have rosacea and it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer with just a hint of color.  Keeps you moisturized all day without being greasy.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love it..Will continue to order it</li>
            <li> Very pleased with all of my Dr. Denese products. I live in the Southeast and want to protect my skin. I like this product as you can wear it alone or put foundation over it for more coverage. I am very fair and the color blends perfectly. I was very skeptical that it would work for me. I will continue to use. Very happy with the vendor Skin Kiosk. They have great prices for a great product.</li>
            <li> THE ORIGINAL BB CREAM before there WERE BB creams....lightly tinted with melanin,your skins&#x27; own natural colorant....so blend with most skin tones....It is a PHYSICAL sunblock,which has been shown to be the most effective protectant. And with the light coverage , many times,one doesn&#x27;t feel they need makeup.</li>
            <li> Has a slight tint and SPF. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great face cream that is light and creamy and a plus in the summer with the SPF 30. Have used this product for about 7 years now...if not longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Denese Defense Day Cream for a few years now and love it. Lightly tinted and unscented, the cream mimics foundation, but it is so lightweight you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing makeup. It provides wonderful coverage and protection with the SPF 30. I&#x27;ve never purchased foundation again after finding this product.</li>
            <li> Great coverage without looking or feeling like makeup or sunscreen.  Doesn&#x27;t rub off color like other tinted moisturizers. Delivered quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Mom asked me to get this for her.  She loves it &amp; uses every day.  I use many of Dr. D. products, but never used this one.  I use her Dream Cream instead.</li>
            <li> I rate this product a 5 star rating. In one step, I get my moisturizer and sunscreen and adds color to my face as well.  A little spendy but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Honestly love this Day Cream.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 5 years --&amp;#62; Consistency is perfect!!!  I mix it will a little bronzer in the summer months for a warmer color and get many compliments!!!  I would highly recommend to anyone considering!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years. If they ever stop making it, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do... It&#x27;s amazing. I don&#x27;t even wash it off at night and my skin continues to look glowing and soft. It&#x27;s great for people who play sports as well, it doesn&#x27;t sweat off.... blends in nicely just like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you have to be aware of is it staining white clothing or towels.... my fiance always puts white towels in the bathroom that I do my hair and make-up in... and I keep turning the hand towel brown.... you&#x27;d think he&#x27;d pick a colored one after the first few times. haha.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I love to use it every day with - or without make up.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Denese cosmetics are fantastic, especially for a mature woman like myself ( age 62 )&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks very young and fresh with her Face Serum and SPF 30 Defense Day Cream.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;  GG</li>
