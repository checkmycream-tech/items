            <li>THIS IS GREAT.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush for my son.  </li>

            <li>My kids really love using these toothbrushes and that makes me really happy!</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The best part the kid will enjoy brushing.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it.</li>
            <li>Just loved it.</li>
            <li>but this one does not have a great brush shape for that kind of brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Great for getting kids to brush longer and better.</li>
            <li>The parents comment was that he liked it.</li>
            <li>The child used, feeling pretty good, very love!</li>
            <li>I have both my 3 year olds and 2 year old happily using these toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>These work great and make brushing time fun for our daughter.  </li>
            <li>Also makes me feel better that the brush is moving when she does her teeth on her own because maybe it&#x27;s helping to reach areas she might miss otherwise.  </li>
            <li>My son Is two years old and has just decided after being wonderful at letting me brush his teeth he no longer likes it.</li>
            <li>He loves how clean his teeth feel after using this brush and actually wants to brush his teeth, which is a win for Mom!</li>
            <li>it is more of a pretend electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Better off just buying it at the store.</li>
            <li>The Colgates suit him better at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great and keeps my sons teeth super clean</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Description needs to be more accurate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a favorite brush in my house by a huge Sponge Bob fan.</li>
            <li>This works great for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>my kid love the color and it works well by making his teeth clean</li>
            <li>Since it electric and kids loves electric stuff it makes it easy to brush.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be working fine.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>and he loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;only thing i didnt like</li>
            <li>Fun and easy to use for kids who are learning how to bush.</li>
            <li>The color was different and apart from that its a good purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not writing up a full review since the proof is in the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than the color of the toothbrush, it works great.</li>
            <li>it is a cool gimmick that the kids will like, and maybe get them to brush more, but as an effective tooth cleaner, or as an electric tooth brush.. it is not really.</li>
            <li>Ran out of batteries too quick.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts as long as toothbrush is good for.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised ,baby love it .</li>
            <li>MY child loves it because it is spongebob and because it &amp;#34; Brushes her teeth for her&amp;#34; Parents should give their child something they may enjoy like this because now it seems like my child wants to brush her teeth every minute ...</li>
            <li>But it made my 10 year old WANT to brush his teeth, so with that said, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After a while the bristles get soft but that happens to most bruches anyhow.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for a couple who has an eight-year old son and since it was battery-operated, I thought it could be more fun.  </li>
            <li>This didnt bother me because i read the description and also my two year old son isnt picky :)</li>
            <li>If you are steadfast on something particular, than dont order where it says this....</li>
            <li>My little boy really love this~ :-)</li>
            <li>The only way it could be better is if it had a off timer.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush made brushing fun and that was the whole point.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>This is a very efficient toothbrush with one of my daughters fave characters!</li>
            <li>GREAT for my one year old , the bristle are soft enough for him .</li>
            <li>I tried a child&#x27;s Sonicare for my son (I use an adult Sonicare), but he was kind of intimidated by its power, even on a low setting.</li>
            <li>friends of my daughter like the toothbrush very much, so I bought too much.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve owned these Colgate powered kids&#x27; toothbrushes, you&#x27;ll know that the scrubbing action is pretty mild, but I feel that at this age they can use all the help they can get with cleaning their teeth.</li>
            <li>The description did say colors and styles might vary, so I can&#x27;t say I wasn&#x27;t warned, but whoever thought of an orange color scheme for SpongeBob, pretty much the yellowest character around?</li>
            <li>The brush is a perfect size for little hands to grasp, the head consists of  round rotating bristles on top and standard non rotating bristles on bottom.</li>
            <li>The handle has an on and off switch made of a rubber material and each brush comes with a battery making it ready to use immediately.</li>
            <li>It cleaned his teeth really well</li>
            <li>I am very strict on dental hygiene</li>
            <li>and I had to think of something fast</li>
            <li>sparked!&lt;br /&gt;-he feels self sufficient and independent brushing his own teeth while at the same time I can relax knowing his is being aided in the process.</li>
            <li>IT IS NOT TOO LOUD AND VERY GENTLE FOR THEIR TEETH.</li>
            <li>and it has got extra soft bristles and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>Will just have to turn the actual phone next time. :-)</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think they clean his teeth too well because it is extra soft.</li>
            <li>We originally tried the Sonicare version (see my other review) but the vibrations were too intense for my 4.5 yr old boy.  </li>
            <li>I had to update this review from 3 to 4 stars because we gave it another shot and the new ones worked a lot longer.</li>
            <li>Brand new out of the package, new batteries and hasn&#x27;t worked once.  </li>
            <li>:D. She loves her new tooth brush..</li>
            <li>We tried replacing the batteries with a new set but in vain.</li>
            <li>Previous electric tooth brushes I&#x27;ve bought the batteries have been going strong for 3+ months.</li>
            <li>Bristles get rough pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Its a decent brush, the spin action is gentle enough not to hurt soft gums.</li>
            <li>It did not work and my 7-yr old was in tears.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we expected.</li>
            <li>it is a bit big for my sons mouth, but he is two years old.</li>
            <li>this case, I was able to show just how poorly the product works through the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>batterys runs out very fast,the toothbush stop running in less than a month after opening .</li>

            <li> is the batteries didnt last as long as i thought they would.</li>
            <li> You have to actually scrub with it just like any other regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> not really the tooth brushes fault but something to consider!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT FOR MY TWO VERY SMALL DOGS.  </li>
            <li> so I am assuming that little kids havent been playing with it like what happens when you buy stuff in the store.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> they still lasted a few weeks though.</li>
            <li> One came to me completely dead.</li>
            <li> It will be a waste to throw away the brush when the bristles go all wonky</li>
            <li> We usually swap them out once a month because kids are hard on their toothbrushes (chewing them, dropping them)</li>
            <li> It made my son&#x27;s gums bleed and is very hard on this teeth.</li>
            <li> However after a month the batteries failed.</li>
            <li> So disappointing!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Description states that it has a rotating head. But it does not rotate like the spinbrush. It only vibrates. Description needs to be more accurate.</li>
            <li> batterys runs out very fast,the toothbush stop running in less than a month after opening . The battery in Oral-B can hold for 3 months,</li>
            <li> The child used, feeling pretty good, very love!</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush. Exactly what we expected. The only way it could be better is if it had a off timer. But it made my 10 year old WANT to brush his teeth, so with that said, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Gives my son motivation to brush his teeth</li>
            <li> Bristles get rough pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Its a decent brush, the spin action is gentle enough not to hurt soft gums. The only 2 improvements i could suggest are softer bristles and replaceable heads. It will be a waste to throw away the brush when the bristles go all wonky</li>
            <li> I had to update this review from 3 to 4 stars because we gave it another shot and the new ones worked a lot longer. After a while the bristles get soft but that happens to most bruches anyhow.</li>
            <li> The kid loves them but I don&#x27;t think they clean his teeth too well because it is extra soft.</li>
            <li> my kid love the color and it works well by making his teeth clean</li>
            <li> Since it electric and kids loves electric stuff it makes it easy to brush. The best part the kid will enjoy brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
            <li> This works great for my 6 year old. He loves how clean his teeth feel after using this brush and actually wants to brush his teeth, which is a win for Mom!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome. My daughter loved it. Its so simple to use and it has got extra soft bristles and easy to grip. Just loved it. Will definitely recommend to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Just what my daughter needed!</li>
            <li> Ran out of batteries too quick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a couple who has an eight-year old son and since it was battery-operated, I thought it could be more fun.  The parents comment was that he liked it.</li>
            <li> Great for getting kids to brush longer and better.This tooth brush made brushing fun and that was the whole point.</li>
            <li> give it to my brother</li>
            <li> A necessity for the kids. character is great...delivered on time</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this toothbrush. It does a great job, and works well. We received the &amp;#34;Patrick&amp;#34; designed toothbrush with our order, and it is blue.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT.  I ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT FOR MY TWO VERY SMALL DOGS.  IT IS NOT TOO LOUD AND VERY GENTLE FOR THEIR TEETH.</li>
            <li> great tooth brush , for my grandson !!!</li>
            <li> My son loves it. They have all kinda characters and my son has 5 of them already.</li>
            <li> Kids like sponge bob, This is a tooth brush that vibrates but not in a way that scrubs or cleans the teeth,  it is more of a pretend electric toothbrush. You have to actually scrub with it just like any other regular toothbrush but this one does not have a great brush shape for that kind of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;So it is a cool gimmick that the kids will like, and maybe get them to brush more, but as an effective tooth cleaner, or as an electric tooth brush.. it is not really.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Brand new out of the package, new batteries and hasn&#x27;t worked once.  Might as well have thrown that 5 bucks in the trashcan.  So disappointing!  Would have given 0 stars if possible.</li>
            <li> We originally tried the Sonicare version (see my other review) but the vibrations were too intense for my 4.5 yr old boy.  This one seems to be working fine.  We&#x27;ve had it for a week and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Very surprised ,baby love it .</li>
            <li> My kids really love using these toothbrushes and that makes me really happy! The brush is a perfect size for little hands to grasp, the head consists of  round rotating bristles on top and standard non rotating bristles on bottom. The handle has an on and off switch made of a rubber material and each brush comes with a battery making it ready to use immediately. It&#x27;s a favorite brush in my house by a huge Sponge Bob fan. I have both my 3 year olds and 2 year old happily using these toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> Its soooo good! My little boy really love this~ :-)</li>
            <li> The product is for my child.. I thought it sung... but It doesn&#x27;t. I received an orange not blue one. MY child loves it because it is spongebob and because it &amp;#34; Brushes her teeth for her&amp;#34; Parents should give their child something they may enjoy like this because now it seems like my child wants to brush her teeth every minute ... :D. She loves her new tooth brush.. Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> I ordered a pack of 1 and received this in blue not yellow like the default picture shows.</li>
            <li> My stepson loves it.  He is never one to be eager to brush his teeth until this toothbrush arrived.</li>
            <li> I am giving this two stars because what I received is not what is pictured here. My daughter picked this one because she likes the color blue and she likes Gary on it. What Amazon sent me was an orange one with only Spongebob. It took a lot of coaxing to get her to use it. Other than the color of the toothbrush, it works great.</li>
            <li> It cleaned his teeth really well and he loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;only thing i didnt like is the batteries didnt last as long as i thought they would. they still lasted a few weeks though.</li>
            <li> This is a very efficient toothbrush with one of my daughters fave characters!</li>
            <li> One came to me completely dead. Better off just buying it at the store.</li>
            <li> If you have replace the head.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for my son.  Works well, great price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is perfectly fine. If you&#x27;ve owned these Colgate powered kids&#x27; toothbrushes, you&#x27;ll know that the scrubbing action is pretty mild, but I feel that at this age they can use all the help they can get with cleaning their teeth. (My son&#x27;s 8 and has never had a cavity, so maybe it&#x27;s working!) I tried a child&#x27;s Sonicare for my son (I use an adult Sonicare), but he was kind of intimidated by its power, even on a low setting. The Colgates suit him better at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted a star because the one we got is orange, not yellow. The description did say colors and styles might vary, so I can&#x27;t say I wasn&#x27;t warned, but whoever thought of an orange color scheme for SpongeBob, pretty much the yellowest character around? Anyway, if you order this, don&#x27;t get your heart set on the brush that&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of this. It made my son&#x27;s gums bleed and is very hard on this teeth. I would not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> The color was different and apart from that its a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately as my kid dropped the brush within a day, the spinner stopped working.</li>
            <li> friends of my daughter like the toothbrush very much, so I bought too much.</li>
            <li> It did not work and my 7-yr old was in tears. We tried replacing the batteries with a new set but in vain.</li>
            <li> It works great and keeps my sons teeth super clean</li>
            <li> My kids brushed their teeth twice a day. However after a month the batteries failed. I replaced them with an AA battery however the batter would only last a month.  Previous electric tooth brushes I&#x27;ve bought the batteries have been going strong for 3+ months.</li>
            <li> Good product. My son enjoys brushing his teeth with this toothbrush. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> These work great and make brushing time fun for our daughter.  Also makes me feel better that the brush is moving when she does her teeth on her own because maybe it&#x27;s helping to reach areas she might miss otherwise.  Battery lasts as long as toothbrush is good for.  We usually swap them out once a month because kids are hard on their toothbrushes (chewing them, dropping them)</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo15MH7NCEE2N22]]This is the second time we tried a Colgate electric toothbrush, and both products broke almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, I was able to show just how poorly the product works through the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not writing up a full review since the proof is in the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize for it appearing sideways, I don&#x27;t know how to rotate movie images.  Will just have to turn the actual phone next time. :-)</li>
            <li> My son Is two years old and has just decided after being wonderful at letting me brush his teeth he no longer likes it. I am very strict on dental hygiene and I had to think of something fast so i ordered this toothbrush to spark his interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;-interest sparked!&lt;br /&gt;-he feels self sufficient and independent brushing his own teeth while at the same time I can relax knowing his is being aided in the process. I still do an initial run through, but leave him to feel like he is grown up and brushing along side me&lt;br /&gt;-It seems to work well, batteries are working great. I bought mine through amazon so I am assuming that little kids havent been playing with it like what happens when you buy stuff in the store. I saw another review about batteries dying, and no wonder if you get it where others have been messing and playing with the buttons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- it is a bit big for my sons mouth, but he is two years old. not really the tooth brushes fault but something to consider!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;side note:&lt;br /&gt;This got knocked in reviews by some because of the color of the toothbrush is different than displayed. Amazon has some products like this and they say in the description that colors may vary. If you are steadfast on something particular, than dont order where it says this....&lt;br /&gt;the one that I got was yellow and a just spongebob. This didnt bother me because i read the description and also my two year old son isnt picky :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for $7 its a steal to encourage teeth brushing!</li>
            <li> GREAT for my one year old , the bristle are soft enough for him . Fun and easy to use for kids who are learning how to bush.</li>
