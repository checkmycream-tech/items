            <li>It is still one of the best men&#x27;s colognes ever made</li>
            <li>so I was very happy to find it.</li>
            <li>, i buy it here on amazon, from Parfum1 seller, great package and they also put sample of wonderful Jean Marc Sinan \\&quot;Lune\\&quot; for women, which i give to my sister.</li>

            <li>Lovely fragrance, if you like it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but, honestly, can we accurately remember a scent?  </li>
            <li>love  </li>
            <li>iv&#x27;e been using Oscar Pour Lui By Oscar De Renta for Many Years.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;IT SMELLS LIKE A REALLY NICE CLEAN SOAP.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light cologne with a fragrance that is fresh and clean, yet warm and sexy!  </li>
            <li>I used to wear this cologne for about 15 years straight as my \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot; and always loved it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, I do still like it and it DOES smell better to me than most of the more modern offerings.  </li>
            <li>Well, I surprised her with this Pour Lui purchase and when she came up to me and smelled this cologne on me and said \\&quot;Man, you really smell GOOD!  </li>
            <li>I long been an admirer of this great fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells so unique</li>
            <li>This is a knock off of the original.  </li>
            <li>Original was discontinued 3 yrs ago.  </li>
            <li>Price and quick delivery are a plus.</li>
            <li>appealing, I finally ordered this \\&quot;oldie\\&quot; in protest to see if it was still as appealing as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>If you love the smell, like I do, pay a little more from a reputable seller.</li>
            <li>i never try before Oscar de la Renta products, but i wanted some serious, maybe classic toilette spray, so when i find this, i liked the design and good reviews (</li>
            <li>It smelled too strong like old men.</li>
            <li>I like it so much I am ordering from another seller!</li>
            <li>but as long as it still smells GOOD (which it does...), is different from today&#x27;s mostly similar-to-each-other offerings (it is...), and generates a few compliments (so far, so good...), I can live with that.  </li>
            <li>Strong and lasting fragrance .</li>
            <li>Who really knows for certain?</li>
            <li>thanks them)</li>
            <li>but i really like it</li>
            <li>This is NOT the real deal.</li>
            <li>Every time, she says she really likes it and, \\&quot;Mmmm, you smell so good\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY</li>
            <li>This Eau de toilette is my father bought it and liked it a lot and have bought several times and always smells the same,</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this fragrance than any other.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my significant other&#x27;s favorite and only cologne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years and will continue to as long as it&#x27;s available</li>
            <li>This is something I have been using for over 10 years,  I find the lady&#x27;s like this on me as long as it is used lightly.</li>
            <li>For unknown reasons, I got away from it for another 10 years and actually pretty much stopped wearing cologne altogether for the past few years, though I kind of missed having a special scent sometimes.  </li>
            <li>She seems to be as particular as I am about men&#x27;s cologne only in a different way and with a taste that varies slightly from my own, at times.  </li>
            <li>Fades immediately and is completely gone in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>MASCULINE AND NOTICEABLE BUT</li>
            <li>It did not smell right, and then the scent only lasted a short time.  </li>
            <li>, my initial impression (after wearing it for 3 days) is that either my sense of this cologne has changed over the years or it is slightly less appealing than it used to be in its current blend of ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I will say that I know it&#x27;s not my body chemistry that&#x27;s causing me to perceive it differently because, when it first arrived, I sprayed it only on the box it came in and not on myself.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She&#x27;s kept coming back for more sniffs and whiffs for the next few days (and nights).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, the big test was to be whether my wife would like it or shoot it down as she has so many other candidates.  </li>
            <li>One had a broken top and lost part of the product.</li>

            <li> This is hard to find in stores.  </li>

            <li> Lovely fragrance, if you like it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the condition the product was in when I received it.  I ordered two bottles of Oscar.  One had a broken top and lost part of the product. Also, they were tester bottles!!!  I bought them to give them for gifts, but had to keep them myself.  They both were missing their tops, and came in plain boxes. Their service was fast, but I was very unhappy.</li>
            <li> This product is superb. Sprayer works over the lifetime of the product. I get more compliments on this fragrance than any other. Price and quick delivery are a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years and will continue to as long as it&#x27;s available and I continue to get compliments.</li>
            <li> i never try before Oscar de la Renta products, but i wanted some serious, maybe classic toilette spray, so when i find this, i liked the design and good reviews (thanks them) i decided to try this and never regret about this decision, can&#x27;t explain the scent but i really like it, i buy it here on amazon, from Parfum1 seller, great package and they also put sample of wonderful Jean Marc Sinan \\&quot;Lune\\&quot; for women, which i give to my sister.</li>
            <li> the worst perfume which I ever had... please do not make the same mistake, it has 5 stars but believe its the worst thing which you could buy on amazon</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this Oscar de la Renta cologne! A friend has been searching in all the retail stores in our area because she so loves the scent on her husband.  It&#x27;s a light cologne with a fragrance that is fresh and clean, yet warm and sexy!  Any man should be happy to receive this Eau de Toilette as a gift.</li>
            <li> I long been an admirer of this great fragrance. This is NOT the real deal. Do not under any circumstances order from these sellers or you will be greatly dissatified. VERY weak with just a hint of the orginal. Fades immediately and is completely gone in 10 minutes. If you love the smell, like I do, pay a little more from a reputable seller. I like it so much I am ordering from another seller!</li>
            <li> Very lovely scent. Goes well with the well groomed man. Thumbs up.👍👍👍</li>
            <li> I was wearing this cologne when I met my wife 28 years ago.  She still loves it and me.  Man, I make good choices!</li>
            <li> Husband loves this and this is about the only place I can find it for him</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell. It smelled too strong like old men. Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is quite different from the same fragance meda in France. Is good also.</li>
            <li> I love it. It smells so unique and i&#x27;ve never smelled anything like it bofore.</li>
            <li> It is still one of the best men&#x27;s colognes ever made</li>

            <li> excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho, el precio es adecuado a la calidad del producto, llegó sin problemas, sin daños y en excelente estado, inclusive la caja exterior venia bien sellada</li>

            <li> This is hard to find in stores.  It&#x27;s my significant other&#x27;s favorite and only cologne so I was very happy to find it.</li>
            <li> Great  Women  love  the  scent......</li>
            <li> This is a knock off of the original.  Original was discontinued 3 yrs ago.  This does come close to the scent of Pour Lui.  I have used it for 50 years and this ain&#x27;t it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product marketed is identical to the store, excellent material, very durable and meets my expectations, the quality of the article is very good and excellent brand</li>
