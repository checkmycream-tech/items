            <li>oprah likes it, its somewhat pricey so it must be the best, i thought.  </li>
            <li>The texture, to me, was perfect.    </li>

            <li>This is the BEST moisturizer ever!!!  </li>

            <li>This moisterizer is great.</li>
            <li>it worked out great...</li>
            <li>The service was great just not the product</li>
            <li>awesome product and the most amazing customer service I have ever had</li>
            <li>It really is good and good for men also.</li>
            <li>I love, love this moisturizer!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love it and don&#x27;t want to use anything else!</li>
            <li>not horrible, but not so much pleasant either.  </li>
            <li>So I think it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li>Try it and make your own decision.</li>
            <li>I have never had any kind of reaction to any cosmetic in my life until this.</li>
            <li>The creamy texture feels nice</li>
            <li>It would be nice if this cream was non-scented.</li>
            <li>I think it has a light pleasant scent, and feels lightweight yet moisturizing-</li>
            <li>great product and worth the money.</li>
            <li>a good,hydrated kind of way)i am very happy with it and will most likely purchase this again</li>
            <li>i would recommend this to everyone who wants more beautiful skin and it will not break your face out.  </li>
            <li>and i love the way my face cleared up.</li>
            <li>Besides that , it made my skin feel better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>my face feels softer and more plump(in</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to put more on after 10 mins.</li>
            <li>I have been using Philosophy for many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I received a sample of this from sephora after hearing and reading about it for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is good for many people, but it is not for everyone, so if you try it for the first time, do a patch test before putting it all over your face.</li>
            <li>So far my mom is  happy with this gift.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it makes my skin feel softer and it&#x27;s pretty nice, but it doesn&#x27;t do much more than my Mary Kay or drugstore moisturizers can do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy a full size jar of this...</li>
            <li>if you try it, I know it will probably be fine for a lot of people but the ones that it isn&#x27;t will suffer a lot.  </li>
            <li>I hope they will test the product to see what is causing a lot of people to itch and make some adjustment so we can enjoy it again.</li>
            <li>The texture is light and airy.</li>
            <li>product is awesome and the price was ok but next time I plan on buying a bigger portion :)</li>
            <li>It has a neat texture, kind of  a \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; feel, but it just didn&#x27;t do that much for me.</li>
            <li>I even quit using my clarisonic for a month just to see if using philosphy products really work well on their own.</li>
            <li>cream makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li>A very fresh, clean feeling for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product because of all of the reviews stating how well it works.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure weather</li>
            <li>and I would not recommend it just because I rarely breakout!</li>
            <li>I originally got a 2 oz.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 1 week of using hope in a jar my skin was incredibly soft and looked amazing.</li>
            <li>i bought the .5 oz jar just to try it and used the whole jar, but dont plan to buy any more of it.  </li>
            <li>Have a bottle full and Don&#x27;t know what to do with it...switching to Biotherm for now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft smell that is kind of floral.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin with mild scarring.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Maybe it does more for older skin.</li>
            <li>I typically use Biore or Neutrogena skin care products, but the Sephora rep hooked me into buying a trial size of the Purity cleanser (which is great),</li>
            <li>having a single pimple would have been surprising.</li>
            <li>I do like the Purity cream cleanser because my face feels really fresh after I use it.  </li>
            <li>But so far I love all I have tried.</li>
            <li>After I received my order I&#x27;d have to say its worth it.</li>
            <li>However, I just don&#x27;t feel this lotion is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I tried this product after using some of Philosphy&#x27;s other products and loved them.  </li>
            <li>I heard so much about this product and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too excited to pay so much.</li>
            <li>Size is just right, and the price was right to sample.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, and there are no dry areas.</li>
            <li>you know the first thing people see when they look at you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only bought the smallest jar.</li>
            <li>Well, sure enough, I woke up this morning to a burning face.</li>
            <li>The morning after I first used this product, I noticed a rash on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strage since this is the first thing I&#x27;m allergic to (besides poison ivy).    </li>
            <li>this product does exactly what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li>it gives the skin a younger, more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long, and it doesn&#x27;t work that great.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking about buying this product, get a sample first and do a test.</li>
            <li>I bought this product (and a hair product from another company) last week after reading the many positive reviews of it.</li>
            <li>I found this adorable little thing in a Christmas box for $10 at a store and decided to give it a shot, even though I have been a loyal user of a great French facial cream for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one complaint is the smell, since my traditional cream smells lovely like berries and this one smells rather like just-cut grass or something earthy and not that pleasant...</li>
            <li>I was looking for this product to reorder it since I like it and it made my skin feel free and light unlike other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My T Zone area is actually more dry now then before the product.</li>
            <li>i had heard so much about this product in various different places that i considered not buying it just because i thought ther was no way it could live up to all the hype, but i was pleasantly suprised.</li>
            <li>By last night, I had huge itchy welts on a large portion of my face.</li>
            <li>It does go on smoothly, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big change in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, I rarely ever have a pimple and am allergic to absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I got caught up in the name of this product and it didn&#x27;t really deliver and neither did the product description.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face 7 hours ago and it is still very noticeable...</li>
            <li>i thought i would try hope in a jar, well because of all the hype really.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was breaking out and didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really use the product now</li>
            <li>very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>REALLY??  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, the arm I put the Philosophy product on developed a rash.</li>
            <li>to be truthful, i have used other products that i think work just as well that i bought at walmart.  </li>
            <li>I was new to the philosophy line of products and was so excited to use it finally.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was stored properly, shipped properly or even if the product is truly authentic...</li>
            <li>I too bought this product with high expectations.</li>
            <li>I love that its not a thick heavy cream.</li>
            <li>I use the face wash and hope in a jar everyday and love my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a new user of Philosophy Brand products  -</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>, I get compliments on my skin, people usually do not notice I have rosacea and do not believe I&#x27;m 51.</li>
            <li>Well, last night I tried Hope in a Jar for the first time in about a week.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer usually makes my skin more oily as the day goes on, but I didn&#x27;t see this with Hope in a Jar.</li>
            <li>It not only moisturizes, but it offers so many other benefits..</li>
            <li>Soon after, I bought the large jar for a big price!</li>
            <li>I have consistently clear skin so</li>
            <li>I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin, and I definitely do not want to leave the house as my face and eyes are completely swollen, unbearably itchy, and a shade of intense purplish-red that I didn&#x27;t know existed heretofore.  </li>
            <li>I have never in my life had sensitive skin and this product in combination with time in a bottle</li>
            <li>I do NOT have sensitive skin and never have had.</li>
            <li>Hi, my daughter gave me this product as a present, and I&#x27;ve been using it without a problem, I had no read the reviews, and did not know much about the product except what my daughter had told me about it.</li>
            <li>but really, everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t know which ingredient caused the allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>received it early...</li>
            <li>Its slides on nice and thin</li>
            <li>I do not have overly sensitive skin; it&#x27;s actually fairly normal and definitely not prone to breakouts or blemishes of any sort....do not get this product.</li>
            <li>Great product but very expensive.</li>
            <li>I am now on day 3 or 4 and the redness is somewhat fading but the itching is intense, skin is so rough yet, and my eyes - especially the lids, are like triple in normal puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I developed some sort of  reaction that made my face and neck itchy and red.</li>
            <li>I plan to use up the rest of what I have and switch back to my old skin care regime.</li>
            <li>Just 5 months later I noticed a marked difference in my face.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes okay, but not great.</li>
            <li>I have very fare sensitive skin, and get mild break outs, so philosophy is right on the money with the delivery of their products.and to the people who are writing bad reviews...</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, it had a slight funky smell to it.</li>
            <li>skin normally gets dry and flaky in the winter but this has stopped my face from flaking away!</li>
            <li>I never would have imagined this product would have such an effect, in spite of my highly sensitive skin, but after closer further review, I see that I am not alone!&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday</li>
            <li>I was skeptical because my skin is sensitive to so many things.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used this product for one day, and woke up this morning with my face hot and red, swelling and little bumps all over.</li>
            <li>I have the small .5 oz jar, and for $30 (the set) was WELL worth it and has last a couple months!</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the negative comments, but in my opinion it&#x27;s a chemical reaction to everyone skin type, as much as I may smell a perfume on someone and like and try it on myself</li>

            <li> I thought I was breaking out and didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really use the product now</li>
            <li> very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> REALLY??  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, the arm I put the Philosophy product on developed a rash.</li>
            <li> to be truthful, i have used other products that i think work just as well that i bought at walmart.  </li>
            <li> I was new to the philosophy line of products and was so excited to use it finally.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was stored properly, shipped properly or even if the product is truly authentic...</li>
            <li> I too bought this product with high expectations.</li>
            <li> I love that its not a thick heavy cream.</li>
            <li> I use the face wash and hope in a jar everyday and love my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a new user of Philosophy Brand products  -</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> , I get compliments on my skin, people usually do not notice I have rosacea and do not believe I&#x27;m 51.</li>
            <li> Well, last night I tried Hope in a Jar for the first time in about a week.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer usually makes my skin more oily as the day goes on, but I didn&#x27;t see this with Hope in a Jar.</li>
            <li> It not only moisturizes, but it offers so many other benefits..</li>
            <li> Soon after, I bought the large jar for a big price!</li>
            <li> I have consistently clear skin so</li>
            <li> I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin, and I definitely do not want to leave the house as my face and eyes are completely swollen, unbearably itchy, and a shade of intense purplish-red that I didn&#x27;t know existed heretofore.  </li>
            <li> I have never in my life had sensitive skin and this product in combination with time in a bottle</li>
            <li> I do NOT have sensitive skin and never have had.</li>
            <li> Hi, my daughter gave me this product as a present, and I&#x27;ve been using it without a problem, I had no read the reviews, and did not know much about the product except what my daughter had told me about it.</li>
            <li> but really, everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t know which ingredient caused the allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> received it early...</li>
            <li> Its slides on nice and thin</li>
            <li> I do not have overly sensitive skin; it&#x27;s actually fairly normal and definitely not prone to breakouts or blemishes of any sort....do not get this product.</li>
            <li> Great product but very expensive.</li>
            <li> I am now on day 3 or 4 and the redness is somewhat fading but the itching is intense, skin is so rough yet, and my eyes - especially the lids, are like triple in normal puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I developed some sort of  reaction that made my face and neck itchy and red.</li>
            <li> I plan to use up the rest of what I have and switch back to my old skin care regime.</li>
            <li> Just 5 months later I noticed a marked difference in my face.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes okay, but not great.</li>
            <li> I have very fare sensitive skin, and get mild break outs, so philosophy is right on the money with the delivery of their products.and to the people who are writing bad reviews...</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, it had a slight funky smell to it.</li>
            <li> skin normally gets dry and flaky in the winter but this has stopped my face from flaking away!</li>
            <li> I never would have imagined this product would have such an effect, in spite of my highly sensitive skin, but after closer further review, I see that I am not alone!&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because my skin is sensitive to so many things.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used this product for one day, and woke up this morning with my face hot and red, swelling and little bumps all over.</li>
            <li> I have the small .5 oz jar, and for $30 (the set) was WELL worth it and has last a couple months!</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the negative comments, but in my opinion it&#x27;s a chemical reaction to everyone skin type, as much as I may smell a perfume on someone and like and try it on myself</li>
            <li> and it is not heavy like other moisturizers, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last that long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyes got dry flaky, swollen and red.</li>
            <li> and it lingers for a really long time.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was uber excited to start using it.    </li>
            <li> Now mind you the rosacea cream lots of time makes my skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer flaky dry.</li>
            <li> This product has some great potential but the smell was so awful I threw it away...</li>
            <li> My main complaint is the \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li> after using other philosophy skin care products for a long time.</li>
            <li> After half a day my face was beet red, swollen, so so itchy, and had a gravel (rough) texture, and my eyes so swollen.  </li>
            <li> It bums me out because this stuff would be so great if it didn&#x27;t smell awful!</li>
            <li> I was curious to try this out since I somewhat routinely use the Hope in a Tinted Moisturizer foundation before work.</li>
            <li> My doctor advised me to go to an urgent care center -- they gave me prednisone to take.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t leave you sticky feeling like other creams do.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this moisturizer, I have other products by philosophy</li>
            <li> From the DAY I started using the set, I have not had one patch of dry skin, even around my eyebrows which were a common dry place when stressed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the retinol since I am nursing, but I have been using the other two products a week and a half now.  </li>
            <li> Like something sour ..</li>
            <li> VERY alarming!</li>
            <li> although it did give me some slight tingling feeling every time I put it on.     </li>
            <li> I like the way it goes on-- not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> what a waste.</li>
            <li> My skin feels raw with an inconsolable burning itch.</li>
            <li> gave me a dermititis allergic skin reaction, blotches of red itchy scaly rash on face and neck, not what you want from an expensive skin care product...</li>
            <li> I just got a small jar of this as part of a Philosophy holiday kit.</li>
            <li> if you are thinking about buying it, i would recommend buying the small jar and just seeing what you think.</li>
            <li> When I went in to see my Skin specialist a week after my small trial size was done...</li>
            <li> No more oily/dry areas.</li>
            <li> It also smells weird, and the smell lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer when they say that the bad reviews must be coming from competitors or repeat reviewers, because like I said, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Well I have rosacea, and very sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m also smells trigger my allergy symptoms badly.</li>
            <li> Also, it has an off-putting \\&quot;fishy\\&quot; scent which was hard to ignore.</li>
            <li> It smelled icky, but I figured the scent would fade.  </li>
            <li> It is not as silky and thick as I need for winter.</li>
            <li> I mean BURNING.</li>
            <li> and I am afraid it will only get worse.</li>
            <li> only reason I can think some people do not like the scent is because it is in a jar and fingers dipped in the jar may leave behind bacteria that over time may smell unpleasant.</li>
            <li> the jar of hope was practically empty, smelled bad and did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> It just got worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> The product was somewhat dried out when I got it, which was disappointing since it is a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The day after that, I had difficulty breathing all night and the rash got worse.</li>
            <li> Today, the reaction is even worse, in spite of the fact that I&#x27;ve taken 2 antihistamine doses.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as what other people are reviewing it to be though.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy because of the bad reviews</li>
            <li> I too had a horrible allergic reaction to this skin cream, with a red, itchy rash on my face...</li>
            <li> However after a week of use my skin has a horrible red pimple like rash!</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that I cannot use any of the philosophy products as it makes my skin and eyes itchy.</li>
            <li> also, the smell is weird, as some others had alluded to.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t you might be sorry like me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this moisturizer stinks.  </li>
            <li> All that aside the product stinks.  </li>
            <li> but it stinks really bad.</li>
            <li> and I have not had a bad reaction from any philosophy</li>
            <li> It got so bad</li>
            <li> the reason for the bad review-</li>
            <li> It was so bad</li>
            <li> Was quite disappointed - this was a gift and nowhere in the description</li>
            <li> like I rubbed poison ivy leaves all over it. :(</li>
            <li> It eventually cleared, but face itched like crazy and was in HORRIBLE shape.</li>
            <li> it makes my rosacea so so bad!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and the jar seemed to be opened and used.</li>
            <li> It looks like I have a horrible case of acne</li>
            <li> , it is terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wish I could give zero stars for this product.  I too had a horrible allergic reaction to this skin cream, with a red, itchy rash on my face...you know the first thing people see when they look at you.  I do not have overly sensitive skin; it&#x27;s actually fairly normal and definitely not prone to breakouts or blemishes of any sort....do not get this product.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life had sensitive skin and this product in combination with time in a bottle gave me a dermititis allergic skin reaction, blotches of red itchy scaly rash on face and neck, not what you want from an expensive skin care product...</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received a sample of this from sephora after hearing and reading about it for years. However, after two uses I had to toss this....I developed some sort of  reaction that made my face and neck itchy and red. Never have had a reaction like this to skin cream.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using this product for a week and I already see a difference. I was a little hesitant to buy because of the bad reviews but I&#x27;ve been using the philosophy face wash \\&quot;purity\\&quot; for about 6 months and i love the way my face cleared up. I have very fare sensitive skin, and get mild break outs, so philosophy is right on the money with the delivery of their products.and to the people who are writing bad reviews...I agree with another reviewer when they say that the bad reviews must be coming from competitors or repeat reviewers, because like I said, I have very sensitive skin and I have not had a bad reaction from any philosophy product.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The smell is NOT bad&lt;br /&gt;100% recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product after using some of Philosphy&#x27;s other products and loved them.  This is a horse of another color though.  BUYER BEWARE is all I can say.  After half a day my face was beet red, swollen, so so itchy, and had a gravel (rough) texture, and my eyes so swollen.  I am now on day 3 or 4 and the redness is somewhat fading but the itching is intense, skin is so rough yet, and my eyes - especially the lids, are like triple in normal puffiness.  All that aside the product stinks.  I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.  Best of luck if you try it, I know it will probably be fine for a lot of people but the ones that it isn&#x27;t will suffer a lot.  Keep in mind I do NOT have sensitive skin and never have had.</li>
            <li> I too bought this product with high expectations. However after a week of use my skin has a horrible red pimple like rash! My T Zone area is actually more dry now then before the product. I will stick with my $5.00 Ponds</li>
            <li> I typically use Biore or Neutrogena skin care products, but the Sephora rep hooked me into buying a trial size of the Purity cleanser (which is great), Hope in a Jar moisturizer and the Help Me retinol treatment.  I can&#x27;t use the retinol since I am nursing, but I have been using the other two products a week and a half now.  I do like the Purity cream cleanser because my face feels really fresh after I use it.  I am on the fence about the Hope in a Jar.  My main complaint is the \\&quot;wet dog\\&quot; smell.  It does go on smoothly, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big change in my complexion.  I wish it had sunscreen in it too, like my fave Oil of Olay moisturizer.  Bottom line: I plan to use up the rest of what I have and switch back to my old skin care regime.</li>
            <li> Hi, my daughter gave me this product as a present, and I&#x27;ve been using it without a problem, I had no read the reviews, and did not know much about the product except what my daughter had told me about it. Well I have rosacea, and very sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m also smells trigger my allergy symptoms badly. I was looking for this product to reorder it since I like it and it made my skin feel free and light unlike other creams I&#x27;ve tried. Now mind you the rosacea cream lots of time makes my skin extremely dry. I was surprised by the negative comments, but in my opinion it&#x27;s a chemical reaction to everyone skin type, as much as I may smell a perfume on someone and like and try it on myself and it does not smell the same. So I think it&#x27;s a nice product, I get compliments on my skin, people usually do not notice I have rosacea and do not believe I&#x27;m 51. Try it and make your own decision.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product because of all of the reviews stating how well it works.  I washed my face with the Purity cleanser and then applied this moisturizer.  It smelled icky, but I figured the scent would fade.  It didn&#x27;t.  It just got worse and worse.  The scent is a cross between moldy musty laundry and rotten food.  It got so bad I had to wash my face an hour later to get rid of it; it was giving me a headache.  I&#x27;m glad I bought the sample size, because this stuff is too expensive to throw in the trash.  There&#x27;s no way I could have worn this and gone out in public; I couldn&#x27;t even stand to be around myself.  Yuck!</li>
            <li> It made my face feel moisturized but it stinks really bad. Like something sour .. and it lingers for a really long time. Besides that , it made my skin feel better. Nothing has changed in looks but it feels aight when you put it on. If you can get pass that smell.</li>
            <li> So far my mom is  happy with this gift.  I was happy with the way it was sent and will continue shopping here.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s a lightweight moisturizer. Not greasy or oily. Size is just right, and the price was right to sample. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> i had heard so much about this product in various different places that i considered not buying it just because i thought ther was no way it could live up to all the hype, but i was pleasantly suprised. my face feels softer and more plump(in a good,hydrated kind of way)i am very happy with it and will most likely purchase this again</li>
            <li> I bought Hope in a Jar because I needed a moisurizer that was a step above what I can find at the store. I got caught up in the name of this product and it didn&#x27;t really deliver and neither did the product description. I don&#x27;t see a difference and I have used the moisturizer daily for almost a month. Also, it has an off-putting \\&quot;fishy\\&quot; scent which was hard to ignore. I&#x27;m glad I only bought the smallest jar. I&#x27;m bummed that I didn&#x27;t get my 3 Sephora samples as promised with my order.</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this product and was excited to try it. I have acne prone skin with mild scarring. I did not like this moisturizer. It broke me out and I did not see any improvement in my skin texture, tone or hyperpigmentation.  I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> About a week ago, my face suddenly broke out. I have consistently clear skin so having a single pimple would have been surprising. Having my entire face covered in what almost appeared to be hives? VERY alarming! I thought maybe it was from starting a medication. It eventually cleared, but face itched like crazy and was in HORRIBLE shape. Well, last night I tried Hope in a Jar for the first time in about a week. I had been trying not to put anything on my skin in an effort to let it heal. Well, sure enough, I woke up this morning to a burning face. I mean BURNING. I was begging for someone to sit on my hands so that I could not scratch my itchy, red face. It looks like I have a horrible case of acne and I am afraid it will only get worse. I am literally icing my face as I type this. I do not have sensitive skin, I rarely ever have a pimple and am allergic to absolutely nothing. After reading these posts and realizing the coincidental timing between the lotion and my reaction, I am furious that a product like this even exists! Help! Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> OMG! I was new to the philosophy line of products and was so excited to use it finally. About after a week or so using this product (hope in a jar) and (lemon custard body wash and cream) my eyes started to itch to the point I had to go to the eye doctor. I was given steroid to help with all the inflammation in my eyes. I am sorry to say that I cannot use any of the philosophy products as it makes my skin and eyes itchy. I hope they will test the product to see what is causing a lot of people to itch and make some adjustment so we can enjoy it again.</li>
            <li> I am a new user of Philosophy Brand products  - But so far I love all I have tried. This moisterizer is great.</li>
            <li> I just got a small jar of this as part of a Philosophy holiday kit. I have to say,  I like the way it goes on-- not greasy or heavy. Moisturizer usually makes my skin more oily as the day goes on, but I didn&#x27;t see this with Hope in a Jar. *However*, I don&#x27;t think I have ever used a beauty product with a stronger smell than this! I put it on my face 7 hours ago and it is still very noticeable... and it is not an \\&quot;added fragrance\\&quot; smell, it is an unintentional chemical smell. It bums me out because this stuff would be so great if it didn&#x27;t smell awful! I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy a full size jar of this... it seems to work though so I will probably start using it before bed so I don&#x27;t have to smell it.</li>
            <li> the jar of hope was practically empty, smelled bad and did nothing for me. I was very disappointed and the jar seemed to be opened and used.</li>
            <li> i thought i would try hope in a jar, well because of all the hype really.  oprah likes it, its somewhat pricey so it must be the best, i thought.  to be truthful, i have used other products that i think work just as well that i bought at walmart.  also, the smell is weird, as some others had alluded to.  not horrible, but not so much pleasant either.  i bought the .5 oz jar just to try it and used the whole jar, but dont plan to buy any more of it.  but really, everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  if you are thinking about buying it, i would recommend buying the small jar and just seeing what you think.</li>
            <li> Same thing as my MAC review. Just not what I thought . It is not as silky and thick as I need for winter.</li>
            <li> The product was somewhat dried out when I got it, which was disappointing since it is a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product (and a hair product from another company) last week after reading the many positive reviews of it. Needless to say, I was uber excited to start using it.    When I first applied it, it had a slight funky smell to it. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it...I guess chemical-ish? The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as what other people are reviewing it to be though. The smell goes away a couple minutes after it absorbs into the skin.    The texture is light and airy. It absorbs into the skin quickly and is not greasy. The texture, to me, was perfect.    -and the reason for the bad review- The morning after I first used this product, I noticed a rash on my face and neck. I thought I was breaking out and didn&#x27;t think much of it. The day after that, I had difficulty breathing all night and the rash got worse. It wasn&#x27;t until the next day when it was swelling and itchy that I figured I was having an allergic reaction. I looked like I had rubbed poison ivy all over my face.    At first I wasn&#x27;t sure weather it was the hope in a jar or the hair product I had purchased on the same day. I swatched them both on different arms and waited. Sure enough, the arm I put the Philosophy product on developed a rash. It&#x27;s strage since this is the first thing I&#x27;m allergic to (besides poison ivy).    BOTTOM LINE: Do a swatch test on your arm in a store before buying!</li>
            <li> So I purchased the small trial jar first..it worked out great...although it did give me some slight tingling feeling every time I put it on.     Soon after, I bought the large jar for a big price! When I went in to see my Skin specialist a week after my small trial size was done...he told me I had rosacea!! I can&#x27;t really use the product now coz it makes my rosacea so so bad! My face is all itchy and has tiny red patches again...! Have a bottle full and Don&#x27;t know what to do with it...switching to Biotherm for now.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne and combination oily/dry skin for 15 years. Numerous people recommended this product, but not wanting to splurge on something I had never tried, I bought the starte kit including Purity cleanser, Help Me retinol treatment, and Hope in a Jar. From the DAY I started using the set, I have not had one patch of dry skin, even around my eyebrows which were a common dry place when stressed. I think it has a light pleasant scent, and feels lightweight yet moisturizing- won&#x27;t leave you sticky feeling like other creams do. My skin tone is more even, and there are no dry areas. A very fresh, clean feeling for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I can think some people do not like the scent is because it is in a jar and fingers dipped in the jar may leave behind bacteria that over time may smell unpleasant. I have the small .5 oz jar, and for $30 (the set) was WELL worth it and has last a couple months!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new. So I decided on this mousterizer and the cleanser. I wasn&#x27;t too excited to pay so much. After I received my order I&#x27;d have to say its worth it. I love that its not a thick heavy cream. Its slides on nice and thin and I don&#x27;t have to put more on after 10 mins. My skin is no longer flaky dry. Its awesome! My face looks younger. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I was curious to try this out since I somewhat routinely use the Hope in a Tinted Moisturizer foundation before work. I found this adorable little thing in a Christmas box for $10 at a store and decided to give it a shot, even though I have been a loyal user of a great French facial cream for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several days of applying, I have decided that I like the lightness/fluffiness of the product, which appears to be one of its big selling points, and that it isn&#x27;t greasy or leaves residue (a plus when one has oily skin). Overall very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is the smell, since my traditional cream smells lovely like berries and this one smells rather like just-cut grass or something earthy and not that pleasant...Otherwise Hope in a Jar would&#x27;ve gotten a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what it is meant to do. i would recommend this to everyone who wants more beautiful skin and it will not break your face out.  great product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product has some great potential but the smell was so awful I threw it away...what a waste.</li>
            <li> I used this product 2 nights ago and have had an increasingly severe allergic reaction ever since.  I never would have imagined this product would have such an effect, in spite of my highly sensitive skin, but after closer further review, I see that I am not alone!&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday morning, my face was beet red in places. By last night, I had huge itchy welts on a large portion of my face. Today, the reaction is even worse, in spite of the fact that I&#x27;ve taken 2 antihistamine doses. I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin, and I definitely do not want to leave the house as my face and eyes are completely swollen, unbearably itchy, and a shade of intense purplish-red that I didn&#x27;t know existed heretofore.  My skin feels raw with an inconsolable burning itch. The rash has affected the skin under my eyebrows, my neck, behind/below my ears and there are additional rashes on different parts of my body.  I would not wish such discomfort on anyone!&lt;br /&gt;NO HOPE for me!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Philosophy for many years.&lt;br /&gt;However this product was watery and NOT White ( as it should have been) it was a yellow watery mess.&lt;br /&gt;It was in a sealed container. So it is not the sellers fault.</li>
            <li> Always look at your net weight before purchase, this is a travel size container.&lt;br /&gt;The product is awesome and the price was ok but next time I plan on buying a bigger portion :)</li>
            <li> This is the BEST moisturizer ever!!!  It not only moisturizes, but it offers so many other benefits..it gives the skin a younger, more youthful appearance.  I love it and don&#x27;t want to use anything else!</li>
            <li> I love, love this moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this moisturizer. It has a neat texture, kind of  a \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; feel, but it just didn&#x27;t do that much for me. It moisturizes okay, but not great. If I put it on flaky skin overnight, it still is flaky in the morning. Yes, it makes my skin feel softer and it&#x27;s pretty nice, but it doesn&#x27;t do much more than my Mary Kay or drugstore moisturizers can do. It also smells weird, and the smell lingers for a long time. Some people like this, and I&#x27;m a fan of a lot of Philosophy&#x27;s products, like Purity and the Microdelivery. However, I just don&#x27;t feel this lotion is worth the price. It doesn&#x27;t last long, and it doesn&#x27;t work that great. Maybe it does more for older skin.</li>
            <li> this product actually made me breakout and I would not recommend it just because I rarely breakout! The service was great just not the product</li>
            <li> I started using this in May of 2011. Just 5 months later I noticed a marked difference in my face. Even toned skin.  No more oily/dry areas. Even with a lot of sun tanning, I have no wrinkles or age lines on my face and I am 50.  It really is good and good for men also.</li>
            <li> I just tried this cream this week..after using other philosophy skin care products for a long time. Well.. after the third application, I woke up this morning with my face beet red like a chemical burn, swollen and itchy. I was horrified. It was so bad I saw a doctor and I will be on oral steroids for a week. I have never had any kind of reaction to any cosmetic in my life until this. sooo....after reading about the ingredients in HIAJ, I discovered it contains lavender oil...an ingredient that can be toxic and cause this allergic reaction similar to poison ivy. REALLY??  I&#x27;m sure this is good for many people, but it is not for everyone, so if you try it for the first time, do a patch test before putting it all over your face. If it burns....STOP USING IT and return it. If you don&#x27;t you might be sorry like me.</li>
            <li> Was quite disappointed - this was a gift and nowhere in the description did it describe this as a plastic container. I was expecting a glass container.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer did it&#x27;s job, although had a really gross smell and I would never want my face to smell like that.</li>
            <li> My eyes got dry flaky, swollen and red. Not for me! I never have allergies</li>
            <li> The consistency of the lotion looks like curdled milk. I don&#x27;t know if it was stored properly, shipped properly or even if the product is truly authentic... I am disappointed!</li>
            <li> awesome product and the most amazing customer service I have ever had</li>
            <li> this is the best moisturizer ive ever used. i have told any person i come incontact with about it and i cant wait to order a larger size</li>
            <li> I used this product for one day, and woke up this morning with my face hot and red, swelling and little bumps all over. My doctor advised me to go to an urgent care center -- they gave me prednisone to take. I wish I had read reviews before buying this. My face is so swollen and itchy I had to take a day out of work. I don&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t know which ingredient caused the allergic reaction. If you are thinking about buying this product, get a sample first and do a test. My face feels like I rubbed poison ivy leaves all over it. :(</li>
            <li> Great product but very expensive. This jar is just about the size of 2 medicine cups. If used daily, probably will only last about s 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this moisturizer, I have other products by philosophy and I like to use them.  Unfortunately, this moisturizer stinks.  The creamy texture feels nice and I think it does hydrate the skin and it is not heavy like other moisturizers, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell, it is terrible.  It would be nice if this cream was non-scented.</li>
            <li> I originally got a 2 oz. jar with the purchase of my clarisonic. I was skeptical because my skin is sensitive to so many things.&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the reviews and don&#x27;t agree with the complaints on the smell. It&#x27;s a soft smell that is kind of floral. The scent doesn&#x27;t last that long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 week of using hope in a jar my skin was incredibly soft and looked amazing. I even quit using my clarisonic for a month just to see if using philosphy products really work well on their own. They DO!!! I use the face wash and hope in a jar everyday and love my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin normally gets dry and flaky in the winter but this has stopped my face from flaking away!</li>
            <li> received it early...cream makes my skin so smooth</li>
