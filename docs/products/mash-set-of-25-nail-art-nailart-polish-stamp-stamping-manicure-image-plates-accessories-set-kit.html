            <li>I thought because of how cheap these were that they would not have very good quality, but these are great!</li>

            <li>if you are looking to make nice designs on your nails without spending $4-$7 a plate then deff buy this !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the plates and they all work great!!!  </li>
            <li>I was really really impressed with the quality of the stamps I was able to make using the MASH plates.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good timing I ordered this immediately.</li>
            <li>The designs are well done and there is a really good variety.</li>
            <li>I heard a lot of good things about the MASH set</li>
            <li>I loved these plates....</li>
            <li>The plates are of good quality though the edges are bit sharper than i&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>These plates as just as good as the konad ones.</li>
            <li>After having the konad, bundle monster and the mash plates I can say that quality wise and money wise, Mash is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Even using a Revlon polish (not the special Konad stamping polish that works the best with image plates)</li>
            <li>Great images, good sizes, and over all better quality.</li>
            <li>Overall, this set is a wonderful value and would be a great edition to any nail art aficionado&#x27;s collection!</li>
            <li>It works pretty good, sometimes doesn&#x27;t go on perfect and maybe smudges or something, but you can&#x27;t beat this amazing price.</li>
            <li>For $10 you can&#x27;t find a better deal on quality image plates!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, these plates are otherwise exact dupes, and excellently done.</li>
            <li>So I was really satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>I love this set!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li>I love your nails!</li>

            <li>They work beautifully and they are so much fun to use!</li>
            <li>I have just started using the stamper and was really impressed with how easy it is to create fun designs on my and my daughter&#x27;s nails!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 11/12 This set is still amazing and has stood the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These stamps are soo amazing</li>
            <li>Bottom line: these plates are CHEAP and GREAT quality.</li>
            <li>The quality of these is amazing.</li>
            <li>I recommend these plates to all of my Konad and nail art loving friends with 100% satisfaction</li>
            <li>I own these, both Bundlemonster sets, and some Konad.  </li>
            <li>own both plates from Konad and plates from ebay.</li>
            <li>I bought another kind</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a nice variety.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always polished my own nails</li>
            <li>This is a deal you honestly cannot pass up.</li>
            <li>But it does make some kind of sense.</li>
            <li>lol I am so excited  i have tried two plates</li>
            <li>They are high quality, and the image selection is awesome.</li>
            <li>Once the plastic is peeled off, you&#x27;ll find a mirror finish plate underneath with high quality images that work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Most of the plates are just like konad at much much better price !</li>
            <li>so make sure you don&#x27;t own copies of these plates.</li>
            <li>They are simply wonderful and make manicures look professional.</li>
            <li>But really for the price it is almost too good to pass up!</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this set today because of all the good reviews and cheap price, however, I think the price went up because I ended up paying more than $15 for them.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to be able to order this set for so cheap!  </li>
            <li>These were the first \\&quot;konad\\&quot; plates I have bought and they work great.  </li>
            <li>They work absolutely amazing, and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Now I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the price</li>
            <li>I just wish it would of come with letter designs as well :)</li>
            <li>and you can be creative</li>
            <li>These nail stamping plates are simply the best out of all the cheap image plates!</li>
            <li>For this set, they charge for shipping which I ended up paying more for Mash plates than the BM.</li>
            <li>For more than $21 for Mash 25 nail plates, let just said you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I would buy more if they came out with them</li>
            <li>I love konad plates</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use more designs.</li>
            <li>With more practice i&#x27;m sure I will get used to how i need to aim and roll each design.</li>
            <li>This was such a great deal I had to buy it!  </li>
            <li>Most of the time when I look for these plate sets, most of the plates have designs that I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>I love Mash&#x27;s image plates.</li>
            <li>I love love love that they are individually packaged - great for maintaining the quality in storage!</li>
            <li>Lots of designs to choose from to fit your mood!  </li>
            <li>I have to say i love all the possiblities i have to be creative</li>
            <li>Most of the images are copies of authentic Konad plates.</li>
            <li>-The MASH images are etched better.  </li>
            <li>so you are able to replicate nail designs seen on bloggers.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s cheaper to manufacture that way</li>
            <li>The shipping speed on this order was just ok.  </li>
            <li>the \\&quot;I love u\\&quot; plate.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a product like this and my first attempt at a design turned out perfect.</li>
            <li>MASH is way better quality....</li>
            <li>the results where fabulous!</li>
            <li>From what I heard, these worked better than the Bundle Monster ones and you get more for your buy.\  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>so I cant wait to try all of them :)</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my nails and</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be so glad you did.</li>
            <li>after getting a konad set i wanted more plates but didnt want to pay $7 for one plate.</li>
            <li>Overall, the pictures look great and the sketching is really good.</li>
            <li>Will buy more and def recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>It has many designs that I love.</li>
            <li>Well, my friends, I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I ordered the BM set, and got a free plate with a \\&quot;hello kitty\\&quot; design from another site(love it!</li>
            <li>more thing I wanted to mention-</li>
            <li>But with this many plates, you will want to have them stored in protective sleeves</li>
            <li>just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the selection of plates to be really varied and great for all occasions, so I don&#x27;t see having any need to get additional plates.</li>
            <li>So cute</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I have worn almost all these designs in most colors</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>Remember the more you practice the better they turn out.  </li>
            <li>Just for background, I keep my nails painted most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with these plates and after many uses they&#x27;ve held up well.</li>
            <li>If felt pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to continue using these because they&#x27;re a fraction of the price of the Konad ones and work well!</li>
            <li>Way more worth it than the bundle monster set, but still nice to have both.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are using the right kind of polish</li>
            <li>I got my image plates a week early so was happy with that.</li>
            <li>What I love most about this set is that most of the plates have really pretty designs that I would use all the time.  </li>
            <li>-BM has cute designs which are generally unique to the BM set.  </li>
            <li>I received this product very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>These plates are so easy to use and your nails look like a pro did them.  </li>
            <li>While admittedly it does take some practice to stamp your own nails, I first experimented on my mother.</li>
            <li>This is a bit tough for me because I&#x27;m not that great at stamping, so often times the design does smear because i don&#x27;t aim exactly right or roll it perfectly.</li>
            <li>While the quality of the etching is fine, I did have a couple plates have flaws on them.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>The shipping for this item was super swift!</li>
            <li>I love the plates they are easy to use and fun for all the girls in the family.</li>
            <li>Last night when i was scanning through to see if it came back in stock for a whooping $9.99, i HAD TO GET THESE wonderful amazing plates that were such a great price.</li>
            <li>The full-nail designs are HUGE and there&#x27;s lots of variety.</li>
            <li>That is a HUGE savings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li>MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit  Great set borrowed to my nail tech and can&#x27;t get it back...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great, similar idea.</li>
            <li>The images are FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>lol enough said buy them allready !!</li>
            <li>They are totally worth it and much much more.  </li>
            <li>To tell you the truth, i bought these without even noticing that they weren&#x27;t Konad brand, then as soon as i realized it, i began to freak out thinking that maybe they wouldn&#x27;t be as good or produce as clear an image.</li>
            <li>One was off (The dupe for konad m72 the LOVEYOU was not placed right and cut off the O in love)</li>
            <li>I also purchased the new BM plate, a week ago, for $21 (exact,no charge for shipping) and they were great, better than the old BM plates.</li>
            <li>If they have new designs coming out, I will buy it for sure!</li>
            <li>transfer is super easy and clean it does not matter what nail polish you use</li>
            <li>Lots of designs &amp; the full nail designs fit the nail.</li>
            <li>I made sure to research a lot first.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s having too much fun!</li>
            <li>Most of the plates are EXACT DUPES to the K brand plates.  </li>
            <li>The name brand plate image comes out crisper and cleaner and leaves the stamper clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are some who say \\&quot;you get what you pay for,\\&quot; as far as the quality, and to that, I say: do you NEED any more than you pay for?</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really nice to get the same look without the huge price!  </li>
            <li>Most of the designs seem like an exact dupe of the konad plates, and the etching is nice and clear.  </li>
            <li>The designs are great and apparently exactly the same as the konad brand.  </li>
            <li>but the images measured 1.5 cm for the tips, and for full images 1.2x1.5cm.</li>
            <li>There is a face of the die with 3 dots very close together (touching) in a triangular shape.  </li>
            <li>I could have saved some money good thing I only have a couple Konads.</li>
            <li>The best part of these plates are that you don&#x27;t need any special nail polishes, I used regular polish that I got at local beauty supply stores that were not brand name</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great value for a fun &amp; unique product.</li>
            <li>i sure will order more plates if they come out with different designs.</li>
            <li>I was able to consistently produce crisp, bold images.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so lucky I saw them when I did.</li>
            <li>I would love to see more such plate designs from them and would deffiantely buy them!</li>
            <li>It looked very classic and appropriate for a 31 year old &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>were very pretty.  </li>
            <li>i ran into the Mash Stamp Set because Konad is very pricy and this one is super cheap</li>
            <li>for the specifics, YES they come separately packaged, each in it&#x27;s own little cello bag that says MASH at the top.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay, and for the money, more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The french tips fit your nail and the designs are big enough to fit and they go on great!</li>
            <li>it was worth seeing if they worked.</li>
            <li>The designs on the plate are crisp, pretty, detailed and fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>this set is worth the money</li>
            <li>Have fun.</li>
            <li>I live in ohio and ordered these plated the 18th reciveved these today the 21st amazing value !</li>
            <li>I used pure acetone to clean the plates off and they cleaned up</li>
            <li>and if you use the right colors, they can even look &#x27;grown up&#x27; and not so &#x27;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the time it would take to get it right every tme</li>
            <li>I do have problems with my nails being too large for the full size images.  </li>
            <li>I especially liked the houndstooth design and the little french tip bowtie.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as Konad for less money.</li>
            <li>I love that there is a variety of tip images, single images, and full nail images.</li>
            <li>A lot of the plates are nearly exact duplicates of the name brand plates, so I selected a design that I had in this set as well as the name brand plate.      </li>
            <li>I cut myself on the first day when putting them into the business card holder</li>
            <li>I will say get em fast tho because the price keeps going up!</li>
            <li>I compared these side by side (even with an exact match</li>
            <li>The designs are exact, and well done.</li>
            <li>If MASH creates another set of more Konad-inspired plates, I&#x27;ll definitely buy them!</li>
            <li>, I just make sure the polish is opaque, like you only need one coat.</li>
            <li>So I think these stencil plates are of a much higher quality than the Konad brand plates.  </li>
            <li>and these are much larger and better quality than those.</li>
            <li>On the m72 plate, the LOVE letters are bigger than the image so they don&#x27;t come centered on the image.  </li>
            <li>I saved so much money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be back</li>
            <li>Yes some are exact duplicates</li>
            <li>Especially if you love the konad images but don&#x27;t have the funds to splurge.</li>
            <li>At $6-7 PER PLATE, it&#x27;s just too much!  </li>
            <li>And YES they do have a blue plastic coating on top of them.</li>
            <li>The dice look funny</li>
            <li>I waited for these plates to come back on the market since they have had better reviews that</li>
            <li>The only thing that would have been nice if Mash had also sold the Scraper and stamper on their site, but other then that, love it.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;d certainly have to replace them much more often than you would the solid metal plates).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that this will allow the MASH brand to last MUCH  longer than the plates that came with my stencil starter set.  </li>
            <li>They are as good as some of the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have more money to invest in nail art and want more unique images (especially coordinating sets of full nail, French tip, and center of the nail images), I recommend also getting the BM set.    </li>
            <li>The images came out clear even without the Konad special nail polish.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect it to arrive that fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I did receive a few of the &#x27;K&#x27; plates with my first stamping starter set, I have never purchased any more of them because of the price!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s pretty much a design for every occasion.  </li>
            <li>The only thing i noticed was that the MASH designs smear easily whereas I&#x27;ve never had problems with my Konad plates smearing.</li>
            <li>However, I found them easy to use with the double ended Konad stamper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m just happy that, for less than the price of 3 of the other plates, I was able to get my hot little hands on most of the full nail and french tip plates I had been lemming for some time.  </li>
            <li>The full nail designs on the MASH plates are very large, especially when compared to the BM plates.     </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re not etched very well.</li>
            <li>I do have some real Konad plates</li>
            <li>The designs come out, they function just like the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot; and I for one don&#x27;t have the money to spend 5-7 dollars per plate.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>After much research, I thought I would get this brand since it is the cheepest.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast, I received this item in two days because I lived in California.</li>
            <li>The MASH plates are a thicker metal and are very</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy this set again for the price I paid (Under fifteen bux).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I never used the brand name Konad plates before, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare these to.</li>
            <li>It matched my dress and turned out really well.</li>
            <li>and I assume that they all do because I have seen other reviews note it also, I don&#x27;t really like the design, it says love</li>
            <li>I tried to start with a smaller design but had difficulties, so I switched to a full nail design.  </li>
            <li>-The MASH full nail images are much larger than BM.   </li>
            <li>I did notice the same flaw another reviewer mentioned on the full naildesign- the writing is not centered.</li>
            <li>Definately recommend new stampers to start out with a set of these!</li>
            <li>-MASH has more plates for less money.   </li>
            <li>The set has many images, and the cover several different themes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these nail plates.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the Konad image plate and spent almost twice as much.</li>
            <li>It probably could have been a little better</li>
            <li>so I tested them out with the MASH equivilents and they are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>still well worth the cost compared to the price of buying individual disks.</li>
            <li>but I use normal nail polish</li>
            <li>-The MASH plate designs are similar (exact, really) to the Konad plates</li>
            <li>not bad but harder than you would think to get the image on the nails straight and even...</li>
            <li>On m56 the checkered french tip was not sketched right.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect ABSOLUTE perfection, but the quality far exceeds other budget friendly sets I&#x27;ve seen out there.  </li>
            <li>NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates</li>
            <li>but the letter are to big and don&#x27;t fit properly like in the Konad plate.   </li>
            <li>Just be aware that such an error MAY happen with your order.    </li>
            <li>Using regular polish can save you sooo much money!</li>
            <li>and it was promptly on my doorstep early Monday morning!</li>
            <li>and now I can make them look extra pretty just as if I went to the nail salon</li>
            <li>English is not their first language, ok?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered these plates because other reviews mentioned they were good quality (aside from a few errors) and worked just as well as Konad.     </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly, each plate was individually wrapped, and the protective plastic coating was blue making it easier to see and remove.</li>
            <li>These plates are so much the same as the Konad brand that I would never know the difference!!!</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>: Store your plates in a business card file, an old CD case, or use those clear hobby card protector sleeves.</li>
            <li>Other than that I suggest you buy this its fun</li>
            <li>The full nail designs are big enough to even cover my entire thumb nail in one go.</li>
            <li>-BM has a lot of coordinating full nail, French tip, and center of the nail designs.    </li>
            <li>A few designs are strange and I couldn&#x27;t make out what they were but most (95%)</li>
            <li>So far every image has come out crisp and sharp.  </li>
            <li>There are so many designs, it&#x27;s hard to choose which ones to use next.</li>
            <li>One of the plates does have an irregularity but for the price 1 slightly off plate is well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>With these plates it&#x27;s harder to get the image perfect on the stamper, and difficult to apply without smudging, and the image leaves a &#x27;ghost&#x27; or slight residue on the stamper.      </li>
            <li>These arrived really quickly after I ordered them (days before the other Konad items I ordered) and were all individually packaged with blue lining overtop.</li>
            <li>I did find that the blue plastic was WAY easier to remove than the clear plastic on the BM plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them once so far, but my stamper picked up the art</li>
            <li>The image sizes are generous though a few are a bit too big to fit entirely on my nails.</li>
            <li>Honestly cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li>You can get this whole set for the price of two stamping plates from the other brand.</li>
            <li>but for a whole lot less.</li>
            <li>they only negative would be that the full nail designs aren&#x27;t big enough to cover my big toes</li>
            <li>If you have high standards, this wont let you down.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This work great.</li>
            <li> Great if you have time for it.</li>
            <li> I thought because of how cheap these were that they would not have very good quality, but these are great!</li>

            <li> if you are looking to make nice designs on your nails without spending $4-$7 a plate then deff buy this !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the plates and they all work great!!!  </li>
            <li> I was really really impressed with the quality of the stamps I was able to make using the MASH plates.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good timing I ordered this immediately.</li>
            <li> The designs are well done and there is a really good variety.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good things about the MASH set</li>
            <li> I loved these plates....</li>
            <li> The plates are of good quality though the edges are bit sharper than i&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> These plates as just as good as the konad ones.</li>
            <li> After having the konad, bundle monster and the mash plates I can say that quality wise and money wise, Mash is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Even using a Revlon polish (not the special Konad stamping polish that works the best with image plates)</li>
            <li> Great images, good sizes, and over all better quality.</li>
            <li> Overall, this set is a wonderful value and would be a great edition to any nail art aficionado&#x27;s collection!</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, sometimes doesn&#x27;t go on perfect and maybe smudges or something, but you can&#x27;t beat this amazing price.</li>
            <li> For $10 you can&#x27;t find a better deal on quality image plates!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, these plates are otherwise exact dupes, and excellently done.</li>
            <li> So I was really satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> I love this set!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> I love your nails!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Update 11/12 This set is still amazing and has stood the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These stamps are soo amazing</li>
            <li> Bottom line: these plates are CHEAP and GREAT quality.</li>
            <li> The quality of these is amazing.</li>
            <li> I recommend these plates to all of my Konad and nail art loving friends with 100% satisfaction</li>
            <li> I own these, both Bundlemonster sets, and some Konad.  </li>
            <li> own both plates from Konad and plates from ebay.</li>
            <li> I bought another kind</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a nice variety.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always polished my own nails</li>
            <li> This is a deal you honestly cannot pass up.</li>
            <li> But it does make some kind of sense.</li>
            <li> lol I am so excited  i have tried two plates</li>
            <li> They are high quality, and the image selection is awesome.</li>
            <li> Once the plastic is peeled off, you&#x27;ll find a mirror finish plate underneath with high quality images that work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Most of the plates are just like konad at much much better price !</li>
            <li> so make sure you don&#x27;t own copies of these plates.</li>
            <li> They are simply wonderful and make manicures look professional.</li>
            <li> But really for the price it is almost too good to pass up!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this set today because of all the good reviews and cheap price, however, I think the price went up because I ended up paying more than $15 for them.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to be able to order this set for so cheap!  </li>
            <li> These were the first \\&quot;konad\\&quot; plates I have bought and they work great.  </li>
            <li> They work absolutely amazing, and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Now I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the price</li>
            <li> I just wish it would of come with letter designs as well :)</li>
            <li> and you can be creative</li>
            <li> These nail stamping plates are simply the best out of all the cheap image plates!</li>
            <li> For this set, they charge for shipping which I ended up paying more for Mash plates than the BM.</li>
            <li> For more than $21 for Mash 25 nail plates, let just said you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I would buy more if they came out with them</li>
            <li> I love konad plates</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use more designs.</li>
            <li> With more practice i&#x27;m sure I will get used to how i need to aim and roll each design.</li>
            <li> This was such a great deal I had to buy it!  </li>
            <li> Most of the time when I look for these plate sets, most of the plates have designs that I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> I love Mash&#x27;s image plates.</li>
            <li> I love love love that they are individually packaged - great for maintaining the quality in storage!</li>
            <li> Lots of designs to choose from to fit your mood!  </li>
            <li> I have to say i love all the possiblities i have to be creative</li>
            <li> Most of the images are copies of authentic Konad plates.</li>
            <li> -The MASH images are etched better.  </li>
            <li> so you are able to replicate nail designs seen on bloggers.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s cheaper to manufacture that way</li>
            <li> The shipping speed on this order was just ok.  </li>
            <li> the \\&quot;I love u\\&quot; plate.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a product like this and my first attempt at a design turned out perfect.</li>
            <li> MASH is way better quality....</li>
            <li> the results where fabulous!</li>
            <li> From what I heard, these worked better than the Bundle Monster ones and you get more for your buy.\  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> so I cant wait to try all of them :)</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my nails and</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be so glad you did.</li>
            <li> after getting a konad set i wanted more plates but didnt want to pay $7 for one plate.</li>
            <li> Overall, the pictures look great and the sketching is really good.</li>
            <li> Will buy more and def recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> It has many designs that I love.</li>
            <li> Well, my friends, I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I ordered the BM set, and got a free plate with a \\&quot;hello kitty\\&quot; design from another site(love it!</li>
            <li> more thing I wanted to mention-</li>
            <li> But with this many plates, you will want to have them stored in protective sleeves</li>
            <li> just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the selection of plates to be really varied and great for all occasions, so I don&#x27;t see having any need to get additional plates.</li>
            <li> So cute</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I have worn almost all these designs in most colors</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> Remember the more you practice the better they turn out.  </li>
            <li> Just for background, I keep my nails painted most of the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with these plates and after many uses they&#x27;ve held up well.</li>
            <li> If felt pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to continue using these because they&#x27;re a fraction of the price of the Konad ones and work well!</li>
            <li> Way more worth it than the bundle monster set, but still nice to have both.</li>
            <li> Make sure you are using the right kind of polish</li>
            <li> I got my image plates a week early so was happy with that.</li>
            <li> What I love most about this set is that most of the plates have really pretty designs that I would use all the time.  </li>
            <li> -BM has cute designs which are generally unique to the BM set.  </li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> These plates are so easy to use and your nails look like a pro did them.  </li>
            <li> While admittedly it does take some practice to stamp your own nails, I first experimented on my mother.</li>
            <li> This is a bit tough for me because I&#x27;m not that great at stamping, so often times the design does smear because i don&#x27;t aim exactly right or roll it perfectly.</li>
            <li> While the quality of the etching is fine, I did have a couple plates have flaws on them.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> The shipping for this item was super swift!</li>
            <li> I love the plates they are easy to use and fun for all the girls in the family.</li>
            <li> Last night when i was scanning through to see if it came back in stock for a whooping $9.99, i HAD TO GET THESE wonderful amazing plates that were such a great price.</li>
            <li> The full-nail designs are HUGE and there&#x27;s lots of variety.</li>
            <li> That is a HUGE savings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li> MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit  Great set borrowed to my nail tech and can&#x27;t get it back...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great, similar idea.</li>
            <li> The images are FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> lol enough said buy them allready !!</li>
            <li> They are totally worth it and much much more.  </li>
            <li> To tell you the truth, i bought these without even noticing that they weren&#x27;t Konad brand, then as soon as i realized it, i began to freak out thinking that maybe they wouldn&#x27;t be as good or produce as clear an image.</li>
            <li> One was off (The dupe for konad m72 the LOVEYOU was not placed right and cut off the O in love)</li>
            <li> I also purchased the new BM plate, a week ago, for $21 (exact,no charge for shipping) and they were great, better than the old BM plates.</li>
            <li> If they have new designs coming out, I will buy it for sure!</li>
            <li> transfer is super easy and clean it does not matter what nail polish you use</li>
            <li> Lots of designs &amp; the full nail designs fit the nail.</li>
            <li> I made sure to research a lot first.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s having too much fun!</li>
            <li> Most of the plates are EXACT DUPES to the K brand plates.  </li>
            <li> The name brand plate image comes out crisper and cleaner and leaves the stamper clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are some who say \\&quot;you get what you pay for,\\&quot; as far as the quality, and to that, I say: do you NEED any more than you pay for?</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really nice to get the same look without the huge price!  </li>
            <li> Most of the designs seem like an exact dupe of the konad plates, and the etching is nice and clear.  </li>
            <li> The designs are great and apparently exactly the same as the konad brand.  </li>
            <li> but the images measured 1.5 cm for the tips, and for full images 1.2x1.5cm.</li>
            <li> There is a face of the die with 3 dots very close together (touching) in a triangular shape.  </li>
            <li> I could have saved some money good thing I only have a couple Konads.</li>
            <li> The best part of these plates are that you don&#x27;t need any special nail polishes, I used regular polish that I got at local beauty supply stores that were not brand name</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great value for a fun &amp; unique product.</li>
            <li> i sure will order more plates if they come out with different designs.</li>
            <li> I was able to consistently produce crisp, bold images.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so lucky I saw them when I did.</li>
            <li> I would love to see more such plate designs from them and would deffiantely buy them!</li>
            <li> It looked very classic and appropriate for a 31 year old &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> were very pretty.  </li>
            <li> i ran into the Mash Stamp Set because Konad is very pricy and this one is super cheap</li>
            <li> for the specifics, YES they come separately packaged, each in it&#x27;s own little cello bag that says MASH at the top.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, and for the money, more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The french tips fit your nail and the designs are big enough to fit and they go on great!</li>
            <li> it was worth seeing if they worked.</li>
            <li> The designs on the plate are crisp, pretty, detailed and fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> this set is worth the money</li>
            <li> Have fun.</li>
            <li> I live in ohio and ordered these plated the 18th reciveved these today the 21st amazing value !</li>
            <li> I used pure acetone to clean the plates off and they cleaned up</li>
            <li> and if you use the right colors, they can even look &#x27;grown up&#x27; and not so &#x27;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the time it would take to get it right every tme</li>
            <li> I do have problems with my nails being too large for the full size images.  </li>
            <li> I especially liked the houndstooth design and the little french tip bowtie.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as Konad for less money.</li>
            <li> I love that there is a variety of tip images, single images, and full nail images.</li>
            <li> A lot of the plates are nearly exact duplicates of the name brand plates, so I selected a design that I had in this set as well as the name brand plate.      </li>
            <li> I cut myself on the first day when putting them into the business card holder</li>
            <li> I will say get em fast tho because the price keeps going up!</li>
            <li> I compared these side by side (even with an exact match</li>
            <li> The designs are exact, and well done.</li>
            <li> If MASH creates another set of more Konad-inspired plates, I&#x27;ll definitely buy them!</li>
            <li> , I just make sure the polish is opaque, like you only need one coat.</li>
            <li> So I think these stencil plates are of a much higher quality than the Konad brand plates.  </li>
            <li> and these are much larger and better quality than those.</li>
            <li> On the m72 plate, the LOVE letters are bigger than the image so they don&#x27;t come centered on the image.  </li>
            <li> I saved so much money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be back</li>
            <li> Yes some are exact duplicates</li>
            <li> Especially if you love the konad images but don&#x27;t have the funds to splurge.</li>
            <li> At $6-7 PER PLATE, it&#x27;s just too much!  </li>
            <li> And YES they do have a blue plastic coating on top of them.</li>
            <li> The dice look funny</li>
            <li> I waited for these plates to come back on the market since they have had better reviews that</li>
            <li> The only thing that would have been nice if Mash had also sold the Scraper and stamper on their site, but other then that, love it.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d certainly have to replace them much more often than you would the solid metal plates).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that this will allow the MASH brand to last MUCH  longer than the plates that came with my stencil starter set.  </li>
            <li> They are as good as some of the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have more money to invest in nail art and want more unique images (especially coordinating sets of full nail, French tip, and center of the nail images), I recommend also getting the BM set.    </li>
            <li> The images came out clear even without the Konad special nail polish.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect it to arrive that fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I did receive a few of the &#x27;K&#x27; plates with my first stamping starter set, I have never purchased any more of them because of the price!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s pretty much a design for every occasion.  </li>
            <li> The only thing i noticed was that the MASH designs smear easily whereas I&#x27;ve never had problems with my Konad plates smearing.</li>
            <li> However, I found them easy to use with the double ended Konad stamper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just happy that, for less than the price of 3 of the other plates, I was able to get my hot little hands on most of the full nail and french tip plates I had been lemming for some time.  </li>
            <li> The full nail designs on the MASH plates are very large, especially when compared to the BM plates.     </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re not etched very well.</li>
            <li> I do have some real Konad plates</li>
            <li> The designs come out, they function just like the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot; and I for one don&#x27;t have the money to spend 5-7 dollars per plate.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> After much research, I thought I would get this brand since it is the cheepest.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast, I received this item in two days because I lived in California.</li>
            <li> The MASH plates are a thicker metal and are very</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy this set again for the price I paid (Under fifteen bux).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I never used the brand name Konad plates before, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare these to.</li>
            <li> It matched my dress and turned out really well.</li>
            <li> and I assume that they all do because I have seen other reviews note it also, I don&#x27;t really like the design, it says love</li>
            <li> I tried to start with a smaller design but had difficulties, so I switched to a full nail design.  </li>
            <li> -The MASH full nail images are much larger than BM.   </li>
            <li> I did notice the same flaw another reviewer mentioned on the full naildesign- the writing is not centered.</li>
            <li> Definately recommend new stampers to start out with a set of these!</li>
            <li> -MASH has more plates for less money.   </li>
            <li> The set has many images, and the cover several different themes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these nail plates.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Konad image plate and spent almost twice as much.</li>
            <li> It probably could have been a little better</li>
            <li> so I tested them out with the MASH equivilents and they are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> still well worth the cost compared to the price of buying individual disks.</li>
            <li> but I use normal nail polish</li>
            <li> -The MASH plate designs are similar (exact, really) to the Konad plates</li>
            <li> not bad but harder than you would think to get the image on the nails straight and even...</li>
            <li> On m56 the checkered french tip was not sketched right.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect ABSOLUTE perfection, but the quality far exceeds other budget friendly sets I&#x27;ve seen out there.  </li>
            <li> NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates</li>
            <li> but the letter are to big and don&#x27;t fit properly like in the Konad plate.   </li>
            <li> Just be aware that such an error MAY happen with your order.    </li>
            <li> Using regular polish can save you sooo much money!</li>
            <li> and it was promptly on my doorstep early Monday morning!</li>
            <li> and now I can make them look extra pretty just as if I went to the nail salon</li>
            <li> English is not their first language, ok?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered these plates because other reviews mentioned they were good quality (aside from a few errors) and worked just as well as Konad.     </li>
            <li> It shipped quickly, each plate was individually wrapped, and the protective plastic coating was blue making it easier to see and remove.</li>
            <li> These plates are so much the same as the Konad brand that I would never know the difference!!!</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> : Store your plates in a business card file, an old CD case, or use those clear hobby card protector sleeves.</li>
            <li> Other than that I suggest you buy this its fun</li>
            <li> The full nail designs are big enough to even cover my entire thumb nail in one go.</li>
            <li> -BM has a lot of coordinating full nail, French tip, and center of the nail designs.    </li>
            <li> A few designs are strange and I couldn&#x27;t make out what they were but most (95%)</li>
            <li> So far every image has come out crisp and sharp.  </li>
            <li> There are so many designs, it&#x27;s hard to choose which ones to use next.</li>
            <li> One of the plates does have an irregularity but for the price 1 slightly off plate is well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> With these plates it&#x27;s harder to get the image perfect on the stamper, and difficult to apply without smudging, and the image leaves a &#x27;ghost&#x27; or slight residue on the stamper.      </li>
            <li> These arrived really quickly after I ordered them (days before the other Konad items I ordered) and were all individually packaged with blue lining overtop.</li>
            <li> I did find that the blue plastic was WAY easier to remove than the clear plastic on the BM plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once so far, but my stamper picked up the art</li>
            <li> The image sizes are generous though a few are a bit too big to fit entirely on my nails.</li>
            <li> Honestly cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> You can get this whole set for the price of two stamping plates from the other brand.</li>
            <li> but for a whole lot less.</li>
            <li> they only negative would be that the full nail designs aren&#x27;t big enough to cover my big toes</li>
            <li> If you have high standards, this wont let you down.</li>
            <li> These work, but it&#x27;s more difficult to get a clear image than with the other plates.  </li>
            <li> The plates come sealed in individual packets and the design are covered with a blue plastic, versus clear plastic like other companies do, making it easier to remove before using.</li>
            <li> But a lot of the BM&#x27;s full nail designs were too small for my average size nails.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that they&#x27;re all metal versus the Konad brand that a has a paper backing (it&#x27;s thick, but all the same, it IS paper!  </li>
            <li> A few days later they arrived and i was gladly proven wrong.</li>
            <li> There are some images which I find rather strange and/or tacky (like the koala), but maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> now with all of these designs I guess I will be for a long long time.</li>
            <li> strange.</li>
            <li> I would personally add some sort of backing if planning to keep them together as non backed plates will scratch each other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking forward to owning the \\&quot;splat\\&quot; design for SO LONG!  </li>
            <li> But look at the other images on that same plate.  </li>
            <li> Besides the few examples above I did not notice any other major design flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean honestly, you cant really go wrong with these.  </li>
            <li> Some other people have mentioned that the plates are sharp around the edges and such, but I didn&#x27;t find them to be sharp at all.</li>
            <li> So be careful.</li>
            <li> the inexperienced like me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried a few  </li>
            <li> on the smaller flower, there is a dash or two missing.</li>
            <li> When it comes to any beauty product, I never really sacrifice quality just so I can get a cheaper deal.</li>
            <li> I would have given these plates 5 stars except they do NOT have the backing on them to make the edges less sharp, and to make them less likely to scratch other plates.  </li>
            <li> plates are sharp, as they have no backing.</li>
            <li> Like other have pointed out, the dice image is messed up, but I don&#x27;t plan to use it.</li>
            <li> (maybe grey for the Koala, brown for the tree trunk, and green for the foliage, etc.)</li>
            <li> plate- just be careful with them!)</li>
            <li> some of these images are etched a little deeper and need a little less polish or a double scrape.  </li>
            <li> There are some very minor differences in a few of the specific designs on these plates but for the price this is hardly a complaint.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s certainly not worth deducting stars from the rating.</li>
            <li> I guess it all boils down to money.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been let down yet.</li>
            <li> And with that plate specifically, the other designs on it don&#x27;t appeal to me-- so spending $6-7 for JUST THE ONE DESIGN that I&#x27;d use (SPLAT!)</li>
            <li> I have other cheap-o plates that are so FLIMSY!</li>
            <li> As a dup of Konad, you still pay less but quality might be off.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, they work just as well as the name brand plates, with much less investment.</li>
            <li> As in, if I wanted to I could probably fold them in half.  </li>
            <li> And in the same way, I purchase something so expensive only if I get what I pay for.</li>
            <li> There are maybe a couple images that are a little off including number M72</li>
            <li> There is little difference between the Konad and these plates</li>
            <li> There are a few that I will probably never use, but</li>
            <li> No, I wouldn&#x27;t want them to waste shipping costs.</li>
            <li> If you were deciding between the MASH plates and the BM plates, I heavily recommend getting the MASH set.</li>
            <li> I already have a few Konad stamping plates.</li>
            <li> A few days after I ordered these they sold out.  </li>
            <li> I have a few K</li>
            <li> The only other flawed plate in my set was the one with the dice on it.</li>
            <li> There are an awful lot of them for French nail tips, but there are still a sufficient number of designs for me to use them for full nails and for any purpose that I have.  </li>
            <li> they have alot of the same designs that KONAD has and its less expensive.</li>
            <li> Some designs(2 total) were weird (one has and \\&quot;I\\&quot; and a \\&quot;Y\\&quot;, why would I stamp</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my set, or if that&#x27;s how it was designed.</li>
            <li> They are thin pieces of metal, but they aren&#x27;t sharp.     </li>
            <li> I really want to get in touch with the company, but i cannot seem to find an e-mail or anything to contact them. :(</li>
            <li> I used Sally Hansen Insta Dry in Petal Pusher as my base with a stamp in white.</li>
            <li> I ordered late Thursday night, it shipped Friday morning, and I got it Monday afternoon.     </li>
            <li> So, I have lately been into doing my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure why someone would  use a paper backing on a product that requires the use of acetone and nail polish!  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not that serious for me.  </li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY?</li>
            <li> lastly when ypu do the math, Konad plates cost around 6 dollar each, buying this bundle will cost you about .45 cents per plate, it would be a bad decision not to buy them.  </li>
            <li> Just look before you stamp and you wont be sorry.  </li>
            <li> Also keep in mind when buying that there is a thin plastic sheeting on it that has to be taken off!</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I went to put some money in the bank today, got home, went on Amazon to search up this image, and sadly went across that it was out of stock AGAIN.</li>
            <li> As if I bought fake nails.</li>
            <li> but they are too expensive at $7.00 a piece.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s another savings because Konad polishes are expensive too.</li>
            <li> &quot;  Lame?</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> They both turned out well, and it didn&#x27;t matter what brand I used as a base.</li>
            <li> I really am very disappointed that i can never buy it before it goes out of stock.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have some of the name brand plates and was looking forward to getting these.  Well, they arrived today.  A lot of the plates are nearly exact duplicates of the name brand plates, so I selected a design that I had in this set as well as the name brand plate.      Bottom line: These work, but it&#x27;s more difficult to get a clear image than with the other plates.  The name brand plate image comes out crisper and cleaner and leaves the stamper clean.  With these plates it&#x27;s harder to get the image perfect on the stamper, and difficult to apply without smudging, and the image leaves a &#x27;ghost&#x27; or slight residue on the stamper.      They&#x27;re okay, and for the money, more than I expected.  But for designs I know I&#x27;ll use a lot I think I&#x27;ll just invest in the name brand plates.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my friend. After finding several sets on Amazon and reading the reviews we decided to purchase this set from M.A.S.H. She is REALLY happy with it. It shipped quickly, each plate was individually wrapped, and the protective plastic coating was blue making it easier to see and remove. This is a great deal 25 plates for $13.99. Lots of designs &amp; the full nail designs fit the nail.</li>
            <li> I had doubts when i bought this item. Now I love it. As soon as it got here i gave it a try and it worked especially with any nail polish. I do nails so its easier to add designs to them. I love the price thank god i ran into the Mash Stamp Set because Konad is very pricy and this one is super cheap i sure will order more plates if they come out with different designs. I just wish it would of come with letter designs as well :) Other than that I suggest you buy this its fun and you can be creative</li>
            <li> if you are looking to make nice designs on your nails without spending $4-$7 a plate then deff buy this ! they have alot of the same designs that KONAD has and its less expensive.</li>
            <li> These image plates are a wonderful value for the money. I originally purchased the Konad image plate and spent almost twice as much. These plates are so much the same as the Konad brand that I would never know the difference!!! I recommend these plates to all of my Konad and nail art loving friends with 100% satisfaction</li>
            <li> These were the first \\&quot;konad\\&quot; plates I have bought and they work great.  I didn&#x27;t feel like spending $5 on each plate and this was the perfect alternative.  Most of the designs seem like an exact dupe of the konad plates, and the etching is nice and clear.  I do have problems with my nails being too large for the full size images.  I am not sure if they are the exact same size as the konad plates but the images measured 1.5 cm for the tips, and for full images 1.2x1.5cm.</li>
            <li> This stamps are great, they transfer well.</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth, i bought these without even noticing that they weren&#x27;t Konad brand, then as soon as i realized it, i began to freak out thinking that maybe they wouldn&#x27;t be as good or produce as clear an image. A few days later they arrived and i was gladly proven wrong. THEY ARE GREAT.  They have the same image as Konad plates and reproduce well on my nails even without Konad nailpolish. they only negative would be that the full nail designs aren&#x27;t big enough to cover my big toes but that&#x27;s not that serious for me.  lastly when ypu do the math, Konad plates cost around 6 dollar each, buying this bundle will cost you about .45 cents per plate, it would be a bad decision not to buy them.  As soon as a girlfriends&#x27; birthday comes up, i will def. buy her this.</li>
            <li> These nail stamping plates are simply the best out of all the cheap image plates! Great images, good sizes, and over all better quality. I would order 50 sets if I had a use for them just because of how great these are. For $10 you can&#x27;t find a better deal on quality image plates!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this set today because of all the good reviews and cheap price, however, I think the price went up because I ended up paying more than $15 for them. I also purchased the new BM plate, a week ago, for $21 (exact,no charge for shipping) and they were great, better than the old BM plates. Since I just purchase these plates today, haven&#x27;t do a review on them yet or compare them to Konad, CAN&#x27;T WAIT. For this set, they charge for shipping which I ended up paying more for Mash plates than the BM. They are no longer under $15, with shipping and the price at $16, do the math, it came out &gt;$21 total.    Bottom Line: Buy them now before the price goes up. As a dup of Konad, you still pay less but quality might be off. For more than $21 for Mash 25 nail plates, let just said you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I own these, both Bundlemonster sets, and some Konad.  I would have given these plates 5 stars except they do NOT have the backing on them to make the edges less sharp, and to make them less likely to scratch other plates.  I cut myself on the first day when putting them into the business card holder I put all my plates in.    So far every image has come out crisp and sharp.  Mind you some of these images are etched a little deeper and need a little less polish or a double scrape.  Just look before you stamp and you wont be sorry.  I would buy more if they came out with them (HINT HINT).      I will say get em fast tho because the price keeps going up!</li>
            <li> As a nail stamping newbie, this was a good buy! I love these! They are high quality, and the image selection is awesome. Also keep in mind when buying that there is a thin plastic sheeting on it that has to be taken off! And if they looked scratched it is because of the plastic not the plate itself.  Once the plastic is peeled off, you&#x27;ll find a mirror finish plate underneath with high quality images that work wonderfully. Bottom line, they work just as well as the name brand plates, with much less investment. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> !!!!This set has been DISCONTINUED!!! See [[ASIN:B0080GV0Z0 NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates 26-50 Accessories Set Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/12 This set is still amazing and has stood the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own both plates from Konad and plates from ebay. I compared these side by side (even with an exact match Konad plate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the designs is no different then konad. The designs are exact, and well done. A couple designs do suffer from quality control though. They stamp on the nails perfectly. Some designs(2 total) were weird (one has and \\&quot;I\\&quot; and a \\&quot;Y\\&quot;, why would I stamp \\&quot;I Y\\&quot; on my fingers??? One was off (The dupe for konad m72 the LOVEYOU was not placed right and cut off the O in love) (I dropped a start recently because of this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these plates are otherwise exact dupes, and excellently done. For the price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s totally worth it. Besides the few examples above I did not notice any other major design flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates are sharp, as they have no backing. So be careful. I would personally add some sort of backing if planning to keep them together as non backed plates will scratch each other.</li>
            <li> I love konad plates but they&#x27;re way too expensive. I bought another kind that&#x27;s non-circular but they&#x27;re not etched very well. This time I bought the MASH after reading all the reviews. It&#x27;s as good as Konad for less money. It&#x27;s a good timing I ordered this immediately. Now it&#x27;s unavailable again. I highly recommend these nail plates.</li>
            <li> When I wanted to get into Konad &amp; nail art I made sure to research a lot first. I ordered these plates because other reviews mentioned they were good quality (aside from a few errors) and worked just as well as Konad.     These arrived really quickly after I ordered them (days before the other Konad items I ordered) and were all individually packaged with blue lining overtop. Some other people have mentioned that the plates are sharp around the edges and such, but I didn&#x27;t find them to be sharp at all. The way people were going on about them made it seem like it was a mini steel knife and that is not the case. They are thin pieces of metal, but they aren&#x27;t sharp.     The designs are well done and there is a really good variety. I&#x27;ve only used them once so far, but my stamper picked up the art well and my nails look really awesome! I tried to start with a smaller design but had difficulties, so I switched to a full nail design.  I suggest if you&#x27;re newer to the nail stamping you start with a larger design since it seems to be easier.     I&#x27;m really excited to continue using these because they&#x27;re a fraction of the price of the Konad ones and work well! I can&#x27;t wait to use more designs.</li>
            <li> For ~$15 this set of stamping plates is AN AMAZING DEAL! I do have some real Konad plates so I tested them out with the MASH equivilents and they are pretty much the same. The only thing i noticed was that the MASH designs smear easily whereas I&#x27;ve never had problems with my Konad plates smearing. This is a bit tough for me because I&#x27;m not that great at stamping, so often times the design does smear because i don&#x27;t aim exactly right or roll it perfectly. But really for the price it is almost too good to pass up! With more practice i&#x27;m sure I will get used to how i need to aim and roll each design.</li>
            <li> After watching people on Youtube doing reviews on these MASH plates, i&#x27;ve been going on Amazon.com searching for this product but it is always out of stock. Last night when i was scanning through to see if it came back in stock for a whooping $9.99, i HAD TO GET THESE wonderful amazing plates that were such a great price. I went to put some money in the bank today, got home, went on Amazon to search up this image, and sadly went across that it was out of stock AGAIN. I really am very disappointed that i can never buy it before it goes out of stock. I really want to get in touch with the company, but i cannot seem to find an e-mail or anything to contact them. :(</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I just got 25 plates for $17!!! This was such a great deal I had to buy it!  I&#x27;ve tried most of the plates and they all work great!!!  What I love most about this set is that most of the plates have really pretty designs that I would use all the time.  There are a few that I don&#x27;t really care for but that&#x27;s probably only 2-3 plates out of the 25.  Most of the time when I look for these plate sets, most of the plates have designs that I don&#x27;t like.  So I was really satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> I love Mash&#x27;s image plates. They&#x27;re cheap (I got them for UNDER $15!) and there&#x27;s a nice variety. I love love love that they are individually packaged - great for maintaining the quality in storage! There are some images which I find rather strange and/or tacky (like the koala), but maybe it&#x27;s just me. I love that there is a variety of tip images, single images, and full nail images. Some of these images may be copies, but hey, I shouldn&#x27;t complain. Like other have pointed out, the dice image is messed up, but I don&#x27;t plan to use it. Overall, I prefer this set over Bundle Monster&#x27;s, which lacks variety, isn&#x27;t packaged individually, and is more expensive.</li>
            <li> Purchased this set to go with my Konad stamper and scraper.  They work great.  Lots of designs to choose from to fit your mood!  There are a few that I will probably never use, but still well worth the cost compared to the price of buying individual disks.</li>
            <li> MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit  Great set borrowed to my nail tech and can&#x27;t get it back...she&#x27;s having too much fun!</li>
            <li> This set comes with 25 nail-stamping plates. Unlike the Bundle Monster sets, MASH plates are \\&quot;inspired by\\&quot; their respective Konad plates. m45 in this set is strikingly similar (oho) to the m45 Konad set.    I&#x27;m sure there are some who say \\&quot;you get what you pay for,\\&quot; as far as the quality, and to that, I say: do you NEED any more than you pay for? The designs come out, they function just like the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot; and I for one don&#x27;t have the money to spend 5-7 dollars per plate.    That said, there was an error with one of my plates. On m72, the sizing and placement of the letters (LOVEU) seems to have been thrown off at some point in the plate creation process. I&#x27;m not too upset as it&#x27;s ONE image out of all 25 plates, but that&#x27;s what prevents this from getting 5 stars. Is it enough of a problem for me to ask for a duplicate? No, I wouldn&#x27;t want them to waste shipping costs. Just be aware that such an error MAY happen with your order.    The full-nail designs are HUGE and there&#x27;s lots of variety. If MASH creates another set of more Konad-inspired plates, I&#x27;ll definitely buy them!</li>
            <li> These stamps are soo amazing and I haven&#x27;t even tried them all! I bought the Konad Stamper but I use normal nail polish, I just make sure the polish is opaque, like you only need one coat. Using regular polish can save you sooo much money!</li>
            <li> Even though i am still getting use to it. I have to say i love all the possiblities i have to be creative</li>
            <li> I already have the [[ASIN:B003ILUQPM Bundle Monster set]] of image plates sold on Amazon. They&#x27;re great, similar idea. But a lot of the BM&#x27;s full nail designs were too small for my average size nails. I heard a lot of good things about the MASH set so when I saw it was back in stock I bought it. I ordered late Thursday night, it shipped Friday morning, and I got it Monday afternoon.     The images are FANTASTIC. I was really really impressed with the quality of the stamps I was able to make using the MASH plates. Even using a Revlon polish (not the special Konad stamping polish that works the best with image plates) I was able to consistently produce crisp, bold images.     Most of the images are copies of authentic Konad plates. This is great for me because it adds variety to my BM set without duplicating the images I already have. The full nail designs on the MASH plates are very large, especially when compared to the BM plates.     BM vs. MASH:  -MASH has more plates for less money.   -The MASH images are etched better.  -The MASH plate designs are similar (exact, really) to the Konad plates so you are able to replicate nail designs seen on bloggers.   -The MASH full nail images are much larger than BM.   -BM has cute designs which are generally unique to the BM set.  -BM has a lot of coordinating full nail, French tip, and center of the nail designs.    If you were deciding between the MASH plates and the BM plates, I heavily recommend getting the MASH set. However, if you have more money to invest in nail art and want more unique images (especially coordinating sets of full nail, French tip, and center of the nail images), I recommend also getting the BM set.    Bottom line: these plates are CHEAP and GREAT quality. A must buy for anyone intrested in stamping nail art!</li>
            <li> So I think these stencil plates are of a much higher quality than the Konad brand plates.  I really like the fact that they&#x27;re all metal versus the Konad brand that a has a paper backing (it&#x27;s thick, but all the same, it IS paper!  I&#x27;m really not sure why someone would  use a paper backing on a product that requires the use of acetone and nail polish!  I guess it all boils down to money. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s cheaper to manufacture that way and you&#x27;d certainly have to replace them much more often than you would the solid metal plates).  I&#x27;m sure that this will allow the MASH brand to last MUCH  longer than the plates that came with my stencil starter set.  The shipping speed on this order was just ok.  It took 6 days to get here.  It probably could have been a little better but it&#x27;s certainly not worth deducting stars from the rating.</li>
            <li> There are maybe a couple images that are a little off including number M72 the \\&quot;I love u\\&quot; plate. Isn&#x27;t correct. But from what I can tell, they are almost perfect! Thank goodness they put these back on Amazon! I&#x27;m so happy with these plates~</li>
            <li> BUY THEM! They work beautifully and they are so much fun to use! The designs are great and apparently exactly the same as the konad brand.  I mean honestly, you cant really go wrong with these.  I paid ten dollars. Ordered them on thursday and got them on monday.  This is my first time using a product like this and my first attempt at a design turned out perfect. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I thought because of how cheap these were that they would not have very good quality, but these are great! I have the Bundle Monster set and these are much larger and better quality than those. The french tips fit your nail and the designs are big enough to fit and they go on great! I love this set! Way more worth it than the bundle monster set, but still nice to have both.</li>
            <li> I loved these plates.... transfer is super easy and clean it does not matter what nail polish you use but if you use Konad the image is sharper. I totally recommend these plates I have purchased Bundle Monster and FASH and MASH is way better quality....</li>
            <li> I already have a few Konad stamping plates. When I saw the MASH set I figured for the price it was worth seeing if they worked. You can get this whole set for the price of two stamping plates from the other brand. THESE WORK JUST AS WELL. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and now I can spend the money I saved on more nail polish!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly.  These plates work as well as the Konad plates.  Only two of the images were defective. On the m72 plate, the LOVE letters are bigger than the image so they don&#x27;t come centered on the image.  On m56 the checkered french tip was not sketched right.  Some of the squares have a line through them.  These are a GREAT BUY for the money!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After deliberating over which set to buy to try my hand at nail stamping, I finally decided on this one. While admittedly it does take some practice to stamp your own nails, I first experimented on my mother. WOW the results where fabulous! I highly recommend this set. One of the plates does have an irregularity but for the price 1 slightly off plate is well worth the purchase price. The shipping for this item was super swift! I ordered on Friday in the mid afternoon and it was promptly on my doorstep early Monday morning! I really didn&#x27;t expect it to arrive that fast! The designs on the plate are crisp, pretty, detailed and fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the inexperienced like me It will take a lot of practice to get placement correctly but if you watch the youtube videos and keep at it, you will have nail designs that will be the envy of any salon! The best part of these plates are that you don&#x27;t need any special nail polishes, I used regular polish that I got at local beauty supply stores that were not brand name and they worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> So, I have lately been into doing my nails. I was looking at nail tutorials on youtube and ran across one with konad. After much research, I thought I would get this brand since it is the cheepest. From what I heard, these worked better than the Bundle Monster ones and you get more for your buy.\  I LOVE THESE! I am in a play and I came in with one of the designs stamped onto my nails and kept getting comments on my nails. \\&quot;Ooooh! I love your nails! Where did you get them??\\&quot; As if I bought fake nails. \\&quot;OOOOOOh! Let me see your nails!\\&quot; \\&quot;Are those fake?\\&quot; I had a group of girls just looking at my nails. If felt pretty darn good. :) It works pretty good, sometimes doesn&#x27;t go on perfect and maybe smudges or something, but you can&#x27;t beat this amazing price.</li>
            <li> I love these stamping plates!  They have great designs and are easy to work with.  The price is great as well!</li>
            <li> This set is gorgeous with a variety of images! The plates come sealed in individual packets and the design are covered with a blue plastic, versus clear plastic like other companies do, making it easier to remove before using. The plates are of good quality though the edges are bit sharper than i&#x27;d like. The image sizes are generous though a few are a bit too big to fit entirely on my nails. The full nail designs are big enough to even cover my entire thumb nail in one go. Overall, this set is a wonderful value and would be a great edition to any nail art aficionado&#x27;s collection! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> awesome plates ! I live in ohio and ordered these plated the 18th reciveved these today the 21st amazing value ! They work great and who can beat the price ??? FOR 25 PLATES helloooo !! lol enough said buy them allready !! lol I am so excited  i have tried two plates so I cant wait to try all of them :)</li>
            <li> I have 2 konads and like them but they are too expensive at $7.00 a piece.  When I saw these and read the reviews I just had to try them. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price of $14.00 including shipping (for 25 of them!) I saved so much money! They are totally worth it and much much more.  I&#x27;ve only tried a few  and they came out beautifully.   I&#x27;ve always polished my own nails and now I can make them look extra pretty just as if I went to the nail salon but for a whole lot less. There are so many designs, it&#x27;s hard to choose which ones to use next. You have to experiment with different nail polishes, a lot of regular polishes work well. That&#x27;s another savings because Konad polishes are expensive too. I get so many compliments on my nails and now with all of these designs I guess I will be for a long long time. A few days after I ordered these they sold out.  I&#x27;m so lucky I saw them when I did. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be back so keep on eye out for them.  You&#x27;ll be so glad you did.</li>
            <li> after getting a konad set i wanted more plates but didnt want to pay $7 for one plate. I didnt even know they have a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; version of these. after reading the reviews i deceided to get them. These plates as just as good as the konad ones. if they offered another set that was different i would probably buy them. this set is worth the money</li>
            <li> This is a deal you honestly cannot pass up. Yes some are exact duplicates so make sure you don&#x27;t own copies of these plates. They work absolutely amazing, and so easy to use. For 15 bucks? Honestly cannot go wrong. I am sooo happy with this.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast, I received this item in two days because I lived in California. Overall, the pictures look great and the sketching is really good. If they have new designs coming out, I will buy it for sure! It&#x27;s really good and affordable!</li>
            <li> I got my image plates a week early so was happy with that. I love the plates they are easy to use and fun for all the girls in the family. The only thing that would have been nice if Mash had also sold the Scraper and stamper on their site, but other then that, love it.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have! Especially if you love the konad images but don&#x27;t have the funds to splurge. Very happy. Will buy more and def recommend it to all. Love it!</li>
            <li> It has many designs that I love. I play with different combinations of colors and designs. It has an infinite number of possible combinations to decorate the nails.</li>
            <li> I have a few K**** plates.  I have the BM set.  And then I saw mention of this set on MUA (makeupalley.com).  Well, my friends, I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did receive a few of the &#x27;K&#x27; plates with my first stamping starter set, I have never purchased any more of them because of the price!  At $6-7 PER PLATE, it&#x27;s just too much!  So I ordered the BM set, and got a free plate with a \\&quot;hello kitty\\&quot; design from another site(love it! they do that promotion all the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, when I heard about these I was STOKED!!!  Most of the plates are EXACT DUPES to the K brand plates.  A couple are dupes of ones in my collection but I don&#x27;t care.  I&#x27;ll keep them for backup or possibly swap them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just happy that, for less than the price of 3 of the other plates, I was able to get my hot little hands on most of the full nail and french tip plates I had been lemming for some time.  Yay! &#x3D;0)  I&#x27;ve been looking forward to owning the \\&quot;splat\\&quot; design for SO LONG!  And with that plate specifically, the other designs on it don&#x27;t appeal to me-- so spending $6-7 for JUST THE ONE DESIGN that I&#x27;d use (SPLAT!) seemed kinda over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was thrilled to be able to order this set for so cheap!  25 of the K plates would cost me around a hundred and fifty-one bux. SERIOUSLY? That is a HUGE savings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the specifics, YES they come separately packaged, each in it&#x27;s own little cello bag that says MASH at the top.  And YES they do have a blue plastic coating on top of them. I did find that the blue plastic was WAY easier to remove than the clear plastic on the BM plates.&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The quality of these is amazing. I have other cheap-o plates that are so FLIMSY! As in, if I wanted to I could probably fold them in half.  Not so with these. The MASH plates are a thicker metal and are very durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The images are etched well. I did notice the same flaw another reviewer mentioned on the full naildesign- the writing is not centered. As for the \\&quot;I_Y\\&quot; design... take a look at the rest of the plate.  I believe this is not a typo or flaw. The plate also has a heart on it.  SOOoo... if you stamped the heart in the middleo of the I_Y (let&#x27;s say you stamp the &amp;lt;3 in a different color), what you&#x27;re left with is a design that looks something like \\&quot;I &amp;lt;3 Y.\\&quot;  Lame? Yes. But it does make some kind of sense. I heart Y for You. Hey give them a break. English is not their first language, ok?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) While the quality of the etching is fine, I did have a couple plates have flaws on them. On the houndstooth design, it appears that there was a hair on the bed of the machine - so there is a line going through the design where it was not etched properly.  It does stamp that way, but it&#x27;s not too noticeable. I will ask for a replacement plate- we&#x27;ll see how that goes and I&#x27;ll try to update you on that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  The only other flawed plate in my set was the one with the dice on it. The dice look funny and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my set, or if that&#x27;s how it was designed. Instead of 1 dot or 2 dots, etc. There is a face of the die with 3 dots very close together (touching) in a triangular shape.  Yeah. I&#x27;ve never seen a dice like that either.  Also, the flowers on the same plate have dashed lines around the perimiter- on the smaller flower, there is a dash or two missing. strange. but I don&#x27;t use flowers so I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, for the money- these are a STEAL. I would buy them again in a heartbeat!  Great gift for the nail polish and nail art enthusiast in your life.  And PERFECT if you&#x27;re just getting into nail art. Buy this set and get your hands on a stamper (use a credit card to scrape with). You CAN use regular polish to stamp with- just use one-coaters and you&#x27;ll be fine. There&#x27;s even a list online somewhere of brands and colors that stamp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  Great value. Don&#x27;t expect ABSOLUTE perfection, but the quality far exceeds other budget friendly sets I&#x27;ve seen out there.  I would absolutely buy this set again for the price I paid (Under fifteen bux).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing I wanted to mention- there&#x27;s a plate with a Koala bear on it. So cute!  But look at the other images on that same plate.  There are coordinating images so you can stamp the tree the koala is holding into, and the leaves on the tree.  So cute!  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but the idea is that you can combine these 3 stamps and get a design with up to 3 different colors! (maybe grey for the Koala, brown for the tree trunk, and green for the foliage, etc.) I think this type of breaking up of designs is brilliant!  It may require use of the smaller end of the K brand double stamper, though, which I don&#x27;t have yet.  Just wanted to put that out there as I haven&#x27;t heard anyone else mention that plate yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY it already!  After reading all this, you deserve it, girl! XD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**TIP: Store your plates in a business card file, an old CD case, or use those clear hobby card protector sleeves. You could even use those plastic inserts that hold photos in your wallet! But with this many plates, you will want to have them stored in protective sleeves so they don&#x27;t scratch eachother or slice you while going thru them. ((I&#x27;ve never been cut by an image plate- just be careful with them!))**</li>
            <li> When it comes to any beauty product, I never really sacrifice quality just so I can get a cheaper deal. And in the same way, I purchase something so expensive only if I get what I pay for. After having the konad, bundle monster and the mash plates I can say that quality wise and money wise, Mash is the way to go. Its so affordable yet so well-replicated to the konad one. If you have high standards, this wont let you down.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I never used the brand name Konad plates before, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare these to. However, I found them easy to use with the double ended Konad stamper. The images came out clear even without the Konad special nail polish. I used sally hansen Insta-dry nail polish in Uptempo Plum &amp; Jumpin Jade, and Kiss brand nail art polish in white. They both turned out well, and it didn&#x27;t matter what brand I used as a base. I used pure acetone to clean the plates off and they cleaned up just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the selection of plates to be really varied and great for all occasions, so I don&#x27;t see having any need to get additional plates. I especially liked the houndstooth design and the little french tip bowtie. So cute and if you use the right colors, they can even look &#x27;grown up&#x27; and not so &#x27;omg what is on your fingers?&#x27;. I used Sally Hansen Insta Dry in Petal Pusher as my base with a stamp in white. It looked very classic and appropriate for a 31 year old &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for a fun &amp; unique product. I could see myself buying these as gifts for my girlfriends, now that I know they work!</li>
            <li> Love these. Make sure you are using the right kind of polish and they work great. Easy to use. Always have cute finger and toe nails!</li>
            <li> This is a steal ! The patterns are deep enough so you can stamp with ease.Most of the plates are just like konad at much much better price ! Buy them,you will love them !</li>
            <li> This work great. I have the Konads too and I wish I had just bought these I could have saved some money good thing I only have a couple Konads. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I waited for these plates to come back on the market since they have had better reviews that the bundle monster plates!  I have just started using the stamper and was really impressed with how easy it is to create fun designs on my and my daughter&#x27;s nails!  There is little difference between the Konad and these plates so it&#x27;s really nice to get the same look without the huge price!  There is only one plate that has a flaw in it and I assume that they all do because I have seen other reviews note it also, I don&#x27;t really like the design, it says love but the letter are to big and don&#x27;t fit properly like in the Konad plate.   I would love to see more such plate designs from them and would deffiantely buy them!</li>
            <li> These plates are so easy to use and your nails look like a pro did them.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> not bad but harder than you would think to get the image on the nails straight and even... I don&#x27;t have the time it would take to get it right every tme</li>
            <li> I have worn almost all these designs in most colors and I haven&#x27;t been let down yet. I wish I could afford to try all the plates by MASH! They are simply wonderful and make manicures look professional.</li>
            <li> I love these.  They are as good as some of the more expensive brands.  It does help if you use it with some of the specialty nail polishes for stamping but you don&#x27;t have to.  You can use any nail polish you want.  I also like to stamp my nails before the final coat with the gel lamps.  A few designs are strange and I couldn&#x27;t make out what they were but most (95%) were very pretty.  Remember the more you practice the better they turn out.  Have fun.</li>
            <li> I have had these for a couple of years and still use them intermittently.  There are an awful lot of them for French nail tips, but there are still a sufficient number of designs for me to use them for full nails and for any purpose that I have.  Just for background, I keep my nails painted most of the time.  I even used the houndstooth plate and took it to a salon to have the nail person do my nails for a wedding.  It matched my dress and turned out really well.</li>
            <li> Often times you get what you pay for but that&#x27;s not the case here! At a fraction of the cost of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; plates these totally exceeded my expectations. There are some very minor differences in a few of the specific designs on these plates but for the price this is hardly a complaint. I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with these plates and after many uses they&#x27;ve held up well. Great product!</li>
            <li> The set has many images, and the cover several different themes.  There&#x27;s pretty much a design for every occasion.  This is one of the best sets I have.  Definately recommend new stampers to start out with a set of these!</li>
            <li> Great if you have time for it.</li>
