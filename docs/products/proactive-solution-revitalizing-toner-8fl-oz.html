            <li>and  some kids had messed up the machine,,, so went on line and got a better deal .&lt;br</li>

            <li>Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
            <li>but it got better after a week or so.  </li>
            <li>I have used if for many years.  </li>
            <li>All of their products are great and really perform so well.  </li>
            <li>Great product and glad to be able to purchase just what i need instead of whole kit.</li>
            <li>Love this...</li>
            <li>I have been using Proactiv for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I will use seller again to purchase more products.</li>

            <li>i love this one</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love using it after shaving</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Ive found it works better than the proactiv cleanser and is WAY CHEAPER.</li>
            <li>We love it and the price here rivals purchasing it from the official site or at one of the kiosks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I hope this seller continues to be able to provide the authentic Proactiv products.  </li>
            <li>The 6oz bottle at the kiosk in the mall is around $45 which is astonishing</li>
            <li>I have been using Proactiv for many years and it has put a stop to my acne.</li>
            <li>and I will always stick with Proactiv:)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I also love the Somme Institute transport pads.</li>
            <li>More is not always better.</li>
            <li>more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>More is not always better.</li>
            <li>more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>great service and fast.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a better price for this product.</li>
            <li>now i use all 3 steps religiously &amp; my skin is great!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling tingly (in a good way) and fresh, and makeup can be applied easily afterwards.  </li>
            <li>using both Proactive products she has a beautiful clear face.</li>
            <li>The oilly then dry water makes my used to be flawless skin turn into a land-mine!</li>
            <li>Last a while an best part is that it&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li>The toner with a great and big bottle is nice.  </li>
            <li>and I survive the day just fine :)</li>
            <li>Always works on keeping my face clean!</li>
            <li>The item shipped very quickly, was appropriately packed and sealed, and is as easy a transaction as you could want.</li>
            <li>To me it is the most important piece of the Proactiv system.</li>
            <li>OK so i use this product with my Clearisol oil free scrubbing beads cleanser.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need the whole system so it is good for me to order it separately</li>
            <li>Easy and cheaper than ordering through kiosk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been blessed to not have too many break-outs in my time, but she sometimes uses make-up for work, and this helps clean out her pores.</li>
            <li>I got a great deal, and it will last me more then a year.</li>
            <li>Easy on your skin</li>
            <li>Hands down anything by proactiv is the best.</li>
            <li>I started using it before I got pregnant with my daughter, when my doctor informed me I would not be able to take my acne medications during a pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>Most boys don&#x27;t want to use acne medication, they are in and out of the bathroom so quick.</li>
            <li>quick delivery too!</li>
            <li>Arrives quickly!</li>
            <li>Amazon is soooo much better than schlepping to a mall when you know exactly what you need!</li>
            <li>I am a huge proactiv fan.</li>
            <li>I wash my face at night then moisturize but in the morning, it&#x27;s a huge hassle for me to wash my face</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, Proactiv isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li>This toner feels nice and is gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>this will be available when I run out.</li>
            <li>Great at removing left over make-up after washing your face.</li>
            <li>This keeps my face and my teenagers acne free.</li>
            <li>This works great for my teen and I.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>It is also alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I CAN BE ACNE FREE IN MY FIFTIES...</li>
            <li>A lower level concentration more regularly is a better and more effective solution with some active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A lower level concentration more regularly is a better and more effective solution with some active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product to complete the original set</li>
            <li>I use this product every day - this was the first time I was able to get a larger bottle at a great price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the large bottle!</li>
            <li>As I am sure many readers are aware, glycolic acid is a main ingredient in many anti-aging products from L&#x27;Oreal to Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
            <li>For me it took two months, but the result was well worth waiting for!  </li>
            <li>I originally tried proactive about 10 years ago and it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product, after learning that it contained witch hazel, glycolic acid, and no drying alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Works great but takes too long to get it!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>It makes your face feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>who doesn&#x27;t like a clean face?</li>
            <li>This stuff is almost cool to the skin, and definitley helps clean it.</li>
            <li>and I love the large bottles and 2 day shipping through Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this purchase was the large size so that made it an even better bargain than I thought.</li>
            <li>I rated the entire luxury-size package as superior.</li>
            <li>A tried and true product.  </li>
            <li>Why pay full price?</li>
            <li>I love getting it from amazon because it is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this here and in such a large container.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best stuff.</li>
            <li>Love shopping on amazon for it because it is a decent price</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>Have noticed softer and more vibrant skin.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and works well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>I also find it reasonably mild.  </li>
            <li>More effective than other products I&#x27;ve tried including witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Clean and clear for sensative skin is better then this toner.</li>
            <li>It is mild, but effective; does not dry skin out, but does remove oil.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for 4 years now and live by it and have turned many others on to it as well.  </li>
            <li>It really works and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t over dry and keeps my skin tone fairly even and fresh...will keep using</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been usng Proactiv for several years now and I love it!  </li>
            <li>exactly!  </li>
            <li>But 8 years later, after I got married I was able to find that using this with the toner was a much better regimen for my face.  </li>
            <li>exactly as it&#x27;s in the pic!</li>
            <li>A lot of product for a reasonable price and quick shipping!</li>
            <li>I love how it cleans my skin, and this large size product is very convenient</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft, and beautiful and clear, I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth trying</li>
            <li>so it was nice to receive the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>I have been using proactiv for 2 years and used to order directly, however they just kept sending more product than needed, and billed me as well.</li>
            <li>Love using proactive for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few years and it seems to work wonderfully in helping keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>Nice to get the larger product.  </li>
            <li>The dirt that is left after a face wash is astounding</li>
            <li>It is worth a try if you&#x27;ve never used it before.  </li>
            <li>Buying on Amazon gives you the best of both worlds in that you get the product at the same price or cheaper, and, no automatic bills for $40-50 every other month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped nicely with break outs especially in the hot humid  weather in MN this year.</li>
            <li>Works very well and clean feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who can go buy it at their nearest mall, as there are vending machines as most major malls that sell Proactiv products now.  </li>
            <li>my personal opinion, one of the reasons the Proactiv line is so successful is that it uses proven ingredients like glycolic acid and benzoyl peroxide in a lower concentration than many other products.</li>
            <li>Cool and gentle toner.</li>
            <li>It really cleans off any left over residue and leaves you with a refreshing feeling !</li>
            <li>I used to have mild acne, especially in my early teens.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and works quickly.</li>
            <li>Very effective for small acne flare ups.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and is one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t burn when I use it on my super sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been the only thing that works on my face for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv Solution for the last 10 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>When I first started Proactive like 7 years ago for some reason I stopped using Toner.  </li>
            <li>Proactiv speaks for itself as a stellar acne treatment product.  </li>
            <li>But 8 years later, after I got married I was able to find that using this toner after the deep cleansing wash was a much better regimen for my face.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>I just really appreciate being to order it through Amazon and through my prime membership, have it delivered to the house in a couple of days; saves a trip to the store!</li>
            <li>It does not have the same alcohol sting that most astringents do yet</li>
            <li>I just purchased the Proactiv kit for the first time about 6 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can buy a bigger version of this product from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;super fast shipment - thank you!</li>
            <li>but I find the toner really works for me!&#x60;</li>
            <li>Thanks will do business again!</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t sure &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; was essential</li>
            <li>This product helps keep my face clean and clear!</li>
            <li>fast shipping and a good price on a product that I have used for years&lt;br /&gt;glad to be able to purchase it without having to by a whole bunch of other products at the same time</li>
            <li>This bottle was extra large, giving me more.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to have a such a large quantity of toner, because that&#x27;s what I go through the quickest.</li>
            <li>Love that you can get this in such a large size -</li>
            <li>I use with other Proactive products that are also effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this review is of Proactiv&#x27;s toner, I would also note that I think their repairing treatment is good for a similar reason: it only has 2.5% of benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>See you at pimples and wrinkles!would also note that I think their repairing treatment is good for a similar reason: it only has 2.5% of benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>better than buying a whole kit when you only need one part.love the xlarge size.</li>
            <li>However, they are too strong given my recent addition of Retin-A into my regimen.  </li>
            <li>This step adds more peace of mind for me, knowing he is at least using a product that works and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>And for years no matter how much I tried to adhere to the &amp;#34;schedule&amp;#34; I never finished up my supply as quickly as the direct buy website kept insisting I should</li>
            <li>Love this product, great for my really bad breakouts.</li>
            <li>and it was drying out my skin and made it really burn.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I cleaned my face</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much else about this product.</li>
            <li>My son really loves this product.</li>
            <li>Quite gentle on my skin - no burning sensation redness , etc</li>
            <li>You have to use every step of the proactive to really see the results.</li>
            <li>my skin really clears up.</li>
            <li>Really like cleaning my skin with this product at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>the whole 3-steps.</li>
            <li>This product really works ,,,I know when people see it advertised on tv,  you think no way&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The system does absolutely nothing for my acne.  </li>
            <li>but I guess I use too much of stage 2.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>if u pit to much , your skin start pill</li>
            <li>Thanks for checking out the review</li>
            <li>I applied a gentle Cerave moisturizer, like always.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even wear foundation or concealer because there&#x27;s no need to thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>I used to use the whole Proactiv kit, but now all I use is this toner</li>
            <li>This toner is effective without being harsh.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any of the other proactive products any more, but I will continue to use this toner forever.</li>
            <li>She still uses this toner, just not all of the other products any more.  </li>
            <li>Its the original product and it works the same.</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable and the size is decent.</li>
            <li>The main active ingredient is glycolic acid, an AHA (Alpha hydroxy acid), which exfoliates the top layer of your skin and helps unclog your pores.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this toner!</li>
            <li>, it works well for making my skin feel oil free and not overly dry.  </li>
            <li>It runs out so quickly, unless you have the bigger bottle!  </li>
            <li>I love the way it refreshes my face and gets the extra oils out that regular washing can not provide.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than constantly buying different products and hoping they&#x27;ll work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use this toner now and not the cleanse or lotion and am still clean and clear!</li>
            <li>I had acne break outs in high school and used the three step process.</li>

            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Cleans up all the scrub residue and leaves your face feeling ready for bed, out the door with a radiant natural look, or prepared for makeup.  </li>
            <li>I used to use just the #1 cleaner and the #3 cream and just a normal astringent that I bought from like meijer or walmart</li>
            <li>I normally get the three piece set of proactive, but my son always seems to run out if this one too soon</li>
            <li>so I use this with a cotton pad, because the cotton balls waste more product to soak the ball.</li>
            <li>Glycolic acid can be found in strengths of 3%-15% normally.</li>
            <li>my daughter uses this regularly for years, has worked for her helps keep face clear shipped quick and just as described</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Essentials Deep Cleaning Toner Sensitive Skin, 8-Ounce</li>
            <li>I always have like this product, even when I started using the new system.</li>
            <li>It did make a difference for her, but she was still getting new pimples.  </li>

            <li>And be on the lookout for the launch of our new site that will have treatment reviews, spa reviews and product reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent toner as far as toners go</li>
            <li>bottle is a nice size too to last u a few months.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This toner is very soft and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>My son always runs out of toner first, so this allows us to only buy what we need!</li>
            <li>I love this product and didn&#x27;t need all the others that are usually packed with it.</li>
            <li>I truly believe they are exactly the same products.  </li>
            <li>I got the 8oz bottle for the price it normally cost me to buy the 4oz bottle direct.</li>
            <li>replacement of supply-good product-great for combination skin type works well with the other products for daily  uses -love</li>
            <li>No other toner removes the dead skin better and without irritation as this one.</li>
            <li>You can purchase what you need at an amazing price unlike other websites that only offer smaller sizes and charge additional SH for each item ordered.</li>
            <li>Did not work as my wife&#x27;s previous proactive purchases from original manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>I used Proactiv faithfully until a few months ago when I decided to switch to the cheaper Acne Free Clear Skin System [[ASIN:B00070QF20</li>
            <li>AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit (Purifying Cleanser, Renewing Toner, Repair Lotion)]].  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not helping to clear up my acne</li>
            <li>This toner had helped clear blemishes that I have had on my skin for a while.</li>
            <li>It came early..</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d still want the lotion to complete the process though.</li>
            <li>it works much the same.</li>
            <li>I have been using proactive products since 10 years and used to buy from company direct but in pair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv products for 3 three years and although they are more expensive that the mass market items and only available through the internet, they continue to perform.</li>
            <li>This is for my 15 year old grandson.  </li>
            <li>The reason I like this toner is that it doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin, and the seller shipped it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter uses this system and it appears to be working very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do the subscription from the company&#x27;s website because 1)I don&#x27;t use all the products that they make you buy and 2)they send the products too frequently.  </li>
            <li>Recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend either[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have completely skipped the cleanser and the micro crystal bottles.</li>
            <li>Because of this toner and a couple mary kay products, my skin has really cleared up and improving daily.</li>
            <li>keeps my adult acne</li>
            <li>I started using Proactiv when I was 15 years old and it has worked for me ever since.</li>
            <li>Proactive really works: you&#x27;ve heard it multiple times, and</li>
            <li>I can actually feel the magic in this toner working in my pores everyday.</li>
            <li>Without having to stalk down some mall kiosk clerk I can conveniently find exactly what I need, when I am ready for it</li>
            <li>so this was a no brainer to buy especially since you still get more for less money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this was an honest mistake, but for those of us who live in heavy metropolitan areas with less time to spare, it can be hard to return products and have them re-shipped.</li>
            <li>I bought this after going to the demo , and his medications didn&#x27;t do half as good as this , which is hard  to believe.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I am not sure but dont think its available in Germany.</li>
            <li>I used to order 4fl of toner, but it runs out fast and this 8fl toner bottle will last long and bit of bargain than 4fl.will order this toner 8fl again for my 15yr old daughter!</li>
            <li>My friend finally gave me some proactive, the new stuff, and I decided,</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the itching turned into burning, and my skin turned bright red.  </li>
            <li>I am a 47year old woman who has tried everything to keep my skin clear of pimples.this is the only product brand that works,</li>
            <li>The wife had a problem with her &amp;#34;complexion&amp;#34; a few months back and ordered this and the Advanced Blemish Treatment.  </li>
            <li>They prevent my 43 year old female skin from looking like that of a 12 year old boy.  </li>
            <li>This active ingredient isn&#x27;t only for acne, its a very important active ingredient to have in your anti-aging regimen as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste any more $$ on other products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I finally have clear skin, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only thing that gives me a clear complexion.</li>
            <li>Two of my daughters had early teen onset acne.</li>
            <li>The only drawback with it is that if you order direct, they require an auto-shipment scheme to keep sucking money out of you.  </li>
            <li>This is probably to only Proactiv product that works for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>forward to present day, and this new stuff is actually working.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>must use product for me during the hot, humid summer months, and any time other than winter when my skin gets dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed how this toner moistens, eliminates loose flakes, and cleans off extra gunk many face washes leave behind.</li>
            <li>even when I try to use little as possible, it comes on too much.</li>
            <li>I ordered this along with pProactive blemish cream for my grand daughter who has very oily skin and HAD bad acne.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>

            <li> The oilly then dry water makes my used to be flawless skin turn into a land-mine!</li>
            <li> Last a while an best part is that it&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li> The toner with a great and big bottle is nice.  </li>
            <li> and I survive the day just fine :)</li>
            <li> Always works on keeping my face clean!</li>
            <li> The item shipped very quickly, was appropriately packed and sealed, and is as easy a transaction as you could want.</li>
            <li> To me it is the most important piece of the Proactiv system.</li>
            <li> OK so i use this product with my Clearisol oil free scrubbing beads cleanser.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need the whole system so it is good for me to order it separately</li>
            <li> Easy and cheaper than ordering through kiosk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed to not have too many break-outs in my time, but she sometimes uses make-up for work, and this helps clean out her pores.</li>
            <li> I got a great deal, and it will last me more then a year.</li>
            <li> Easy on your skin</li>
            <li> Hands down anything by proactiv is the best.</li>
            <li> I started using it before I got pregnant with my daughter, when my doctor informed me I would not be able to take my acne medications during a pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> Most boys don&#x27;t want to use acne medication, they are in and out of the bathroom so quick.</li>
            <li> quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> Arrives quickly!</li>
            <li> Amazon is soooo much better than schlepping to a mall when you know exactly what you need!</li>
            <li> I am a huge proactiv fan.</li>
            <li> I wash my face at night then moisturize but in the morning, it&#x27;s a huge hassle for me to wash my face</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, Proactiv isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li> This toner feels nice and is gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> this will be available when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great at removing left over make-up after washing your face.</li>
            <li> This keeps my face and my teenagers acne free.</li>
            <li> This works great for my teen and I.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> It is also alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I CAN BE ACNE FREE IN MY FIFTIES...</li>
            <li> A lower level concentration more regularly is a better and more effective solution with some active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lower level concentration more regularly is a better and more effective solution with some active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product to complete the original set</li>
            <li> I use this product every day - this was the first time I was able to get a larger bottle at a great price!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the large bottle!</li>
            <li> As I am sure many readers are aware, glycolic acid is a main ingredient in many anti-aging products from L&#x27;Oreal to Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
            <li> For me it took two months, but the result was well worth waiting for!  </li>
            <li> I originally tried proactive about 10 years ago and it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, after learning that it contained witch hazel, glycolic acid, and no drying alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Works great but takes too long to get it!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> It makes your face feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t like a clean face?</li>
            <li> This stuff is almost cool to the skin, and definitley helps clean it.</li>
            <li> and I love the large bottles and 2 day shipping through Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this purchase was the large size so that made it an even better bargain than I thought.</li>
            <li> I rated the entire luxury-size package as superior.</li>
            <li> A tried and true product.  </li>
            <li> Why pay full price?</li>
            <li> I love getting it from amazon because it is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this here and in such a large container.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best stuff.</li>
            <li> Love shopping on amazon for it because it is a decent price</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> Have noticed softer and more vibrant skin.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and works well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> I also find it reasonably mild.  </li>
            <li> More effective than other products I&#x27;ve tried including witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Clean and clear for sensative skin is better then this toner.</li>
            <li> It is mild, but effective; does not dry skin out, but does remove oil.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 4 years now and live by it and have turned many others on to it as well.  </li>
            <li> It really works and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t over dry and keeps my skin tone fairly even and fresh...will keep using</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been usng Proactiv for several years now and I love it!  </li>
            <li> exactly!  </li>
            <li> But 8 years later, after I got married I was able to find that using this with the toner was a much better regimen for my face.  </li>
            <li> exactly as it&#x27;s in the pic!</li>
            <li> A lot of product for a reasonable price and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I love how it cleans my skin, and this large size product is very convenient</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft, and beautiful and clear, I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth trying</li>
            <li> so it was nice to receive the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using proactiv for 2 years and used to order directly, however they just kept sending more product than needed, and billed me as well.</li>
            <li> Love using proactive for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years and it seems to work wonderfully in helping keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Nice to get the larger product.  </li>
            <li> The dirt that is left after a face wash is astounding</li>
            <li> It is worth a try if you&#x27;ve never used it before.  </li>
            <li> Buying on Amazon gives you the best of both worlds in that you get the product at the same price or cheaper, and, no automatic bills for $40-50 every other month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped nicely with break outs especially in the hot humid  weather in MN this year.</li>
            <li> Works very well and clean feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who can go buy it at their nearest mall, as there are vending machines as most major malls that sell Proactiv products now.  </li>
            <li> my personal opinion, one of the reasons the Proactiv line is so successful is that it uses proven ingredients like glycolic acid and benzoyl peroxide in a lower concentration than many other products.</li>
            <li> Cool and gentle toner.</li>
            <li> It really cleans off any left over residue and leaves you with a refreshing feeling !</li>
            <li> I used to have mild acne, especially in my early teens.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and works quickly.</li>
            <li> Very effective for small acne flare ups.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and is one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t burn when I use it on my super sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been the only thing that works on my face for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv Solution for the last 10 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> When I first started Proactive like 7 years ago for some reason I stopped using Toner.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv speaks for itself as a stellar acne treatment product.  </li>
            <li> But 8 years later, after I got married I was able to find that using this toner after the deep cleansing wash was a much better regimen for my face.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> I just really appreciate being to order it through Amazon and through my prime membership, have it delivered to the house in a couple of days; saves a trip to the store!</li>
            <li> It does not have the same alcohol sting that most astringents do yet</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Proactiv kit for the first time about 6 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can buy a bigger version of this product from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;super fast shipment - thank you!</li>
            <li> but I find the toner really works for me!&#x60;</li>
            <li> Thanks will do business again!</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t sure &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; was essential</li>
            <li> This product helps keep my face clean and clear!</li>
            <li> fast shipping and a good price on a product that I have used for years&lt;br /&gt;glad to be able to purchase it without having to by a whole bunch of other products at the same time</li>
            <li> This bottle was extra large, giving me more.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to have a such a large quantity of toner, because that&#x27;s what I go through the quickest.</li>
            <li> Love that you can get this in such a large size -</li>
            <li> I use with other Proactive products that are also effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this review is of Proactiv&#x27;s toner, I would also note that I think their repairing treatment is good for a similar reason: it only has 2.5% of benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> See you at pimples and wrinkles!would also note that I think their repairing treatment is good for a similar reason: it only has 2.5% of benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> better than buying a whole kit when you only need one part.love the xlarge size.</li>
            <li> However, they are too strong given my recent addition of Retin-A into my regimen.  </li>
            <li> This step adds more peace of mind for me, knowing he is at least using a product that works and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> And for years no matter how much I tried to adhere to the &amp;#34;schedule&amp;#34; I never finished up my supply as quickly as the direct buy website kept insisting I should</li>
            <li> Love this product, great for my really bad breakouts.</li>
            <li> and it was drying out my skin and made it really burn.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I cleaned my face</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much else about this product.</li>
            <li> My son really loves this product.</li>
            <li> Quite gentle on my skin - no burning sensation redness , etc</li>
            <li> You have to use every step of the proactive to really see the results.</li>
            <li> my skin really clears up.</li>
            <li> Really like cleaning my skin with this product at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> the whole 3-steps.</li>
            <li> This product really works ,,,I know when people see it advertised on tv,  you think no way&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The system does absolutely nothing for my acne.  </li>
            <li> but I guess I use too much of stage 2.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> if u pit to much , your skin start pill</li>
            <li> Thanks for checking out the review</li>
            <li> I applied a gentle Cerave moisturizer, like always.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even wear foundation or concealer because there&#x27;s no need to thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I used to use the whole Proactiv kit, but now all I use is this toner</li>
            <li> This toner is effective without being harsh.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any of the other proactive products any more, but I will continue to use this toner forever.</li>
            <li> She still uses this toner, just not all of the other products any more.  </li>
            <li> Its the original product and it works the same.</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable and the size is decent.</li>
            <li> The main active ingredient is glycolic acid, an AHA (Alpha hydroxy acid), which exfoliates the top layer of your skin and helps unclog your pores.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this toner!</li>
            <li> , it works well for making my skin feel oil free and not overly dry.  </li>
            <li> It runs out so quickly, unless you have the bigger bottle!  </li>
            <li> I love the way it refreshes my face and gets the extra oils out that regular washing can not provide.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than constantly buying different products and hoping they&#x27;ll work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use this toner now and not the cleanse or lotion and am still clean and clear!</li>
            <li> I had acne break outs in high school and used the three step process.</li>
            <li> I had acne break outs in high school and used the three step process.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Cleans up all the scrub residue and leaves your face feeling ready for bed, out the door with a radiant natural look, or prepared for makeup.  </li>
            <li> I used to use just the #1 cleaner and the #3 cream and just a normal astringent that I bought from like meijer or walmart</li>
            <li> I normally get the three piece set of proactive, but my son always seems to run out if this one too soon</li>
            <li> so I use this with a cotton pad, because the cotton balls waste more product to soak the ball.</li>
            <li> Glycolic acid can be found in strengths of 3%-15% normally.</li>
            <li> my daughter uses this regularly for years, has worked for her helps keep face clear shipped quick and just as described</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear Essentials Deep Cleaning Toner Sensitive Skin, 8-Ounce</li>
            <li> I always have like this product, even when I started using the new system.</li>
            <li> It did make a difference for her, but she was still getting new pimples.  </li>

            <li> And be on the lookout for the launch of our new site that will have treatment reviews, spa reviews and product reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent toner as far as toners go</li>
            <li> bottle is a nice size too to last u a few months.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This toner is very soft and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> My son always runs out of toner first, so this allows us to only buy what we need!</li>
            <li> I love this product and didn&#x27;t need all the others that are usually packed with it.</li>
            <li> I truly believe they are exactly the same products.  </li>
            <li> I got the 8oz bottle for the price it normally cost me to buy the 4oz bottle direct.</li>
            <li> replacement of supply-good product-great for combination skin type works well with the other products for daily  uses -love</li>
            <li> No other toner removes the dead skin better and without irritation as this one.</li>
            <li> You can purchase what you need at an amazing price unlike other websites that only offer smaller sizes and charge additional SH for each item ordered.</li>
            <li> Did not work as my wife&#x27;s previous proactive purchases from original manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I used Proactiv faithfully until a few months ago when I decided to switch to the cheaper Acne Free Clear Skin System [[ASIN:B00070QF20</li>
            <li> AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit (Purifying Cleanser, Renewing Toner, Repair Lotion)]].  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not helping to clear up my acne</li>
            <li> This toner had helped clear blemishes that I have had on my skin for a while.</li>
            <li> It came early..</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d still want the lotion to complete the process though.</li>
            <li> it works much the same.</li>
            <li> I have been using proactive products since 10 years and used to buy from company direct but in pair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv products for 3 three years and although they are more expensive that the mass market items and only available through the internet, they continue to perform.</li>
            <li> This is for my 15 year old grandson.  </li>
            <li> The reason I like this toner is that it doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin, and the seller shipped it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter uses this system and it appears to be working very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do the subscription from the company&#x27;s website because 1)I don&#x27;t use all the products that they make you buy and 2)they send the products too frequently.  </li>
            <li> Recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend either[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have completely skipped the cleanser and the micro crystal bottles.</li>
            <li> Because of this toner and a couple mary kay products, my skin has really cleared up and improving daily.</li>
            <li> keeps my adult acne</li>
            <li> I started using Proactiv when I was 15 years old and it has worked for me ever since.</li>
            <li> Proactive really works: you&#x27;ve heard it multiple times, and</li>
            <li> I can actually feel the magic in this toner working in my pores everyday.</li>
            <li> Without having to stalk down some mall kiosk clerk I can conveniently find exactly what I need, when I am ready for it</li>
            <li> so this was a no brainer to buy especially since you still get more for less money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this was an honest mistake, but for those of us who live in heavy metropolitan areas with less time to spare, it can be hard to return products and have them re-shipped.</li>
            <li> I bought this after going to the demo , and his medications didn&#x27;t do half as good as this , which is hard  to believe.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I am not sure but dont think its available in Germany.</li>
            <li> I used to order 4fl of toner, but it runs out fast and this 8fl toner bottle will last long and bit of bargain than 4fl.will order this toner 8fl again for my 15yr old daughter!</li>
            <li> My friend finally gave me some proactive, the new stuff, and I decided,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the itching turned into burning, and my skin turned bright red.  </li>
            <li> I am a 47year old woman who has tried everything to keep my skin clear of pimples.this is the only product brand that works,</li>
            <li> The wife had a problem with her &amp;#34;complexion&amp;#34; a few months back and ordered this and the Advanced Blemish Treatment.  </li>
            <li> They prevent my 43 year old female skin from looking like that of a 12 year old boy.  </li>
            <li> This active ingredient isn&#x27;t only for acne, its a very important active ingredient to have in your anti-aging regimen as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste any more $$ on other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I finally have clear skin, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only thing that gives me a clear complexion.</li>
            <li> Two of my daughters had early teen onset acne.</li>
            <li> The only drawback with it is that if you order direct, they require an auto-shipment scheme to keep sucking money out of you.  </li>
            <li> This is probably to only Proactiv product that works for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> forward to present day, and this new stuff is actually working.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> must use product for me during the hot, humid summer months, and any time other than winter when my skin gets dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how this toner moistens, eliminates loose flakes, and cleans off extra gunk many face washes leave behind.</li>
            <li> even when I try to use little as possible, it comes on too much.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with pProactive blemish cream for my grand daughter who has very oily skin and HAD bad acne.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> At first, it did make my skin feel a little itchy and dry</li>
            <li> , cleans pores out well, does not dry your skin (as long as you use a moisturizer afterward).</li>
            <li> During my pregnancy, and after I had my daughter, my skin was an absolute mess!</li>
            <li> No harsh burn like other toners.</li>
            <li> He has been using it for a couple of years, and you can certainly tell when he gets lazy and doesn&#x27;t apply it.</li>
            <li> The 8 oz toner goes a long way because you only need a dab or two on a cotton swab a day.  </li>
            <li> I hated it, and with being 23 I still wanted to have beautiful skin since I never had a problem before.</li>
            <li> but I need the product and its not worth it for me to go through the hassle of sending back and waiting for the actual 8oz bottle.</li>
            <li> but you can get a generic version with the same ingredients at Wal-Mart for much less money.</li>
            <li> I ordered an extra bottle of this solution because it tends to finish quicker than the other products.</li>
            <li> My son found that he ran out of the toner before the other products, so it did not make sense to order the entire kit.  </li>
            <li> My skin care regime includes nothing but Proactiv Solution due to middle-age facial acne.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, it&#x27;s just helpful.</li>
            <li> Well, 10 years ago, all it did was dry out</li>
            <li> My friend think its good,really good,after used , not too dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry my face.</li>
            <li> Some parts are oily and some parts are dry.</li>
            <li> Brands like Clean&amp;Clear and Stridex and even Neutrogena put much higher levels of Benzoly Peroxide in their products and often concentrations of 5% and 10% are too drying and irritating.</li>
            <li> Brands like Clean&amp;Clear and Stridex and even Neutrogena put much higher levels of Benzoly Peroxide in their products and often concentrations of 5% and 10% are too drying and irritating.</li>
            <li> least try the small size first to see if your skin can tolerate it!</li>
            <li> The result is a smoother skin surface, smaller pores and less breakouts.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I find with this is that you do have to use the TEA TREE MOISTURIZER as aging skin has less moisture</li>
            <li> Unlike other toners, Proactiv does not irritate my skin it all (my skin tends to get irritated by alcohol-based toners) nor does it give me that uncomfortable &#x27;tight&#x27; feeling on my face; instead, it makes me feel clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> and you can get very very dry using proactiv without a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and it would automatically send and charge me for another new product when I didn&#x27;t necessarily need it causing me unnecessary cost and an over stocked supply that I didn&#x27;t have room for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and did not find it harsh but will probably not use daily after the snow flies.</li>
            <li> The item was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> You will see results after a few uses if used consistently; daily.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Glycolic acid goes under the upper layers of skin and destroys the &#x60;glue&#x27; which holds dead skin to the surface.</li>
            <li> I use the toner everyday with my regular face wash and it has kept my acne at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont use the rest of their products because they are too harsh for my skin but using this alone, controls my occasional breakouts!</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and product was as stated</li>
            <li> Just as described and expected</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple or black head for months since I started using proactive products.</li>
            <li> When I stop using this my face feels tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, even in combination with other skin care products.</li>
            <li> Product was used as directed as well as with other proactive products as suggested.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say!</li>
            <li> Took a month to due so.</li>
            <li> After trying lots of other products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about the other products, because they&#x27;re alright</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use the other steps</li>
            <li> but there are times when I use it with other branded cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for years in conjunction with the other two steps in the Proactiv system.  </li>
            <li> This size is supposed to last 120 days (and I suppose it would if you were very careful with it), but my wife usually has me reorder it about every 90 days.  </li>
            <li> I recently moved to a well water home which is very harsh on my already senstive skin.</li>
            <li> I think pro active is over priced for what it is.</li>
            <li> Plus, it takes forever to dry, and when it does, my face is so uneven almost like the toner is a sponge taking all of the moisture out of it.</li>
            <li> Proactive toner is deffinately not worth the price.</li>
            <li> My dark are getting lighter and lighter.</li>
            <li> The 8oz will last me at least 6 moths.</li>
            <li> For the price in compairison to other products I have used no significant noticeable improvement to the skin was noticed after a month of use.</li>
            <li> It is less drying for me but still cleanses.</li>
            <li> It is less drying for me but still cleanses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blemishes etc continued to appear unlike previous applications.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried, on one or two occasions, using other products, with terrible results; to be honest, I tried to make the switch for price reasons.  </li>
            <li> on mornings when I am extra lazy or running late this is all I use</li>
            <li> but u can use it for a little while.</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for a few years now and I no longer have acne.</li>
            <li> A lot of money was wasted at the dermatologist before we found this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with acne</li>
            <li> To be completely honest, I HATE IT!</li>
            <li> Use the product for few years now...</li>
            <li> and I usually just use this and the benzoyl peroxide cream</li>
            <li> All my bottles have broken lids by the time they&#x27;re empty.</li>
            <li> I have shopped Amazon for Proactiv in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually use it with the cleanser</li>
            <li> I usually use it in the morning after washing.  </li>
            <li> but my pimples returned in just a few days!  </li>
            <li> She had problems with acne well into her late 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I found a kiosk in my nearby mall but the ONLY reason I go to that blasted place is to buy this stuff.  </li>
            <li> After having my son in my late 30s</li>
            <li> now in my late 30s</li>
            <li> I tried other fancier brands and they were useless.</li>
            <li> I seriously had to switch toners.</li>
            <li> Having said that; this isn&#x27;t the worst deal in the world for Proactiv, when you don&#x27;t want to drive to a mall or there isn&#x27;t one near you</li>
            <li> I was having awful large and painful breakouts?????  </li>
            <li> The texture and smell of the solution are completely different and the Result on my skin has been terrIble.  </li>
            <li> The package deal is so expensive and always piles up.</li>
            <li> It felt really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Freaking expensive but it works.&lt;br /&gt;Wife</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after application, I noticed my face start to itch.  </li>
            <li> it will still come off oilly and dirty.</li>
            <li> and I was desperate to find something that worked.</li>
            <li> But you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-1 Star still very expensive for the components it has..</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> However, after disastrous results I have returned to Proactiv, and still use it today.  </li>
            <li> Completely disappointed and feeling ripped off.</li>
            <li> Anyways, about the toner, I HATE IT!</li>
            <li> but that toner was just awful for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I always have like this product, even when I started using the new system. I found that i still needed this. It came early..</li>
            <li> Been using the toner for years and will use the BP lotion as needed. REMEMBER to sunscreen after. The cleanser was way too drying. I&#x27;m amazed how this toner moistens, eliminates loose flakes, and cleans off extra gunk many face washes leave behind. When I stop using this my face feels tight and dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so good. It has control my acne and cleanse my skin so well. My face looks so much better since I&#x27;ve started using the toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this produce before and it always make my skin look nice! I recommend it, even in combination with other skin care products.</li>
            <li> Two of my daughters had early teen onset acne. This product helped them both. What works for one person may not help another but it is well worth trying and I love the large bottles and 2 day shipping through Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> This product was not Proactiv solution.  The texture and smell of the solution are completely different and the Result on my skin has been terrIble.  Completely disappointed and feeling ripped off.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece, she wanted it.  I think pro active is over priced for what it is. Witch Hazel works as well as this toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been usng Proactiv for several years now and I love it!  I started using it before I got pregnant with my daughter, when my doctor informed me I would not be able to take my acne medications during a pregnancy.  The Proactiv commercials claim that you will see results in 2 weeks.  For me it took two months, but the result was well worth waiting for!  I used Proactiv faithfully until a few months ago when I decided to switch to the cheaper Acne Free Clear Skin System [[ASIN:B00070QF20 AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit (Purifying Cleanser, Renewing Toner, Repair Lotion)]].  What a mistake that was!  You know the saying you get what you pay for....exactly!  So, now I&#x27;m back with my Proactiv.  It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth it.  This toner is effective without being harsh.  It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  1/12/2014  I still use Proactiv.  Over the years I have tried, on one or two occasions, using other products, with terrible results; to be honest, I tried to make the switch for price reasons.  Let&#x27;s face it, Proactiv isn&#x27;t cheap.  However, after disastrous results I have returned to Proactiv, and still use it today.  It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my skin from breaking out.</li>
            <li> Best skin care around!</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for years. I LOVE it. It does a good job exfoliating, clarifying and moisturizing. No drying. I don&#x27;t use any of the other proactive products any more, but I will continue to use this toner forever. It works that well.</li>
            <li> I am a 47year old woman who has tried everything to keep my skin clear of pimples.this is the only product brand that works,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and I love Proactive.  It&#x27;s been the only thing that works on my face for the most part.  I use Noxema face wash when going out into the sun and no Proactive products that day because I can&#x27;t use sunscreen because it breaks me out.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who can go buy it at their nearest mall, as there are vending machines as most major malls that sell Proactiv products now.  Having said that; this isn&#x27;t the worst deal in the world for Proactiv, when you don&#x27;t want to drive to a mall or there isn&#x27;t one near you anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will pay Amazon before buying from the Proactiv website, because once you give them your payment information, they will charge you forever.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to a well water home which is very harsh on my already senstive skin. The oilly then dry water makes my used to be flawless skin turn into a land-mine! I hated it, and with being 23 I still wanted to have beautiful skin since I never had a problem before. I used to use just the #1 cleaner and the #3 cream and just a normal astringent that I bought from like meijer or walmart and it was drying out my skin and made it really burn. No matter how much I cleaned my face it will still come off oilly and dirty. This stuff is almost cool to the skin, and definitley helps clean it. Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> REALLY NICE SIZE MY SON LOVE IT HE DOESN&#x27;T HAVE TO BE WORRY ANY MORE TO RUN OUT OF THOS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;USE EVERY DAY</li>
            <li> Product was in good shape and expiration date was acceptable.</li>
            <li> This product left my face feeling sticky. For the price in compairison to other products I have used no significant noticeable improvement to the skin was noticed after a month of use. Product was used as directed as well as with other proactive products as suggested. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv Solution for the last 10 years and love it.  This is the best deal I have found for it.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it does take care of acne.  This doesn&#x27;t wipe acnes out instantly but it does shorten the time of the healing process, I think.  You&#x27;d still want the lotion to complete the process though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv for close to 10 years.  This bottle was extra large, giving me more.  I seem to go through this faster so it was nice to receive the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I definatley recommend it. The size (8oz) is awsome, you can&#x27;t get the 8 oz size in a vending machine in the mall. The price is great, worth the money. I have been using proactiv for 2 years and used to order directly, however they just kept sending more product than needed, and billed me as well. Can&#x27;t beat the price for this size!</li>
            <li> When I first started Proactive like 7 years ago for some reason I stopped using Toner.  I recently started back and I don&#x27;t know why I stopped!  I really like it.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a good safe yet effective toner this ones one to try! It really cleans off any left over residue and leaves you with a refreshing feeling ! Regular price on this stuff is quite pricey but amazon sells this stuff for an awsome price and for a bigge bottle ! Last a while an best part is that it&#x27;s alcohol free yayyy !!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great. I bought this for my son. It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, it&#x27;s just helpful. Most boys don&#x27;t want to use acne medication, they are in and out of the bathroom so quick. This step adds more peace of mind for me, knowing he is at least using a product that works and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product which I got for a steal here on Amazon.  It seems to work well, as my skin is clearing up.  The 8 oz toner goes a long way because you only need a dab or two on a cotton swab a day.  I recommend using only once a day to start off with.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist said this product is safe to use on my rosacea blemishes. I love how it cleans my skin, and this large size product is very convenient</li>
            <li> Proactiv speaks for itself as a stellar acne treatment product.  The only drawback with it is that if you order direct, they require an auto-shipment scheme to keep sucking money out of you.  Buying on Amazon gives you the best of both worlds in that you get the product at the same price or cheaper, and, no automatic bills for $40-50 every other month.</li>
            <li> I buy my Proactiv products from Amazon for the value. If you&#x27;re reading this you probably already use Proactiv but, if you are thinking of trying it, I definitely would encourage you to do so. It is literally the only thing that has helped my skin, ever.</li>
            <li> I like this toner because it has glycolic acid in it and that is very good for my skin. You get 8 oz. and I usually just use this and the benzoyl peroxide cream and I don&#x27;t need the whole system so it is good for me to order it separately so I am not locked in to the proactiv company. The only thing is these don&#x27;t have  expiration dates on them so I don&#x27;t know if the product is expired or not.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest I have found this product. The package deal is so expensive and always piles up. Keep these deals coming! A lot of product for a reasonable price and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I ordered an extra bottle of this solution because it tends to finish quicker than the other products. I rated the entire luxury-size package as superior.</li>
            <li> great product! Love using proactive for my sensitive skin.Love shopping on amazon for it because it is a decent price</li>
            <li> I love this product. I had acne break outs in high school and used the three step process. It seemed to help. But 8 years later, after I got married I was able to find that using this toner after the deep cleansing wash was a much better regimen for my face.  It is less drying for me but still cleanses. I I love this product. I had acne break outs in high school and used the three step process. It seemed to help. But 8 years later, after I got married I was able to find that using this with the toner was a much better regimen for my face.  It is less drying for me but still cleanses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even on mornings when I am extra lazy or running late this is all I use and I survive the day just fine :)</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Not much else to say! Can&#x27;t say much else about this product. Works for me! And will work for you</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for a few years now and I no longer have acne. I will continue to use it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come back. Keep in mind this is not an overnight solution, it takes a good 4 weeks to see improvements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try proactive and decided to start with the toner. It&#x27;s helped nicely with break outs especially in the hot humid  weather in MN this year. I am in my 50&#x27;s and did not find it harsh but will probably not use daily after the snow flies.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this purchase was the large size so that made it an even better bargain than I thought.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years and it is awesome keeps my skin clear and bright and free of blemishes</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for years and this is the only toner that works for my acne.  I love the size of the bottle - I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months already - and the price was very good.  Much better than ordering it from tv.</li>
            <li> This toner feels nice and is gentle on my skin.  I have been using it for a few years and it seems to work wonderfully in helping keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> My son really loves this product. This is the only product that works for him.  He has tried all different kinds.  I like that they come in bigger sizes.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to have a such a large quantity of toner, because that&#x27;s what I go through the quickest.</li>
            <li> The item was just what I expected. Great price for size and shipping was quick. I will  probably order another one soon. Its great!</li>
            <li> I have used Proactive products for eight years.  I am 56 years and tend to have breakouts.  Proactive keeps them under control.  If I had to choose one Proactive product, it would be the toner.  After washing your face it removes anything left on your face that might cause a breakout.  I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product for both of my granddaughters. All of the Proactive products that they use work unbeleivably well. A lot of money was wasted at the dermatologist before we found this product.</li>
            <li> This product works. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Cleared my skin. Took a month to due so. I still use it.</li>
            <li> Easy and cheaper than ordering through kiosk. My son always runs out of toner first, so this allows us to only buy what we need!</li>
            <li> A tried and true product.  I was thrilled to find it is this size at this price.  Excellent price for this item.</li>
            <li> The wife had a problem with her &amp;#34;complexion&amp;#34; a few months back and ordered this and the Advanced Blemish Treatment.  It did make a difference for her, but she was still getting new pimples.  She bought the Neutragena 3-piece kit and liked it better. I&#x27;m no expert so please be polite.... I&#x27;m just the messenger.</li>
            <li> Ordered AND PAID for the 8oz toner. They shipped me a 4oz toner bottle with an &amp;#34;8oz&amp;#34; label on the bag that it came in. I&#x27;m sure this was an honest mistake, but for those of us who live in heavy metropolitan areas with less time to spare, it can be hard to return products and have them re-shipped. Feel ripped off but I need the product and its not worth it for me to go through the hassle of sending back and waiting for the actual 8oz bottle.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff. I&#x27;ve been blessed to not have too many break-outs in my time, but she sometimes uses make-up for work, and this helps clean out her pores.</li>
            <li> My son found that he ran out of the toner before the other products, so it did not make sense to order the entire kit.  I found a large size of the toner on Amazon for a great price.  Perfect solution!</li>
            <li> The toner with a great and big bottle is nice.  I had an issue with the bottle for the cleanser but did not have the same issue with the toner. I love proactive products!</li>
            <li> Always works on keeping my face clean!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and I highly recommend.  Must use all the steps 1, 2, 3 for best results!  You will see results after a few uses if used consistently; daily.</li>
            <li> Excellent as a make up remover adjunct to my facial wash. Quite gentle on my skin - no burning sensation redness , etc and I have very sensitive skin. This is probably to only Proactiv product that works for my sensitive skin. On time delivery was a plus!</li>
            <li> Seriously the best stuff. Shrunk my pores, evened my complexion, faded pimple scares, and helped pimples go away sooner. I&#x27;ve only used for 2 weeks, morning and night, on my entire face and I have had amazing results. i was referred by my mother-in-law. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results are like after I&#x27;ve used it for awhile.</li>
            <li> I always buy this product!!  Works for me and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy and the price is good.</li>
            <li> You have to use every step of the proactive to really see the results. But you can&#x27;t go wrong! I&#x27;ve been dealing with breakouts and when I use all of the face wash, the toner and the lotion my skin really clears up. It dries up too, so be prepared. 8 oz is a lot though, this is the BIG one!</li>
            <li> Really like cleaning my skin with this product at the end of the day. Kind of works as a make up remover, but also takes away the oil. And it cleans the skin!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Not a cure for acne, but good for treatment and clearing skin. NOTHING can cure acne. People need to realize that.</li>
            <li> I originally tried proactive about 10 years ago and it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me. I&#x27;ve always had trouble with acne and I was desperate to find something that worked. Well, 10 years ago, all it did was dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip forward to present day, and this new stuff is actually working. During my pregnancy, and after I had my daughter, my skin was an absolute mess! I tried everything! My friend finally gave me some proactive, the new stuff, and I decided, what the hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked, and it&#x27;s still working. I only have to use it once a day, the whole 3-steps. If I do it twice a day, it&#x27;s too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally have clear skin, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried it before with no luck, try it again......</li>
            <li> This product really works ,,,I know when people see it advertised on tv,  you think no way&lt;br /&gt;but I bought this after going to the demo , and his medications didn&#x27;t do half as good as this , which is hard  to believe.&lt;br /&gt;and this bottle , is alot for the $$$&lt;br /&gt;went to the mall to get it from the vending machine they have there and  some kids had messed up the machine,,, so went on line and got a better deal .&lt;br /&gt;hope  this will be available when I run out.</li>
            <li> what i was looking for</li>
            <li> exactly as it&#x27;s in the pic! quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> More than happy with very large bottle.  Arrived in timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with pProactive blemish cream for my grand daughter who has very oily skin and HAD bad acne.&lt;br /&gt;She uses the toner after washing her face about 3x a week. We found using this&lt;br /&gt;Proactive  Revitalizing Toner more often caused her face to peel.&lt;br /&gt;Now using both Proactive products she has a beautiful clear face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactive for years.  I just really appreciate being to order it through Amazon and through my prime membership, have it delivered to the house in a couple of days; saves a trip to the store!</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that works for me. Don&#x27;t waste any more $$ on other products. Received quickly. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The toner does not disappoint at all. It does not have the same alcohol sting that most astringents do yet it works much the same.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
            <li> Always a great product, but Amazon has made it so I don&#x27;t have to have a subscription to ProActive to keep in supply. Keeps blemishes in check without drying the skin.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product !</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, great price, very effective!</li>
            <li> I like this and will continue to use/ buy it.  It makes your face feel really clean.  I&#x27;m acne-prone and it helps.</li>
            <li> my daughter uses this regularly for years, has worked for her helps keep face clear shipped quick and just as described</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product is what says is. I have been using it for month now and see a difference. I just use this after my olay face scrub. Have noticed softer and more vibrant skin.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Proactiv kit for the first time about 6 weeks ago.  The system does absolutely nothing for my acne.  It has just been getting progressively worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the toner, it works well for making my skin feel oil free and not overly dry.  At first, it did make my skin feel a little itchy and dry but it got better after a week or so.  However, it&#x27;s not helping to clear up my acne and I do use the products twice daily.  It&#x27;s a decent toner as far as toners go but you can get a generic version with the same ingredients at Wal-Mart for much less money.</li>
            <li> I love Proactive!  I have used if for many years.  After trying lots of other products Proactive works the best for me and I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I use the Proactiv products twice a day and have for years.  All of their products are great and really perform so well.  Great item.</li>
            <li> Great product you use if often but I guess I use too much of stage 2. I work if used regularly</li>
            <li> Great at removing left over make-up after washing your face.</li>
            <li> This keeps my face and my teenagers acne free.</li>
            <li> Delivered in time frame promised.  Product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this toner! It has keep my face looking great for a while now and have had no problems. The large size is great!</li>
            <li> I have been using proactive products since 10 years and used to buy from company direct but in pair. I wanted to buy toner only. it is great product with great price!.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Haven&#x27;t noticed anything drastic though</li>
            <li> Have been using the same product for several years. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product and glad to be able to purchase just what i need instead of whole kit.</li>
            <li> Too drying on my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> This is a must, makes you face feel great! who doesn&#x27;t like a clean face? removes all the excess dirt after washing, wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love that I can buy a bigger version of this product from Amazon.  It runs out so quickly, unless you have the bigger bottle!  To me it is the most important piece of the Proactiv system.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day - this was the first time I was able to get a larger bottle at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;super fast shipment - thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this product and didn&#x27;t need all the others that are usually packed with it. The solution came in its factory wrapper so I didn&#x27;t have to worry that it had been tampered with. Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and works well</li>
            <li> My wife swears that Proactiv cleared up her skin.  She had problems with acne well into her late 40&#x27;s.  She still uses this toner, just not all of the other products any more.  This size is supposed to last 120 days (and I suppose it would if you were very careful with it), but my wife usually has me reorder it about every 90 days.  Even so, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The item shipped very quickly, was appropriately packed and sealed, and is as easy a transaction as you could want.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable for very good size!</li>
            <li> Good price! Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great. It&#x27;s the real deal. No problems or worries of a counterfeit product.  It&#x27;s just a larger, cheaper bottle of the stuff in the mall.</li>
            <li> To be completely honest, I HATE IT! I seriously had to switch toners. Proactiv did work for me only in my forehead section but not anywhere else. My cheeks were pimple invested. Anyways, about the toner, I HATE IT! It&#x27;s too watery for me, even when I try to use little as possible, it comes on too much. Plus, it takes forever to dry, and when it does, my face is so uneven almost like the toner is a sponge taking all of the moisture out of it. It felt really uncomfortable. Toner is supposed to EVEN OUT COMPLEXIONS....and it did not do what it said. I&#x27;m never using it ever. I&#x27;m not talking about the other products, because they&#x27;re alright but that toner was just awful for me.</li>
            <li> After using this I noticed that it made my skin very red. It didn&#x27;t help with my complexion or acne at all. Clean and clear for sensative skin is better then this toner. And CHEAPER. Proactive toner is deffinately not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I actually use this with an Olay cleanser. I save money on skincare overall, by doing that and it works great without the sting.</li>
            <li> Love this product, great for my really bad breakouts. It keeps them at bay and evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love the large bottle! This product is amazing, i love proactive products. The lids aren&#x27;t very good quality though. And often break. All my bottles have broken lids by the time they&#x27;re empty.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactive for years, for me it&#x27;s the only thing that gives me a clear complexion. And for years no matter how much I tried to adhere to the &amp;#34;schedule&amp;#34; I never finished up my supply as quickly as the direct buy website kept insisting I should and it would automatically send and charge me for another new product when I didn&#x27;t necessarily need it causing me unnecessary cost and an over stocked supply that I didn&#x27;t have room for. Without having to stalk down some mall kiosk clerk I can conveniently find exactly what I need, when I am ready for it and it comes in a larger than &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; kit size so it lasts even longer.</li>
            <li> Love this...don&#x27;t use the other steps but I find the toner really works for me!&#x60;</li>
            <li> My friend think its good,really good,after used , not too dry. Maybe will buy again! We are all like it.</li>
            <li> I was buying proactive and stopped cause I was irritated with their auto-send process. I was so happy to find this here and in such a large container. I only use this toner now and not the cleanse or lotion and am still clean and clear!</li>
            <li> Super!&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product whoever suffer from acne. Thank you for a great price and  amazing, working product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the size of the bottle I got a great deal, and it will last me more then a year.</li>
            <li> Why pay full price? I have shopped Amazon for Proactiv in the past. You can purchase what you need at an amazing price unlike other websites that only offer smaller sizes and charge additional SH for each item ordered. Its the original product and it works the same. I have been using Proactiv for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and i received very quick, exactly what I ordered. I will use seller again to purchase more products.</li>
            <li> Great product....I have been using it for several months. Helps to reduce my acne and sooth my skin after cleansing. No harsh burn like other toners. Doesn&#x27;t over dry my face. A little pricey but worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv products for 3 three years and although they are more expensive that the mass market items and only available through the internet, they continue to perform.</li>
            <li> I always come back to this toner.  It&#x27;s mild and does the job.  It helps me combat oiliness and breakouts.  I usually use it with the cleanser but there are times when I use it with other branded cleansers.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> No other toner removes the dead skin better and without irritation as this one. I tried other fancier brands and they were useless. i love this one</li>
            <li> worked awesome at first but then tapered off</li>
            <li> Arrives quickly! This is for my 15 year old grandson.  He has been using it for a couple of years, and you can certainly tell when he gets lazy and doesn&#x27;t apply it.</li>
            <li> Freaking expensive but it works.&lt;br /&gt;Wife LOVES it since we discovered Proactive, buying ever since...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 Star still very expensive for the components it has..</li>
            <li> This is the only toner that keeps my daughter&#x27;s acne under control. We can&#x27;t be without it.  Product arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Excellent price.  I&#x27;m a user of toners.  Like to wipe my face with a cotton pad after I get out of the shower, before i go to bed or during the day when I want to freshen up.</li>
            <li> Nice to get the larger product.  Doing wonders for my sons complexion</li>
            <li> Works great but takes too long to get it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff if used along with all of Proactiv product line. I&#x27;ve found out you can&#x27;t skip any of the products and get the best results.</li>
            <li> Did not work as my wife&#x27;s previous proactive purchases from original manufacturer.  Blemishes etc continued to appear unlike previous applications.</li>
            <li> I normally get the three piece set of proactive, but my son always seems to run out if this one too soon so I just buy the extra bottle. Works great!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this toner! Great price too!</li>
            <li> This toner had helped clear blemishes that I have had on my skin for a while. My dark are getting lighter and lighter. I only use this part of the kit because either the cleanser or lotion causes me to break out. This 8 fl. oz. bottle is a nice size too to last u a few months.</li>
            <li> I am a huge proactiv fan. This is a great product. This step runs out quicker then the others which last forever. When i se arched it on Amazon they offer a 4 month bottle and it&#x27;s cheaper than ordering from manufacturer. I might cancel my shipments and subscribe here on Amazon</li>
            <li> Great product as well!! Have been using this for 4 years now and live by it and have turned many others on to it as well.  I love using it after shaving I get no bumps or breakouts!!</li>
            <li> My skin care regime includes nothing but Proactiv Solution due to middle-age facial acne. I got this toner at a great price, just $13 per eight ounce bottle. The reason I like this toner is that it doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin, and the seller shipped it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I order it when I run out and don&#x27;t need the rest of the 3 step system. I love getting it from amazon because it is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this line but this bottle is huge! It was a great price and it got here in like 2 days! Very quick! Thanks will do business again!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter she just loves it. Have been rebuying it over and over for her whenever I fly to the States I am not sure but dont think its available in Germany. Great price here on Amazon too.  I think it helps with my teenage daughter oily skin that is why she always requested that I get it for her.</li>
            <li> Not the bast one. but u can use it for a little while. if u pit to much , your skin start pill</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years in conjunction with the other two steps in the Proactiv system.  Love that you can get this in such a large size - easily last&#x27;s me 6+ months.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter uses this system and it appears to be working very well.</li>
            <li> Second bottle.  Works very well and clean feeling on the skin.  Using it right after the cleansing scrub works best.  Cleans up all the scrub residue and leaves your face feeling ready for bed, out the door with a radiant natural look, or prepared for makeup.  It actually feels like it moisturizes your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended as a great toner.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: it works as advertised. Great product.</li>
            <li> Good product to complete the original set</li>
            <li> I love the way it refreshes my face and gets the extra oils out that regular washing can not provide.</li>
            <li> I used to order 4fl of toner, but it runs out fast and this 8fl toner bottle will last long and bit of bargain than 4fl.will order this toner 8fl again for my 15yr old daughter!</li>
            <li> OK so i use this product with my Clearisol oil free scrubbing beads cleanser. Ive found it works better than the proactiv cleanser and is WAY CHEAPER. you should try it!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This works great for my teen and I.  We have oily to combo skin.  The dirt that is left after a face wash is astounding but that dirt is no match for this toner.  We love it and the price here rivals purchasing it from the official site or at one of the kiosks.</li>
            <li> This bottle has lasted forever now.  It&#x27;s refreshing on my skin.  Cool and gentle toner. no stinging.  Thanks for checking out the review</li>
            <li> I love proactiv toner! I&#x27;ve used this for probably 15 years and still haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well as this. I have oily skin, and prone to the occasional zits. This product helps keep my face clean and clear!</li>
            <li> I swear by Proactiv cleanser and toner.  They prevent my 43 year old female skin from looking like that of a 12 year old boy.  I don&#x27;t do the subscription from the company&#x27;s website because 1)I don&#x27;t use all the products that they make you buy and 2)they send the products too frequently.  I found a kiosk in my nearby mall but the ONLY reason I go to that blasted place is to buy this stuff.  I looked on Amazon a while ago but the Proactiv products looked sketchy and one review actually said the writing on the label was in &amp;#34;Chinese&amp;#34;.  I looked again recently and found these items.  The reviews were good so I went for it and ordered them.  I truly believe they are exactly the same products.  I compared them to what I bought from the kiosk and there is no difference in packaging (same tamper-evident seal) or labeling.  I hope this seller continues to be able to provide the authentic Proactiv products.  Amazon is soooo much better than schlepping to a mall when you know exactly what you need!</li>
            <li> I wash my face at night then moisturize but in the morning, it&#x27;s a huge hassle for me to wash my face so I use this with a cotton pad, because the cotton balls waste more product to soak the ball. It is a great product and is one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t burn when I use it on my super sensitive skin! This size is a steal for the price! The 6oz bottle at the kiosk in the mall is around $45 which is astonishing so this was a no brainer to buy especially since you still get more for less money! Recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My son loves this skin care line. It really works and it is easy to use. He finds it to be very effective.</li>
            <li> I got the 8oz bottle for the price it normally cost me to buy the 4oz bottle direct. This is the only product I use as an after shave that does does sting or irritate my skin. The 8oz will last me at least 6 moths. Fabulous.</li>
            <li> As i&#x27;m  wiping away all the dirt and oil-you can actually see all the brown dirt just wipe off onto the clothe,so GOOD JOB TO THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, after learning that it contained witch hazel, glycolic acid, and no drying alcohol.  Unfortunately, after application, I noticed my face start to itch.  I applied a gentle Cerave moisturizer, like always.  Unfortunately, the itching turned into burning, and my skin turned bright red.  Too bad I bought the 8 oz. size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend either[[ASIN:B003TOU7UW Clean &amp; Clear Essentials Deep Cleaning Toner Sensitive Skin, 8-Ounce (Pack of 2)]] or [[ASIN:B00016XJ4M Thayer Witch Hazel AF Toner w/Aloe Vera Vitamin E, Rose Pental 12 oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least try the small size first to see if your skin can tolerate it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for many years and it has put a stop to my acne. Before Proactiv, I would simply choose any product that was on sale and none of them worked. But after taking the plunge to try the cleanser, toner and lotion, I saw results inside of 3-4 weeks and have never looked back. That was 6 years ago and I will always stick with Proactiv:) I get several compliments on my skin and I don&#x27;t even wear foundation or concealer because there&#x27;s no need to thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I love it. Cleans my face and give you a glow. Everyone should have one. Go for it now, yeahhh.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. Some parts are oily and some parts are dry. In my regimen I need to address breakout control AND anti-aging. You may only think of this Proactiv product for acne but it is also for anti-aging (even though it is not marketed that way).  The main active ingredient is glycolic acid, an AHA (Alpha hydroxy acid), which exfoliates the top layer of your skin and helps unclog your pores. Glycolic acid goes under the upper layers of skin and destroys the &#x60;glue&#x27; which holds dead skin to the surface. The result is a smoother skin surface, smaller pores and less breakouts. As I am sure many readers are aware, glycolic acid is a main ingredient in many anti-aging products from L&#x27;Oreal to Peter Thomas Roth. This active ingredient isn&#x27;t only for acne, its a very important active ingredient to have in your anti-aging regimen as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my personal opinion, one of the reasons the Proactiv line is so successful is that it uses proven ingredients like glycolic acid and benzoyl peroxide in a lower concentration than many other products. Glycolic acid can be found in strengths of 3%-15% normally. The Proactiv toner is a 5% solution. It also contains witch hazel and aloe vera. It is also alcohol free. I also find it reasonably mild.  If you do not use any glycolic products I think incorporating this into your regimen even just once a day will make a difference. I also love the Somme Institute transport pads. I used to use those daily and I loved them. However, they are too strong given my recent addition of Retin-A into my regimen.  They are also significantly more expensive. The Mario Badescu glycolic toner is also good but I find this one to be more effective.  I usually use it in the morning after washing.  I use my Mario Badescu cucumber cleansing lotion as my night toner/astringent. I do not want to mix my Retin-A with glycolic acid so I use a different morning and nighttime toner/astringent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this review is of Proactiv&#x27;s toner, I would also note that I think their repairing treatment is good for a similar reason: it only has 2.5% of benzoyl peroxide. Brands like Clean&amp;Clear and Stridex and even Neutrogena put much higher levels of Benzoly Peroxide in their products and often concentrations of 5% and 10% are too drying and irritating. More is not always better. A lower level concentration more regularly is a better and more effective solution with some active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.

            <li> I have used Proactive products for years, but don&#x27;t use them at the same rate that makes sense having to buy them as a set as the Proactive requires. This solution is good for oily skin, to keep it clean throughout the day without drying it out. It is mild, but effective; does not dry skin out, but does remove oil. More effective than other products I&#x27;ve tried including witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I have oily skin, and this is a must use product for me during the hot, humid summer months, and any time other than winter when my skin gets dry.  I use the entire Proactive regime, but whereas I might substitute another cleanser in a pinch, I have not found a toner equal to Proactiv.  It is worth a try if you&#x27;ve never used it before.  It leaves your skin feeling tingly (in a good way) and fresh, and makeup can be applied easily afterwards.  It also helps prevent acne flare ups as it dries the oil out of your skin.</li>
            <li> appearance seems like good and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item that I was looking for and needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it almost expired.,..</li>
            <li> great service and fast. great pricing. Would recommend for any1 to order from seller. Can&#x27;t find a better price for this product.</li>
            <li> Best acne-fighting toner money can buy. Easy on your skin, cleans pores out well, does not dry your skin (as long as you use a moisturizer afterward). I used to use the whole Proactiv kit, but now all I use is this toner</li>
            <li> Good haven&#x27;t used it as yet but proactive products have been working great for me</li>
            <li> I have completely skipped the cleanser and the micro crystal bottles. I use the toner everyday with my regular face wash and it has kept my acne at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Hands down anything by proactiv is the best. To me atleast. I can actually feel the magic in this toner working in my pores everyday. Because of this toner and a couple mary kay products, my skin has really cleared up and improving daily.</li>
            <li> i know some people find proactiv too drying for their skin but it is the only thing that works for me.  keeps my adult acne is check.  cheaper to buy through amazon than thru company, don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve ever bought a &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34; that way.  b/c i buy these products separately, i once tried to skip this step b/c i wasn&#x27;t sure &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; was essential but my pimples returned in just a few days!  now i use all 3 steps religiously &amp; my skin is great!</li>
            <li> Very effective for small acne flare ups. I use with other Proactive products that are also effective. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and a good price on a product that I have used for years&lt;br /&gt;glad to be able to purchase it without having to by a whole bunch of other products at the same time</li>
            <li> I love Proactiv toner! I dont use the rest of their products because they are too harsh for my skin but using this alone, controls my occasional breakouts!</li>
            <li> I used to have mild acne, especially in my early teens. I started using Proactiv when I was 15 years old and it has worked for me ever since. It&#x27;s so much better than constantly buying different products and hoping they&#x27;ll work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner is especially great! It is the &#x27;second step,&#x27; which means I apply it after washing my face with the Proactiv cleanser. The toner refreshes my skin and I feel like it takes off any excess dirt or oil. I prefer the big size (8 oz) because I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out. Unlike other toners, Proactiv does not irritate my skin it all (my skin tends to get irritated by alcohol-based toners) nor does it give me that uncomfortable &#x27;tight&#x27; feeling on my face; instead, it makes me feel clean and refreshed! I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Proactive really works: you&#x27;ve heard it multiple times, and I know it&#x27;s true. I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple or black head for months since I started using proactive products. This toner is very soft and non-irritating. The price is very affordable and the size is decent.</li>
            <li> did not know amazon had this too! better than buying a whole kit when you only need one part.love the xlarge size.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and product was as stated</li>
            <li> Just as described and expected</li>
            <li> Thanks and great job!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  It makes your skin soft, and beautiful and clear, I highly recommend.  It is gentle and works quickly.</li>
            <li> After having my son in my late 30s my hormones went nuts and there was NOTHING  that I could use on my face that would combat the acne I was facing.  I had beautiful skin as a teenager and didnt have acne... now in my late 30s almost 40 I was having awful large and painful breakouts?????  This continued for years until I found Proactiv... I have tried everything.... nothing worked!!!!  The only thing that I find with this is that you do have to use the TEA TREE MOISTURIZER as aging skin has less moisture and you can get very very dry using proactiv without a moisturizer.  However if you use another brands moisturizer it may make you break out again, so I stick with the PROACTIV PRODUCTS INCLUDING THE MOISTURIZER.... I used neutragena moisturizer, supposedly hypoallergenic etc and they all broke me out except the Proactiv!&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY I CAN BE ACNE FREE IN MY FIFTIES... ITS ABOUT TIME!</li>
            <li> Nothing left to say . . . I&#x27;m coming close to my 15th year of using the products.  i wouldn&#x27;t have anything else cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> Use the product for few years now...it doesn&#x27;t over dry and keeps my skin tone fairly even and fresh...will keep using</li>
            <li> replacement of supply-good product-great for combination skin type works well with the other products for daily  uses -love it-recommend it!</li>
