            <li>Loved this bath bomb.</li>

            <li>This is a feminine, feel good, smell good, pamper yourself, playful product if there ever was one.</li>
            <li>I realized how good it felt to bathe again - to make time to relax.</li>
            <li>so* good.</li>
            <li>I got an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; for effort so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>Dipper&#x27;s aim was true this time and it was SEX BOMB fireworks over the range!!!</li>

            <li>I LOVE the smell of this bath bomb!</li>
            <li>I will deffinately be ordering LOTS more!</li>
            <li>Absolutely lovely!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;sex bomb\\&quot; makes your bathroom, water and you feel ultra sexy!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop buying them, great product, and a nice unique scent!</li>
            <li>I might enjoy and what others had experienced with their products.  </li>
            <li>It has a rose that floats around..</li>
            <li>That being said, if you love the smell (as I do) then you should be delighted.</li>
            <li>It definately leaves a nice scent on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a musky smell.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product but didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>just like a woman coming into her own.  </li>
            <li>Nice and relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as s stocking stuffer for my roomate and while she loved it, the smell was overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li>If you have asthma, you might want to skip this kind of scent.</li>
            <li>I really liked the color the water turned.</li>
            <li>it smells kind of like a floral fragrance.</li>
            <li>I received one of these awesome hand-made LUSH bath bombs for Christmas and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>Clean your tub!!</li>
            <li>Not oily or greasy, just light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>This was the first bath bomb I ever bought, and I loved using it!</li>
            <li>I guess I am more of a flowery kind of girl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a huge bath bomb with the perfect combination of jasmine and ylang ylang, the scent is not too soft or too strong!!  </li>
            <li>The bathroom smelled for close to a week, it was terribly strong!  </li>
            <li>As a heads up - If you do not like strong flowery jasmine then do not purchase this product!    </li>
            <li>What I love best about LUSH&#x27;s bath bombs (and the bubble bars) is the fact that you don&#x27;t need to rinse off after using them.  </li>
            <li>This bath bomb is fabulous -- it smells great (but not overpowering), and it makes your skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU WANT BETTER SALES.</li>
            <li>Bath bombs are mostly scent-infused baking soda.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have some grit in the bottom of your tub afterward, but the trade-off is a longer-lasting, better product.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I did-</li>
            <li>which was not at all sexy.  </li>
            <li>The smell is one of my favorite things about bath bombs and bubble bath but these lacked that.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite, not even in the top 20.</li>
            <li>It even made the whole house smell great.</li>
            <li>And beleive me...theres so many.</li>
            <li>Well, okay, it is.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sticking to it.in many cases</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin silky smooth with a HEAVENLY scent that lasts &amp; lasts &amp; lasts!</li>
            <li>and it was still fairly potent.  </li>
            <li>With a touch jasmine and ylang ylang to make you feel sexy, and the clary sage makes it exceedingly relaxing.</li>
            <li>Dipper sure knows how to use his rod</li>
            <li>Better to stick with the Bubble Bars.</li>
            <li>; I went to order more and they were out of stock.</li>
            <li>do you get more then one for this price???</li>
            <li>an thought the name was cute.</li>
            <li>Love the bath bomb.  </li>
            <li>Makes my mood better, clears my mind, softens the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this before when I was actually in stores years ago and was so happy to see it again!</li>
            <li>The bath bomb was phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Yes it does a great job of leaving your skin soft &amp; silky</li>
            <li>LUSH has to be one of my favorite stores!!  </li>
            <li>The soaps, shampoo bar, bubble bars and the other bath bombs I bought smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>company!)so took the easy way out and used it to scent my bed linens.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put it in the tub it started to melt very quickly.</li>
            <li>It might be too strong for some people</li>
            <li>The smell was SOOOO strong</li>
            <li>The Sex Bomb seems to be the top rated bomb from Lush, and for good reason.  </li>
            <li>It was more of a sweet, yummy smell.  </li>
            <li>think the dictionary should have a picture of this Bath Ball under the definition of beautiful, beacuse this simply it.</li>
            <li>I thought this particular bath bomb was very lovely.  </li>
            <li>Anything that has \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; on the label is nothing more than a synthetic chemical \\&quot;smell\\&quot; and nothing like the real deal!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that gives lots of bubbles, more pampering for your skin and amazing scents, go for the bubble bars and bath melts by Lush.</li>
            <li>A 7 dollar bath is a decadent thing in this day and age, but i&#x27;ll gladly give up a couple mornings&#x27; worth of coffee runs in order to enjoy a bath like this one once or twice a month.  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s good if you do that trick of putting the fizzing bomb underneath sore muscles to get some light massaging action from the bubbles.)</li>
            <li>now if it had been a scent I liked the strength might not of bothered Me as much.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic, glorious, decadent.  </li>
            <li>the sex bath bomb is not to be missed, as it is sexy, silky, luxurious, with a lovely scent that lasts on your skin and lingers in the bathroom for a whole day.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good, and leaves my skin really soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>But this was such a lovely gesture from a good friend, and so I made an exception.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll feel better right away.</li>
            <li>Once in a while you will get a dud - This comes from the fact that they are made from REAL INGREDIENTS!!!</li>
            <li>After the stress of kids and family, there is nothing I enjoy more than a hot bath and a book.  </li>
            <li>but it is still very lovely and seems to be a pretty hot item</li>
            <li>DELICIOUSLY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I gained great points for the thought - my wife was clearly not relaxed after having to scrub (not rinse but SCRUB)</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite bath bombs from lush and one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>The water should feel silky soft and the entire room will smell wonderful and steamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the bright pink color and the musky scent.  </li>
            <li>felt like a \\&quot;Hilton\\&quot; in the beautiful scented pink water!   </li>
            <li>The scent was amazing without being overpowering and it made my skin feel so silky and soft.</li>
            <li>The only good aspect was the color that the water changed.</li>
            <li>It filled my bathroom with a noxious cheap perfume scent that friends commented on for DAYS, made my tub greasy and bright pink, and it irritated the hell out of my girlparts.</li>
            <li>A definate for a full hedonistic experience.</li>
            <li>they leave your skin feeling much softer than the bombs and tend to smell better too.</li>
            <li>LUSH products are expensive but they do a wonderful job of making your skin feel great.</li>
            <li>The bubble bombs and bath play-doe come highly endorsed by me! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>So much for relaxing, sexy bath time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a great bath bomb</li>
            <li>Then the strong scent of a cheap perfume permeated the bathroom, and I was less happy because it was really pungent.</li>
            <li>If they lasted longer and left my skin feeling more moisturized instead of dessicated, I&#x27;d be more forgiving of it.</li>
            <li>My skin also felt quite nice getting out of the bath (probably because citric acid is a major ingredient in the bomb -- it helps soften skin when put in a bath.)   </li>
            <li>My first reaction was WOW, the shop smelled FANTASTIC!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Lush products but this particular Bath Bomb had an overpowering scent that didn&#x27;t seem sexy.</li>
            <li>i whacked it into about five good size chunks-the ballistic is pretty big-</li>
            <li>It permeated the entire house and I have a pretty good sized place.</li>
            <li>My favorite of all LUSH&#x27;s Bath Bombs!  </li>
            <li>original price is much cheaper!</li>
            <li>It turns the bath a pretty hot pink color and it makes my room and me smell great.</li>
            <li>it does leave your skin kind of smooth but not baby soft skin which I was definitely surprised.</li>
            <li>While the scents range from &#x27;ok&#x27; to &#x27;really good&#x27;, the bombs fizz out in under 5 minutes and leave massive amounts of *navy blue* grit in the bottom of the tub (no matter the type of bomb).</li>
            <li>the idea of which is neat but the rose felt totally disguisting and smooched all up when I touched it.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all, like most of LUSH&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I dropped this bath bomb in the tub on my birthday, and it made me laugh.</li>
            <li>Rock Star soap was fun for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I have tried many Lush bath bombs, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>once you experience the eroticism of bathing in the alluring scent of jasmine and ylang ylang, lying back in the tub with a towel cushioning your head and neck, and the warm, fragrant steam wafting by your face, you will not want to sleep.</li>
            <li>I can&#x60;t say it   you should try it     it worth</li>
            <li>I like Lush products, but the dye in this one was way too potent.</li>
            <li>( Oh well it was worth a try).</li>
            <li>If you call Lush support or go into the store they are pretty good about replacing a dud or giving you many free samples to try other products!</li>
            <li>One of LUSH&#x27;s primary attractions is the fact that their products are unique in texture, scent and color and are fun to use.  </li>
            <li>Hello!&lt;br /&gt;I have been into Lush products for as long as i can remember, so i know great quality but with this price is absolutely off the charts!!</li>
            <li>The color was gorgeous ( and did NOT leave a ring around my tub as I&#x27;ve read other bombs</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this LUSH product very much.  </li>
            <li>The name&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>As I said, the name&#x27;s right - for a reason.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d suggest this to anyone who has dark-colored bed linens(the water colors pretty intensely and light sheets might stain), whether you sleep alone or share your bed.</li>
            <li>I liked this BOMB alot more than my previous LUSH bubble bar (milk?) and look forward to experimenting with more LUSH bombs.</li>
            <li>Lush is an amazing bath store near my house, but sometimes it&#x27;s easier to order from here.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Clary sage essential oil,  with reported aphrodisiac properties, is a primary ingredient which helps sooth and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li>Clary sage essential oil,  with reported aphrodisiac properties, is a primary ingredient which helps sooth and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite bath bomb from Lush.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I used this product before going out, because (WOW!)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for to spoil myself.</li>
            <li>Much to my amazement, the baseball bomb bounced!</li>
            <li>It did however leave a ok smell on My skin after the bath, even smelled it the next day, but cant handle the strength during the bath, will not buy again.</li>
            <li>Yes, my bath smelled good and was a pretty color, but this is a waste of  money.</li>
            <li>so the water was not as hot asI like it.</li>
            <li>I like mine hot.</li>
            <li>so much for girly-girls!</li>
            <li>This one is a real winner!  </li>
            <li>The first thing that happens when this delectable bomb meets the water is the fizzle... and then the rice paper flower blooms...</li>
            <li>and this is the first product I came upon.</li>
            <li>It smells so nice and turns your water pink.</li>
            <li>After soaking in the tub, it also makes your skin smell pretty too.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t impress me!</li>
            <li>But she agreed that the smell was overpowering at first for her as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most definitely a keeper!!!</li>
            <li>Every time I opened that cabinet the whole house would be perfumed with the smell of it!</li>
            <li>I felt I really needed it!</li>
            <li>SO PLEASE GO TO THE OFFICIAL LUSH SITE!!!!</li>
            <li>The one and only downfall to this naughty and wonderful sin is the hot pink velvety water has a tendency to stain some tubs so make sure you have some cleaner ready -</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I ordered the bath bomb(s) from Lush.  </li>
            <li>Leaves bits a rose petals and other stuff in your bath.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw that Amazon started carrying Lush products</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s because we haven&#x27;t the faintest notion about the things that really matter, such as why it would be good for it to demand special treatment that, in many cases, borders on the ridiculous.</li>
            <li>As I watched my efforts go down the drain, I noticed my squeezed out washcloth draped over the side of the tub with a memorable tinge of bright pink to remind myself not to buy the Sex Bomb again.  </li>
            <li>The pink water was kind of attractive, and it was quite fun watching the ball explode into a fizzing fountain, but the smell was similar to musty, heavy talc powder.\\</li>
            <li>pink - ok, fun.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, she did say it left her skin feeling really smooth.</li>
            <li>The sex bomb left the water a nice pink and it has some  rose petals in the middle</li>
            <li>The positive reviews I have read about this bomb thus far don&#x27;t do justice to this soft-ball sized pink sphere of magic!    </li>
            <li>This was My very first lush product.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that Lush sent me samples of some of their other products to try out, I will most definitely order this particular bath bomb again and again, and I will recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>I think one whole large one is too much for one bath.</li>
            <li>Or even garner much attention.</li>
            <li>and the scent really stays for awhile.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve used like 8 of those all ready.</li>
            <li>/&gt;VERY HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>Sex Bomb made my bath water (I don&#x27;t have a tub, but I used my boyfriends tub) a really nice pink color, and the rice paper rose slowly dissolved.  </li>
            <li>The smell was alot better than I expected</li>
            <li>I had thrown in the whole bomb into the tub and let it fizz before stepping in.  </li>
            <li>Costs too much for what you get.</li>
            <li>did i want to keep ordering so much stuff from that addicting</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t be too much.</li>
            <li>Very pricey.  </li>
            <li>This one is a real winner!&lt;br /&gt;JANAle to enhance the experience.</li>
            <li>You absorb so much through the pores of your skin when bathing.</li>
            <li>Make soaking in the bath a real treat.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft after my bath and still the next day smelled lovely.</li>
            <li>I just finished my first ever Lush Sex Bomb Bath Bomb bath, and I am SOLD!  </li>
            <li>but so do the other bombs &amp; they smell much better.</li>
            <li>oh and make sure that your man of the hour is on standby, you won&#x27;t want to be lonely after this!  </li>
            <li>, who hustled on over to the nearest Lush store and picked up a potent Hot Pink SEX BOMB Bath Bomb for me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK!</li>
            <li>I first tried LUSH when I lived in England.  </li>
            <li>This was my first lush product ever</li>
            <li>I will probably get this again but not for awhile until I try all of the lush products that I am interested in.</li>
            <li>I love how consistent they are, every single one of the Sex Bombs I bought smells the same.</li>
            <li>Then, especially in NYC, there&#x27;s the morning, afternoon and evening rush, a quick dinner, maybe another shower, hit the sack, and then it begins all over again.</li>
            <li>I love Lush things, but in general they tend to smell similar, well, this bath bomb, make the water a hot pink, and it smells like sweet, flowery musk.</li>
            <li>a little- grab one of these luxurious bath bombs, a bottle of wine, and your favorite tunes and</li>
            <li>That made me feel a little sexy.</li>
            <li>And the lack of light did help to hide the fact that my bath water was pink - but a much softer, more subtle color than the outside of the bomb, fortunately.</li>
            <li>And the lack of light did help to hide the fact that my bath water was pink - but a much softer, more subtle color than the outside of the bomb, fortunately.</li>
            <li>But I should point out that Lush believes that we have too much freedom.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to take a $5.00 bath, I would much rather use one of Lush&#x27;s bath melts...</li>
            <li>Go directly to LUSH to purchase for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>but the slow opening rose</li>
            <li>PULL was called out several times before the Purple Dove flew right.</li>
            <li>If it seems large enough to break in half and get more for your money by all means</li>
            <li>The pink water was a fun touch for me, and the silk like feel of the water was very inviting.  </li>
            <li>As for the pink ring around the tub, be smart and just wipe down the sides of your tub after your bath with a try wash cloth while the tub is still wet... so easy and saves you a head ache later (I&#x27;m sure!).</li>
            <li>The scent nearly put me to sleep in the tub!</li>
            <li>and I am so excited to try the other ones that I bought.</li>
            <li>Oh on a funny note, I didn&#x27;t realize the middle was rice paper and had let it fizz along with the rest of the bomb.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why it&#x27;s named the way it is, it wasn&#x27;t particularly sexy to me</li>
            <li>stuff lingers on the skin a little strong, though...</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor...get some real, high quality essential oils.</li>
            <li>You will feel invigorated and want company to share your newly softened, lush smelling skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer to believe things that my experience tells me are true, such as that Lush&#x27;s premise (that the only way to expand one&#x27;s mind is with drugs -- or maybe even bathing balm) is its morality disguised as pretended neutrality.</li>
            <li>This is not fun to clean at the end of a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li>These are oils proven to have very high vibrational frequency to them...and you can definitely feel the difference!!</li>
            <li>LUSH BATH BOMBS ARE LIKE 6.95...</li>
            <li>I have tried 4 bath bombs from Lush.</li>
            <li>SexBomb is one of two emotibombs I purchased a couple of weeks ago, after doing plenty of research on the LUSH website about which smells</li>
            <li>recommend Titsy Totsy instead, also from Lush.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B0002260DW Sex Bomb Bath Bomb by LUSH]]    </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s far away from me</li>
            <li>If you have yet to try LUSH</li>
            <li>Lush uses this disguised morality to support its snow jobs, thereby making its argument self-refuting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; Lush likes to posture as a guardian of virtue and manners.</li>

            <li>The description doesnt really explain how big this item is</li>
            <li>It made the water so silky and soft as well.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;ve tried a LUSH bath bomb before.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy anymore lush products.  </li>
            <li>It makes your legs feel soft and silky as well.</li>
            <li>Does lush add clay to their bombs?</li>
            <li>Ylang Ylang oil from Young Living, for example.</li>
            <li>I came upon a Lush store while I was living in the UK</li>
            <li>These cost 6 bucks at Lush.  </li>
            <li>We have yet to try something from Lush that we didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>or you can also purchase this bath bomb from Lush Cosmetics website.</li>
            <li>In fact, to understand just how scary Lush is, you first need to realize that if we are to seek some structure in which the cacophony introduced by its ethics might be systematized, reconciled, and made rational, then we must be guided by a healthy and progressive ideology, not by the demonic and supercilious ideologies that Lush promotes.</li>

            <li>She wanted feedback, no less.</li>
            <li>Major points there!</li>
            <li>It turned my bath water a hot pink color and smelled yummy.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it turns the bathwater this really surreal shade of pink, if visuals are your thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it smells like roses and jasmine and make the water turn a pretty pink.</li>
            <li>have to admit, I had not been pampering myself enough recently, and rarely had time for a leisurely bath last summer.</li>
            <li>It almost kind of made me feel a little naughty just because it&#x27;s such a \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; sort of smell.  </li>
            <li>However, when it comes right down to it, what it is pushing is both feral and obstreperous.</li>
            <li>However, when it comes right down to it, what it is pushing is both feral and obstreperous.</li>
            <li>I starting buying all kinds of LUSH Products from then!  </li>
            <li>It didnt leave any pink on the tub possibly because I cleaned my tub right before.</li>
            <li>It fizzes as it dissolves into the hot bath water and turns from pink and purple swirls into a solid, hot pink.</li>
            <li>If u go to the official Lush site its only $6.65!!</li>
            <li>This bath bomb is only $6.95 in the Lush store</li>
            <li>I had gone to Vancouver Island several years ago and discovered Lush cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Earlier today I picked up this bath bomb from lush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely cheaper to buy this product directly from Lush.it retails for about $6.95 in Florida.</li>
            <li>If not you can always use a white bath bomb from Lush.</li>
            <li>At first I was intimated by the reports of irremovable pink stains in the tub, but that is totally not the case.</li>
            <li>Kind of a silly product but anything to spice things up is always welcomed by the wife.</li>
            <li>did a fine job of it; after putting half of it in the bathwater and watching it turn an enticing blush color as the bomb piece fizzed its way around the tub I decided to say \\&quot;why not?\\&quot; and threw in the other piece too.  </li>
            <li>Lush&#x27;s more than scary.</li>
            <li>Lush&#x27;s more than scary.</li>
            <li>Definitely not a REAL Lush product... Smells ok and very overpriced for a fake item.</li>
            <li>Lush wants us to emulate the White Queen from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Through the Looking Glass, who strives to believe \\&quot;as many as six impossible things before breakfast\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t want to hear a long, drawn-out explanation about how Lush is the type of organization that turns up its nose at people like you and me.</li>
            <li>I have used several of them and every time I keep hoping that it&#x27;ll just be an amazing experience but really, after the fizz dies down, you&#x27;re left with colored water and some random stuff floating around.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a little overpowering in the tub, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my skin very well.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I will deffinately be ordering LOTS more!</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovely!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;sex bomb\\&quot; makes your bathroom, water and you feel ultra sexy!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop buying them, great product, and a nice unique scent!</li>
            <li> I might enjoy and what others had experienced with their products.  </li>
            <li> It has a rose that floats around..</li>
            <li> That being said, if you love the smell (as I do) then you should be delighted.</li>
            <li> It definately leaves a nice scent on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a musky smell.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product but didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> just like a woman coming into her own.  </li>
            <li> Nice and relaxing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as s stocking stuffer for my roomate and while she loved it, the smell was overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li> If you have asthma, you might want to skip this kind of scent.</li>
            <li> I really liked the color the water turned.</li>
            <li> it smells kind of like a floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> I received one of these awesome hand-made LUSH bath bombs for Christmas and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Clean your tub!!</li>
            <li> Not oily or greasy, just light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This was the first bath bomb I ever bought, and I loved using it!</li>
            <li> I guess I am more of a flowery kind of girl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a huge bath bomb with the perfect combination of jasmine and ylang ylang, the scent is not too soft or too strong!!  </li>
            <li> The bathroom smelled for close to a week, it was terribly strong!  </li>
            <li> As a heads up - If you do not like strong flowery jasmine then do not purchase this product!    </li>
            <li> What I love best about LUSH&#x27;s bath bombs (and the bubble bars) is the fact that you don&#x27;t need to rinse off after using them.  </li>
            <li> This bath bomb is fabulous -- it smells great (but not overpowering), and it makes your skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT BETTER SALES.</li>
            <li> Bath bombs are mostly scent-infused baking soda.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have some grit in the bottom of your tub afterward, but the trade-off is a longer-lasting, better product.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I did-</li>
            <li> which was not at all sexy.  </li>
            <li> The smell is one of my favorite things about bath bombs and bubble bath but these lacked that.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite, not even in the top 20.</li>
            <li> It even made the whole house smell great.</li>
            <li> And beleive me...theres so many.</li>
            <li> Well, okay, it is.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sticking to it.in many cases</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin silky smooth with a HEAVENLY scent that lasts &amp; lasts &amp; lasts!</li>
            <li> and it was still fairly potent.  </li>
            <li> With a touch jasmine and ylang ylang to make you feel sexy, and the clary sage makes it exceedingly relaxing.</li>
            <li> Dipper sure knows how to use his rod</li>
            <li> Better to stick with the Bubble Bars.</li>
            <li> ; I went to order more and they were out of stock.</li>
            <li> do you get more then one for this price???</li>
            <li> an thought the name was cute.</li>
            <li> Love the bath bomb.  </li>
            <li> Makes my mood better, clears my mind, softens the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this before when I was actually in stores years ago and was so happy to see it again!</li>
            <li> The bath bomb was phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Yes it does a great job of leaving your skin soft &amp; silky</li>
            <li> LUSH has to be one of my favorite stores!!  </li>
            <li> The soaps, shampoo bar, bubble bars and the other bath bombs I bought smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> company!)so took the easy way out and used it to scent my bed linens.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it in the tub it started to melt very quickly.</li>
            <li> It might be too strong for some people</li>
            <li> The smell was SOOOO strong</li>
            <li> The Sex Bomb seems to be the top rated bomb from Lush, and for good reason.  </li>
            <li> It was more of a sweet, yummy smell.  </li>
            <li> think the dictionary should have a picture of this Bath Ball under the definition of beautiful, beacuse this simply it.</li>
            <li> I thought this particular bath bomb was very lovely.  </li>
            <li> Anything that has \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; on the label is nothing more than a synthetic chemical \\&quot;smell\\&quot; and nothing like the real deal!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that gives lots of bubbles, more pampering for your skin and amazing scents, go for the bubble bars and bath melts by Lush.</li>
            <li> A 7 dollar bath is a decadent thing in this day and age, but i&#x27;ll gladly give up a couple mornings&#x27; worth of coffee runs in order to enjoy a bath like this one once or twice a month.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s good if you do that trick of putting the fizzing bomb underneath sore muscles to get some light massaging action from the bubbles.)</li>
            <li> now if it had been a scent I liked the strength might not of bothered Me as much.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic, glorious, decadent.  </li>
            <li> the sex bath bomb is not to be missed, as it is sexy, silky, luxurious, with a lovely scent that lasts on your skin and lingers in the bathroom for a whole day.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good, and leaves my skin really soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> But this was such a lovely gesture from a good friend, and so I made an exception.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel better right away.</li>
            <li> Once in a while you will get a dud - This comes from the fact that they are made from REAL INGREDIENTS!!!</li>
            <li> After the stress of kids and family, there is nothing I enjoy more than a hot bath and a book.  </li>
            <li> but it is still very lovely and seems to be a pretty hot item</li>
            <li> DELICIOUSLY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I gained great points for the thought - my wife was clearly not relaxed after having to scrub (not rinse but SCRUB)</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite bath bombs from lush and one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> The water should feel silky soft and the entire room will smell wonderful and steamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the bright pink color and the musky scent.  </li>
            <li> felt like a \\&quot;Hilton\\&quot; in the beautiful scented pink water!   </li>
            <li> The scent was amazing without being overpowering and it made my skin feel so silky and soft.</li>
            <li> The only good aspect was the color that the water changed.</li>
            <li> It filled my bathroom with a noxious cheap perfume scent that friends commented on for DAYS, made my tub greasy and bright pink, and it irritated the hell out of my girlparts.</li>
            <li> A definate for a full hedonistic experience.</li>
            <li> they leave your skin feeling much softer than the bombs and tend to smell better too.</li>
            <li> LUSH products are expensive but they do a wonderful job of making your skin feel great.</li>
            <li> The bubble bombs and bath play-doe come highly endorsed by me! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> So much for relaxing, sexy bath time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a great bath bomb</li>
            <li> Then the strong scent of a cheap perfume permeated the bathroom, and I was less happy because it was really pungent.</li>
            <li> If they lasted longer and left my skin feeling more moisturized instead of dessicated, I&#x27;d be more forgiving of it.</li>
            <li> My skin also felt quite nice getting out of the bath (probably because citric acid is a major ingredient in the bomb -- it helps soften skin when put in a bath.)   </li>
            <li> My first reaction was WOW, the shop smelled FANTASTIC!!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Lush products but this particular Bath Bomb had an overpowering scent that didn&#x27;t seem sexy.</li>
            <li> i whacked it into about five good size chunks-the ballistic is pretty big-</li>
            <li> It permeated the entire house and I have a pretty good sized place.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all LUSH&#x27;s Bath Bombs!  </li>
            <li> original price is much cheaper!</li>
            <li> It turns the bath a pretty hot pink color and it makes my room and me smell great.</li>
            <li> it does leave your skin kind of smooth but not baby soft skin which I was definitely surprised.</li>
            <li> While the scents range from &#x27;ok&#x27; to &#x27;really good&#x27;, the bombs fizz out in under 5 minutes and leave massive amounts of *navy blue* grit in the bottom of the tub (no matter the type of bomb).</li>
            <li> the idea of which is neat but the rose felt totally disguisting and smooched all up when I touched it.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all, like most of LUSH&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I dropped this bath bomb in the tub on my birthday, and it made me laugh.</li>
            <li> Rock Star soap was fun for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have tried many Lush bath bombs, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> once you experience the eroticism of bathing in the alluring scent of jasmine and ylang ylang, lying back in the tub with a towel cushioning your head and neck, and the warm, fragrant steam wafting by your face, you will not want to sleep.</li>
            <li> I can&#x60;t say it   you should try it     it worth</li>
            <li> I like Lush products, but the dye in this one was way too potent.</li>
            <li> ( Oh well it was worth a try).</li>
            <li> If you call Lush support or go into the store they are pretty good about replacing a dud or giving you many free samples to try other products!</li>
            <li> One of LUSH&#x27;s primary attractions is the fact that their products are unique in texture, scent and color and are fun to use.  </li>
            <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;I have been into Lush products for as long as i can remember, so i know great quality but with this price is absolutely off the charts!!</li>
            <li> The color was gorgeous ( and did NOT leave a ring around my tub as I&#x27;ve read other bombs</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this LUSH product very much.  </li>
            <li> The name&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> As I said, the name&#x27;s right - for a reason.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d suggest this to anyone who has dark-colored bed linens(the water colors pretty intensely and light sheets might stain), whether you sleep alone or share your bed.</li>
            <li> I liked this BOMB alot more than my previous LUSH bubble bar (milk?) and look forward to experimenting with more LUSH bombs.</li>
            <li> Lush is an amazing bath store near my house, but sometimes it&#x27;s easier to order from here.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> Clary sage essential oil,  with reported aphrodisiac properties, is a primary ingredient which helps sooth and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li> Clary sage essential oil,  with reported aphrodisiac properties, is a primary ingredient which helps sooth and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite bath bomb from Lush.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I used this product before going out, because (WOW!)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for to spoil myself.</li>
            <li> Much to my amazement, the baseball bomb bounced!</li>
            <li> It did however leave a ok smell on My skin after the bath, even smelled it the next day, but cant handle the strength during the bath, will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Yes, my bath smelled good and was a pretty color, but this is a waste of  money.</li>
            <li> so the water was not as hot asI like it.</li>
            <li> I like mine hot.</li>
            <li> so much for girly-girls!</li>
            <li> This one is a real winner!  </li>
            <li> The first thing that happens when this delectable bomb meets the water is the fizzle... and then the rice paper flower blooms...</li>
            <li> and this is the first product I came upon.</li>
            <li> It smells so nice and turns your water pink.</li>
            <li> After soaking in the tub, it also makes your skin smell pretty too.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t impress me!</li>
            <li> But she agreed that the smell was overpowering at first for her as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most definitely a keeper!!!</li>
            <li> Every time I opened that cabinet the whole house would be perfumed with the smell of it!</li>
            <li> I felt I really needed it!</li>
            <li> SO PLEASE GO TO THE OFFICIAL LUSH SITE!!!!</li>
            <li> The one and only downfall to this naughty and wonderful sin is the hot pink velvety water has a tendency to stain some tubs so make sure you have some cleaner ready -</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered the bath bomb(s) from Lush.  </li>
            <li> Leaves bits a rose petals and other stuff in your bath.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw that Amazon started carrying Lush products</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s because we haven&#x27;t the faintest notion about the things that really matter, such as why it would be good for it to demand special treatment that, in many cases, borders on the ridiculous.</li>
            <li> As I watched my efforts go down the drain, I noticed my squeezed out washcloth draped over the side of the tub with a memorable tinge of bright pink to remind myself not to buy the Sex Bomb again.  </li>
            <li> The pink water was kind of attractive, and it was quite fun watching the ball explode into a fizzing fountain, but the smell was similar to musty, heavy talc powder.\\</li>
            <li> pink - ok, fun.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, she did say it left her skin feeling really smooth.</li>
            <li> The sex bomb left the water a nice pink and it has some  rose petals in the middle</li>
            <li> The positive reviews I have read about this bomb thus far don&#x27;t do justice to this soft-ball sized pink sphere of magic!    </li>
            <li> This was My very first lush product.  </li>
            <li> I also liked that Lush sent me samples of some of their other products to try out, I will most definitely order this particular bath bomb again and again, and I will recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I think one whole large one is too much for one bath.</li>
            <li> Or even garner much attention.</li>
            <li> and the scent really stays for awhile.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve used like 8 of those all ready.</li>
            <li> /&gt;VERY HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> Sex Bomb made my bath water (I don&#x27;t have a tub, but I used my boyfriends tub) a really nice pink color, and the rice paper rose slowly dissolved.  </li>
            <li> The smell was alot better than I expected</li>
            <li> I had thrown in the whole bomb into the tub and let it fizz before stepping in.  </li>
            <li> Costs too much for what you get.</li>
            <li> did i want to keep ordering so much stuff from that addicting</li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t be too much.</li>
            <li> Very pricey.  </li>
            <li> This one is a real winner!&lt;br /&gt;JANAle to enhance the experience.</li>
            <li> You absorb so much through the pores of your skin when bathing.</li>
            <li> Make soaking in the bath a real treat.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft after my bath and still the next day smelled lovely.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first ever Lush Sex Bomb Bath Bomb bath, and I am SOLD!  </li>
            <li> but so do the other bombs &amp; they smell much better.</li>
            <li> oh and make sure that your man of the hour is on standby, you won&#x27;t want to be lonely after this!  </li>
            <li> , who hustled on over to the nearest Lush store and picked up a potent Hot Pink SEX BOMB Bath Bomb for me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK!</li>
            <li> I first tried LUSH when I lived in England.  </li>
            <li> This was my first lush product ever</li>
            <li> I will probably get this again but not for awhile until I try all of the lush products that I am interested in.</li>
            <li> I love how consistent they are, every single one of the Sex Bombs I bought smells the same.</li>
            <li> Then, especially in NYC, there&#x27;s the morning, afternoon and evening rush, a quick dinner, maybe another shower, hit the sack, and then it begins all over again.</li>
            <li> I love Lush things, but in general they tend to smell similar, well, this bath bomb, make the water a hot pink, and it smells like sweet, flowery musk.</li>
            <li> a little- grab one of these luxurious bath bombs, a bottle of wine, and your favorite tunes and</li>
            <li> That made me feel a little sexy.</li>
            <li> And the lack of light did help to hide the fact that my bath water was pink - but a much softer, more subtle color than the outside of the bomb, fortunately.</li>
            <li> And the lack of light did help to hide the fact that my bath water was pink - but a much softer, more subtle color than the outside of the bomb, fortunately.</li>
            <li> But I should point out that Lush believes that we have too much freedom.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to take a $5.00 bath, I would much rather use one of Lush&#x27;s bath melts...</li>
            <li> Go directly to LUSH to purchase for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> but the slow opening rose</li>
            <li> PULL was called out several times before the Purple Dove flew right.</li>
            <li> If it seems large enough to break in half and get more for your money by all means</li>
            <li> The pink water was a fun touch for me, and the silk like feel of the water was very inviting.  </li>
            <li> As for the pink ring around the tub, be smart and just wipe down the sides of your tub after your bath with a try wash cloth while the tub is still wet... so easy and saves you a head ache later (I&#x27;m sure!).</li>
            <li> The scent nearly put me to sleep in the tub!</li>
            <li> and I am so excited to try the other ones that I bought.</li>
            <li> Oh on a funny note, I didn&#x27;t realize the middle was rice paper and had let it fizz along with the rest of the bomb.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s named the way it is, it wasn&#x27;t particularly sexy to me</li>
            <li> stuff lingers on the skin a little strong, though...</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor...get some real, high quality essential oils.</li>
            <li> You will feel invigorated and want company to share your newly softened, lush smelling skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer to believe things that my experience tells me are true, such as that Lush&#x27;s premise (that the only way to expand one&#x27;s mind is with drugs -- or maybe even bathing balm) is its morality disguised as pretended neutrality.</li>
            <li> This is not fun to clean at the end of a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> These are oils proven to have very high vibrational frequency to them...and you can definitely feel the difference!!</li>
            <li> LUSH BATH BOMBS ARE LIKE 6.95...</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 bath bombs from Lush.</li>
            <li> SexBomb is one of two emotibombs I purchased a couple of weeks ago, after doing plenty of research on the LUSH website about which smells</li>
            <li> recommend Titsy Totsy instead, also from Lush.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002260DW Sex Bomb Bath Bomb by LUSH]]    </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s far away from me</li>
            <li> If you have yet to try LUSH</li>
            <li> Lush uses this disguised morality to support its snow jobs, thereby making its argument self-refuting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; Lush likes to posture as a guardian of virtue and manners.</li>
            <li> &quot; Lush likes to posture as a guardian of virtue and manners.</li>
            <li> The description doesnt really explain how big this item is</li>
            <li> It made the water so silky and soft as well.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve tried a LUSH bath bomb before.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy anymore lush products.  </li>
            <li> It makes your legs feel soft and silky as well.</li>
            <li> Does lush add clay to their bombs?</li>
            <li> Ylang Ylang oil from Young Living, for example.</li>
            <li> I came upon a Lush store while I was living in the UK</li>
            <li> These cost 6 bucks at Lush.  </li>
            <li> We have yet to try something from Lush that we didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> or you can also purchase this bath bomb from Lush Cosmetics website.</li>
            <li> In fact, to understand just how scary Lush is, you first need to realize that if we are to seek some structure in which the cacophony introduced by its ethics might be systematized, reconciled, and made rational, then we must be guided by a healthy and progressive ideology, not by the demonic and supercilious ideologies that Lush promotes.</li>

            <li> She wanted feedback, no less.</li>
            <li> Major points there!</li>
            <li> It turned my bath water a hot pink color and smelled yummy.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it turns the bathwater this really surreal shade of pink, if visuals are your thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it smells like roses and jasmine and make the water turn a pretty pink.</li>
            <li> have to admit, I had not been pampering myself enough recently, and rarely had time for a leisurely bath last summer.</li>
            <li> It almost kind of made me feel a little naughty just because it&#x27;s such a \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; sort of smell.  </li>
            <li> However, when it comes right down to it, what it is pushing is both feral and obstreperous.</li>
            <li> However, when it comes right down to it, what it is pushing is both feral and obstreperous.</li>
            <li> I starting buying all kinds of LUSH Products from then!  </li>
            <li> It didnt leave any pink on the tub possibly because I cleaned my tub right before.</li>
            <li> It fizzes as it dissolves into the hot bath water and turns from pink and purple swirls into a solid, hot pink.</li>
            <li> If u go to the official Lush site its only $6.65!!</li>
            <li> This bath bomb is only $6.95 in the Lush store</li>
            <li> I had gone to Vancouver Island several years ago and discovered Lush cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Earlier today I picked up this bath bomb from lush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely cheaper to buy this product directly from Lush.it retails for about $6.95 in Florida.</li>
            <li> If not you can always use a white bath bomb from Lush.</li>
            <li> At first I was intimated by the reports of irremovable pink stains in the tub, but that is totally not the case.</li>
            <li> Kind of a silly product but anything to spice things up is always welcomed by the wife.</li>
            <li> did a fine job of it; after putting half of it in the bathwater and watching it turn an enticing blush color as the bomb piece fizzed its way around the tub I decided to say \\&quot;why not?\\&quot; and threw in the other piece too.  </li>
            <li> Lush&#x27;s more than scary.</li>
            <li> Lush&#x27;s more than scary.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a REAL Lush product... Smells ok and very overpriced for a fake item.</li>
            <li> Lush wants us to emulate the White Queen from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Through the Looking Glass, who strives to believe \\&quot;as many as six impossible things before breakfast\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t want to hear a long, drawn-out explanation about how Lush is the type of organization that turns up its nose at people like you and me.</li>
            <li> I have used several of them and every time I keep hoping that it&#x27;ll just be an amazing experience but really, after the fizz dies down, you&#x27;re left with colored water and some random stuff floating around.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little overpowering in the tub, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my skin very well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Sex Bomb Bath Bomb along with several other LUSH items.</li>
            <li> The water turned a very pretty pink color, and I thought the fizzing action lasted a lot longer than with other bath bombs I&#x27;ve used in the past, and was somewhat stronger.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried a LUSH Bath Bomb, you&#x27;ve never really lived!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as long as it believes such absurdities, it will continue to commit atrocities.</li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t last too long on my skin.</li>
            <li> the smell last very long on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have seen a few reviews saying there was no smell, little smell or a strange smell not like in the store - Lush products are made from mostly natural, often organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> These letters are typically couched in gutter language (which is doubtless the language in which Lush habitually thinks) and serve no purpose other than to convince me that we have a dilemma of leviathan proportions on our hands: Should we challenge its inconsiderate assumptions about merit, or is it sufficient to follow knowledge like a sinking star beyond the utmost bound of human thought?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a difficult question to answer, however, because the querist generally wants a simple, concise answer.</li>
            <li> Since this first product I am LUSH obsessed.</li>
            <li> The next day, as luck would have it, I was heading down to the local target range.</li>
            <li> I usually have my friends in England ship me some LUSH goodies</li>
            <li> but I have a small bathroom and a pretty small tub</li>
            <li> With a little jimmieing, the SEX BOMB was properly snuggled into the skeet trap launch.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars though because it was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> When I drained the bathtub, the pink pigment stained it</li>
            <li> I saw a shop and was curious about it and went in.  </li>
            <li> (I ordered a few different ones).  </li>
            <li> Then again, even the White Queen would have trouble believing that heathenism brings one closer to nirvana.</li>
            <li> I spent my friends money on this</li>
            <li> My Moose boodle was recently spent on 100 of these Hubba-Bubbles</li>
            <li> Sex Bomb contains jasmine, which I am not really a fan of</li>
            <li> and I still can&#x27;t get the pink stains off the bathtub, even with softscrub.  </li>
            <li> have since become addicted to Lush&#x27;s bath bombs, there are all kinds with just one purpose - to pamper you and make you feel terrific!</li>
            <li> I have since become addicted to Lush&#x27;s bath bombs, there are all kinds with just one purpose - to pamper you and make you feel terrific!</li>
            <li> It left the Kia smelling real curious and I swear deer were chasing me down the highway home.</li>
            <li> The first star is for the random squishy flower that came out of the bomb and floated around in the water.</li>
            <li> It must be the other essentials oils as well.  </li>
            <li> It also perminatly dyed My tub stopper pink!  </li>
            <li> That seems a bit extreme for the price of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other cheaper bath bombs and had no problems.</li>
            <li> For those bombs containing flower petals or other surprises, wrap the globe in nylon before use.</li>
            <li> So imagine my let down.  </li>
            <li> I can not even tell you my disappointment when I took my first bath.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;hidden present&amp;#34; came out as slimy little disks which stuck to skin and walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I feel a little sexier.  </li>
            <li> It was a little harsh for my senses.</li>
            <li> (On the other hand, the hubby was doing the laundry!!)</li>
            <li> &quot;  As I bathed, I tried to convince myself that the smell wasn&#x27;t that bad until my seven year old son opened the door and stopped in mid sentence to ask, \\&quot;what&#x27;s that aweful smell?\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been turned off by the heavy staining characteristics of the bath bombs.</li>
            <li> , Honey I Washed The Kids Soap, King of Skin, Buffy The Backside Slayer, and a few others.  </li>
            <li> I think, \\&quot;Lush makes decisions based on random things glamorized by the press and the resulting rantings of myopic maggots.\\</li>
            <li> I think, \\&quot;Lush makes decisions based on random things glamorized by the press and the resulting rantings of myopic maggots.\\</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t want to waste it in one bath(nor</li>
            <li> and whenever i cleaned my sheets, i&#x27;d soak them for a few hours in the tub with a piece of the bomb.</li>
            <li> I pulled a muscle a few weeks ago and bought some bath salts to relieve the pain.</li>
            <li> I was and am impatient.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fabulously rich in moisture, like taking a bath in lotion and very faint butter cream smell!</li>
            <li> Not that that&#x27;s a bad thing ;)</li>
            <li> , I hate pink - which I don&#x27;t consider to be a real color.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I only ordered one :-(</li>
            <li> Not sure how this worked out since I bought it as a gift</li>
            <li> the mess is quite icky!</li>
            <li> I am a bath fanatic.  </li>
            <li> I settle in for an hour at least.  </li>
            <li> things DO come in small packages!</li>
            <li> Mad that the hubby was doing the laundry at the same time</li>
            <li> but I took those out because I didnt want to have a nasty clean up after my bath.</li>
            <li> Not worth how expensive they are</li>
            <li> , borders on the ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I do wish they were a bit less expensive, but I knew what I was getting into when I bought it.</li>
            <li> After using the Sex Bomb Bath Bomb for the first time, I must admit I was greatly disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I stock up on these bad boys for bad days and loooong hot baths.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused?</li>
            <li> occasionally writes letters accusing me and my friends of being abhorrent publishers of hate literature.</li>
            <li> As weird as that sounds, you know what I&#x27;m talking about</li>
            <li> My skin was noticeably softer post-bath and smelled faintly like the bomb.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out all over my legs with a red rash that itched terribly.</li>
            <li> ill buy again.</li>
            <li> Already, some snippy pipsqueaks have begun to cover up Lush&#x27;s criminal ineptitude, and with terrifying and tragic results.</li>

            <li> I saved this for a bad day and was disappointed.</li>

            <li> I was very disappointed in the Sex Bomb Bath Bomb because of the smell.</li>
            <li> This smelling like disgusting Maryland stream mud water.</li>
            <li> So nasty.</li>

            <li> LUSH BATH BOMBS ARE LIKE 6.95... LOWER YOUR PRICE IF YOU WANT BETTER SALES.</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 bath bombs from Lush. Each one has disappointed me. While the scents range from &#x27;ok&#x27; to &#x27;really good&#x27;, the bombs fizz out in under 5 minutes and leave massive amounts of *navy blue* grit in the bottom of the tub (no matter the type of bomb). This is not fun to clean at the end of a relaxing bath. I&#x27;ve also been turned off by the heavy staining characteristics of the bath bombs. If they lasted longer and left my skin feeling more moisturized instead of dessicated, I&#x27;d be more forgiving of it. Bath bombs are mostly scent-infused baking soda. Big deal.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that gives lots of bubbles, more pampering for your skin and amazing scents, go for the bubble bars and bath melts by Lush. You&#x27;ll have some grit in the bottom of your tub afterward, but the trade-off is a longer-lasting, better product.</li>
            <li> I love the sex bomb ballistic!!!  It turned my bath water a hot pink color and smelled yummy.  The name sex bomb is somewhat deceiving though, because I didn&#x27;t think the smell was necessarily \\&quot;sexy\\&quot;.  It was more of a sweet, yummy smell.  It has a rose that floats around..the idea of which is neat but the rose felt totally disguisting and smooched all up when I touched it.  BUT the water color and smell where enough for me!  I will definately buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This was great! The scent nearly put me to sleep in the tub! Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;I have been into Lush products for as long as i can remember, so i know great quality but with this price is absolutely off the charts!! If u go to the official Lush site its only $6.65!! Their products are THE BEST out there and they have extremely low prices!! SO PLEASE GO TO THE OFFICIAL LUSH SITE!!!!</li>
            <li> I just finished my first ever Lush Sex Bomb Bath Bomb bath, and I am SOLD!  SexBomb is one of two emotibombs I purchased a couple of weeks ago, after doing plenty of research on the LUSH website about which smells I might enjoy and what others had experienced with their products.  The positive reviews I have read about this bomb thus far don&#x27;t do justice to this soft-ball sized pink sphere of magic!    If it seems large enough to break in half and get more for your money by all means do- that was my plan and a well placed whack with a hammer did a fine job of it; after putting half of it in the bathwater and watching it turn an enticing blush color as the bomb piece fizzed its way around the tub I decided to say \\&quot;why not?\\&quot; and threw in the other piece too.  I am SO glad I did- The color was gorgeous ( and did NOT leave a ring around my tub as I&#x27;ve read other bombs do)andthe scent is lingering on my skin and hair as I sit and type and is deliciously floral but not cloyingly so.  A 7 dollar bath is a decadent thing in this day and age, but i&#x27;ll gladly give up a couple mornings&#x27; worth of coffee runs in order to enjoy a bath like this one once or twice a month.  DELICIOUSLY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I was excites about this one...smelled great in the store, but when i put it in the tub, there was almost no scent. It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all, like most of LUSH&#x27;s products. The only good aspect was the color that the water changed.Save your money, or buy a different bomb.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Lush products but this particular Bath Bomb had an overpowering scent that didn&#x27;t seem sexy.</li>
            <li> I saved this for a bad day and was disappointed. I dropped it into the bathtub which turned neon pink - ok, fun. Then the strong scent of a cheap perfume permeated the bathroom, and I was less happy because it was really pungent. When I drained the bathtub, the pink pigment stained it and I had to scrub it out which was not at all sexy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend Titsy Totsy instead, also from Lush.</li>
            <li> Lush is an amazing bath store near my house, but sometimes it&#x27;s easier to order from here.  the sex bath bomb is not to be missed, as it is sexy, silky, luxurious, with a lovely scent that lasts on your skin and lingers in the bathroom for a whole day.  just pop one in and it immediately fizzes open for bath time enjoyment.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002260DW Sex Bomb Bath Bomb by LUSH]]    Smells great haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet but can&#x27;t wait</li>
            <li> great bomb. floats and fizzes on the surface of the water as it reveals the flower inside. smells and feels great.</li>
            <li> I first tried LUSH when I lived in England.  I saw a shop and was curious about it and went in.  My first reaction was WOW, the shop smelled FANTASTIC!!  I starting buying all kinds of LUSH Products from then!  My favorites and staples in my house are Sex Bomb, Floating Island, Ceriwen&#x27;s Cauldren, Creamed Almond and Coconut Smoothie, Honey I Washed The Kids Soap, King of Skin, Buffy The Backside Slayer, and a few others.  LUSH has to be one of my favorite stores!!  Since there is only one shop in the US and that&#x27;s far away from me I usually have my friends in England ship me some LUSH goodies and I ship them some American goodies!!  We love our exchanges and I get all my favorites!!  If you have yet to try LUSH I recommended it!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered the bath bomb(s) from Lush.  I am a bath fanatic.  After the stress of kids and family, there is nothing I enjoy more than a hot bath and a book.  I settle in for an hour at least.  So imagine my let down.  I had read all the wonderful reviews and was looking forward to using them (I ordered a few different ones).  I can not even tell you my disappointment when I took my first bath.  The smell is one of my favorite things about bath bombs and bubble bath but these lacked that.  With the bombs they also sent me samples of their soap - I do not recommend that either, even my children didn&#x27;t like the smell!  I will not be ordering from them again.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Leaves bits a rose petals and other stuff in your bath.  Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel soft.  Not my favorite, not even in the top 20.</li>
            <li> After using the Sex Bomb Bath Bomb for the first time, I must admit I was greatly disappointed!  The pink water was kind of attractive, and it was quite fun watching the ball explode into a fizzing fountain, but the smell was similar to musty, heavy talc powder.\\&quot;  As I bathed, I tried to convince myself that the smell wasn&#x27;t that bad until my seven year old son opened the door and stopped in mid sentence to ask, \\&quot;what&#x27;s that aweful smell?\\&quot;  I couldn&#x27;t deny the obvious and pulled the drain plug.  As I watched my efforts go down the drain, I noticed my squeezed out washcloth draped over the side of the tub with a memorable tinge of bright pink to remind myself not to buy the Sex Bomb again.  The bathroom smelled for close to a week, it was terribly strong!  I definitely would not buy another one of this scent but did since order the Butterball Bath Bomb and it&#x27;s fabulously rich in moisture, like taking a bath in lotion and very faint butter cream smell!</li>
            <li> This was my first lush product ever and I am so excited to try the other ones that I bought. The sex bomb left the water a nice pink and it has some  rose petals in the middle but I took those out because I didnt want to have a nasty clean up after my bath. My skin was so soft after my bath and still the next day smelled lovely. It might be too strong for some people but I have a small bathroom and a pretty small tub and I found it to be just perfect. It even made the whole house smell great. It didnt leave any pink on the tub possibly because I cleaned my tub right before. I will probably get this again but not for awhile until I try all of the lush products that I am interested in. And beleive me...theres so many.</li>
            <li> I dropped this bath bomb in the tub on my birthday, and it made me laugh. It filled my bathroom with a noxious cheap perfume scent that friends commented on for DAYS, made my tub greasy and bright pink, and it irritated the hell out of my girlparts. Won&#x27;t be using this one again. The first star is for the random squishy flower that came out of the bomb and floated around in the water. The second star is for the buttercream and the soap samples that came with it.</li>
            <li> Or even garner much attention. However, writing it is the only way I know to show principle, gumption, verve, and nerve. Let me cut to the chase: My purpose here is not to uplift individuals and communities on a global scale to lend a helping hand. Well, okay, it is. But I should point out that Lush believes that we have too much freedom. Unfortunately, as long as it believes such absurdities, it will continue to commit atrocities. Lush wants us to emulate the White Queen from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Through the Looking Glass, who strives to believe \\&quot;as many as six impossible things before breakfast\\&quot;. Then again, even the White Queen would have trouble believing that heathenism brings one closer to nirvana. I prefer to believe things that my experience tells me are true, such as that Lush&#x27;s premise (that the only way to expand one&#x27;s mind is with drugs -- or maybe even bathing balm) is its morality disguised as pretended neutrality. Lush uses this disguised morality to support its snow jobs, thereby making its argument self-refuting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lush occasionally writes letters accusing me and my friends of being abhorrent publishers of hate literature. These letters are typically couched in gutter language (which is doubtless the language in which Lush habitually thinks) and serve no purpose other than to convince me that we have a dilemma of leviathan proportions on our hands: Should we challenge its inconsiderate assumptions about merit, or is it sufficient to follow knowledge like a sinking star beyond the utmost bound of human thought? People often ask me that question. It&#x27;s a difficult question to answer, however, because the querist generally wants a simple, concise answer. He doesn&#x27;t want to hear a long, drawn-out explanation about how Lush is the type of organization that turns up its nose at people like you and me. I guess that&#x27;s because we haven&#x27;t the faintest notion about the things that really matter, such as why it would be good for it to demand special treatment that, in many cases, borders on the ridiculous. Already, some snippy pipsqueaks have begun to cover up Lush&#x27;s criminal ineptitude, and with terrifying and tragic results. What put-downs will follow from their camp is anyone&#x27;s guess. Lush&#x27;s more than scary. It&#x27;s mega-scary. In fact, to understand just how scary Lush is, you first need to realize that if we are to seek some structure in which the cacophony introduced by its ethics might be systematized, reconciled, and made rational, then we must be guided by a healthy and progressive ideology, not by the demonic and supercilious ideologies that Lush promotes. When I look back I think, \\&quot;Lush makes decisions based on random things glamorized by the press and the resulting rantings of myopic maggots.\\&quot; Lush likes to posture as a guardian of virtue and manners. However, when it comes right down to it, what it is pushing is both feral and obstreperous. That&#x27;s my story and I&#x27;m sticking to it.in many cases, borders on the ridiculous.

            <li> This smelling like disgusting Maryland stream mud water. So nasty. I feel bad I spent my friends money on this (I got a gift certificate). DO NOT BUY. Unless you like to smell like mud, of course.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for to spoil myself.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this bath bomb! My only regret is that I only ordered one :-( I will deffinately be ordering LOTS more! It leaves your skin silky smooth with a HEAVENLY scent that lasts &amp; lasts &amp; lasts! You won&#x27;t be disapointed, I promise!!</li>
            <li> As a heads up - If you do not like strong flowery jasmine then do not purchase this product!    It is simply not for everyone.     That being said, if you love the smell (as I do) then you should be delighted. I stock up on these bad boys for bad days and loooong hot baths. Truly an indulgence!!    I have seen a few reviews saying there was no smell, little smell or a strange smell not like in the store - Lush products are made from mostly natural, often organic ingredients. They do have shelf lifes and are not all perfect. Once in a while you will get a dud - This comes from the fact that they are made from REAL INGREDIENTS!!! If you call Lush support or go into the store they are pretty good about replacing a dud or giving you many free samples to try other products!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome!  It almost kind of made me feel a little naughty just because it&#x27;s such a \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; sort of smell.  Plus, it turns the bathwater this really surreal shade of pink, if visuals are your thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lingers on the skin a little strong, though... I actually broke mine in thirds and it was still fairly potent.  Not that that&#x27;s a bad thing ;)</li>
            <li> it smells like roses and jasmine and make the water turn a pretty pink. I wanted to stay in the bath for ever. This is one of my favorite bath bombs from lush and one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> The name says it all. With a touch jasmine and ylang ylang to make you feel sexy, and the clary sage makes it exceedingly relaxing. A definate for a full hedonistic experience. You&#x27;ll leave you tub feeling like a goddess (if you ever feeling like getting out after this bomb!) and the scent really stays for awhile. Absolutely lovely!</li>
            <li> I love Lush things, but in general they tend to smell similar, well, this bath bomb, make the water a hot pink, and it smells like sweet, flowery musk. In other words, it&#x27;s insanely enchanting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think the dictionary should have a picture of this Bath Ball under the definition of beautiful, beacuse this simply it. &lt;br /&gt;And I love how consistent they are, every single one of the Sex Bombs I bought smells the same. Major points there! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I think I&#x27;ve used like 8 of those all ready. I can&#x27;t stop buying them, great product, and a nice unique scent!</li>
            <li> The description doesnt really explain how big this item is but it is about the size of a baseball! I was impressed! A lovely smell and great skin softeners. Not oily or greasy, just light and pleasant. I will be ordering more!!</li>
            <li> Dipper won a raffle recently at our local Moose Lodge totaling 500 clams. I was also given a gag gift of this pink and purple SEX BOMB Bath Bomb by LUSH. It left the Kia smelling real curious and I swear deer were chasing me down the highway home. I left the SEX BOMB in the garage until I swear squirrels were trying to use a battering ram to get in. The next day, as luck would have it, I was heading down to the local target range. The Dipper Bright Lightbulb lit up the forest then and the SEX BOMB just happened to come along! With a little jimmieing, the SEX BOMB was properly snuggled into the skeet trap launch. PULL was called out several times before the Purple Dove flew right. And I missed! Much to my amazement, the baseball bomb bounced! A retrieval and reload with #4 shot was readied! Dipper&#x27;s aim was true this time and it was SEX BOMB fireworks over the range!!! That thing went off like an al-Quaeda freedom fighter! My Moose boodle was recently spent on 100 of these Hubba-Bubbles and they have greatly entertained since! Dipper sure knows how to use his rod right!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> My favorite of all LUSH&#x27;s Bath Bombs!  Smells so good, and leaves my skin really soft and moisturized.  What I love best about LUSH&#x27;s bath bombs (and the bubble bars) is the fact that you don&#x27;t need to rinse off after using them.  You just relax in your tub, and when you&#x27;re done you just towel off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The  Sex Bomb contains jasmine, which I am not really a fan of, however I found this bath bomb to smell SOOOO good.  It must be the other essentials oils as well.  The scent lingers and I can still smell it the next day.  Sex Bomb made my bath water (I don&#x27;t have a tub, but I used my boyfriends tub) a really nice pink color, and the rice paper rose slowly dissolved.  It made the water so silky and soft as well.  As weird as that sounds, you know what I&#x27;m talking about if you&#x27;ve tried a LUSH bath bomb before.  For those of you who don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about, go out and get one NOW!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good things DO come in small packages!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this LUSH product very much.  The pink water was a fun touch for me, and the silk like feel of the water was very inviting.  The smell was alot better than I expected and I felt uplifted and awake by its scent.  I had thrown in the whole bomb into the tub and let it fizz before stepping in.  Not sure what the exact proper directions are since they don&#x27;t come with any whatsoever!  The smell didn&#x27;t last too long on my skin. Oh on a funny note, I didn&#x27;t realize the middle was rice paper and had let it fizz along with the rest of the bomb.  When I came out of the tub the rice paper had turned to goo and stuck to my hair! Didn&#x27;t look too good, but whoops on my part!  I liked this BOMB alot more than my previous LUSH bubble bar (milk?) and look forward to experimenting with more LUSH bombs.</li>
            <li> This was My very first lush product.  The smell was SOOOO strong it gave Me a headache!  now if it had been a scent I liked the strength might not of bothered Me as much.  It also perminatly dyed My tub stopper pink!  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy anymore lush products.  It did however leave a ok smell on My skin after the bath, even smelled it the next day, but cant handle the strength during the bath, will not buy again. it also dryed out My skin on My hands.</li>
            <li> Yes, my bath smelled good and was a pretty color, but this is a waste of  money. Costs too much for what you get. Better to stick with the Bubble Bars. They&#x27;re pricey too, but you do get several uses out of them.</li>
            <li> This was the first bath bomb I ever bought, and I loved using it! As soon as I dropped it into the bath tub, I was amazed at how beautiful the colors were! It makes your legs feel soft and silky as well. I only gave it 4 stars though because it was a little pricey. Other than that, this is a great bath bomb and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;sex bomb\\&quot; makes your bathroom, water and you feel ultra sexy!  &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a huge bath bomb with the perfect combination of jasmine and ylang ylang, the scent is not too soft or too strong!!  &lt;br /&gt;I felt like a \\&quot;Hilton\\&quot; in the beautiful scented pink water!   &lt;br /&gt;Not to spoil the surprise...but the slow opening rose bud.. tops off the bath, like your last bite of Belgium chocolate. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I thought this particular bath bomb was very lovely.  It definately leaves a nice scent on your skin.  Kind of a musky smell.  You can definitely smell the Lavander.  Not sure why it&#x27;s named the way it is, it wasn&#x27;t particularly sexy to me but it is still very lovely and seems to be a pretty hot item; I went to order more and they were out of stock.</li>
            <li> Loved this bath bomb. Mad that the hubby was doing the laundry at the same time so the water was not as hot asI like it. (On the other hand, the hubby was doing the laundry!!) Could have lived without the rice paper flower that semi-desintigrated in the tub, but the aroma and color were dreamy. I woke up and could still smell the scent on my skin. Will buy again. BTW- they sent samples- Rock Star soap was fun for my daughter.</li>
            <li> i received this in a gift set. it smells so good-sexy in a comforting, relaxing way. i didn&#x27;t want to waste it in one bath(nor did i want to keep ordering so much stuff from that addicting company!)so took the easy way out and used it to scent my bed linens. i whacked it into about five good size chunks-the ballistic is pretty big-and whenever i cleaned my sheets, i&#x27;d soak them for a few hours in the tub with a piece of the bomb. this worked out great, as my bed smelled heavenly for weeks. the bathroom would smell good for awhile, too. i&#x27;d suggest this to anyone who has dark-colored bed linens(the water colors pretty intensely and light sheets might stain), whether you sleep alone or share your bed.</li>
            <li> This bath bomb is just \\&quot;meh\\&quot; for me.  I have used several of them and every time I keep hoping that it&#x27;ll just be an amazing experience but really, after the fizz dies down, you&#x27;re left with colored water and some random stuff floating around.  The scent is a little overpowering in the tub, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my skin very well.  If I&#x27;m going to take a $5.00 bath, I would much rather use one of Lush&#x27;s bath melts...they leave your skin feeling much softer than the bombs and tend to smell better too.</li>
            <li> This bath bomb is fabulous -- it smells great (but not overpowering), and it makes your skin silky smooth.  I have tried many Lush bath bombs, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product but didn&#x27;t like that it seems to be something you only use once. As soon as I put it in the tub it started to melt very quickly. That seems a bit extreme for the price of it. Much smaller ones should be made and in packs so that you can have one to put in the tub when you want to and it wouldn&#x27;t be too much. I think one whole large one is too much for one bath. There also should be instructions with their products. I noticed a lot of their items do not have any.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I&#x27;ve gotten this product.  It turns the bath a pretty hot pink color and it makes my room and me smell great.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sex Bomb Bath Bomb along with several other LUSH items. The soaps, shampoo bar, bubble bars and the other bath bombs I bought smell wonderful. The Sex Bomb truly smells like something from a bog. Yes it does a great job of leaving your skin soft &amp; silky but so do the other bombs &amp; they smell much better. LUSH products are expensive but they do a wonderful job of making your skin feel great. I was very disappointed in the Sex Bomb Bath Bomb because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this worked out since I bought it as a gift but she loved the gift!</li>
            <li> You have GOT to try this bath bomb. At first I was intimated by the reports of irremovable pink stains in the tub, but that is totally not the case. I received one of these awesome hand-made LUSH bath bombs for Christmas and was very pleased. The smell wasn&#x27;t all cupcakes and cookies, but instead a feminine musty-rose smell. It fizzes as it dissolves into the hot bath water and turns from pink and purple swirls into a solid, hot pink. As for the pink ring around the tub, be smart and just wipe down the sides of your tub after your bath with a try wash cloth while the tub is still wet... so easy and saves you a head ache later (I&#x27;m sure!). My skin was noticeably softer post-bath and smelled faintly like the bomb. Obviously, this product isn&#x27;t an every night thing, it&#x27;s way too pricey, but if you&#x27;re looking to spoil yourself a little- grab one of these luxurious bath bombs, a bottle of wine, and your favorite tunes and enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 4.5/5 shiny, shiny stars...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. Since this first product I am LUSH obsessed. The bubble bombs and bath play-doe come highly endorsed by me! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> my boyfriend bought this bath bomb as a gift for me. I was so excited to try it. My skin broke out all over my legs with a red rash that itched terribly. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allergic to something in it or what. I&#x27;ve used other cheaper bath bombs and had no problems. Does lush add clay to their bombs? It plugged my drain. I had to use drain-o and use a snake. There was some gray jell type stuff that looked like clay in some areas out of my drain. I will never order this product and asked my BF to not buy this product again. He tried his best to do something nice for me.</li>
            <li> Stained skin, hair and the Tub Purple.  The &amp;#34;hidden present&amp;#34; came out as slimy little disks which stuck to skin and walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I gained great points for the thought - my wife was clearly not relaxed after having to scrub (not rinse but SCRUB) the purple STAIN which had enveloped the tub.  So much for relaxing, sexy bath time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused? This bath bomb is only $6.95 in the Lush store do you get more then one for this price???</li>
            <li> The bomb smells awesome, I bought these for my girlfriend to try an she fell in love, an thought the name was cute. ill buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the bath bomb.  Very pricey.  Go directly to LUSH to purchase for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried a LUSH Bath Bomb, you&#x27;ve never really lived! Treat yourself! This is a feminine, feel good, smell good, pamper yourself, playful product if there ever was one. The name&#x27;s right too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I had not been pampering myself enough recently, and rarely had time for a leisurely bath last summer. It was jump into the shower in the AM and off to work. Then, especially in NYC, there&#x27;s the morning, afternoon and evening rush, a quick dinner, maybe another shower, hit the sack, and then it begins all over again. I pulled a muscle a few weeks ago and bought some bath salts to relieve the pain. I realized how good it felt to bathe again - to make time to relax. I mentioned this to a friend, (Thank God for girl friends!!), who hustled on over to the nearest Lush store and picked up a potent Hot Pink SEX BOMB Bath Bomb for me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK! So what does one do with a bath bomb. Clean your tub!! Then fill it with water. I like mine hot. Drop in the bomb and it will fizz like crazy and dissolve. You can dive in while it is melting or wait. I was and am impatient. For those bombs containing flower petals or other surprises, wrap the globe in nylon before use. The water should feel silky soft and the entire room will smell wonderful and steamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I hate pink - which I don&#x27;t consider to be a real color. ..so much for girly-girls! But this was such a lovely gesture from a good friend, and so I made an exception. She wanted feedback, no less. Fortunately I used this product before going out, because (WOW!) once you experience the eroticism of bathing in the alluring scent of jasmine and ylang ylang, lying back in the tub with a towel cushioning your head and neck, and the warm, fragrant steam wafting by your face, you will not want to sleep. As I said, the name&#x27;s right - for a reason. You will feel invigorated and want company to share your newly softened, lush smelling skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to the bath. I turned the lights low and lit a candle to enhance the experience. And the lack of light did help to hide the fact that my bath water was pink - but a much softer, more subtle color than the outside of the bomb, fortunately. Clary sage essential oil,  with reported aphrodisiac properties, is a primary ingredient which helps sooth and smooth the skin. And again, the smell was heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since become addicted to Lush&#x27;s bath bombs, there are all kinds with just one purpose - to pamper you and make you feel terrific! Check them out. You deserve it! This one is a real winner!&lt;br /&gt;JANAle to enhance the experience.

            <li> One of LUSH&#x27;s primary attractions is the fact that their products are unique in texture, scent and color and are fun to use.  This is the case with the SEX BOMB- I love the bright pink color and the musky scent.  One of the *best* bombs, and truly an experience!</li>
            <li> I can&#x60;t say it   you should try it     it worth</li>
            <li> Actually...I&#x27;d give it 0 stars. Read the ingredients!! Would you want to actually soak in this stuff? You absorb so much through the pores of your skin when bathing. Do yourself a favor...get some real, high quality essential oils. Ylang Ylang oil from Young Living, for example. It&#x27;s wonderful!! Just add some drops to the bath water. These are oils proven to have very high vibrational frequency to them...and you can definitely feel the difference!! Anything that has \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; on the label is nothing more than a synthetic chemical \\&quot;smell\\&quot; and nothing like the real deal!!</li>
            <li> The Sex Bomb seems to be the top rated bomb from Lush, and for good reason.  The first thing that happens when this delectable bomb meets the water is the fizzle... and then the rice paper flower blooms... just like a woman coming into her own.  The scent hits you next which is almost illicit in its intoxicating smell, taking your mind to places not for public viewing.  The one and only downfall to this naughty and wonderful sin is the hot pink velvety water has a tendency to stain some tubs so make sure you have some cleaner ready - oh and make sure that your man of the hour is on standby, you won&#x27;t want to be lonely after this!  FYI: Remove paper flower before running off with loverboy/girl otherwise the mess is quite icky!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite bath bomb from Lush. I came upon a Lush store while I was living in the UK and this is the first product I came upon. It smells so nice and turns your water pink. After soaking in the tub, it also makes your skin smell pretty too. And my husband always knows when I have had this bath bomb in the tub because the smell lasts in my bathroom for like 2 days!</li>
            <li> Fantastic, glorious, decadent.  Buy it, try it.  You&#x27;ll feel better right away. Makes my mood better, clears my mind, softens the skin. And I feel a little sexier.  Its *so* good.</li>
            <li> These cost 6 bucks at Lush.  I can&#x27;t believe I wasted that much money.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Nice and relaxing.  We have yet to try something from Lush that we didn&#x27;t like.  Make soaking in the bath a real treat.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a REAL Lush product... Smells ok and very overpriced for a fake item.</li>
            <li> This was awesome came before its estimated date and I just loved it!!!! Can&#x27;t get enough!! I&#x27;ve had this before when I was actually in stores years ago and was so happy to see it again!</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t impress me! Not worth how expensive they are</li>
            <li> I bought this as s stocking stuffer for my roomate and while she loved it, the smell was overwhelming for me. It permeated the entire house and I have a pretty good sized place. For what it&#x27;s worth, she did say it left her skin feeling really smooth. But she agreed that the smell was overpowering at first for her as well. If you have asthma, you might want to skip this kind of scent.</li>
            <li> I like Lush products, but the dye in this one was way too potent. Weeks have gone by and I still can&#x27;t get the pink stains off the bathtub, even with softscrub.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Try the Butterball bath bomb instead - it feels sublime, and melts away stress without staining the tub.</li>
            <li> I like how the bomb bubbles and fizzeses. I really liked the color the water turned. That made me feel a little sexy. But the overall smell was kinda raunchy sexy to me. It was a little harsh for my senses. My husband said I smelled like Tide detergent. ( Oh well it was worth a try). I guess I am more of a flowery kind of girl.</li>
            <li> I had gone to Vancouver Island several years ago and discovered Lush cosmetics. I was so excited when I saw that Amazon started carrying Lush products and I ordered them immediately. The bath bomb was phenomenal. The sex bath bomb was absolutely perfect. The scent was amazing without being overpowering and it made my skin feel so silky and soft. I also liked that Lush sent me samples of some of their other products to try out, I will most definitely order this particular bath bomb again and again, and I will recommend it to all my friends. I can&#x27;t say enough about it! It makes you feel like a princess and you never want to leave the tub! It&#x27;s most definitely a keeper!!!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few months ago, and stored it in my bathroom cabinet for safekeeping till I was ready to use it. Every time I opened that cabinet the whole house would be perfumed with the smell of it! Finally last night I went ahead and used the bomb for my bath. The water turned a very pretty pink color, and I thought the fizzing action lasted a lot longer than with other bath bombs I&#x27;ve used in the past, and was somewhat stronger. (It&#x27;s good if you do that trick of putting the fizzing bomb underneath sore muscles to get some light massaging action from the bubbles.) I love the smell of it -- it&#x27;s like a perfect halfway between candy and floral scents. The fragrance stuck to me all night, too; it was great. My skin also felt quite nice getting out of the bath (probably because citric acid is a major ingredient in the bomb -- it helps soften skin when put in a bath.)   I do wish they were a bit less expensive, but I knew what I was getting into when I bought it. That&#x27;s why I saved it for a discontented day whereupon I felt I really needed it!</li>
            <li> The product itself is great.&lt;br /&gt;But this is listed for way too much!&lt;br /&gt;The original price is much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Earlier today I picked up this bath bomb from lush. It&#x27;s definitely cheaper to buy this product directly from Lush.it retails for about $6.95 in Florida. or you can also purchase this bath bomb from Lush Cosmetics website. I believe it retails for about $6.75. This bath bomb did Stain my white bathtub my white bathtub. I would definitely recommend using a coconut oil to reduce the chances of this bath bomb staining your tub again. If not you can always use a white bath bomb from Lush. overall I definitely like this bath bomb it smells kind of like a floral fragrance. the smell last very long on your skin. but it definitely isn&#x27;t an overpowering smell. it does leave your skin kind of smooth but not baby soft skin which I was definitely surprised.</li>
            <li> Kind of a silly product but anything to spice things up is always welcomed by the wife. I got an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; for effort so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
