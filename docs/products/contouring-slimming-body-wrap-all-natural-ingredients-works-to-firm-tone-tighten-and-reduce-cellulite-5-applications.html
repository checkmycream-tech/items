            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>wraps worked really well to tighten my belly fat.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>

            <li>I received a single application as a free sample for my review.</li>
            <li>With that said, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s how light weight it is but other than that.</li>
            <li>The Contouring Slimming Body Wrap is a simple and effective way to tighten and firm the belly area.</li>
            <li>Worked for me, even though I did not see a difference after my first application, I would say it became noticeable only after using 3 wraps.</li>
            <li>I do have a little muffin top and instead of putting mine where the heart shape is over my belly button, I actually lowered it a bit, and this could also be part of the difference.  </li>
            <li>I have also been eating a little better and drinking a gallon of water each day, especially the day I am wearing the patch.  </li>
            <li>Wish it could work a little faster, but overall Iâ€™m still satisfied.</li>
            <li>This contouring body wrap is all natural.</li>
            <li>I am a size 10 and they wrap really far around my waist.  </li>
            <li>This body wrap being all natural</li>
            <li>After giving birth to my sons pretty much back to back, I got the stretch marks</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, but I wish the area it covered was a little bigger.</li>
            <li>There is no irritation from the wrap, it is very easy to put on and since it is thin it hides well under my clothes.</li>
            <li>Tried different wraps, they all work the same way, but I really like this one because of the shape and the price</li>
            <li>I cleaned my stomach first and then applied it starting at the center and then working outwards.</li>
            <li>The thing I like about this most is that it is thin</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it was shipped in an envelope, and when I opened it, I accidentally ripped up the instructions (totally my own fault).</li>
            <li>After the first treatment I was skeptical but after the third treatment I started to notice a change in how my clothes fit.</li>
            <li>Its major ingredients (Herbal Extracts) such as Sophoricoside and Actiponin (just to name a couple) are patented substances known for weight reducing effects.</li>

            <li> I have lost a half inch off of my waist, so far.  </li>
            <li> They can be worn longer than intended as I have done it that way and got no irritation after long use.</li>
            <li> I have never tried any other similar products</li>
            <li> Not at all what I would have expected.</li>
            <li> I started from the middle and worked the wrap outwards until it was firmly on my abdomen</li>
            <li> I placed the center of the wrap in the middle of my stomach and pressed the wrap to my lower abdomen in a outwards press until it was firmly attached to my stomach area.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> you get 5 for the price of what you would pay for one of the other</li>
            <li> Did not see any results, although less bulky than other brands, I would not purchase again at all.</li>
            <li> I have noticed this has visibly toned my belly and helped my strech marks on my belly to go down.</li>
            <li> I have used other wraps in the past, and you can smell the herbal properties of those wraps, and you can feel it when applying the wrap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t to say that it won&#x27;t work for someone else, but I had little to no results from it.</li>
            <li> Here is a full list of ingredients: Sophora Japonica Root Extract (Sophoriciside), Actiponin, Rosehip polyphenol MJ, Green Tea Extract Powder, Ginkgo Biloba EXT.24/6 WS, COLLAGEN PEPTIDE-SP, L-CARNITINE BASE, Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract, Lecithin, Alcohol.</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to notice it when it is out on, under clothing.</li>
            <li> but because of that I am addicted!!</li>
            <li> For the price, it isn&#x27;t a bad start...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I received my package and opened it, as I did I realized it resembled a great big band-aid. This wrap comes with instructions that are easy to to follow. You simply peel off the backing and apply it to your stomach area. I placed the center of the wrap in the middle of my stomach and pressed the wrap to my lower abdomen in a outwards press until it was firmly attached to my stomach area.&lt;br /&gt;All Natural Ingredients, Long Lasting Effect - up to 8 Hours! Improved adhesive layer - wear it in the shower, wear it anywhere! 5 Large Size Applications Included - 20.5 inches X 6.7 inches (52 cm X 17 cm) - covers large area! This contouring body wrap is all natural. Its major ingredients (Herbal Extracts) such as Sophoricoside and Actiponin (just to name a couple) are patented substances known for weight reducing effects. Here is a full list of ingredients: Sophora Japonica Root Extract (Sophoriciside), Actiponin, Rosehip polyphenol MJ, Green Tea Extract Powder, Ginkgo Biloba EXT.24/6 WS, COLLAGEN PEPTIDE-SP, L-CARNITINE BASE, Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract, Lecithin, Alcohol. With all of these incredible ingredients how ca you go wrong with this wrap.&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a savings price or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying from this company. Tried different wraps, they all work the same way, but I really like this one because of the shape and the price - you can usually get a wrap or two for the money, five is really nice.</li>
            <li> I am on my second wrap out of the five that came in my package. I have read a lot of the reviews on this product and no one else has mentioned this, so I am beginning to wonder if I am the only one it has happened to.....These wraps get very warm!  They feel great, too, I am not complaining.  I have lost a half inch off of my waist, so far.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results will be after I use all five!  I left the first one on for the full eight hours.  I will be leaving this one on the same amount of time. My skin looks so much better, it is actually tighter where my muffin-top is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like everyone else has said, yes, it does look like a huge bandage!  I am a size 10 and they wrap really far around my waist.  I think this has helped them to work very well.  I do have a little muffin top and instead of putting mine where the heart shape is over my belly button, I actually lowered it a bit, and this could also be part of the difference.  I love that these are made of all-natural ingredients. I don&#x27;t have much concern about what is being absorbed through my skin..  I have also been eating a little better and drinking a gallon of water each day, especially the day I am wearing the patch.  I have never tried any other similar products so I have nothing else to compare this to.  Overall, I am pretty happy with these wraps.  I received these at no cost, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> After the first treatment I was skeptical but after the third treatment I started to notice a change in how my clothes fit. Of course I started to get more exercise and change my diet. With that combination the inches just melted away.  Great product. I have told all my friends.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, this is my third order and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the wraps. Great value and really effective.</li>
            <li> This wrap didn&#x27;t do any slimming at all. It did make the appearance of my skin slightly better (stretch marks weren&#x27;t as noticeable) but overall, I just wasn&#x27;t a huge fan. I have used other wraps in the past, and you can smell the herbal properties of those wraps, and you can feel it when applying the wrap. These, however, had neither. This was wrap was like a giant bandaid. It was stretchable, and you can&#x27;t feel it once it is on, but otherwise it didn&#x27;t do much of anything for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t to say that it won&#x27;t work for someone else, but I had little to no results from it. Hopefully you have better results that I do. For the price, it isn&#x27;t a bad start...you get 5 for the price of what you would pay for one of the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion*</li>
            <li> I enjoy getting spa treatments and trying different body wraps. Easy to apply. Skin felt soft and nice.</li>
            <li> I have made two applications so far, and I love the results. Other wraps that I have tried did not do much for me, but this product seems to be so much better!</li>
            <li> Worked for me, even though I did not see a difference after my first application, I would say it became noticeable only after using 3 wraps. Wish it could work a little faster, but overall Iâ€™m still satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just adhesive.  No lotions or creams on it.  Did nothing except hurt to pull it off. Rip off.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. Its way better than the yucky smelly other ones I have tried. There is no bad chemical smells. The thing I like about this most is that it is thin so it&#x27;s hard to notice it when it is out on, under clothing. I can go about my day with no worries as I use these. I have noticed this has visibly toned my belly and helped my strech marks on my belly to go down. They can be worn longer than intended as I have done it that way and got no irritation after long use. I received this at a one time discounted price to review.</li>
            <li> I bought this slimming patch from eBay for about 10 bucks for 5 of them, loved it alot, you can see and feel effect from it, will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I have been looking for! After giving birth to my sons pretty much back to back, I got the stretch marks and I cannot seem to lose the weight around my belly. This body wrap being all natural I had to try, I was sent a sample to try out and see for myself. I can feel my skin tighten after wearing these body wraps, I bought more to use and I cannot believe how well this works. Its much better than many of the creams I have used and my stretch marks are going away! I will be getting back to my summer slim body soon. There is no irritation from the wrap, it is very easy to put on and since it is thin it hides well under my clothes.</li>
            <li> I have seen so many of my &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; friends use these wraps but spend so much on them. I see the &amp;#34;memes&amp;#34; on Facebook and think do those things really work? I purchased these at a promotional price to try out for myself. I have to say I don&#x27;t see an inch difference but i will say they give you a nice boost of energy whilst using them. I am up moving around especially if I put them on in the morning even before I have a  cup of coffee. Not sure why but because of that I am addicted!!</li>
            <li> Did not see any results, although less bulky than other brands, I would not purchase again at all.</li>
            <li> The Contouring Slimming Body Wrap is a simple and effective way to tighten and firm the belly area. It looks like a giant bandaid. Five pieces come in a set and is easy to apply: just peel the clear plastic off of the wrap and place it on the abdominal area. There is a heart shaped hole at belly button area, so there is no guessing if it is applied correctly. I use this product as directed: apply once every two days for 4-8 hours. I decided to wear mine for the maximum amount of time recommended. After the first application, I noticed that my abdominal area was firm and more toned. After several more applications, I can see a significant difference. Thanks to the all natural active ingredients, cellulite has diminished and my abdominal area looks slimmer and more contoured. This slimming wrap can be worn inconspicuously under clothes. I didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. With that said, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This wrap is just a sticker it doesn&#x27;t work at all..</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me. I used it as directed and after five wraps nothing. I will say that it is very comfortable, you put it on and literally forget it&#x27;s there, that&#x27;s how light weight it is but other than that. I&#x27;ve been making and drinking my own belly slimming detox water and it works way better than these wraps. Sometimes inside out is better than outside in</li>
            <li> wraps worked really well to tighten my belly fat.  along with exercise and diet i really do notice a difference!!! shipping was also pretty fast 2 days max.  thumbs up</li>
            <li> Was not at all happy with the results. Used as directed and did not see any difference. Not at all what I would have expected. Thought maybe I would see some skin firming but instead everything is the same as it was prior to using this product. I would not recommend for anyone to try.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference but Ive only worn these for 2 days.  I&#x27;ll update with a change</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in place at all.</li>
            <li> I received a single application as a free sample for my review. Unfortunately it was shipped in an envelope, and when I opened it, I accidentally ripped up the instructions (totally my own fault). The product almost looks like a giant band aid, with a similar backing that you peel off when you want to use it. I cleaned my stomach first and then applied it starting at the center and then working outwards. It was easy to apply, but I wish the area it covered was a little bigger. As I only had one sample to try I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this product. It would take multiple applications over many weeks to start seeing a result. However, it is easy to apply and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this product I opened it and laughed because it looks like a big giant band-aid. The product comes with instructions and very easy to use. You just peel off the backing and apply it to your stomach area. I started from the middle and worked the wrap outwards until it was firmly on my abdomen area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this sample for my review and opinion in which I only reviewed one. I can&#x27;t say how effective it is because you will need several applications to get the best results. I will say that it was comfy, unnoticeable and did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, love the design and the price! Recommended</li>
            <li> It is in my opinion that these provide some assistance with slimming your waist, but I recommend that you remove this in the shower after liberally soaking and soaping it up, it can cause some redness and irritation otherwise.  I have used all of my wraps and noticed w decrease in my waist and was quite satisfied.  Thank you so much.  I received this product for free for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> love the wraps, worked well on my stretch-marks!</li>
