    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This shampoo was recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;It works best for itching and flakey scalp&lt;br /&gt;Better than head &amp; shoulders&lt;</li>
            <li>I have and it works wonderfully.</li>

            <li>the best with your flaking, peeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo does the best job at controlling the build-up of plaques from psoriasis and removing the greasy medications I have to use.</li>
            <li>for psoriasis scales build up, this is the best product to deal with it.  </li>
            <li>I waited 3 weeks to get into one of the best dermatologists in the city.</li>
            <li>Perfect for greasy scalps and ones with dermatitis or severe dandruff.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really is awesome</li>
            <li>bought this shampoo solely on the basis of excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>great stuff!</li>
            <li>Like another review said, this shampoo works best if used twice in one cleaning.</li>
            <li>Excellent shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, it works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>Use as directed and results are great!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m beyond happy</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but you see the results.</li>
            <li>is how great of a shampoo it is.</li>
            <li>This product works great for targeting dandruff issues.</li>
            <li>This product was great...</li>
            <li>this shampoo works great for my problem scalp .</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is still a great brand.</li>
            <li>This product works great for me.</li>
            <li>THIS WAS ALRIGHT, BUT NOTHING GREAT.</li>
            <li>The scalp brush works great, but is purchased separately.  </li>
            <li>It helps also with detangling my hair, so that is a great help.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very effective in controlling scalp itchiness and dandruff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to just have one product do the job of three!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>And it has a pleasant, nonmediciney smell...</li>
            <li>but I wish they would add a pleasant fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>So, I would suggest washing your hands THOROUGHLY after using it and applying a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it is good for hair growth when I stop using t/sal my hair will fall out and look bald.</li>
            <li>I do a good scrub on my hair and my face</li>
            <li>I had to use a really good conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo.</li>
            <li>It bleeds fairly easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it comes without fragrance, and it does smell nice anyway.</li>
            <li>good product and price</li>
            <li>A QUALITY ITEM WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE PRICED FAIRLY, AND MET ALL THE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THAT ONE COME TO EXPECT FROM A GOOD BRAND THAT HAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a good addition to any anti-dandruff regimen.</li>
            <li>Also get a good conditioner because the shampoo is a bit drying.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow directions!</li>
            <li>You will want more too!</li>
            <li>My scalp and hair feel amazing.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell great, doesn&#x27;t have a smooth luxurious texture...</li>
            <li>The scent is not over powering and the liquid has a nice consistency.  </li>
            <li>I kept reading online that shampoo containing salicylic acid was an effective treatment for this condition, so I found this product on Amazon, gave it a try, AND</li>
            <li>The product is relatively effective at treating flakes.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena really is the best</li>
            <li>I have always liked Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>It does kind of fade my color</li>
            <li>Pert plus dandruff controls is the best I&#x27;ve found, I didn&#x27;t really notice any scalp improvement from this t-sal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I honestly have never written a review for any product before</li>
            <li>and it lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, works to conquer the problem, and is overall a great buy!</li>
            <li>I already have thinning hair so seeing the huge bumps were not the most attractive things.</li>
            <li>This seemed a good fit</li>
            <li>more effective than zinc pyrithione treatments for me.</li>
            <li>My son has had dandruff, or some kind of scalp build-up for many years.</li>
            <li>Great product, arrived quickly and works better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>And it does just fine!</li>
            <li>Very Light shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Effective so far&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It certainly helps greatly with dandruff.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit more money than the others</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I love my hair but my scalp is another matter altogether.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li>I tried many over the counter medicated shampoos, organic all-natural shampoos, I went to the dermatologist and tried medicated shampoos</li>
            <li>I really love about this product</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, after doing some research (through reputable sources, pubmed.gov), I learned the pH of skin should be between 4-5</li>
            <li>and I also learned most shampoos, conditioners, face washes and body washes are around 6.</li>
            <li>So I started experimenting with the more \\&quot;hardcore\\&quot; dandruff and psoriasis</li>
            <li>Perhaps I should use it more.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a month ago and for the most part 90% of my scalp acne is gone.</li>
            <li>it was bothered me most.</li>
            <li>and my hair was much more voluminous.</li>
            <li>T/Sal Shampoo has soothed my scalp itch, smells OK, and was delivered timely.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product worth the money</li>
            <li>I always buy this from the store but it is a better value on here.</li>
            <li>wait a minute or two then rinse and add the shampoo on once more.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about this getting on my face when washing my hair because I know it wont do any damage :)</li>
            <li>Plus you can always use a safe conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure this is working for me.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>whatever stuck in their precious locks.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am buying more.  </li>
            <li>The hair cuttery girl said my hair was really smooth and nice for a guy.</li>
            <li>After discontinuing Dove her skin has mostly cleared up and she no longer itches.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if I can&#x27;t end up rating it better than a 3 star</li>
            <li>I will say that this product is better than Neutrogena&#x27;s body wash/scrubs.</li>
            <li>but this is much better.</li>
            <li>Many of the reviewers mentioned this product&#x27;s ability to deal with their itchy and often oily scalp.</li>
            <li>more so than it did before</li>
            <li>As a shampoo, it&#x27;s more medicinal -</li>
            <li>, I guess I have to reduce my complaining :)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use it more than once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>The salicylic acid in it helps gently removes flakes with a fairly pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>ended up trying this product and enjoy it much more than the coal tar.</li>
            <li>My scalp is now about 70% better, and I don&#x27;t have to resort to yet another prescription being filled.</li>
            <li>I really thought this product would help because of all the good reviews</li>
            <li>My stylist uses tea tree oil on me whenever I go for a trim, but that can easily be overdone.  </li>
            <li>These are easily removeable, but just an FYI.</li>
            <li>I had bought this shampoo because my skin would easily become flaky after cleansing both hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend for those whose scalp has itchiness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Amazing as a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;-Treats flakes/dandruff pretty effectively, but condition returns after not using for 1-2 days.&lt;br /&gt;-Can</li>
            <li>just so you know that it is effective for that particular ailment:)</li>
            <li>Smell is fine - to me almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li>It smells fine, nothing fancy nor traumatizing.. sort of a stringent, lemony smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mild scalp acne for a while now, and I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure which shampoo at the drugstore would help me.</li>
            <li>They were huge and not going away.</li>
            <li>stuff is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>And it also cleanses the scalp if there is build up from beauty products or cheap shampoos or conditioners.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t use conditioner because my hair was smooth.</li>
            <li>My head is still itch which was my primary problem.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is aloe based, hypoallergenic and paraben free, with a light fragrance that hasn&#x27;t caused any issues.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the results just after a few shampoos.</li>
            <li>So far my experience with T/Sal has been really good.  </li>
            <li>Great size for travel and a deep clean.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>My doctor said either product was fine for me to use, but the scent of this one is mild; and within two months, my dandruff and psoriasis was all but gone.</li>
            <li>So, I was excited about how well it worked and</li>
            <li>Simply clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>Helps with scalp problems and leaves hair clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>I used it today, and when washing my scalp felt clean</li>
            <li>It keeps the dandruff away and leaves your hair clean</li>
            <li>My barber always asks me if I wash my hair before i go get a hair cut b/c its so clean.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels and looks great and my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy or dry.</li>
            <li>Great for dry hair</li>
            <li>OK, I am re-writing my previously positive review.</li>
            <li>A huge benefit I noticed right away was that it made my hair (not my scalp) feel really really clean-</li>
            <li>Not as great as expected.</li>
            <li>And it was true; they were all around pH 6-7.  </li>
            <li>However, no so sure if it was really really effected in my case.</li>
            <li>and I love that it has salicylic acid because my face is very acne prone</li>
            <li>I have a full head of hair but still like to know that its not an issue.  </li>
            <li>My hair was silky, smooth, and strong it took a fraction of the time and effort to get my hair pin straight.</li>
            <li>Agree with all the other reviews that it smells nice and seems good for my hair, but it really does nothing for my scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s squeaky clean with no weird off-white build up!</li>
            <li>Neutrogena  makes great products, but there are other options.</li>
            <li>and I started losing my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product cleans my scalp super well.</li>
            <li>quite mild</li>
            <li>However, it wasn&#x27;t as quick of a process as I wanted it to be</li>
            <li>what 4.5 fluid ounces really was, but I happily bought this to combat my dandruff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a large size T-Gel to see if it&#x27;s more cost effective and will report back after I try it.</li>
            <li>Works wonders, super soft curly hair with clean scalp :)</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves your hair clean feeling, smooth, REALLY shiny without drying at ALL.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes scalp so its not itchy or flaky or dry and it looks good.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m presented with the challenge of discovering good, dry scalp savers.</li>
            <li>Pro&#x27;s  Love that there is no harsh smell!  </li>
            <li>I went back to it, and I&#x27;m STILL in love with it!  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve done that I haven&#x27;t had any problems, my scalp is super clear and I couldn&#x27;t be any more please.</li>
            <li>my end, I am sensitive to fragrances and my hair reacts terribly to strong sulfuctants and silicones found in \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; shampoos, causing a huge amount of frizz, dryness, build up and breakage.</li>
            <li>B000GCV2VI DHS Clear Shampoo 16 oz]] and [[ASIN:B000XDCGOM DHS Conditioning Rinse with Panthenol, Fragrance Free 8 fl oz (236 ml)]], both very mild no-frills products that work</li>
            <li>I looked at Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel shampoo but really didn&#x27;t think it would fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: It is September 2013 now and I can safely say that the itch and flakes are completely gone with the tea tree shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth a try even if you don&#x27;t suffer from the scalp conditions.</li>
            <li>Totally worth  the money.</li>
            <li>Cannot comment on effectiveness compared to selenium sulfide (Selsun) or ketaconazole (Nizoral).&lt;br /&gt;-Smells very, very neutral, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>She uses this shampoo every other wash with the 3 min conditioner and her hair is more healthy than I have ever seen it, and</li>
            <li>I also for the first time, had mild psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the clear scentless bottle as the dark t-sal does not smell very good.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I would recommend is make sure you adequately rinse the tub if you are using this and someone else in your house is using the T/Gel.</li>
            <li>Works great on my hair and no more dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Even though it is highlighted my hair still gets greasy very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had mild issues with dandruff over the years, but my scalp does tend to build-up easily.</li>
            <li>After the FIRST use, this shampoo cleared up my scalp.</li>
            <li>I am going to keep using it because I like the results on my hair SO MUCH!  </li>
            <li>the first week I followed this procedure every day, then after that about three times a week.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I will be honest and say I did not follow the directions exactly as stated on the bottle and because of that, I did not get the results I expected.  </li>
            <li>today) I tried it again and using some suggestions from fellow reviewers on here, I followed the directions exactly...</li>
            <li>I noticed that the second lather foamed up a lot more</li>
            <li>and I believe it&#x27;s because the first application removed the build-up and</li>
            <li>I ordered this stuff to combat a pretty severe case of dandruff that started to develop about a year ago.</li>
            <li>I will give it 3 stars because it helped with my scalp itchiness, but a product that also helps with itching and is more formulated for oily hair is Selsun Blue Naturals Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Try it, and you will see results the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get much in a bottle, and need to shampoo twice per shower with it to get the maximum effect, but worth it because it works so well.</li>
            <li>That is pretty</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li>I wash first with Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree shampoo, then wash once with T/Sal</li>
            <li>I will gladly be switching back to T/Sal.</li>
            <li>It smells so much better than the T-Gel Coal Tar shampoo, but I like to switch back and forth between the two (as recommended by a dermatologist)</li>
            <li>T-sal was recommended by a dermatoloogist that I went to for the first time in Jan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to finally have found</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll likely get one more bottle after this one runs out</li>
            <li>If anyone else has had this reaction and wants to share any tips, I&#x27;m all ears!</li>
            <li>In addition, my scalp actually burns now and I am losing even more hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoos scent is light, nearly nonexistent.  </li>
            <li>The hair stayed clean for nearly two days and my scalp didn&#x27;t itch or hurt.</li>
            <li>I recommend to use this with Biotin B complex shampoo for best results as a second wash.</li>
            <li>and I pretty much have purchased all the drugstore products I could find to solve this.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with how quickly it relieved my skin.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to need some sort of conditioning cream post shampoo, but I am very happy to report that T-Sal left my coarse, thick hair soft and silky smooth!  </li>
            <li>T/Gel and the knockoffs just aren&#x27;t strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>That certainly was not the case for me.</li>
            <li>In the winter scalp can get dry &amp; itchy, this so far is working nicely.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I use it on my young son who has a mild case of psoriasis on his scalp and behind his ears.</li>
            <li>My scalp became very dry and itchy and flakes became more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Not only was my scalp and hair clean, it no longer itched, flaked, or burned--even after the first use.</li>
            <li>I like this product, but the cost is too much.</li>
            <li>It makes a real and noticable difference.  </li>
            <li>, the price was reasonable, so I ordered a bottle.  </li>
            <li>The breakouts occur mostly on the back of my head, and I&#x27;ve tried about every topical treatment out there without success.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that I did not lose as much hair in this wash.  </li>
            <li>I am on day 4 of use, I dont really see a difference yet, scalp is still itchy with flakes.</li>
            <li>always really suck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Between the two it really drops the banhammer on dandruff.  </li>
            <li>You would think I had naturally straight hair</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this.  </li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li>I have problems with scalp acne and dandruff, and my hair is very oily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell of this... at all.</li>
            <li>Also, as a side note, when I am off carbs and sugar, I don&#x27;t need this shampoo as much.</li>
            <li>and this combination REALLY solved it in a matter of days.</li>
            <li>but just keep in mind that this product by itself didn&#x27;t really do too much.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well for clearing up acne along my hair line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So you may have to use more than expected.</li>
            <li>This product worked very well for my hair and didn&#x27;t strip the color</li>
            <li>I had been having problems with a very itchy scalp and it was causing a lot of hair breakage, too.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Like that this product doesn&#x27;t have a really noticeable smell.  </li>
            <li>Gentle to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 3 weeks and have had much improvement.  </li>
            <li>Her hair dresser also suggested a cheap deep conditioner</li>
            <li>I leave it on until I have applied to every section part of hair and after rubbing gently my scalp to remove the scalp flakes.  </li>
            <li>It leaves it super clean although it also makes it harder to detangle.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the other reviewers, I made sure to follow the directions.</li>
            <li>Definitely stopped the itching right after the first use.</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special shampoo only exacerbated the problem.</li>
            <li>For those who are sensitive to scent, I would call this nearly fragrance-free; there is some scent, but it disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, just be aware it (like the TGEL) will dry your scalp, which can lead to itching....and perpetuate the problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed it helps my hand eczema (from using strong detergents such as [[ASIN:B007IX9RTC Dial 1423982 Purex Ultra Free and Clear Concentrated Liquid Detergent, 100oz Bottle, (Pack of 4)]]), if I leave the shampoo on my hands as long as I do on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time tonight, and my hair has not been this soft in MONTHS.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>It contains a high percentage of salicylic acid (3%) in a formula I like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I have only used this a few times but it definitely gives a very clean refreshing feel to my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am about half way through the bottle, washing my hair every other day, and have experienced the same results consistently.</li>
            <li>This really cleans my scalp like nothing else so far.</li>
            <li>I normal wash my hair maybe twice a week</li>
            <li>When you add it the second time it lathers VERY well :) there really is no smell at all</li>
            <li>I normally have an oily, itchy scalp with buildup, and I notice that I have no itching afer using the T/Sal for a month.</li>
            <li>So my husband started using it since he has normal hair and happens to have psoriasis which it states it helps.</li>
            <li>scalp is actually sun burnt right now</li>
            <li>i was very hopeful after reading all the positive reviews and followed the instructions for several weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so difficult to find shampoos that are fragrance free and dye free!</li>
            <li>I had a variety of opinions but the major one is that there are too much oil from my head which also leads to my receding hairline and etc.  </li>
            <li>and it was very soft and wavy</li>
            <li>his scalp is clear!</li>
            <li>If this is just after one (following directions exactly) try, then I can&#x27;t wait to see results after one or two weeks.  </li>
            <li>for the first 2 weeks, then my hair went back to itching and</li>
            <li>After first use I noticed my curls came springing back to life</li>
            <li>I have very dry super curly hair.</li>
            <li>The lather is hard to work up, though, as I found I could only get it to lather enough (and feel like it was adhering to my hair and scalp instead of just lightly sitting on top)</li>
            <li>I bought this because I needed a new shampoo that exfoliates the scalp (clear scalp &#x3D; healthier hair, faster growth).</li>
            <li>This is great to prevent dandruff during the winter months or when its cold out.  </li>
            <li>I scoured the web looking for something that would help clear this up.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear it up 100%, but it did drastically reduce the severity of the condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it and immediately saw it clear up.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised to see how well T-Sal cleaned and how soft and light feeling my hair dried afterwards.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter has severe eczema.</li>
            <li>I even started washing my hair only once a week in an attempt to not lose as much hair.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no heavy fragrance, either.</li>
            <li>Early this winter, my scalp fell apart.</li>
            <li>So far, a week has gone by and no itch...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I have to use this once a week.  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper on Amazon than at our local stores.</li>
            <li>So far, this product is doing the job.</li>
            <li>my scalp was itching so INTENSELY and flaking constantly.</li>
            <li>So when I start to itch this is an instant remedy and an ABSOLUTE LIFE SAVER.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and the area is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Followup:  After almost a year the psoriasis on my scalp has been completely eliminated with the help of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>T/Sal is nearly a miracle.</li>
            <li>So far this stuff has been working well.</li>
            <li>I had to order it from amazon because I could not find it in the storel but since starting it ,my scalp does not itch very often</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 47 year old guy, and have had problems with scalp pimples.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product so far.</li>
            <li>It has natural wave to it</li>
            <li>She removed some non malignant lesions this shampoo removed the rest.keeps scalp clear and free from dried skin.</li>
            <li>After months and months of trying to find a solution I decided to give this a try even though I thought it was quite expensive and yes, it did start to get better right away.</li>
            <li>I have thick black hair cut short in a great pixie.</li>
            <li>I probably have something more serious than scalp build-up.  </li>
            <li>It is half the price of many of the other products I tried.</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but worth it because it does what it says it will do nearly overnight.</li>
            <li>IT WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the product&#x27;s a little pricey, instead of lathering twice with this shampoo, when I first get into the shower I wash my hair first with my regular shampoo, rinse it out, and then lather a second time with the Nutrogena T/Sal shampoo, using this device [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands that were supposed to be more natural, but this is the only one that always works.</li>
            <li>few months ago I discovered that [[ASIN:B005HO0AR2 Dove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Count]] had been the main cause of redness and intense itching on her skin, which doctors thought was atypical eczema.</li>
            <li>When I finished this shampoo, I started using Garnier Fructis Anti-Dandruff Clear Control Shampoo, 13-Fluid Ounce, with 3% Salicylic Acid, and only spend $5.29 here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair was left relatively soft and it helps control the oil on my scalp as well.</li>
            <li>Decreased All Scalp Itch and Most of Flakes.</li>
            <li>I found I could use it every day and my hair and scalp would tolerate it very well, but my HANDS started getting extremely dry and lost feeling in several patches (I thought i was going to lose my finger print).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have your normal dry dandruff.</li>
            <li>if I applied this as the second round of shampooing, using a different normal type of shampoo first.</li>
            <li>I lather it up, then let it sit for 2-3 minutes while attending to other areas, then gently rinse.  </li>
            <li>We have been trying to find a sensitive enough shampoo that actually cleaned her oily hair without increasing the flakes &amp; itching.</li>
            <li>I think if the shampoo doesn&#x27;t work well at first, then combine it with essential oils like tea tree oil, cedarwood oil, neem oil, karanja oil, peppermint oil, and other oils that fight fungus and balances sebum of the scalp like ylang ylang essential oil.</li>
            <li>Cleared up head acne pretty quickly, not 100% but enough to see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>Because her hair is so dark the flakes showed up really well.</li>
            <li>Apparently when the residues mix, they leave red stains in the tub.</li>
            <li>so greasy hair may be my cross to bare.</li>
            <li>I work out everyday and live in hot/humid New Orleans,</li>
            <li>I do involves a ridiculous amount of product layering and damage for days done to my hair and this shampoo will leave my locks squeaky clean every time.</li>
            <li>Had some scalp issues and it really fixed the dry flakiness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel dry and my hair is soft after shampooing.</li>
            <li>AND...for the first time in TEN years, I actually see a majority of a pink scalp rather than a white, dry, flaky scalp all over.  </li>
            <li>I like having a little tingle and this shampoo really has no tingle.  </li>
            <li>think the price on here is a little much for what you get though.</li>
            <li>(her hair is very, very thick) and our scalps stay itch free all day.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Neutrogena is still a great brand.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS ALRIGHT, BUT NOTHING GREAT.</li>
            <li> The scalp brush works great, but is purchased separately.  </li>
            <li> It helps also with detangling my hair, so that is a great help.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very effective in controlling scalp itchiness and dandruff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to just have one product do the job of three!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> And it has a pleasant, nonmediciney smell...</li>
            <li> but I wish they would add a pleasant fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> So, I would suggest washing your hands THOROUGHLY after using it and applying a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it is good for hair growth when I stop using t/sal my hair will fall out and look bald.</li>
            <li> I do a good scrub on my hair and my face</li>
            <li> I had to use a really good conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo.</li>
            <li> It bleeds fairly easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that it comes without fragrance, and it does smell nice anyway.</li>
            <li> good product and price</li>
            <li> A QUALITY ITEM WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE PRICED FAIRLY, AND MET ALL THE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THAT ONE COME TO EXPECT FROM A GOOD BRAND THAT HAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a good addition to any anti-dandruff regimen.</li>
            <li> Also get a good conditioner because the shampoo is a bit drying.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow directions!</li>
            <li> You will want more too!</li>
            <li> My scalp and hair feel amazing.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell great, doesn&#x27;t have a smooth luxurious texture...</li>
            <li> The scent is not over powering and the liquid has a nice consistency.  </li>
            <li> I kept reading online that shampoo containing salicylic acid was an effective treatment for this condition, so I found this product on Amazon, gave it a try, AND</li>
            <li> The product is relatively effective at treating flakes.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena really is the best</li>
            <li> I have always liked Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> It does kind of fade my color</li>
            <li> Pert plus dandruff controls is the best I&#x27;ve found, I didn&#x27;t really notice any scalp improvement from this t-sal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I honestly have never written a review for any product before</li>
            <li> and it lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, works to conquer the problem, and is overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> I already have thinning hair so seeing the huge bumps were not the most attractive things.</li>
            <li> This seemed a good fit</li>
            <li> more effective than zinc pyrithione treatments for me.</li>
            <li> My son has had dandruff, or some kind of scalp build-up for many years.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived quickly and works better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> And it does just fine!</li>
            <li> Very Light shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Effective so far&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It certainly helps greatly with dandruff.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit more money than the others</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I love my hair but my scalp is another matter altogether.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li> I tried many over the counter medicated shampoos, organic all-natural shampoos, I went to the dermatologist and tried medicated shampoos</li>
            <li> I really love about this product</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, after doing some research (through reputable sources, pubmed.gov), I learned the pH of skin should be between 4-5</li>
            <li> and I also learned most shampoos, conditioners, face washes and body washes are around 6.</li>
            <li> So I started experimenting with the more \\&quot;hardcore\\&quot; dandruff and psoriasis</li>
            <li> Perhaps I should use it more.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a month ago and for the most part 90% of my scalp acne is gone.</li>
            <li> it was bothered me most.</li>
            <li> and my hair was much more voluminous.</li>
            <li> T/Sal Shampoo has soothed my scalp itch, smells OK, and was delivered timely.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product worth the money</li>
            <li> I always buy this from the store but it is a better value on here.</li>
            <li> wait a minute or two then rinse and add the shampoo on once more.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about this getting on my face when washing my hair because I know it wont do any damage :)</li>
            <li> Plus you can always use a safe conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure this is working for me.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> whatever stuck in their precious locks.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am buying more.  </li>
            <li> The hair cuttery girl said my hair was really smooth and nice for a guy.</li>
            <li> After discontinuing Dove her skin has mostly cleared up and she no longer itches.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if I can&#x27;t end up rating it better than a 3 star</li>
            <li> I will say that this product is better than Neutrogena&#x27;s body wash/scrubs.</li>
            <li> but this is much better.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviewers mentioned this product&#x27;s ability to deal with their itchy and often oily scalp.</li>
            <li> more so than it did before</li>
            <li> As a shampoo, it&#x27;s more medicinal -</li>
            <li> , I guess I have to reduce my complaining :)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it more than once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> The salicylic acid in it helps gently removes flakes with a fairly pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> ended up trying this product and enjoy it much more than the coal tar.</li>
            <li> My scalp is now about 70% better, and I don&#x27;t have to resort to yet another prescription being filled.</li>
            <li> I really thought this product would help because of all the good reviews</li>
            <li> My stylist uses tea tree oil on me whenever I go for a trim, but that can easily be overdone.  </li>
            <li> These are easily removeable, but just an FYI.</li>
            <li> I had bought this shampoo because my skin would easily become flaky after cleansing both hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend for those whose scalp has itchiness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Amazing as a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;-Treats flakes/dandruff pretty effectively, but condition returns after not using for 1-2 days.&lt;br /&gt;-Can</li>
            <li> just so you know that it is effective for that particular ailment:)</li>
            <li> Smell is fine - to me almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li> It smells fine, nothing fancy nor traumatizing.. sort of a stringent, lemony smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild scalp acne for a while now, and I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure which shampoo at the drugstore would help me.</li>
            <li> They were huge and not going away.</li>
            <li> stuff is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> And it also cleanses the scalp if there is build up from beauty products or cheap shampoos or conditioners.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t use conditioner because my hair was smooth.</li>
            <li> My head is still itch which was my primary problem.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is aloe based, hypoallergenic and paraben free, with a light fragrance that hasn&#x27;t caused any issues.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results just after a few shampoos.</li>
            <li> So far my experience with T/Sal has been really good.  </li>
            <li> Great size for travel and a deep clean.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li> My doctor said either product was fine for me to use, but the scent of this one is mild; and within two months, my dandruff and psoriasis was all but gone.</li>
            <li> So, I was excited about how well it worked and</li>
            <li> Simply clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> Helps with scalp problems and leaves hair clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> I used it today, and when washing my scalp felt clean</li>
            <li> It keeps the dandruff away and leaves your hair clean</li>
            <li> My barber always asks me if I wash my hair before i go get a hair cut b/c its so clean.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels and looks great and my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy or dry.</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair</li>
            <li> OK, I am re-writing my previously positive review.</li>
            <li> A huge benefit I noticed right away was that it made my hair (not my scalp) feel really really clean-</li>
            <li> Not as great as expected.</li>
            <li> And it was true; they were all around pH 6-7.  </li>
            <li> However, no so sure if it was really really effected in my case.</li>
            <li> and I love that it has salicylic acid because my face is very acne prone</li>
            <li> I have a full head of hair but still like to know that its not an issue.  </li>
            <li> My hair was silky, smooth, and strong it took a fraction of the time and effort to get my hair pin straight.</li>
            <li> Agree with all the other reviews that it smells nice and seems good for my hair, but it really does nothing for my scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s squeaky clean with no weird off-white build up!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena  makes great products, but there are other options.</li>
            <li> and I started losing my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> This product cleans my scalp super well.</li>
            <li> quite mild</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t as quick of a process as I wanted it to be</li>
            <li> what 4.5 fluid ounces really was, but I happily bought this to combat my dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a large size T-Gel to see if it&#x27;s more cost effective and will report back after I try it.</li>
            <li> Works wonders, super soft curly hair with clean scalp :)</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves your hair clean feeling, smooth, REALLY shiny without drying at ALL.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes scalp so its not itchy or flaky or dry and it looks good.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m presented with the challenge of discovering good, dry scalp savers.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s  Love that there is no harsh smell!  </li>
            <li> I went back to it, and I&#x27;m STILL in love with it!  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve done that I haven&#x27;t had any problems, my scalp is super clear and I couldn&#x27;t be any more please.</li>
            <li> my end, I am sensitive to fragrances and my hair reacts terribly to strong sulfuctants and silicones found in \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; shampoos, causing a huge amount of frizz, dryness, build up and breakage.</li>
            <li> B000GCV2VI DHS Clear Shampoo 16 oz]] and [[ASIN:B000XDCGOM DHS Conditioning Rinse with Panthenol, Fragrance Free 8 fl oz (236 ml)]], both very mild no-frills products that work</li>
            <li> I looked at Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel shampoo but really didn&#x27;t think it would fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: It is September 2013 now and I can safely say that the itch and flakes are completely gone with the tea tree shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth a try even if you don&#x27;t suffer from the scalp conditions.</li>
            <li> Totally worth  the money.</li>
            <li> Cannot comment on effectiveness compared to selenium sulfide (Selsun) or ketaconazole (Nizoral).&lt;br /&gt;-Smells very, very neutral, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> She uses this shampoo every other wash with the 3 min conditioner and her hair is more healthy than I have ever seen it, and</li>
            <li> I also for the first time, had mild psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the clear scentless bottle as the dark t-sal does not smell very good.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would recommend is make sure you adequately rinse the tub if you are using this and someone else in your house is using the T/Gel.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair and no more dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is highlighted my hair still gets greasy very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had mild issues with dandruff over the years, but my scalp does tend to build-up easily.</li>
            <li> After the FIRST use, this shampoo cleared up my scalp.</li>
            <li> I am going to keep using it because I like the results on my hair SO MUCH!  </li>
            <li> the first week I followed this procedure every day, then after that about three times a week.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I will be honest and say I did not follow the directions exactly as stated on the bottle and because of that, I did not get the results I expected.  </li>
            <li> today) I tried it again and using some suggestions from fellow reviewers on here, I followed the directions exactly...</li>
            <li> I noticed that the second lather foamed up a lot more</li>
            <li> and I believe it&#x27;s because the first application removed the build-up and</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff to combat a pretty severe case of dandruff that started to develop about a year ago.</li>
            <li> I will give it 3 stars because it helped with my scalp itchiness, but a product that also helps with itching and is more formulated for oily hair is Selsun Blue Naturals Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Try it, and you will see results the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get much in a bottle, and need to shampoo twice per shower with it to get the maximum effect, but worth it because it works so well.</li>
            <li> That is pretty</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li> I wash first with Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree shampoo, then wash once with T/Sal</li>
            <li> I will gladly be switching back to T/Sal.</li>
            <li> It smells so much better than the T-Gel Coal Tar shampoo, but I like to switch back and forth between the two (as recommended by a dermatologist)</li>
            <li> T-sal was recommended by a dermatoloogist that I went to for the first time in Jan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to finally have found</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll likely get one more bottle after this one runs out</li>
            <li> If anyone else has had this reaction and wants to share any tips, I&#x27;m all ears!</li>
            <li> In addition, my scalp actually burns now and I am losing even more hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoos scent is light, nearly nonexistent.  </li>
            <li> The hair stayed clean for nearly two days and my scalp didn&#x27;t itch or hurt.</li>
            <li> I recommend to use this with Biotin B complex shampoo for best results as a second wash.</li>
            <li> and I pretty much have purchased all the drugstore products I could find to solve this.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with how quickly it relieved my skin.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to need some sort of conditioning cream post shampoo, but I am very happy to report that T-Sal left my coarse, thick hair soft and silky smooth!  </li>
            <li> T/Gel and the knockoffs just aren&#x27;t strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> That certainly was not the case for me.</li>
            <li> In the winter scalp can get dry &amp; itchy, this so far is working nicely.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I use it on my young son who has a mild case of psoriasis on his scalp and behind his ears.</li>
            <li> My scalp became very dry and itchy and flakes became more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Not only was my scalp and hair clean, it no longer itched, flaked, or burned--even after the first use.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but the cost is too much.</li>
            <li> It makes a real and noticable difference.  </li>
            <li> , the price was reasonable, so I ordered a bottle.  </li>
            <li> The breakouts occur mostly on the back of my head, and I&#x27;ve tried about every topical treatment out there without success.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that I did not lose as much hair in this wash.  </li>
            <li> I am on day 4 of use, I dont really see a difference yet, scalp is still itchy with flakes.</li>
            <li> always really suck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Between the two it really drops the banhammer on dandruff.  </li>
            <li> You would think I had naturally straight hair</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this.  </li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li> I have problems with scalp acne and dandruff, and my hair is very oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell of this... at all.</li>
            <li> Also, as a side note, when I am off carbs and sugar, I don&#x27;t need this shampoo as much.</li>
            <li> and this combination REALLY solved it in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> but just keep in mind that this product by itself didn&#x27;t really do too much.</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well for clearing up acne along my hair line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So you may have to use more than expected.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for my hair and didn&#x27;t strip the color</li>
            <li> I had been having problems with a very itchy scalp and it was causing a lot of hair breakage, too.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Like that this product doesn&#x27;t have a really noticeable smell.  </li>
            <li> Gentle to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 3 weeks and have had much improvement.  </li>
            <li> Her hair dresser also suggested a cheap deep conditioner</li>
            <li> I leave it on until I have applied to every section part of hair and after rubbing gently my scalp to remove the scalp flakes.  </li>
            <li> It leaves it super clean although it also makes it harder to detangle.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the other reviewers, I made sure to follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Definitely stopped the itching right after the first use.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special shampoo only exacerbated the problem.</li>
            <li> For those who are sensitive to scent, I would call this nearly fragrance-free; there is some scent, but it disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, just be aware it (like the TGEL) will dry your scalp, which can lead to itching....and perpetuate the problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed it helps my hand eczema (from using strong detergents such as [[ASIN:B007IX9RTC Dial 1423982 Purex Ultra Free and Clear Concentrated Liquid Detergent, 100oz Bottle, (Pack of 4)]]), if I leave the shampoo on my hands as long as I do on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time tonight, and my hair has not been this soft in MONTHS.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> It contains a high percentage of salicylic acid (3%) in a formula I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times but it definitely gives a very clean refreshing feel to my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am about half way through the bottle, washing my hair every other day, and have experienced the same results consistently.</li>
            <li> This really cleans my scalp like nothing else so far.</li>
            <li> I normal wash my hair maybe twice a week</li>
            <li> When you add it the second time it lathers VERY well :) there really is no smell at all</li>
            <li> I normally have an oily, itchy scalp with buildup, and I notice that I have no itching afer using the T/Sal for a month.</li>
            <li> So my husband started using it since he has normal hair and happens to have psoriasis which it states it helps.</li>
            <li> scalp is actually sun burnt right now</li>
            <li> i was very hopeful after reading all the positive reviews and followed the instructions for several weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find shampoos that are fragrance free and dye free!</li>
            <li> I had a variety of opinions but the major one is that there are too much oil from my head which also leads to my receding hairline and etc.  </li>
            <li> and it was very soft and wavy</li>
            <li> his scalp is clear!</li>
            <li> If this is just after one (following directions exactly) try, then I can&#x27;t wait to see results after one or two weeks.  </li>
            <li> for the first 2 weeks, then my hair went back to itching and</li>
            <li> After first use I noticed my curls came springing back to life</li>
            <li> I have very dry super curly hair.</li>
            <li> The lather is hard to work up, though, as I found I could only get it to lather enough (and feel like it was adhering to my hair and scalp instead of just lightly sitting on top)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a new shampoo that exfoliates the scalp (clear scalp &#x3D; healthier hair, faster growth).</li>
            <li> This is great to prevent dandruff during the winter months or when its cold out.  </li>
            <li> I scoured the web looking for something that would help clear this up.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clear it up 100%, but it did drastically reduce the severity of the condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it and immediately saw it clear up.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised to see how well T-Sal cleaned and how soft and light feeling my hair dried afterwards.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has severe eczema.</li>
            <li> I even started washing my hair only once a week in an attempt to not lose as much hair.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no heavy fragrance, either.</li>
            <li> Early this winter, my scalp fell apart.</li>
            <li> So far, a week has gone by and no itch...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I have to use this once a week.  </li>
            <li> It is much cheaper on Amazon than at our local stores.</li>
            <li> So far, this product is doing the job.</li>
            <li> my scalp was itching so INTENSELY and flaking constantly.</li>
            <li> So when I start to itch this is an instant remedy and an ABSOLUTE LIFE SAVER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and the area is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Followup:  After almost a year the psoriasis on my scalp has been completely eliminated with the help of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> T/Sal is nearly a miracle.</li>
            <li> So far this stuff has been working well.</li>
            <li> I had to order it from amazon because I could not find it in the storel but since starting it ,my scalp does not itch very often</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 47 year old guy, and have had problems with scalp pimples.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product so far.</li>
            <li> It has natural wave to it</li>
            <li> She removed some non malignant lesions this shampoo removed the rest.keeps scalp clear and free from dried skin.</li>
            <li> After months and months of trying to find a solution I decided to give this a try even though I thought it was quite expensive and yes, it did start to get better right away.</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair cut short in a great pixie.</li>
            <li> I probably have something more serious than scalp build-up.  </li>
            <li> It is half the price of many of the other products I tried.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but worth it because it does what it says it will do nearly overnight.</li>
            <li> IT WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the product&#x27;s a little pricey, instead of lathering twice with this shampoo, when I first get into the shower I wash my hair first with my regular shampoo, rinse it out, and then lather a second time with the Nutrogena T/Sal shampoo, using this device [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands that were supposed to be more natural, but this is the only one that always works.</li>
            <li> few months ago I discovered that [[ASIN:B005HO0AR2 Dove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Count]] had been the main cause of redness and intense itching on her skin, which doctors thought was atypical eczema.</li>
            <li> When I finished this shampoo, I started using Garnier Fructis Anti-Dandruff Clear Control Shampoo, 13-Fluid Ounce, with 3% Salicylic Acid, and only spend $5.29 here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair was left relatively soft and it helps control the oil on my scalp as well.</li>
            <li> Decreased All Scalp Itch and Most of Flakes.</li>
            <li> I found I could use it every day and my hair and scalp would tolerate it very well, but my HANDS started getting extremely dry and lost feeling in several patches (I thought i was going to lose my finger print).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have your normal dry dandruff.</li>
            <li> if I applied this as the second round of shampooing, using a different normal type of shampoo first.</li>
            <li> I lather it up, then let it sit for 2-3 minutes while attending to other areas, then gently rinse.  </li>
            <li> We have been trying to find a sensitive enough shampoo that actually cleaned her oily hair without increasing the flakes &amp; itching.</li>
            <li> I think if the shampoo doesn&#x27;t work well at first, then combine it with essential oils like tea tree oil, cedarwood oil, neem oil, karanja oil, peppermint oil, and other oils that fight fungus and balances sebum of the scalp like ylang ylang essential oil.</li>
            <li> Cleared up head acne pretty quickly, not 100% but enough to see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Because her hair is so dark the flakes showed up really well.</li>
            <li> Apparently when the residues mix, they leave red stains in the tub.</li>
            <li> so greasy hair may be my cross to bare.</li>
            <li> I work out everyday and live in hot/humid New Orleans,</li>
            <li> I do involves a ridiculous amount of product layering and damage for days done to my hair and this shampoo will leave my locks squeaky clean every time.</li>
            <li> Had some scalp issues and it really fixed the dry flakiness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel dry and my hair is soft after shampooing.</li>
            <li> AND...for the first time in TEN years, I actually see a majority of a pink scalp rather than a white, dry, flaky scalp all over.  </li>
            <li> I like having a little tingle and this shampoo really has no tingle.  </li>
            <li> think the price on here is a little much for what you get though.</li>
            <li> (her hair is very, very thick) and our scalps stay itch free all day.  </li>
            <li> it left my hands pretty dry and itchy, but that&#x27;s nothing a little lotion can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I use it for scalp acne, based on the advice of the Internet and the fact that facial cleansers that clear up acne also employ salicylic acid as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Also like it a lot because your hair stays soft and silky unlike other medicated shampoos.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference in my itchy scalp or dandruff</li>
            <li> I have seborrhoeic dermatitis and have found that the active ingredient in this doesn&#x27;t work as well for me and that this isn&#x27;t worth the money for such a small container.</li>
            <li> For over 10 years, I have suffered from extremely dry scalp and scalp acne to the point to where I was constantly scratching my scalp so much that it would be raw and bleed</li>
            <li> While the infection is long gone, and my scalp is almost healed, I am left with the detritus.  </li>
            <li> One use of the T/Sal Shampoo I didn&#x27;t automatically see a difference until I straightened it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> After regular use of product, my scalp did not clear up at all.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day on my hair and it has helped to clear up some of my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena simply the best!&lt;br /&gt;After chemically treating my hair for a long time, my scalp needed help!</li>
            <li> I have very long blonde color treated hair.</li>
            <li> My two-year old toddler has suffered from bad scalp eczema for most of her life, with scaly itchy lesions that she would scratch to the point of bleeding.</li>
            <li> I figured after air drying, that my hair would be unmanageable &amp; dry because I did not use conditioner (I have very coarse, frizzy, wavy hair).  </li>
            <li> Several members of my household have dry skin issues which can result in dandruff during the fall and winter season.</li>
            <li> Yes my scalp has less buildup, but it has not vanished completely.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a big deal since I don&#x27;t use it every single day.</li>
            <li> and I noticed it did not take as long to flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> On the contrary, it dried soft to the touch</li>
            <li> With long hair, I felt like I couldn&#x27;t escape the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If it were not for Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo I would have clawed my scalp to shreds long ago.</li>
            <li> T/Sal has long been and will remain a staple in my shampoo assortment.  </li>
            <li> As long as it does the job, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I had tried T/Sal a long time ago without any adverse effects.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping the negative results are just an initial reaction to new treatment.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using it for the same purpose as me, just keep in mind that it is not a quick fix and will likely require weeks before results are noticeable!</li>
            <li> Plus, not only was my hair soft, it straightened in half the time, AND there were less split ends.</li>
            <li> so I bought it, but I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for the last 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I was browsing my local pharmacy the other day and came across the T-Sal Scalp Build-Up Control Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and now i switched to every other day, because the bottle is SO tiny</li>
            <li> initially bought both the T/Sal and T/Gel, so I used the T/Gel last night, and I notice I have a little itching today.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;ll likely give other products a try.  </li>
            <li> Further, after a day of washing, my scalp got extremely oily-</li>
            <li> Its not a big bottle, but you only use a little bit.  </li>
            <li> and I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> Besides the flakes, I&#x27;ve always struggled to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t ridiculously dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena needs to label this for dry scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Someone else posted that it is dry.</li>
            <li> Not even remotely dry either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of moisturizing, dry scalp saving products and none compare to this one.</li>
            <li> I tried Nioxin, and all it did was burn my scalp and make my hair feel dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Not something I would recommend unless you have really dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> We swapped to \\&quot;dry scalp\\&quot; shampoo-still nothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Walgreens has the same product with the same amount of active ingredient for half the price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for people with oily dandruff, when you find that moisturizing anti-dandruff shampoos only make your scalp worse.</li>
            <li> Her scalp cleared up in less than a week, and although she isn&#x27;t cured - it comes back if I don&#x27;t use it on her -  </li>
            <li> I thought her curly hair would be a dry frizzy mess but was surprised when it dried</li>
            <li> Its not as bubbly as the T-gel and the scent is very dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Neutrogena clarifying shampoo and it just left my hair limp and dry.</li>
            <li> I started only shampooing every other day or so, but I found that it just resulted in having super dry hair for a day and then progressively clumpier and dirty hair until I shampooed again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it leaves my hair feeling clean but not dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s 3% salicylic acid, though, so you have to be careful with it.</li>
            <li> I never really stopped using this product</li>
            <li> There is really no fragrance to it that I can recall.</li>
            <li> However, I will use it until the bottle is empty, and if results change, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> All I had to do was wet my sectioned hair and scalp and apply a dime-size amount of the shampoo and lather.</li>
            <li> wondered if the detergent (surfuctant) base in most baby shampoos could be triggering a similar response.</li>
            <li> I very badly want to leave this product a good review, but in the interest of honesty, here goes...</li>
            <li> Other brands have the same active ingredient for much less.</li>
            <li> Instead, my scalp became very very dry!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great for color-treated hair, but as long as it&#x27;s used only occasionally, like once a week or every once in a while, and in conjunction with conditioner, then it isn&#x27;t too drying.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cure my dandruff nearly as well at Nizoral did, and the smell is pretty bad (smells like detergent).</li>
            <li> My daughter has Native American heritage from her father&#x27;s side, so she has extremely dark, course, heavy hair.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well.</li>
            <li> (i have frizz and extreme curls).</li>
            <li> it stung where I was affected by scalp pimples, but other than that no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> No more white flaking on my shirts!    </li>
            <li> T Sal makes my hair softer than my other anti dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> No burning, itching, or other adverse effects.  </li>
            <li> Both shampoos have worked well on my other children who sometimes get cradle cap as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is the small size.</li>
            <li> I use this product about every other day and its been 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> We think it is due to the medication he is on.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this shampoo for my seborrheic dermatitis (along with other scalp treatments).</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is 3% Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li> I will update my review after I&#x27;ve used the bottle, but I already prefer the T/Sal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after using the T/Gel for a few weeks, I do not have itching, but I have a dry, flaky scalp, which I did not have before.</li>
            <li> my scalp is flake free, and it was getting really bad and itchy.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked and I would cry as all hope would wash down the drain with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually I have curls that refuse to straighten and this time every single strand straightened.</li>
            <li> After a week of use with this product, my scalp was less flaky and itchy, and guess what, when I tested this product&#x27;s pH, it laid somewhere between 4 and 5.</li>
            <li> (I have slightly oily hair).</li>
            <li> Seriously, this shampoo WORKS, especially if you lather/let sit/rinse/repeat but just one wash will do.</li>
            <li> even I used the half of the bottle...</li>
            <li> I guess I can say I have seen a slight improvement in my scalp acne.</li>
            <li> I am half way through the bottle and still have problems with my scalp.</li>
            <li> After being off of Accutane for a year, my scalp resumed the odd crusty itchy oily flaking it had before the meds.</li>
            <li> Finally, after serious research, I decided to try T/Sal.</li>
            <li> but I live in the tundra of dry, cold weather with a tendency toward normal/dry skin</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;ve been using it and giving it a chance, at least until I am done with this entire (small) bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been losing hair since a few months and i suspect that I have either Scalp Psoriasis or Seborrheic Dermatitis.</li>
            <li> and we tried a few.</li>
            <li> Will update after using for a few weeks to inform you folks about the effect on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I started using it everyday</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised when I looked in the mirror today and realized that I was having a difficult time seeing the lesion.  </li>
            <li> but I lost a few hairs in the process and while lathering  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have tons of harsh chemicals in it and it doesn&#x27;t cause scalp or skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use (instead of almost everyday) to see it it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> You use it as a shampoo and leave it on your head for a few mins.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of previous products and this works!</li>
            <li> After countless years of suffering with seborrheic dermatitis and trying every remedy including oral medication, expensive steroid creams, lotions, oils, and other shampoos, I purchased this product with 3% salicylic acid along with a Scalpmaster shampoo brush for my husband (who is a physician...</li>
            <li> After having done this for some time, the amount of scalp acne I&#x27;ve had has significantly decreased (it&#x27;s not completely gone, however).  </li>
            <li> My scalp felt raw and in places looked reddened with discomfort.</li>
            <li> It took the size down but stuff was still growing and by growing, I mean to the size of a dime.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and thick curly hair that I have to wash at least every other day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a small area of what I think is psoriasis on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> During the past two years I&#x27;ve been struggling with some scalp build up problems</li>
            <li> I knew dandruff shampoos were sometimes recommended for cradle cap in babies, so I tried a small amount (quarter size) of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The size is a bit small.  </li>
            <li> USED IN THE PAST</li>
            <li> So many of them, and so disgustingly visible!</li>
            <li> No more itchiness or oily hair.  </li>
            <li> I followed up with my usual conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had had occasional dandruff in winters past, but this was by far the worst.</li>
            <li> It can be a little tough so</li>
            <li> I had such bad dandruff that I could not even wear a black shirt.  </li>
            <li> Tea tree oil works, but it smells and its hard to put it into your shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have this terrible scaly dead skin build up following an infection on several areas of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product for that it made my sons hair look like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using T Sal for at least a decade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I leave this product in for at least 5 minutes while in the shower before rinsing it off.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo, which would not lather at all and left my hair a bit dirty feeling, did nothing for my itching.  </li>
            <li> Leave the shampoo on for at least 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use the Scalpmaster Shampoo brush in the shower with this shampoo, and the problem is slowly going away.  </li>
            <li> no more!</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed was that it is difficult to rinse off this shampoo, compared to all other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> No more itching for me!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this turned out to be totally the wrong choice in products.  </li>
            <li> As a teenager this was a serious self confidence issue.</li>
            <li> No problems with dandruff or flakey scalp, but for the last three years I&#x27;ve had intermittent problems with painful pimples on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> but it is the one thing that will help scalp build up or dandruff almost immediately so its worth the nasty smell.</li>
            <li> In terms of the smell I don&#x27;t really like it, but it&#x27;s nothing intolerable or disgusting.</li>
            <li> The itchiness was driving me insane and because my scalp is oily, normal dandruff shampoo made it worse.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, about 150 dollars through the doc, 8 dollar shampoo did the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually its horrible</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was embarrassed.</li>
            <li> So be wary of the conditioner you buy.</li>
            <li> Seriously you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t rate this with 5 stars is that maybe I haven&#x27;t seen very dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Gone is the mad itch I have.  </li>
            <li> flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the dermatologist who suggested the tea tree shampoo which is very expensive on Amazon, so I bought it at a retail location called ulta.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell bad but feels like it works.</li>
            <li> It looked really bad too.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t too bad though.</li>
            <li> It smells bad</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not working :(</li>
            <li> Con&#x27;s  Stripped semi-permanent color off my grays :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried head and shoulders, tar shampoo and hated the smell.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> YUK just the worst.</li>
            <li> Just the worst.</li>
            <li> Every year like clockwork, it seems as if I get terrible dandruff.</li>
            <li> This year was no exception, but this year I got terrible scalp acne in addition to the dandruff.</li>
            <li> My scalp hurt, itched, and looked terrible all at once.</li>
            <li> She started noticing terrible flaking at her crown and her hairdresser said it looked like build-up of some sort.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, arrived quickly and works better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;It works best for itching and flakey scalp&lt;br /&gt;Better than head &amp; shoulders&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shampoo&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a bit more money than the others</li>
            <li> This really cleans my scalp like nothing else so far.</li>
            <li> I have been losing hair since a few months and i suspect that I have either Scalp Psoriasis or Seborrheic Dermatitis. I bought this shampoo after trying a few home made remedies for my itchy and flaky scalp and this shampoo has been very helpful in releiving the symptoms. I definitely recommend this over the counter medicated shampoo.</li>
            <li> My Dr, ordered me to use this shampoo. I have and it works wonderfully. The itchies are gone. My hair is now filling out again. This is a wonderful problem solver.</li>
            <li> I have very dry super curly hair. I get build up on my scalp whenever i use &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoo/conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using apple cider vinegar to treat this but it doesn&#x27;t always work for me.  After the FIRST use, this shampoo cleared up my scalp. It&#x27;s squeaky clean with no weird off-white build up! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also no smell! I&#x27;ve tried head and shoulders, tar shampoo and hated the smell.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is fragrance free. I love it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner but I use my ACV/Water spray as a conditioner after this shampoo. Works wonders, super soft curly hair with clean scalp :)</li>
            <li> I like this product, but the cost is too much. The scent is not over powering and the liquid has a nice consistency.  The active ingredient is 3% Salicylic Acid. Other brands have the same active ingredient for much less. When I finished this shampoo, I started using Garnier Fructis Anti-Dandruff Clear Control Shampoo, 13-Fluid Ounce, with 3% Salicylic Acid, and only spend $5.29 here on Amazon. Neutrogena  makes great products, but there are other options.</li>
            <li> I had a beautician friend recommend this for an itchy scalp.  It is a wonderful product and I don&#x27;t know how I managed without it.  My itchy scalp has disappeared.  Would recommend the Neutrogena T-Gel or Denorex for dandruff.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have itchy scalps, combined with oily skin.  Our hair comes out looking great (her hair is very, very thick) and our scalps stay itch free all day.  It doesn&#x27;t get as oily, either.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this so I bought it, but I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for the last 3 weeks and it&#x27;s not working :( still have a ton of flakes. Agree with all the other reviews that it smells nice and seems good for my hair, but it really does nothing for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought three different shampoos looking for help for my teenage son&#x27;s oily hair with dandruff.  This one does the job.  It makes a real and noticable difference.  It certainly helps greatly with dandruff.  That&#x27;s now gone from his head.  The oily hair is helped by this shampoo some as well, although no revolution on that front.  Still, the best thing I found out there and we tried a few.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has severe eczema. We have been trying to find a sensitive enough shampoo that actually cleaned her oily hair without increasing the flakes &amp; itching. This is it! I&#x27;m beyond happy we have found something that works well for her.</li>
            <li> I have scalp buildup from products and some dandruff. I have been searching for a product to help with this concerns and this product did the trick. I am so glad I ordered it. It is half the price of many of the other products I tried. I highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Havent moticed the difference. i was very hopeful after reading all the positive reviews and followed the instructions for several weeks. no changes i dont think.</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair cut short in a great pixie. I love my hair but my scalp is another matter altogether.  I have this terrible scaly dead skin build up following an infection on several areas of my scalp.  While the infection is long gone, and my scalp is almost healed, I am left with the detritus.  I scoured the web looking for something that would help clear this up.  My stylist uses tea tree oil on me whenever I go for a trim, but that can easily be overdone.  I looked at Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel shampoo but really didn&#x27;t think it would fit the bill.  Then I noticed T-Sal.  This seemed a good fit, the price was reasonable, so I ordered a bottle.  I was expecting to need some sort of conditioning cream post shampoo, but I am very happy to report that T-Sal left my coarse, thick hair soft and silky smooth!  Imagine my surprise!  And from a medicinal shampoo!  There&#x27;s no fragrance, and there&#x27;s no doubt about it:  even if this doesn&#x27;t work on my scalp I am going to keep using it because I like the results on my hair SO MUCH!  Will update after using for a few weeks to inform you folks about the effect on my scalp.  But I say try this in the meantime.  Don&#x27;t wait for me!</li>
            <li> No problems with dandruff or flakey scalp, but for the last three years I&#x27;ve had intermittent problems with painful pimples on my scalp.  I believe, like another reviewer here, that the condition is called \\&quot;scalp acne.\\&quot;  The breakouts occur mostly on the back of my head, and I&#x27;ve tried about every topical treatment out there without success.  I kept reading online that shampoo containing salicylic acid was an effective treatment for this condition, so I found this product on Amazon, gave it a try, AND IT WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the product&#x27;s a little pricey, instead of lathering twice with this shampoo, when I first get into the shower I wash my hair first with my regular shampoo, rinse it out, and then lather a second time with the Nutrogena T/Sal shampoo, using this device [[ASIN:B0001I8ZT4 Marvy Shampoo Brush Flinn Scalp]] to massage it into my scalp.  I let the T/Sal lather remain on my hair/scalp to \\&quot;do its thing\\&quot; while if finish my shower - four or five minutes - then rinse it off and finish with my regular conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first week I followed this procedure every day, then after that about three times a week.  In 3-1/2 week&#x27;s time the pimples on my head are GONE and there have been no further outbreaks.  It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li> For over 10 years, I have suffered from extremely dry scalp and scalp acne to the point to where I was constantly scratching my scalp so much that it would be raw and bleed and I started losing my hair quickly.  I tried many over the counter medicated shampoos, organic all-natural shampoos, I went to the dermatologist and tried medicated shampoos and I even tried home remedies such as tea tree oil, neem oil and apple cider vinegar rinse.  Nothing worked and I would cry as all hope would wash down the drain with my hair.  I even started washing my hair only once a week in an attempt to not lose as much hair.  I was browsing my local pharmacy the other day and came across the T-Sal Scalp Build-Up Control Shampoo.  I figured \\&quot;what do I have to lose but $7?\\&quot;  The first time I tried it, I will be honest and say I did not follow the directions exactly as stated on the bottle and because of that, I did not get the results I expected.  A week later (today) I tried it again and using some suggestions from fellow reviewers on here, I followed the directions exactly...I lathered it on my hair and left it in for FIVE minutes. Then I rinsed and lathered again and left it on for another FIVE minutes.  I noticed that the second lather foamed up a lot more and I believe it&#x27;s because the first application removed the build-up and the second lather did it&#x27;s \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; purposes.  I did not condition my hair.  I noticed that I did not lose as much hair in this wash.  I figured after air drying, that my hair would be unmanageable &amp; dry because I did not use conditioner (I have very coarse, frizzy, wavy hair).  On the contrary, it dried soft to the touch and I noticed it did not take as long to flat iron my hair. AND...for the first time in TEN years, I actually see a majority of a pink scalp rather than a white, dry, flaky scalp all over.  And I am not itching nearly as much I do on a daily basis.  If this is just after one (following directions exactly) try, then I can&#x27;t wait to see results after one or two weeks.  I truly believe that after all these years, my scalp problem is a result of over processed hair and the use of chemical-ridden hair products and all I needed was a shampoo to help rid my scalp of that build-up.  TRY THIS...it&#x27;s worth it!  (P.S. the acne is only at the nape of my neck, under my hair...I did not notice any relief from this shampoo, but I am now targeting that area with acne medication).</li>
            <li> I am on day 4 of use, I dont really see a difference yet, scalp is still itchy with flakes. Will keep using and let you know.</li>
            <li> This product cleans my scalp super well. Seriously you will not be disappointed. Great size for travel and a deep clean.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product. Had some scalp issues and it really fixed the dry flakiness. Make sure you follow directions!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend at all! After regular use of product, my scalp did not clear up at all. Instead, my scalp became very very dry!</li>
            <li> Cleared up head acne pretty quickly, not 100% but enough to see a noticeable difference. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but you see the results.</li>
            <li> My husband used the product once and it took care of the patch of psoriasis on the back of his scalp. There&#x27;s no heavy fragrance, either.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff to combat a pretty severe case of dandruff that started to develop about a year ago. The product is relatively effective at treating flakes. It didn&#x27;t clear it up 100%, but it did drastically reduce the severity of the condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really love about this product is how great of a shampoo it is. Besides the flakes, I&#x27;ve always struggled to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t ridiculously dry out my hair. I started only shampooing every other day or so, but I found that it just resulted in having super dry hair for a day and then progressively clumpier and dirty hair until I shampooed again. This stuff leaves your hair clean feeling, smooth, REALLY shiny without drying at ALL. It&#x27;s like what you would expect from a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner except 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioners always really suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 3% salicylic acid, though, so you have to be careful with it. I found I could use it every day and my hair and scalp would tolerate it very well, but my HANDS started getting extremely dry and lost feeling in several patches (I thought i was going to lose my finger print). So, I would suggest washing your hands THOROUGHLY after using it and applying a good moisturizer. You could probably stop the acid reaction by rinsing your hands with baking soda water as well, but it isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Amazing as a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;-Treats flakes/dandruff pretty effectively, but condition returns after not using for 1-2 days.&lt;br /&gt;-Can demolish your hands/palms, so take caution in using regularly.&lt;br /&gt;-Much more effective than zinc pyrithione treatments for me. Cannot comment on effectiveness compared to selenium sulfide (Selsun) or ketaconazole (Nizoral).&lt;br /&gt;-Smells very, very neutral, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This is great to prevent dandruff during the winter months or when its cold out.  And it also cleanses the scalp if there is build up from beauty products or cheap shampoos or conditioners. It moisturizes scalp so its not itchy or flaky or dry and it looks good.</li>
            <li> Definitely stopped the itching right after the first use. The lather is hard to work up, though, as I found I could only get it to lather enough (and feel like it was adhering to my hair and scalp instead of just lightly sitting on top) if I applied this as the second round of shampooing, using a different normal type of shampoo first.</li>
            <li> Several members of my household have dry skin issues which can result in dandruff during the fall and winter season. This stuff, used about twice a week, has been taking care of the problem. The only thing that I would recommend is make sure you adequately rinse the tub if you are using this and someone else in your house is using the T/Gel. Apparently when the residues mix, they leave red stains in the tub. These are easily removeable, but just an FYI.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild scalp acne for a while now, and I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure which shampoo at the drugstore would help me. Since this was the only one that seem to address skin buildup, and didn&#x27;t call it dandruff, I decided to try it out.   Meanwhile, after doing some research (through reputable sources, pubmed.gov), I learned the pH of skin should be between 4-5 and I also learned most shampoos, conditioners, face washes and body washes are around 6. So I bought pH strips and began testing my products. And it was true; they were all around pH 6-7.  After a week of use with this product, my scalp was less flaky and itchy, and guess what, when I tested this product&#x27;s pH, it laid somewhere between 4 and 5. I now use it as a body wash and face wash, and my skins seems to be responding well. It&#x27;s nice to just have one product do the job of three!</li>
            <li> My husband has severe psoriasis, and this is the only product on the market that works for him. T/Gel and the knockoffs just aren&#x27;t strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> I tried it 3 times. It made my hair so oily there is no way I can continue to use it. Neutrogena needs to label this for dry scalp. I will give it 3 stars because it helped with my scalp itchiness, but a product that also helps with itching and is more formulated for oily hair is Selsun Blue Naturals Shampoo. For those who are sensitive to scent, I would call this nearly fragrance-free; there is some scent, but it disappears quickly.  I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> it is good for hair growth when I stop using t/sal my hair will fall out and look bald.</li>
            <li> Early this winter, my scalp fell apart. I had had occasional dandruff in winters past, but this was by far the worst. My scalp felt raw and in places looked reddened with discomfort. I also for the first time, had mild psoriasis. Basic dandruff shampoo like Head &amp; Shoulders didn&#x27;t even make a bit of improvement. So I started experimenting with the more \\&quot;hardcore\\&quot; dandruff and psoriasis shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;First I tried the Coal Tar shampoo, which began healing my scalp but made me smell like a medicine cabinet at a nursing home. With long hair, I felt like I couldn&#x27;t escape the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up trying this product and enjoy it much more than the coal tar. My doctor said either product was fine for me to use, but the scent of this one is mild; and within two months, my dandruff and psoriasis was all but gone. Now I use it for maintenance twice a week.</li>
            <li> It gave me the impression that my scalp was been treated as it should to prevent dandruff. It smells like remedy. However, no so sure if it was really really effected in my case. Perhaps I should use it more.</li>
            <li> Simply clean with no residue. Neutrogena really is the best and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Try it, and you will see results the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> Not only does T/Sal reduce flakes and itching from psoriasis, but it moisturizes and conditions my hair without affecting my highlights.</li>
            <li> I have seborrhoeic dermatitis and have found that the active ingredient in this doesn&#x27;t work as well for me and that this isn&#x27;t worth the money for such a small container.</li>
            <li> Very Light shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Effective so far&lt;br /&gt;Will wait for it to show longer lasting results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But quite mild and you may have to use another shampoo for reducing dryness or damage</li>
            <li> It works extremely well. I don&#x27;t feel dry and my hair is soft after shampooing.</li>
            <li> This product works great for targeting dandruff issues. You don&#x27;t get much in a bottle, and need to shampoo twice per shower with it to get the maximum effect, but worth it because it works so well.</li>
            <li> OK, I am re-writing my previously positive review. This product was great... for the first 2 weeks, then my hair went back to itching and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the dermatologist who suggested the tea tree shampoo which is very expensive on Amazon, so I bought it at a retail location called ulta. So far, a week has gone by and no itch... If I don&#x27;t re-review this by October, 2012, it means that the tea tree shampoo worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best with your flaking, peeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It is September 2013 now and I can safely say that the itch and flakes are completely gone with the tea tree shampoo. I do a good scrub on my hair and my face and I&#x27;m no longer suffering. The brand I buy is Paul Mitchel&#x27;s which they do sell on Amazon. I now just buy it at regular hair salons; I basically call around to see where it is the cheapest and get the biggest bottle they have.</li>
            <li> So far my experience with T/Sal has been really good.  I alternate it with T/Gel.  Between the two it really drops the banhammer on dandruff.  I had such bad dandruff that I could not even wear a black shirt.  Now I can and will only see one or two flakes here and there.  That is pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it to be ineffective on my seborrheic dermatitis.  i need to use something else for that.  But for dandruff...awesome.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does the best job at controlling the build-up of plaques from psoriasis and removing the greasy medications I have to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a month ago and for the most part 90% of my scalp acne is gone.I have very long blonde color treated hair. Even though it is highlighted my hair still gets greasy very fast. I saw in some reviews that this helped cut the grease. That certainly was not the case for me. I would not say my hair is greasier, but it definitely did nothing to stop the grease. I work out everyday and live in hot/humid New Orleans, so greasy hair may be my cross to bare. I started using it everyday and now i switched to every other day, because the bottle is SO tiny and I have very long hair. The only lasted me a month. I am going to buy another bottle, because my scalp acne is gone and it was bothered me most. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tangled my hair something fierce. I had to use a really good conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> good product. just wasn&#x27;t quite what I needed but I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is miraculous! Thanks to the other reviewers, I made sure to follow the directions. After 1 shoer (2 washes)  my scalp is flake free, and it was getting really bad and itchy. no more! I think I had seborrheic dermatitis, just so you know that it is effective for that particular ailment:)</li>
            <li> for psoriasis scales build up, this is the best product to deal with it.  Psoriasis is gone but still use it as a prevention method and it works wonders.  Also like it a lot because your hair stays soft and silky unlike other medicated shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had mild issues with dandruff over the years, but my scalp does tend to build-up easily. I normal wash my hair maybe twice a week so the products I put in my hair tend to build up over the week. I have tried the Neutrogena clarifying shampoo and it just left my hair limp and dry. One use of the T/Sal Shampoo I didn&#x27;t automatically see a difference until I straightened it with a flat iron. I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO WASH MY HAIR. My hair was silky, smooth, and strong it took a fraction of the time and effort to get my hair pin straight. Usually I have curls that refuse to straighten and this time every single strand straightened. You would think I had naturally straight hair (i have frizz and extreme curls). My scalp and hair feel amazing. This is definitely worth a try even if you don&#x27;t suffer from the scalp conditions. I will forever have the product in my regime.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I have to use this once a week.  It works as described.  It is much cheaper on Amazon than at our local stores.</li>
            <li> After countless years of suffering with seborrheic dermatitis and trying every remedy including oral medication, expensive steroid creams, lotions, oils, and other shampoos, I purchased this product with 3% salicylic acid along with a Scalpmaster shampoo brush for my husband (who is a physician...BTW) and PRESTO...his scalp is clear! The stronger 3% product must have done the trick as the weaker product didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this.  Uses by rotating daily t-sal, t-gel, and zinc shampoo, a a different one each day, then starts cycle over. Has cleared up his scalp problems.</li>
            <li> Had to find a replacement for Sebulex Shampoo, which in the infinite wisdom of the manufacturer, decided to quit producing. So far, this product is doing the job.</li>
            <li> this shampoo works great for my problem scalp . I have always liked Neutrogena products. it dose all that it says</li>
            <li> Before I discovered T/Sal Shampoo my scalp was itching so INTENSELY and flaking constantly. I have oily skin, and thick curly hair that I have to wash at least every other day or it gets too greasy. I try to alternate between hard-water build-up removing shampoo with my regular shampoo, Although, alternating products doesn&#x27;t always keep the itch away. After first use I noticed my curls came springing back to life and my hair was much more voluminous. It does kind of fade my color but it&#x27;s not a big deal since I don&#x27;t use it every single day. So when I start to itch this is an instant remedy and an ABSOLUTE LIFE SAVER. If it were not for Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo I would have clawed my scalp to shreds long ago.</li>
            <li> T/Sal Shampoo has soothed my scalp itch, smells OK, and was delivered timely.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo. In the winter scalp can get dry &amp; itchy, this so far is working nicely. Smell is fine - to me almost nonexistent. But it solved the dryness and itch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a small area of what I think is psoriasis on my scalp.  I&#x27;ve been fighting with it for about 5 years, and over time it&#x27;s gone from about the diameter of a pencil eraser to the diameter of my thumbnail.  I had a doctor look at it once, and he \\&quot;froze\\&quot; it with liquid nitrogen and it reduced the size for about a year, but came back.  It bleeds fairly easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try a medicated shampoo and, after reading the reviews decided to try T/Sal.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and the area is almost completely gone.  I was extremely surprised when I looked in the mirror today and realized that I was having a difficult time seeing the lesion.  It&#x27;s disappeared enough so that I almost can&#x27;t feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followup:  After almost a year the psoriasis on my scalp has been completely eliminated with the help of this shampoo.  I used it for about 2 months and then switched back to my regular shampoo, and there&#x27;s been no sign of the problem.  If it ever flairs back up, I&#x27;ll uses the T/Sal shampoo again to get it under control.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo for my hair. It leaves it super clean although it also makes it harder to detangle. The reason I didn&#x27;t rate this with 5 stars is that maybe I haven&#x27;t seen very dramatic results. Yes my scalp has less buildup, but it has not vanished completely. It&#x27;s great that it comes without fragrance, and it does smell nice anyway.</li>
            <li> Helps with scalp problems and leaves hair clean and manageable. T/Sal has long been and will remain a staple in my shampoo assortment.  Neutrogena is still a great brand.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product worth the money</li>
            <li> I always buy this from the store but it is a better value on here. I bought this on advice from my doctor and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Just doesn&#x27;t lather very well so I mix with another shampoo.</li>
            <li> T/Sal is nearly a miracle. I used it today, and when washing my scalp felt clean and I didn&#x27;t use conditioner because my hair was smooth. I have problems with scalp acne and dandruff, and my hair is very oily.Using H&amp;S I didn&#x27;t get relief for either problem and this worked well but I lost a few hairs in the process and while lathering  it stung where I was affected by scalp pimples, but other than that no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> Ive struggled with flakes and oily scalp for years; this is the only product that has seemed to work with my issues. I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times but it definitely gives a very clean refreshing feel to my hair and scalp. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference in my itchy scalp or dandruff BUT I wanted to say I noticed people complain about this not lathering well but if you read the directions it lets you know you must rub this into your scalp wait a minute or two then rinse and add the shampoo on once more.  When you add it the second time it lathers VERY well :) there really is no smell at all and I love that it has salicylic acid because my face is very acne prone so I don&#x27;t have to worry about this getting on my face when washing my hair because I know it wont do any damage :)</li>
            <li> There are some reviews you just need to leave. I was having severe acne on the side of my head. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing it. I already have thinning hair so seeing the huge bumps were not the most attractive things. I waited 3 weeks to get into one of the best dermatologists in the city. They gave me a topical ointment that didn&#x27;t do a thing. I went back and he shot a steroid in there. It took the size down but stuff was still growing and by growing, I mean to the size of a dime.They were huge and not going away. I do sports and sweat a lot so I was worried that was the factor. He however recommended something with salisilic acid in it. I figured why not. I used it and immediately saw it clear up. I still have the occasional bump but nothing severe. I have even taken pills which didn&#x27;t help. Needless to say, about 150 dollars through the doc, 8 dollar shampoo did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone else posted that it is dry. Well it has to be given the nature of the product however you should only use it twice a week as it is so it doesn&#x27;t cause you to get flaky. Plus you can always use a safe conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps others!</li>
            <li> Pert plus dandruff controls is the best I&#x27;ve found, I didn&#x27;t really notice any scalp improvement from this t-sal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure this is working for me. The jury is still out on this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell of this... at all. Actually its horrible but it is the one thing that will help scalp build up or dandruff almost immediately so its worth the nasty smell.</li>
            <li> We used this for a while, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help as much as regular Tea Tree Oil shampoo.  I like having a little tingle and this shampoo really has no tingle.  Maybe I should have bought a second bottle, but since I saw no results with the first one, I went back to my usual Tea Tree shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me. I normally have an oily, itchy scalp with buildup, and I notice that I have no itching afer using the T/Sal for a month. I wash first with Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree shampoo, then wash once with T/Sal (leaving on for several minutes), then condition with Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought both the T/Sal and T/Gel, so I used the T/Gel last night, and I notice I have a little itching today. I will update my review after I&#x27;ve used the bottle, but I already prefer the T/Sal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after using the T/Gel for a few weeks, I do not have itching, but I have a dry, flaky scalp, which I did not have before. I will gladly be switching back to T/Sal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and I love it. It contains a high percentage of salicylic acid (3%) in a formula I like. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it leaves my hair feeling clean but not dry (I have slightly oily hair). Also, as a side note, when I am off carbs and sugar, I don&#x27;t need this shampoo as much. I think that Candida (systemic yeast) is a big part of me having scalp buildup and flakes.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a new shampoo that exfoliates the scalp (clear scalp &#x3D; healthier hair, faster growth). Used it for the first time tonight, and my hair has not been this soft in MONTHS. Not even remotely dry either and I did not use conditioner (tends to clog pores). Definitely going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS ALRIGHT, BUT NOTHING GREAT. I WON&#x27;T BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Not bad, just be aware it (like the TGEL) will dry your scalp, which can lead to itching....and perpetuate the problem. Oh, well...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of moisturizing, dry scalp saving products and none compare to this one. I don&#x27;t color my hair so it can get oily but I live in the tundra of dry, cold weather with a tendency toward normal/dry skin so I&#x27;m presented with the challenge of discovering good, dry scalp savers. Look no further! Seriously, this shampoo WORKS, especially if you lather/let sit/rinse/repeat but just one wash will do. This shampoo also works miracles for product build-up or the occasions where one may find peanut butter/glue/whatever stuck in their precious locks. Almost every photo shoot I do involves a ridiculous amount of product layering and damage for days done to my hair and this shampoo will leave my locks squeaky clean every time. You can opt to follow with a conditioner or go without; it works either way.</li>
            <li> So far this stuff has been working well. As long as it does the job, I&#x27;ll continue to use it. However, I will look locally for lower prices.</li>
            <li> It embarrassing to admit that I recently got cradle cap.  Yeah.  I thought only babies get it.  Well, my hope was dashed after using this product for over two weeks without any changes in my dandruff-creating condition.  Well, it&#x27;s time to go see a dermatologist for me.  I probably have something more serious than scalp build-up.  One thing I noticed was that it is difficult to rinse off this shampoo, compared to all other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works great on my hair and no more dandruff.  I am buying more.  You will want more too!</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s  Love that there is no harsh smell!  Worked within 3 uses!  No more itching for me!  No more white flaking on my shirts!    Con&#x27;s  Stripped semi-permanent color off my grays :(</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use this for my inverse psoriasis to help reduce the inflammation and itchiness to my skin. I was surprised with how quickly it relieved my skin. I use it as a body wash and it is now part of my daily regimen and keeps my psoriasis at bay. I would recommend the clear scentless bottle as the dark t-sal does not smell very good.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me even I used the half of the bottle... My head is still itch which was my primary problem.</li>
            <li> The hair cuttery girl said my hair was really smooth and nice for a guy. Controls my dandruff well too. Definitely agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the size of the bottle is pretty small.</li>
            <li> recommended by dermatologist</li>
            <li> good product and price</li>
            <li> T Sal makes my hair softer than my other anti dandruff shampoo. I would definetly recommend this product. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This shampoo definitely cleans your head but I needed something medicated for a reason and it hasnt helped with what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Dermotologist recomended this for me. It keeps the dandruff away and leaves your hair clean</li>
            <li> During the past two years I&#x27;ve been struggling with some scalp build up problems and I pretty much have purchased all the drugstore products I could find to solve this. After months and months of trying to find a solution I decided to give this a try even though I thought it was quite expensive and yes, it did start to get better right away. However, it wasn&#x27;t as quick of a process as I wanted it to be so I decided to buy Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength and use it combined with this and this combination REALLY solved it in a matter of days. Since I&#x27;ve done that I haven&#x27;t had any problems, my scalp is super clear and I couldn&#x27;t be any more please. I never really stopped using this product and I don&#x27;t plan on doing it but just keep in mind that this product by itself didn&#x27;t really do too much. In terms of the smell I don&#x27;t really like it, but it&#x27;s nothing intolerable or disgusting.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to aleive my scalp build up so that my hair will grow out again.  I tried Nioxin, and all it did was burn my scalp and make my hair feel dry and brittle.  I had tried T/Sal a long time ago without any adverse effects.  I went back to it, and I&#x27;m STILL in love with it!  No burning, itching, or other adverse effects.  (It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair either!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is actually sun burnt right now and it didn&#x27;t even agitate the burn when I applied it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I use it on my young son who has a mild case of psoriasis on his scalp and behind his ears. It smells so much better than the T-Gel Coal Tar shampoo, but I like to switch back and forth between the two (as recommended by a dermatologist) Pleasant smell, works to conquer the problem, and is overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> Perfect for greasy scalps and ones with dermatitis or severe dandruff.  I can already see a big improvement.  I recommend to use this with Biotin B complex shampoo for best results as a second wash.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell bad but feels like it works. I have psoriasis and have tried a bunch of shampoos but I like this one</li>
            <li> I have dealt withthis &amp;#34; build up&amp;#34; or lesions on my scalp for several years. My dr gave me a lotion which would hwlp some then it would come back and spread. T-sal was recommended by a dermatoloogist that I went to for the first time in Jan. I had to order it from amazon because I could not find it in the storel but since starting it ,my scalp does not itch very often and the lesions are very tiny and I have hope that they will disappear all together</li>
            <li> I honestly have never written a review for any product before but I felt like this deserved one! This stuff really is awesome</li>
            <li> My two-year old toddler has suffered from bad scalp eczema for most of her life, with scaly itchy lesions that she would scratch to the point of bleeding. I&#x27;ve tried all baby shampoos on the market (Johnson and Johnson, Aveeno, California Baby, Mustela) and none helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I discovered that [[ASIN:B005HO0AR2 Dove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Count]] had been the main cause of redness and intense itching on her skin, which doctors thought was atypical eczema. After discontinuing Dove her skin has mostly cleared up and she no longer itches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if the detergent (surfuctant) base in most baby shampoos could be triggering a similar response. I knew dandruff shampoos were sometimes recommended for cradle cap in babies, so I tried a small amount (quarter size) of [[ASIN:B000052XZX Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo, Scalp Build-up Control, 4.5 fl oz]] on her, left it on for five minutes, rinsed well and reapplied, leaving it on for another five minutes. I thought her curly hair would be a dry frizzy mess but was surprised when it dried and it was very soft and wavy; a dime size dab of [[ASIN:B003BJZ1P6 Aveeno Baby Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, 5 Ounce]]worked through her hair and scalp, a spray of water and some scrunching is all that&#x27;s needed to form ringlets that hold all day. Her scalp cleared up in less than a week, and although she isn&#x27;t cured - it comes back if I don&#x27;t use it on her -  I&#x27;m glad to finally have found a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use T-Sal once or twice a week on her, if any scales reappear - otherwise, I use [[ASIN:B001W03ANQ Bella B Bee Gone Cradle Cap Baby Shampoo 8 Oz]]. This shampoo is aloe based, hypoallergenic and paraben free, with a light fragrance that hasn&#x27;t caused any issues. Both shampoos have worked well on my other children who sometimes get cradle cap as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my end, I am sensitive to fragrances and my hair reacts terribly to strong sulfuctants and silicones found in \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; shampoos, causing a huge amount of frizz, dryness, build up and breakage. Before trying T-Sal on my children, I tried it on my wavy hair. I was also surprised to see how well T-Sal cleaned and how soft and light feeling my hair dried afterwards. I&#x27;ve also noticed it helps my hand eczema (from using strong detergents such as [[ASIN:B007IX9RTC Dial 1423982 Purex Ultra Free and Clear Concentrated Liquid Detergent, 100oz Bottle, (Pack of 4)]]), if I leave the shampoo on my hands as long as I do on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use T-Sal to help remove product build up and alternate with [[ASIN:B000GCV2VI DHS Clear Shampoo 16 oz]] and [[ASIN:B000XDCGOM DHS Conditioning Rinse with Panthenol, Fragrance Free 8 fl oz (236 ml)]], both very mild no-frills products that work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the small size. I&#x27;ve bought a large size T-Gel to see if it&#x27;s more cost effective and will report back after I try it.</li>
            <li> YUK just the worst. I purchased this item because it was recommended for oily hair. Not a good product for that it made my sons hair look like an oil slick.  So my husband started using it since he has normal hair and happens to have psoriasis which it states it helps. It made his hair so oily he felt like he put pomade in his hair.  It looked really bad too. Not something I would recommend unless you have really dry brittle hair. Just the worst.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It works really well for clearing up acne along my hair line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the price on here is a little much for what you get though. The bottle is pretty small and I didn&#x27;t get nearly enough uses out of it to justify the cost.</li>
            <li> I use this product about every other day and its been 2-3 weeks. I guess I can say I have seen a slight improvement in my scalp acne. I have a full head of hair but still like to know that its not an issue.  The size is a bit small.  I&#x27;ll likely get one more bottle after this one runs out but if I can&#x27;t end up rating it better than a 3 star then I&#x27;ll likely give other products a try.  I will say that this product is better than Neutrogena&#x27;s body wash/scrubs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find shampoos that are fragrance free and dye free! It doesn&#x27;t have tons of harsh chemicals in it and it doesn&#x27;t cause scalp or skin irritation. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> A QUALITY ITEM WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE PRICED FAIRLY, AND MET ALL THE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXPECTATIONS THAT ONE COME TO EXPECT FROM A GOOD BRAND THAT HAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEEN USED IN THE PAST</li>
            <li> I am half way through the bottle and still have problems with my scalp. I will continue to use (instead of almost everyday) to see it it makes a difference. The price isn&#x27;t too bad though. so I might buy another one.</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week.  It seems to work well and it lathers nicely.  There is really no fragrance to it that I can recall.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a good addition to any anti-dandruff regimen. The salicylic acid in it helps gently removes flakes with a fairly pleasant smell. It&#x27;s not great for color-treated hair, but as long as it&#x27;s used only occasionally, like once a week or every once in a while, and in conjunction with conditioner, then it isn&#x27;t too drying. Over all, it&#x27;s a beneficial shampoo that has stood the test of time.</li>
            <li> Husband loves and uses and it is so convenient to order and have delivered in two days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using T Sal for at least a decade. Nothing clears my scalp like this product. I used to buy the T Gel but this is much better.</li>
            <li> I very badly want to leave this product a good review, but in the interest of honesty, here goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shampoo solely on the basis of excellent reviews. Many of the reviewers mentioned this product&#x27;s ability to deal with their itchy and often oily scalp. This was my concern too. A huge benefit I noticed right away was that it made my hair (not my scalp) feel really really clean- it would even squeak when I would squeeze out the water, post-shower. So, I was excited about how well it worked and how quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I noticed within a day of using it that I now had a problem I never had before: flakes! So many of them, and so disgustingly visible! Further, after a day of washing, my scalp got extremely oily- more so than it did before. Still, I&#x27;ve been using it and giving it a chance, at least until I am done with this entire (small) bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am about half way through the bottle, washing my hair every other day, and have experienced the same results consistently. However, I will use it until the bottle is empty, and if results change, I will update this review. I am hoping the negative results are just an initial reaction to new treatment. If anyone else has had this reaction and wants to share any tips, I&#x27;m all ears!</li>
            <li> For years, Ive been wondering why my scalp always itches.  I had a variety of opinions but the major one is that there are too much oil from my head which also leads to my receding hairline and etc.  I used to use facial cleaners with Salicytic acids to accompany my shampoo.  Tea tree oil works, but it smells and its hard to put it into your shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does it all.  Its not a big bottle, but you only use a little bit.  You use it as a shampoo and leave it on your head for a few mins.  Gone is the mad itch I have.  No more itchiness or oily hair.  My barber always asks me if I wash my hair before i go get a hair cut b/c its so clean.  Its this product!  Strongly recommend for those whose scalp has itchiness.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has low lather. So you may have to use more than expected. It has a pleasant smell. My scalp is itchy still after using the product 3 times. Also get a good conditioner because the shampoo is a bit drying.</li>
            <li> My son has had dandruff, or some kind of scalp build-up for many years. We think it is due to the medication he is on. This shampoo has been the ONLY thing that has made any difference. Very happy with the results just after a few shampoos. Will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cure my dandruff nearly as well at Nizoral did, and the smell is pretty bad (smells like detergent). The smell wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me, as I know the sole purpose is to fix dandruff/dry scalp. I would definitely recommend Nizoral over this one.</li>
            <li> My scalp became very dry and itchy and flakes became more noticeable. I really thought this product would help because of all the good reviews but it did not at all.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO 100% RECOMENDADO, ME ENCANTA Y ES JUSTO LO QUE ME RECOMENDO EL MEDICO ESPECIALISTA EN PROBLEMAS DE CAIDA DE CABELLO</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for my hair and didn&#x27;t strip the color (I dye my hair darker so I worry about fading). I don&#x27;t have your normal dry dandruff. My skin overall has acne issues. After being off of Accutane for a year, my scalp resumed the odd crusty itchy oily flaking it had before the meds. The itchiness was driving me insane and because my scalp is oily, normal dandruff shampoo made it worse. Every time I scratched my head I would get what felt like sand under my nails. I bought this on a whim and it helped immensely. My scalp is now about 70% better, and I don&#x27;t have to resort to yet another prescription being filled. My hair was left relatively soft and it helps control the oil on my scalp as well. I highly recommend this for people with oily dandruff, when you find that moisturizing anti-dandruff shampoos only make your scalp worse.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo specifically for the salicylic acid that it contains in an attempt to combat acne that has begun to pop up on my scalp.  I&#x27;ve tried several different shampoos to date, and this is the only one that has produced any results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I leave this product in for at least 5 minutes while in the shower before rinsing it off.  After having done this for some time, the amount of scalp acne I&#x27;ve had has significantly decreased (it&#x27;s not completely gone, however).  If you&#x27;re using it for the same purpose as me, just keep in mind that it is not a quick fix and will likely require weeks before results are noticeable!</li>
            <li> This is the only seborrheic dermatitis shampoo that controls my symptoms. And it has a pleasant, nonmediciney smell... great stuff!</li>
            <li> Every year like clockwork, it seems as if I get terrible dandruff. This year was no exception, but this year I got terrible scalp acne in addition to the dandruff. My scalp hurt, itched, and looked terrible all at once. Needless to say, I was embarrassed. Head and Shoulders cleared up the dandruff, but did nothing for the acne. Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special shampoo only exacerbated the problem. Finally, after serious research, I decided to try T/Sal. If you follow the directions specifically, it works wonders! I lathered twice, left it on for five minutes each time, and then rinsed. I followed up with my usual conditioner. Not only was my scalp and hair clean, it no longer itched, flaked, or burned--even after the first use. Plus, not only was my hair soft, it straightened in half the time, AND there were less split ends. The hair stayed clean for nearly two days and my scalp didn&#x27;t itch or hurt. BUY THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: it left my hands pretty dry and itchy, but that&#x27;s nothing a little lotion can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> my dandruf and build up have not been effected by it using it for a week</li>
            <li> Not as great as expected. Its not as bubbly as the T-gel and the scent is very dry. i guess its just not for me.</li>
            <li> This product works well for me but I wish they would add a pleasant fragrance to it. It smells bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands that were supposed to be more natural, but this is the only one that always works. Not cheap, but worth it because it does what it says it will do nearly overnight. Hair feels and looks great and my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy or dry.</li>
            <li> I use it for scalp acne, based on the advice of the Internet and the fact that facial cleansers that clear up acne also employ salicylic acid as the active ingredient. Like another review said, this shampoo works best if used twice in one cleaning. I find that using it twice is the only way that achieve results that actually last. Otherwise, my scalp acne came back as soon as it left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walgreens has the same product with the same amount of active ingredient for half the price.</li>
            <li> Very Good Product. Decreased All Scalp Itch and Most of Flakes.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo.  Great for dry hair</li>
            <li> I had been having problems with a very itchy scalp and it was causing a lot of hair breakage, too.  I decided to try this shampoo after my hair stylist said she was horrified with the condition of my scalp.  Unfortunately, this turned out to be totally the wrong choice in products.  The shampoo, which would not lather at all and left my hair a bit dirty feeling, did nothing for my itching.  In addition, my scalp actually burns now and I am losing even more hair. Never again!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this shampoo for my seborrheic dermatitis (along with other scalp treatments). It has helped immensely.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the zinc pyrithione shampoo to keep my seborrheic dermatitis under control. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Like that this product doesn&#x27;t have a really noticeable smell.  I use it every other day on my hair and it has helped to clear up some of my dry scalp.  it&#x27;s not a overnight fix but has helped quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena simply the best!&lt;br /&gt;After chemically treating my hair for a long time, my scalp needed help! This shampoo helped with the build-up as well as the redness. Gentle to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 47 year old guy, and have had problems with scalp pimples.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 3 weeks and have had much improvement.  I use the Scalpmaster Shampoo brush in the shower with this shampoo, and the problem is slowly going away.  I lather it up, then let it sit for 2-3 minutes while attending to other areas, then gently rinse.  The scalp brush works great, but is purchased separately.  I recommend this product so far.</li>
            <li> I guess I had no idea what 4.5 fluid ounces really was, but I happily bought this to combat my dandruff. And it does just fine! I definitely have noticed reduced flakes with this. As a shampoo, it&#x27;s more medicinal - it doesn&#x27;t smell great, doesn&#x27;t have a smooth luxurious texture...but it does what it says so, I guess I have to reduce my complaining :)</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. I have allergies and one of the causes my scalp to get itchy and flaky. This shampoo has helped relieve the itchiness and flakes.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very effective in controlling scalp itchiness and dandruff.  It can be a little tough so don&#x27;t use it more than once or twice a week.  It smells fine, nothing fancy nor traumatizing.. sort of a stringent, lemony smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter has Native American heritage from her father&#x27;s side, so she has extremely dark, course, heavy hair. It has natural wave to it so she straightens it often. She started noticing terrible flaking at her crown and her hairdresser said it looked like build-up of some sort. Because her hair is so dark the flakes showed up really well. As a teenager this was a serious self confidence issue. We tried \\&quot;clean\\&quot; shampoos to no avail. We swapped to \\&quot;dry scalp\\&quot; shampoo-still nothing. We knew it was not dandruff so I decided to pick up some T-Sal as a last resort. Thankfully, it works wonderfully!  Her hair dresser also suggested a cheap deep conditioner so we went with the 3 Min repair by Aussie. She uses this shampoo every other wash with the 3 min conditioner and her hair is more healthy than I have ever seen it, and flake free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the hairdresser did mention that using a \\&quot;reparative\\&quot; conditioner could cause breakage when used with T-Sal. So be wary of the conditioner you buy.</li>
            <li> I was advised to use this by a dermatologist for sun damaged scalp.She removed some non malignant lesions this shampoo removed the rest.keeps scalp clear and free from dried skin. Will keep using</li>
            <li> I had bought this shampoo because my skin would easily become flaky after cleansing both hair and scalp.  All I had to do was wet my sectioned hair and scalp and apply a dime-size amount of the shampoo and lather. Leave the shampoo on for at least 3 minutes. I leave it on until I have applied to every section part of hair and after rubbing gently my scalp to remove the scalp flakes.  Then I will reapply, and sometimes, I will add an essential oil that can assist the shampoo.  I like this shampoo because it works well for my scalp and it cleanses both my hair and scalp. It helps also with detangling my hair, so that is a great help. The shampoos scent is light, nearly nonexistent.  I think if the shampoo doesn&#x27;t work well at first, then combine it with essential oils like tea tree oil, cedarwood oil, neem oil, karanja oil, peppermint oil, and other oils that fight fungus and balances sebum of the scalp like ylang ylang essential oil. I hope this review helps you.</li>
            <li> Use as directed and results are great! I have tried a lot of previous products and this works! Totally worth  the money.</li>
            <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
