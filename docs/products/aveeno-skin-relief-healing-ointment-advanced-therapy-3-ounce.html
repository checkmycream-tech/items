    <ol>

            <li>Excellent product if you need to repair the skin on your hands (or feet).</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>awesome stuff !!  </li>
            <li>hope I win !!</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST ever!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is better then Neosporin!!!!</li>
            <li>very good!</li>
            <li>Not too many places carry it, but Amazon does!!!</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>So happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li>Great for use after swimming and on days not too sunny.</li>
            <li>Aveeno is a good product.</li>
            <li>good effect.</li>
            <li>In comaprison, I use Blistex DCT lip salve on lips and knuckles, but this works so much better!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>To allow it to be in any way effective, the area to which it is applied must be covered to avoid smearing it or rubbing it off.  </li>
            <li>Great for super chapped skin.</li>
            <li>Doctor recommended for Eczema on prominent areas of body.</li>
            <li>This is what keeps my hands from cracking in the winter. :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>no one can believe how improved they are: heals cracked dry heels and (this is the best part)</li>
            <li>/&gt;EWG says the product is somewhat safe and doesn&#x27;t contain as much harmful chemicals as others of this kind.</li>
            <li>Delivery and packaging were fine.  </li>
            <li>Very good for severely dry skin!</li>
            <li>Walgreens would put in a special order.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth a try.</li>
            <li>Got a sample of this from my dermatologist and after 2 days no more pain and is healing beautifully.  </li>
            <li>right now im bidding on a lot of  48 sample tubes on ebay...</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t use it on face in summer because I get so oily, but for any other time I love it!.</li>
            <li>I also see great relief on my knuckles which will get dry and crack open.</li>
            <li>Very think...almost like Vaseline.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For comparison, the rosebud salve sold at Anthropologie smells good and is thick, but it doesn&#x27;t heal cracked skin like the Aveeno ointment.</li>
            <li>It worked on my husband&#x27;s dry skin better than anything so far.</li>
            <li>This Aveeno product helps calloused skin - particularly elbows, knees and feet heal &amp; disappear almost overnight.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, but that makes it so effective.</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick and will not go anywhere.</li>
            <li>I have many products from this company that work for dry skin in a remarkably short period of time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very soft and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>It only takes the smallest amount, even for my whole face.</li>
            <li>It really is the only product that protects my lips longer than a minute.</li>
            <li>I use this for my infant sons incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a non-absorbable, heavy, ointment that only sits on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this stuff to anyone with the same issue.</li>
            <li>Finally, this fixed it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth ten of any other ointment.</li>
            <li>After several lotions and creams promising to fix dry cracked skin...</li>
            <li>My 12  year old came back from camp with dry cracked feet.</li>

            <li> It did not penetrate my skin, nor did it provide any relief from dry patches because the skin does not absorb it, it merely sits on top.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even been using it on my face in the evenings because my skin is so dry.</li>
            <li> my skin is SO dry that the Vaseline in this product works well.</li>
            <li> Whether you need it for chapped lips, dry winter skin, or cuts and scrapes, BUY IT.</li>
            <li> Was unable to find a full size tube in any stores-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently doing a round of treatment with isotretinoin, and the chapped lips are NO JOKE.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> 20 other things i tried didnt work...</li>
            <li> I had a half ounce sample tube of this stuff  from the doctor and it cleared it up by the time I finished the tube...</li>
            <li> If you need something that heavy it works.</li>
            <li> Have been using it on my feet for the past year and</li>
            <li> This petroleum-like ointment is not a favorite, not is it one I will purchase again.  </li>
            <li> I fell and had a huge scrape that was very painful.</li>
            <li> Hardly need any at all.</li>
            <li> This winter has been hard and drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> Worried because it&#x27;s getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> I found it to be the least valuable product from Aveeno I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> This is a thick ointment that I use nightly.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick like Vaseline.</li>
            <li> What a disappointing product from Aveeno!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! Recommended by my dermatologist.  Not too many places carry it, but Amazon does!!!</li>
            <li> Received a tiny .50 oz tube from the dermatologist.  Was unable to find a full size tube in any stores- Walgreens would put in a special order.  Checked Amazon &amp; price lower than Walgreens, so order 2 tubes.  Excellent product if you need to repair the skin on your hands (or feet). A little goes a long way.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you whoever made this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This saved my skin (hand) during winter especially since I have to wash my hands constantly at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EWG says the product is somewhat safe and doesn&#x27;t contain as much harmful chemicals as others of this kind. That&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It is truly healing! Recommended by a dermatologist!</li>
            <li> My lips are constaly chapped and cracked in winter. This literally heals them in 1 day. Hardly need any at all. I&#x27;ve even been using it on my face in the evenings because my skin is so dry. It has not made me break out, which I am prone to. Probably won&#x27;t use it on face in summer because I get so oily, but for any other time I love it!. I also see great relief on my knuckles which will get dry and crack open. In comaprison, I use Blistex DCT lip salve on lips and knuckles, but this works so much better! It&#x27;s also very soft and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. It only takes the smallest amount, even for my whole face. So happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Doctor recommended for Eczema on prominent areas of body. Great for use after swimming and on days not too sunny.</li>
            <li> Not greasy. Dermotoligist recommended for keeping skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Delivery and packaging were fine.  This Aveeno product helps calloused skin - particularly elbows, knees and feet heal &amp; disappear almost overnight.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have had cracked heels for 12 years...tried EVERTHING...nothing worked...even that a &amp; d ointment for cracked heels ( all that did was eat the heels out of my socks )  Vaseline didn&#x27;t work...huskers didn&#x27;t work...lanolin didn&#x27;t work...20 other things i tried didnt work...I had a half ounce sample tube of this stuff  from the doctor and it cleared it up by the time I finished the tube...awesome stuff !!  but I cant find it in the store...right now im bidding on a lot of  48 sample tubes on ebay...hope I win !!</li>
            <li> It worked on my husband&#x27;s dry skin better than anything so far. It is well worth a try. Aveeno is a good product.</li>
            <li> my skin is SO dry that the Vaseline in this product works well. recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently doing a round of treatment with isotretinoin, and the chapped lips are NO JOKE. My dermatologist gave me a 0.5 oz sample tube of this ointment. It really is the only product that protects my lips longer than a minute. I only need a teensy bit, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, the rosebud salve sold at Anthropologie smells good and is thick, but it doesn&#x27;t heal cracked skin like the Aveeno ointment. Whether you need it for chapped lips, dry winter skin, or cuts and scrapes, BUY IT. It&#x27;s worth ten of any other ointment.</li>
            <li> Love this! This winter has been hard and drying to my skin. This is a thick ointment that I use nightly.</li>
            <li> Ointments give Longer acting relief than lotions.</li>
            <li> Very good for severely dry skin! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is what keeps my hands from cracking in the winter. :)</li>
            <li> Very think...almost like Vaseline. If you need something that heavy it works. Great for super chapped skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick like Vaseline. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I use this for my infant sons incredibly sensitive skin. It&#x27;s thick, but that makes it so effective.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST ever!  Have been using it on my feet for the past year and no one can believe how improved they are: heals cracked dry heels and (this is the best part) even my splitting cracked toe nails!  Love this stuff.  Worried because it&#x27;s getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> After several lotions and creams promising to fix dry cracked skin... This one works.  My 12  year old came back from camp with dry cracked feet. Finally, this fixed it!</li>
            <li> This is a non-absorbable, heavy, ointment that only sits on top of the skin.  I found it to be the least valuable product from Aveeno I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I have many products from this company that work for dry skin in a remarkably short period of time.  This petroleum-like ointment is not a favorite, not is it one I will purchase again.

It did not penetrate my skin, nor did it provide any relief from dry patches because the skin does not absorb it, it merely sits on top.  What a disappointing product from Aveeno!</li>
            <li> This stuff is better then Neosporin!!!! I fell and had a huge scrape that was very painful. I put Neosporin on it 2-3 times daily and was getting nowhere. Got a sample of this from my dermatologist and after 2 days no more pain and is healing beautifully.  I would highly recommend this stuff to anyone with the same issue.</li>
            <li> My derma gave me a sample. It is nice and thick and will not go anywhere.</li>
            <li> very good! good effect.</li>
