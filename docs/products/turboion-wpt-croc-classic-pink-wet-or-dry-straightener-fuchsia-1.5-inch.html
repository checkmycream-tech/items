            <li>Definitely my favorite hair iron!</li>
            <li>I bought this for mydaughter for Christmas, and she love&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li>this is for you, looks good, very smooth, but doesn&#x27;t meet durability.</li>
            <li>it did do an AMAZING job. ...</li>
            <li>I love how you can adjust the temperature, and the grip is really good.</li>
            <li>It was nice while it worked...but it died after 9 months and I was suprised to find out that Turbo Ion Inc/Croc does not provide a warranty for this item when purchased from here.  </li>
            <li>At this point I was kind of</li>
            <li>Heats quickly works great</li>
            <li>Make sure you use some kind of product to protect from over drying-</li>
            <li>Heats up quick and makes my hair nice and shiny!</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my TurboIon Croc!</li>
            <li>I wanted my own, and I have never been more satisfied with a hair-care tool in my life.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast, and it does a great job straightening hair.</li>
            <li>Had one for ten years that worked perfectly until my kitten broke the cord.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this iron is if you forget to turn it off, it will turn off by itself after a period of time.</li>
            <li>but my wife sure seems to love it</li>
            <li>Will order more on amazon</li>
            <li>You are going to pay more for it</li>

            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Heats</li>
            <li>I love the straightener</li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>

            <li>Time is so important.</li>
            <li>Does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li>this is a great iron for straighting your hair the only problem i have had</li>
            <li>So far so good and its been about 4 weeks already.</li>
            <li>I was advised to use it at 350 at most and only when I have a good amount of heat protector in my hair as well.    </li>
            <li>It is a very smooth process, does not pull hair, fast heat up, easy to set the temperature, easy to use,</li>

            <li>She loves the temperature control and her hair always looks great using this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I straighten my hair every day and the Croc makes it a quick and easy job.</li>
            <li>the best part is its PINK!!!! â™¡</li>
            <li>it also close easily therefore your hands are not tired from the gripping.</li>
            <li>It may be a yearly investment, but it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>Just got this today and was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>so was familiar.  </li>
            <li>I went to a beauty supply wholesale place and fell in love with my first Croc.</li>
            <li>Honestly it was not hard at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, super shiny and the straightest</li>
            <li>Like a dummy, I would give in (instead of politely declining like a smart person) and allow the saleperson to do their magic on me.</li>
            <li>My wife liked her first Croc so much that she wanted this one to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I was just so happy to get this in pink.</li>
            <li>Love this straightener it will leave your hair straight and shiny</li>
            <li>Was what I expected and more!!  </li>
            <li>up Quickly.  </li>
            <li>I got this cute pink Croc for her for Christmas and she is loving it.</li>
            <li>Totally love my new croc and</li>
            <li>Looking at reviews, and the heads of people who own other brands, I will only ever own a Croc!</li>
            <li>I always believed that when I left her salon, my hair looked so amazing because she had styled it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the last hair straightener/curler she&#x27;ll ever own.......</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money, it&#x27;s a must buy.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best flat iron on the market, but be careful.  </li>
            <li>Build quality looks good, and it&#x27;s definitely an eye catching hot pink.</li>
            <li>right after one year of use.  </li>
            <li>I do not advise putting the iron right against the scalp.  </li>
            <li>he can advise you on the right temperature to use and any heat protection as well.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to wear my hair down and feel beautiful again, but didn&#x27;t have the time to blow dry and straighten and play \\&quot;Mommy\\</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good flat iron.</li>
            <li>I never use it on wet hair but with my dry hair it styles perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s digital &amp; heats up quick.  </li>
            <li>We bought this for my daughter who has course, very curly hair that we put a mild relaxer on.  </li>
            <li>After years of struggling, we have finally found a fun way to do her hair :)</li>
            <li>Expected more from this iron!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great flat iron and I will probably buy the same one again, but it is an investment.</li>
            <li>I know there&#x27;s a chance that it might die within the first year</li>
            <li>My first Croc died on me--</li>
            <li>I love the digital temp display, and it&#x27;s still as hot as the day I got it almost a year ago.</li>
            <li>The first was done in by a power surge - no fault on my Croc.  </li>
            <li>Its the same exact thing as the Avanti except flatironexperts.com didn&#x27;t have it in my favorite color</li>
            <li>If you decide to purchase one of these, talk to your hair stylist first.  </li>
            <li>First was a walmart version that lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>one swipe curly to straight!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even sure it was possible to straighten her hair because of how curly it is.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than it&#x27;s similarly priced competitor.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>First off she didn&#x27;t buy this, I bought it for her birthday</li>
            <li>Works well, heats up quickly and maintains high temperature.</li>
            <li>I love these Croc flat irons.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and none compare worth every dollar spent.</li>
            <li>But on a positive note I think I will jump on the CHI bandwagon and see how it does.</li>
            <li>And the icing on the cake is how fast this baby heats up, the temperature gage on the side tells you exactly what temp it is, and it gets to its hottest setting (450) in about 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When i contacted the seller they were happy to replace it for the third time but not willing to refund my money, even though it has a 1 year warranty.  </li>
            <li>Event while waiting for my roots to dry, it does not seem to affect the style at all and many times, I just let my roots \\&quot;air</li>
            <li>Mostly I use with dry hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little goofy and super girly</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly frizzy hair and it leaves it smooth and silky and super straight.</li>
            <li>I have VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li>Very disapointment in this item and the seller.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from Amazon too.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone that wants a quality hair iron</li>
            <li>and now her hair is straight.  </li>
            <li>her hair is straight now.  </li>
            <li>Has heat control, heats fast</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>Light brown to sandy blonde :</li>
            <li>Although, I am not so sure that I should take the chance of using it on wet hair again.</li>
            <li>temperature goes up to 410 degrees and feels very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>Yesterday was the first day that I used my new iron.  </li>
            <li>After my first croc broke, I was in need of a new one.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s a wet to dry, so you can straighten your damp hair instead of having to either wait for it to dry</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is the very first time that I have splurged a bit on a more expensive iron &amp; let&#x27;s just say, I will NEVER waste $20 to $30 on a cheap iron ever again!</li>
            <li>But now the new growth is going to be curly and the rest straight.  </li>
            <li>It smooths and straightens very quickly and the wet</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product, but not that seller.</li>
            <li>Another thing I also found when using on wet hair, is that although it leaves hair feeling silky smooth and the shiniest I have ever saw it, it is super flat with no volume.</li>
            <li>Says it makes her hair soft and straight.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE $$$$ ten fold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she does, because now she doesn&#x27;t have to go through the process of straightening it everyday.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the black one if you are looking for a more professional or sleek look.</li>
            <li>I have not used it on wet hair,but I really do like how it gets hot fast and has a auto shut off.</li>
            <li>So I found a new croc on here and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I researched a bit about the product since ive been wanting a new iron for me.</li>
            <li>Check these wires carefully for any lose connections, most likely this will be the problem.</li>
            <li>That said, it was a better price on-line than purchaing in a salon, so a little bit is off-set, but only if it holds up for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Fully dry your hair first, then iron!</li>
            <li>The hot pink is for my daughter, I certainly hope they don&#x27;t quit making it in this color.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick, course hair and this product is able to take out all of the frizz, leaving my hair flat and smooth .</li>
            <li>However, the first one I had stopped working within a year of purchase, for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li>It takes my very thick, very curly, non-relaxed hair and makes it smooth and silky!  </li>
            <li>I started hearing static sound from the twisted cord at the bottom of iron and realized there had to be some short of some sort with the wire.  </li>
            <li>she&#x27;s accustomed to with her old one.</li>
            <li>So this morning as I was thinking to myself wow</li>
            <li>so far...</li>
            <li>As far as this straightener goes if u have the money to blow then</li>
            <li>but they are so worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>My first two Crocs ended up dying on me, but I ended up using both for several years and have no regrets; I will keep buying these things until they are no longer being manufactured.</li>
            <li>not enough heat to straighten like it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li>The second one lasted about a year and died at the very end of flat-ironing my hair last week.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it a 4-star because the first one went out (same one just a different color)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that it just didn&#x27;t work as well because I don&#x27;t think it was heating up to the right temps as I had to put mine on the highest setting to even get it to remotely straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend you spend the extra $$ or go with other trusted brands that are going to worth the investment.</li>
            <li>so the next time I tried on completely dry hair (as I would normally do with my other flat irons) and still found that it just didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth and sleek as some of it&#x27;s competitors.</li>
            <li>I believe that If you flat iron ur hair right the first time you wont have to do it again for at least 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two so far, and am about to buy my third one.  </li>
            <li>I really tried to like it and wanted to keep it but for the money I spent</li>
            <li>I really like that it is pink, dont know if I would buy again.</li>
            <li>If I had used it everyday for 10 months then maybe it was worth the 100.</li>
            <li>Tops the Chi by far, especially if you have this coarse hair</li>
            <li>I purchased my Croc a couple weeks back but have unfortunately only had a chance to use once so far.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted me less than 5 months and the second was about 9 months.  </li>
            <li>This was my second one; the first died a little after one year (it started smoking and crackling when you turned it on</li>
            <li>Heats up really quick and according to her, glides much more smoother without the annoying hair pulling sensation</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my 16 year old niece who has naturally curly hair (tight ringlet curly).  </li>
            <li>I bought the pink one just to mix it up and have a little fun.</li>

            <li> I am going to try a variety of products to see what works best with this iron on my hair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also straightens my hair perfectly but does not take away from the volume.</li>
            <li> Very Happy!</li>
            <li> Well lets just start off by saying this WAS a excellent straightener while it lasted (10 months).</li>
            <li> Great quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> Awesome thanks!!!!!!</li>

            <li> The Croc was way cheaper and it works great.</li>
            <li> This iron did do a great job when it worked.</li>
            <li> She says it does a great job at all it is supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This hair straightner is great.</li>
            <li> Great service.</li>
            <li> LOL ...</li>
            <li> but i had heard great things about Croc</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> I just recieved this straightner through Fedex today and I have to say I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you women have awesome guys too that will take this apart and fix it.</li>
            <li> And I rarely even used it!!!!</li>
            <li> This wonderful iron makes life so easy.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you want a good iron that you need to replace often this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this croc iron because of all the wonderful things everyone had to say.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> She is very pleased with the performance and quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY CROC!</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite hair iron!</li>
            <li> I bought this for mydaughter for Christmas, and she love&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> this is for you, looks good, very smooth, but doesn&#x27;t meet durability.</li>
            <li> it did do an AMAZING job. ...</li>
            <li> I love how you can adjust the temperature, and the grip is really good.</li>
            <li> It was nice while it worked...but it died after 9 months and I was suprised to find out that Turbo Ion Inc/Croc does not provide a warranty for this item when purchased from here.  </li>
            <li> At this point I was kind of</li>
            <li> Heats quickly works great</li>
            <li> Make sure you use some kind of product to protect from over drying-</li>
            <li> Heats up quick and makes my hair nice and shiny!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my TurboIon Croc!</li>
            <li> I wanted my own, and I have never been more satisfied with a hair-care tool in my life.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast, and it does a great job straightening hair.</li>
            <li> Had one for ten years that worked perfectly until my kitten broke the cord.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this iron is if you forget to turn it off, it will turn off by itself after a period of time.</li>
            <li> but my wife sure seems to love it</li>
            <li> Will order more on amazon</li>
            <li> You are going to pay more for it</li>
            <li> I love my croc.  </li>
            <li> We love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this straightening iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I stuck with Croc and didn&#x27;t go with another brand.</li>
            <li> Would recommend and have recommended this product to many people.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Heats</li>
            <li> I love the straightener</li>
            <li> but I still love it.</li>
            <li> But the croc top&#x27;s them all in her opinion.</li>
            <li> Love my croc.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I surely don&#x60;t regret purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Will surely recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> so I will be sure to leave a follow-up comment sometime thereafter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a awesome guy, well atleast until that day.</li>

            <li> My sister handed hers down to me after having it for 2 years and it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> my hair seems to be just fine.</li>

            <li> My hair is always silky smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky smooth every time and looks like it was done at the salon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this croc in 2010 and it still works fabulously.</li>
            <li> Time is so important.</li>
            <li> Does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li> this is a great iron for straighting your hair the only problem i have had</li>
            <li> So far so good and its been about 4 weeks already.</li>
            <li> I was advised to use it at 350 at most and only when I have a good amount of heat protector in my hair as well.    </li>
            <li> It is a very smooth process, does not pull hair, fast heat up, easy to set the temperature, easy to use,</li>
            <li> Is amazing for straightening hair pin straight or big sexy curls!!</li>
            <li> this is a really great flat iron it&#x27;s lasted me 6 years</li>
            <li> She loves the temperature control and her hair always looks great using this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I straighten my hair every day and the Croc makes it a quick and easy job.</li>
            <li> the best part is its PINK!!!! â™¡</li>
            <li> it also close easily therefore your hands are not tired from the gripping.</li>
            <li> It may be a yearly investment, but it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li> Just got this today and was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> so was familiar.  </li>
            <li> I went to a beauty supply wholesale place and fell in love with my first Croc.</li>
            <li> Honestly it was not hard at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, super shiny and the straightest</li>
            <li> Like a dummy, I would give in (instead of politely declining like a smart person) and allow the saleperson to do their magic on me.</li>
            <li> My wife liked her first Croc so much that she wanted this one to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I was just so happy to get this in pink.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener it will leave your hair straight and shiny</li>
            <li> Was what I expected and more!!  </li>
            <li> up Quickly.  </li>
            <li> I got this cute pink Croc for her for Christmas and she is loving it.</li>
            <li> Totally love my new croc and</li>
            <li> Looking at reviews, and the heads of people who own other brands, I will only ever own a Croc!</li>
            <li> I always believed that when I left her salon, my hair looked so amazing because she had styled it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the last hair straightener/curler she&#x27;ll ever own.......</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money, it&#x27;s a must buy.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best flat iron on the market, but be careful.  </li>
            <li> Build quality looks good, and it&#x27;s definitely an eye catching hot pink.</li>
            <li> right after one year of use.  </li>
            <li> I do not advise putting the iron right against the scalp.  </li>
            <li> he can advise you on the right temperature to use and any heat protection as well.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to wear my hair down and feel beautiful again, but didn&#x27;t have the time to blow dry and straighten and play \\&quot;Mommy\\</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> I never use it on wet hair but with my dry hair it styles perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s digital &amp; heats up quick.  </li>
            <li> We bought this for my daughter who has course, very curly hair that we put a mild relaxer on.  </li>
            <li> After years of struggling, we have finally found a fun way to do her hair :)</li>
            <li> Expected more from this iron!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great flat iron and I will probably buy the same one again, but it is an investment.</li>
            <li> I know there&#x27;s a chance that it might die within the first year</li>
            <li> My first Croc died on me--</li>
            <li> I love the digital temp display, and it&#x27;s still as hot as the day I got it almost a year ago.</li>
            <li> The first was done in by a power surge - no fault on my Croc.  </li>
            <li> Its the same exact thing as the Avanti except flatironexperts.com didn&#x27;t have it in my favorite color</li>
            <li> If you decide to purchase one of these, talk to your hair stylist first.  </li>
            <li> First was a walmart version that lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> one swipe curly to straight!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even sure it was possible to straighten her hair because of how curly it is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than it&#x27;s similarly priced competitor.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> First off she didn&#x27;t buy this, I bought it for her birthday</li>
            <li> Works well, heats up quickly and maintains high temperature.</li>
            <li> I love these Croc flat irons.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and none compare worth every dollar spent.</li>
            <li> But on a positive note I think I will jump on the CHI bandwagon and see how it does.</li>
            <li> And the icing on the cake is how fast this baby heats up, the temperature gage on the side tells you exactly what temp it is, and it gets to its hottest setting (450) in about 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When i contacted the seller they were happy to replace it for the third time but not willing to refund my money, even though it has a 1 year warranty.  </li>
            <li> Event while waiting for my roots to dry, it does not seem to affect the style at all and many times, I just let my roots \\&quot;air</li>
            <li> Mostly I use with dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little goofy and super girly</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly frizzy hair and it leaves it smooth and silky and super straight.</li>
            <li> I have VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li> Very disapointment in this item and the seller.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from Amazon too.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone that wants a quality hair iron</li>
            <li> and now her hair is straight.  </li>
            <li> her hair is straight now.  </li>
            <li> Has heat control, heats fast</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> Light brown to sandy blonde :</li>
            <li> Although, I am not so sure that I should take the chance of using it on wet hair again.</li>
            <li> temperature goes up to 410 degrees and feels very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> Yesterday was the first day that I used my new iron.  </li>
            <li> After my first croc broke, I was in need of a new one.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it&#x27;s a wet to dry, so you can straighten your damp hair instead of having to either wait for it to dry</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is the very first time that I have splurged a bit on a more expensive iron &amp; let&#x27;s just say, I will NEVER waste $20 to $30 on a cheap iron ever again!</li>
            <li> But now the new growth is going to be curly and the rest straight.  </li>
            <li> It smooths and straightens very quickly and the wet</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product, but not that seller.</li>
            <li> Another thing I also found when using on wet hair, is that although it leaves hair feeling silky smooth and the shiniest I have ever saw it, it is super flat with no volume.</li>
            <li> Says it makes her hair soft and straight.</li>
            <li> WORTH THE $$$$ ten fold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she does, because now she doesn&#x27;t have to go through the process of straightening it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the black one if you are looking for a more professional or sleek look.</li>
            <li> I have not used it on wet hair,but I really do like how it gets hot fast and has a auto shut off.</li>
            <li> So I found a new croc on here and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I researched a bit about the product since ive been wanting a new iron for me.</li>
            <li> Check these wires carefully for any lose connections, most likely this will be the problem.</li>
            <li> That said, it was a better price on-line than purchaing in a salon, so a little bit is off-set, but only if it holds up for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Fully dry your hair first, then iron!</li>
            <li> The hot pink is for my daughter, I certainly hope they don&#x27;t quit making it in this color.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, course hair and this product is able to take out all of the frizz, leaving my hair flat and smooth .</li>
            <li> However, the first one I had stopped working within a year of purchase, for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> It takes my very thick, very curly, non-relaxed hair and makes it smooth and silky!  </li>
            <li> I started hearing static sound from the twisted cord at the bottom of iron and realized there had to be some short of some sort with the wire.  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;s accustomed to with her old one.</li>
            <li> So this morning as I was thinking to myself wow</li>
            <li> so far...</li>
            <li> As far as this straightener goes if u have the money to blow then</li>
            <li> but they are so worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> My first two Crocs ended up dying on me, but I ended up using both for several years and have no regrets; I will keep buying these things until they are no longer being manufactured.</li>
            <li> not enough heat to straighten like it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li> The second one lasted about a year and died at the very end of flat-ironing my hair last week.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4-star because the first one went out (same one just a different color)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that it just didn&#x27;t work as well because I don&#x27;t think it was heating up to the right temps as I had to put mine on the highest setting to even get it to remotely straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend you spend the extra $$ or go with other trusted brands that are going to worth the investment.</li>
            <li> so the next time I tried on completely dry hair (as I would normally do with my other flat irons) and still found that it just didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth and sleek as some of it&#x27;s competitors.</li>
            <li> I believe that If you flat iron ur hair right the first time you wont have to do it again for at least 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two so far, and am about to buy my third one.  </li>
            <li> I really tried to like it and wanted to keep it but for the money I spent</li>
            <li> I really like that it is pink, dont know if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> If I had used it everyday for 10 months then maybe it was worth the 100.</li>
            <li> Tops the Chi by far, especially if you have this coarse hair</li>
            <li> I purchased my Croc a couple weeks back but have unfortunately only had a chance to use once so far.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me less than 5 months and the second was about 9 months.  </li>
            <li> This was my second one; the first died a little after one year (it started smoking and crackling when you turned it on</li>
            <li> Heats up really quick and according to her, glides much more smoother without the annoying hair pulling sensation</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 16 year old niece who has naturally curly hair (tight ringlet curly).  </li>
            <li> I bought the pink one just to mix it up and have a little fun.</li>
            <li> She stated that there is nothing wrong with ceramic plates on a flat iron, but that titanium was better.  </li>
            <li> flat irons r not ment to be used on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Either way a flat iron shouldn&#x27;t have heating issues after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> It was $125 less than what you can buy one new for anywhere else</li>
            <li> when you open it up and take it apart you will see a 360 degree clear swivel in the back where the black cord meets, you will notice two wires going to it.</li>
            <li> Even my much less expensive flat iron that&#x27;s a couple years old worked better than this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I later have to go back to dry my roots because they stay damp.  </li>
            <li> It started to make a dull buzzing sound a few months back</li>
            <li> I usually use straightners that at 1\\&quot; but this one is 1 and 1/2\\&quot; and it straightens my hair so much faster.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron as recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> because of a technique i use and also this flat iron it takes me around 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist uses this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Is this flat iron ceramic or titanium?&lt;br /&gt;It says ceramic but then describes the straitened blade as Nano titanium.</li>
            <li> Got this flat iron for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, she loves it.</li>
            <li> and I ALWAYS recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> but If you have thicker curly hair this flat iron is not for you.</li>
            <li> The saleperson would beckon to me and wave the flat iron in the air and offer to do a demo on my &#x27;do.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned -- mall flat irons suck.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is straight naturally</li>
            <li> â€¦ It was the flat iron!  </li>
            <li> She claims its lighter and half the weight of her old Paul Brown one.</li>
            <li> I had been using a drugstore quality flat iron for years and never really knew any different.  </li>
            <li> to dry application means my hair only has to be about 90% dry to start styling it.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted a year of traveling around the country and being thrown in a gym bag constantly--and this is AFTER it was used for a year by my mom, passed down to my little sister who used it for another year, THEN finally passed down to me.</li>
            <li> This is the second Croc I have owned and I would never buy any other flat iron.</li>
            <li> Long (Mid-back length) :</li>
            <li> You can use this flat iron for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d give this wet or dry flat iron a try.</li>
            <li> Before I was taking 30-40 minutes to blow dry and straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> Now with the CROC, I can blow dry AND straighten my hair in under 15 minutes,</li>
            <li> I have left out a few possibly helpful facts---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe I spent over $100 each on those suckers.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair softer than using any other flat iron that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Would use any other flat iron since I have found the Croc.  </li>
            <li> It usually took an hour to straighten my hair completely; with the croc it takes about 30 minutes. .</li>
            <li> I will never use any other brand of Flat Iron!</li>
            <li> Okay, I admit -- once upon a time, I used to be a sucker who would buy cheesy, crappily-made flat irons from mall kisoks.</li>
            <li> I opted to buy this Croc flat iron over the Keratin Complex Stealth flat iron because it was a little bit cheaper and appeared to be very similar to the Stealth (which I&#x27;ve tried several times)</li>
            <li> My hair is very very thick and wavy and this iron leaves it perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> I have gone thru 2 of these flat irons in less than 2 years.  </li>
            <li> The pink is also a plus...</li>
            <li> My receipt and tr box says pink.</li>
            <li> I prefer a Moroccan oil type product sparingly applied when the hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> This is not for the inexperienced, or excitable user.  </li>
            <li> She loves the pink color and the durability.  </li>
            <li> I used it on wet hair on \\&quot;max\\&quot; (</li>
            <li> and I spent a 100 on this junk.</li>
            <li> I have always used a CHI in the past and was a little nervous about trying something new</li>
            <li> Very upset that I am unable to exchange or do anything with such an expensive product that is only three months old!</li>
            <li> To use on wet hair you will need to have your hair a little dry before ironing it.</li>
            <li> do not try to use this iron on wet hair, it will literally boil the hair!</li>
            <li> Wont buy any other brand now.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use it every day and was very careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the Croc, I look like I just spent an hour and a half, and $50.00, at a salon.</li>
            <li> My only complaint....</li>
            <li> That really sucks and left me feeling &amp;#34;double dealt&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> personally I thought that was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it less then 30 times and</li>
            <li> I was shocked on how quick we got it.</li>
            <li> For example, I have very dry, thick, curly highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a good habit to waste money on rubbish, but I did it TWICE and bought two crappy flat irons from the mall!</li>
            <li> but it only heats up to 280 (seems to be a common complaint) ...</li>
            <li> I had one and it broke after a few years</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I ordered the hot pink croc and received a BLACK ONE!</li>
            <li> Half the price, yup!</li>
            <li> Extremely please with the product as well as my friends who have thick, damages hair.</li>
            <li> yeah, my hair would be kinda sorta straight (after awhile), but these things are expensive and really poorly made.</li>
            <li> I was the bad guy that day, or maybe I have a smart mouth, either way the blame was on me.</li>
            <li> so it usually takes 45 minutes to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> I would not suggest this iron as with mine in the past</li>
            <li> She was still not satisfied with how wavy her hair was, and our hairdresser suggested a Croc.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t switch it out because there were no more at the Leicester</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works yet.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been throwing it up for the past two years after having my two boys.</li>
            <li> I was unfortunate enough to be around when all this happen, I guess since I bought it</li>
            <li> Going from wet to dry seemed impossible to me until I tried this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pricey but it works wonders on my thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair you must order this item.</li>
            <li> have extremely thick and wavey hair</li>
            <li> Wavy : Thick</li>
            <li> I bought one from Sally&#x27;s that was touted as being \\&quot;great\\&quot; and am not satisfied!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean after using the product, I mean out of the shower...</li>
            <li> Once done, I would feel obligated to buy one of these damned things because for some odd reason, I would feel guilty --</li>
            <li> hair is very thick, kinky/curly and hard to straighten.  </li>
            <li> Sucks do not order!</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason it broke was because I tried to use it in Europe and it shorted out since I was stupid and didn&#x27;t use an adapter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I would not want to stand behind a product that was a peice of junk either.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this straightner because I had never owned/heard about this brand</li>
            <li> I purchased it from the seller &amp;#34;Premier Beauty&amp;#34; and they sent me the wrong item TWICE.</li>
            <li> and it was a bad solder</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was very disappointed with the Croc and returned it.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hope my daughter isn&#x27;t too disappointed.</li>
            <li> So remember don&#x27;t hate him on the day it breaks, hes not to blame.</li>
            <li> and it is already broken!!!!!</li>

            <li> Best flat iron on the market. Had one for ten years that worked perfectly until my kitten broke the cord. So I found a new croc on here and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Would pay triple what i did for this product. WORTH THE $$$$ ten fold.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron as recommended by my hair stylist. I absolutely loved it! It had been the best flat iron I had ever owned. It is now about 9 months since I purchased it and it no longer works! It started to make a dull buzzing sound a few months back and I thought nothing of it. Then it starting making crackling sounds then low and behold it started shutting on and off and eventually the cord actually starting sparking! OMG!... I suppose if you want a good iron that you need to replace often this is the one for you. I am now gonna try a GHD as I have heard wonderful things about it. Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron in the world!!!</li>
            <li> I have VERY curly hair. It used to take me 2 hours to do my hair. now. because of a technique i use and also this flat iron it takes me around 45 minutes. and my hair looks great and shiny. flat irons r not ment to be used on a daily basis. I believe that If you flat iron ur hair right the first time you wont have to do it again for at least 2 days.  Since my hair is soo curly i just put it up in a bun n it kinda creates a simple wave when i take it out the next morning.</li>
            <li> Very disapointment in this item and the seller. I bought this item in April and it is already broken!!!!! And I rarely even used it!!!! Very upset that I am unable to exchange or do anything with such an expensive product that is only three months old!</li>
            <li> I love this product! My favorite thing about this iron is if you forget to turn it off, it will turn off by itself after a period of time. I love how you can adjust the temperature, and the grip is really good. However I rated this item with a 4 because it only comes with a one-year warranty and the warranty isn&#x27;t automatic you have to fill out a form and send it in within 30 days of purchasing the item, so personally I thought that was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Says it makes her hair soft and straight. Keeps the frizz away. Hey what do I know about this product??? I&#x27;m a guy with a crew-cut type haircut that wouldn&#x27;t know one hair straightener from another if it asked me to dance.....but my wife sure seems to love it and she says she is very happy with it. She researches stuff before she buys and this is the one she wanted. She said give it 5 stars when I asked her.</li>
            <li> I love these Croc flat irons. Perfect size for my shorter hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the midsection the way it does with the Chi.</li>
            <li> My wife liked her first Croc so much that she wanted this one to replace it.  I only gave it a 4-star because the first one went out (same one just a different color) right after one year of use.  It actually didn&#x27;t go totally out,  but it only heats up to 280 (seems to be a common complaint) ... not enough heat to straighten like it did when it was new.  Hoping this one will last longer this time.</li>
            <li> I bought the Turbolon Croc for my daughter and she is very happy with it. This is a top end flat iron at a great price.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this straightner through Fedex today and I have to say I LOVE it!! I was skeptical about buying this straightner because I had never owned/heard about this brand but I read some of the reviews on amazon and decided to try it. It heats up in no time and stays heated up. I usually use straightners that at 1\\&quot; but this one is 1 and 1/2\\&quot; and it straightens my hair so much faster. I have very thick hair that is straight naturally but its frizzy so it usually takes 45 minutes to straighten my hair but with this straightner it only take 20 minutes!! The plates glide through my hair effortlessly. The pink is also a plus...so over all I would reccomend this straightner to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great quality, love the staightining iron so much, my friend loves the color and I do to. Will order more on amazon DEFINETLY</li>
            <li> I had been using a drugstore quality flat iron for years and never really knew any different.  My hair stylist recommended the Croc Titanium and said I would not believe the difference.  I always believed that when I left her salon, my hair looked so amazing because she had styled it.  NO WAYâ€¦ It was the flat iron!  My hair is always silky smooth after using it.  It smooths and straightens very quickly and the wet to dry application means my hair only has to be about 90% dry to start styling it.  Before I was taking 30-40 minutes to blow dry and straighten my hair.  Now with the CROC, I can blow dry AND straighten my hair in under 15 minutes, no joke.  And the icing on the cake is how fast this baby heats up, the temperature gage on the side tells you exactly what temp it is, and it gets to its hottest setting (450) in about 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straight iron is amazing!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have gone thru 2 of these flat irons in less than 2 years.  The first one lasted me less than 5 months and the second was about 9 months.  My hairdresser recommended this iron.  I will NEVER again purchase this product.  Both irons did the same thing...it will allow you to turn it on but the minute that you begin using it it shuts off.  I am so disappointed.  When i contacted the seller they were happy to replace it for the third time but not willing to refund my money, even though it has a 1 year warranty.  My suggestion to those of you considering this go with a Sultra or a GHD.  You are going to pay more for it but they are so worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Product works great heats fast works great with wet hair. Some straighteners loss their heat while using on damp hair but this one hold up well</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had.  I love how it&#x27;s digital &amp; heats up quick.  Best purchase for a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for this product.  I love my croc.  We all have long curly hair and the croc does the best job on our hair.  We love it.  Fast shipping from Amazon too.  I was shocked on how quick we got it.</li>
            <li> I love this straightening iron.  My Chi finally died on me after 4 years and so I decided to try out the Croc.  My hairdresser uses one at her salon.  I know there&#x27;s a chance that it might die within the first year and I have come to terms with it.  My hair is very very thick and wavy and this iron leaves it perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist uses this flat iron.  I asked her about it the last time I was there.  She stated that there is nothing wrong with ceramic plates on a flat iron, but that titanium was better.  Yesterday was the first day that I used my new iron.  It ran through my hair more smoothly and didn&#x27;t pull it.  My hair looked smoother and I got two compliments on my hair yesterday.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Awesome thanks!!!!!! A+++++++</li>
            <li> I bought this in May and now the iron turns off while I&#x27;m using it.  It will not stay on and then I have to always check to see if it&#x27;s lit up.  It sometimes won&#x27;t turn on at all. I might use it 4 times a month and it&#x27;s obviously a manufacturer defect.  I would not suggest this iron as with mine in the past have lasted well ovee a year.</li>
            <li> My first Croc died on me-- the cord got a short in it after 5 years of daily use &amp; travel, so I ordered this one as a replacement. I&#x27;m so glad I stuck with Croc and didn&#x27;t go with another brand. I love the digital temp display, and it&#x27;s still as hot as the day I got it almost a year ago. I will never use any other brand of Flat Iron!</li>
            <li> Great iron! I&#x27;ve only ever owned a Croc. Looking at reviews, and the heads of people who own other brands, I will only ever own a Croc! It takes my very thick, very curly, non-relaxed hair and makes it smooth and silky!  My only complaint....I&#x27;ve bought two so far, and am about to buy my third one.  The first was done in by a power surge - no fault on my Croc.  The surge literally melted the plastic!  The second one lasted about a year and died at the very end of flat-ironing my hair last week.  I bought one from Sally&#x27;s that was touted as being \\&quot;great\\&quot; and am not satisfied!  My hair looks like everyone else&#x27;s!  THIS JUST WILL NOT DO!  It may be a yearly investment, but it&#x27;s worth it!  I LOVE MY CROC!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever. Leaves my hair silky smooth every time and looks like it was done at the salon. Extremely please with the product as well as my friends who have thick, damages hair.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my daughter who has course, very curly hair that we put a mild relaxer on.  She was still not satisfied with how wavy her hair was, and our hairdresser suggested a Croc.  So happy that she did!  After years of struggling, we have finally found a fun way to do her hair :)</li>
            <li> I had one and it broke after a few years, it&#x27;s pricey but it works wonders on my thick and frizzy hair. Makes my hair softer than using any other flat iron that I&#x27;ve tried. Better than the expensive salon brand.</li>
            <li> After my first croc broke, I was in need of a new one. Totally love my new croc and the best part is its PINK!!!! â™¡</li>
            <li> I purchased it as a Christmas gift. I am disappointed that I ordered the hot pink croc and received a BLACK ONE! My receipt and tr box says pink. I couldn&#x27;t switch it out because there were no more at the Leicester I purchased it for. I hope my daughter isn&#x27;t too disappointed. Not sure how it works yet.</li>
            <li> Would use any other flat iron since I have found the Croc.  The hot pink is for my daughter, I certainly hope they don&#x27;t quit making it in this color.  Would recommend and have recommended this product to many people.</li>
            <li> I recieved my croc 4 days after I bought it (during Christmas when everyone is the busiest.) It was $125 less than what you can buy one new for anywhere else and it works great. Best straitener out there. It has a timer so if you forget to turn it off when you leave, it will shut off after 30 minutes of non use.  Tops the Chi by far, especially if you have this coarse hair like I do. It usually took an hour to straighten my hair completely; with the croc it takes about 30 minutes. . If you have thick hair you must order this item. I do suggest you purchase a heat pad that you can lay the croc on while using.</li>
            <li> I purchased this croc in 2010 and it still works fabulously. Heats up quick and makes my hair nice and shiny!</li>
            <li> I was just so happy to get this in pink. I researched a bit about the product since ive been wanting a new iron for me. Its the same exact thing as the Avanti except flatironexperts.com didn&#x27;t have it in my favorite color and I got mine here wayy cheaper. Half the price, yup! It doesn&#x27;t snip my hair like how my old forgotten vidal sassoon nano tech iron in pink does. It can now it dust and rust!</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Heats up Quickly.  Going from wet to dry seemed impossible to me until I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thick, kinky/curly and hard to straighten.  Especially when wet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I straightened my entire head of hair in 10 minutes flat.&lt;br /&gt;However, I later have to go back to dry my roots because they stay damp.  I do not advise putting the iron right against the scalp.  Event while waiting for my roots to dry, it does not seem to affect the style at all and many times, I just let my roots \\&quot;air dry\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredible.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course hair and this product is able to take out all of the frizz, leaving my hair flat and smooth .</li>
            <li> It is a very smooth process, does not pull hair, fast heat up, easy to set the temperature, easy to use,</li>
            <li> I have not used it on wet hair,but I really do like how it gets hot fast and has a auto shut off.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this croc iron because of all the wonderful things everyone had to say.  The moment I used it, it began to shut off.  I thought my hand was hitting the button which I thought was an inconvenience.  Well thinking it was an automatic shut off maybe that is why it was shutting off but it was turned on for about 10 minutes and once I started to use it, it would shut off.  I started hearing static sound from the twisted cord at the bottom of iron and realized there had to be some short of some sort with the wire.  Sometimes it would shut off and not let me turn it back on.  I really tried to like it and wanted to keep it but for the money I spent I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Is amazing for straightening hair pin straight or big sexy curls!! Definitely my favorite hair iron! Would recommend to anyone that wants a quality hair iron</li>
            <li> The reason I choose the Croc is because of its similarities to the Avanti straightener. The Croc was way cheaper and it works great.You can use this flat iron for wet or dry hair. To use on wet hair you will need to have your hair a little dry before ironing it. So far so good and its been about 4 weeks already.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it less then 30 times and all of a sudden it stopped working, it would heat up and error out.  I believe this was a safegaurd built in as the unit would over heat.  My husband took it apart and it was a bad solder and we threw it away.  THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO MY SISTER, she had hers two months, she was the one that recommended this product to me.  This iron did do a great job when it worked.</li>
            <li> Great quality at a great price! My new favorite hair styling product!!</li>
            <li> Works well, heats up quickly and maintains high temperature.</li>
            <li> I regularly get Blo outs, and the place I go uses the Croc- and retails it for $175.00. I wanted my own, and I have never been more satisfied with a hair-care tool in my life. Period. I have waist length, curly to frizzy hair. With the Croc, I look like I just spent an hour and a half, and $50.00, at a salon. Max time from frizzy to PanteneCommercial hair? 20 mins.&lt;br /&gt;One caveat- do not try to use this iron on wet hair, it will literally boil the hair! Fully dry your hair first, then iron! Make sure you use some kind of product to protect from over drying- I prefer a Moroccan oil type product sparingly applied when the hair is still wet. I can&#x27;t recommend this iron enough! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I really like that it is pink, dont know if I would buy again. I may buy another to replace this one.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best flat iron on the market, but be careful.  This is not for the inexperienced, or excitable user.  If you decide to purchase one of these, talk to your hair stylist first.  She/he can advise you on the right temperature to use and any heat protection as well.  For example, I have very dry, thick, curly highlighted hair.  I was advised to use it at 350 at most and only when I have a good amount of heat protector in my hair as well.    NOT TO BE USED AROUND/BY CHILDREN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!</li>
            <li> This is my second Croc. First was a walmart version that lasted 2 years. Bought this after I found I did not like the sultra or the Chi. Wont buy any other brand now.</li>
            <li> Is this flat iron ceramic or titanium?&lt;br /&gt;It says ceramic but then describes the straitened blade as Nano titanium. Is this a one inch or 1 1/2?</li>
            <li> Heats quickly works great</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES it! She says it does a great job at all it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;She has already recommended it to friends and coworkers. :-}</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly frizzy hair and it leaves it smooth and silky and super straight. I have tried many and none compare worth every dollar spent.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife for Christmas and she couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. She absolutely loves it! She claims its lighter and half the weight of her old Paul Brown one. Build quality looks good, and it&#x27;s definitely an eye catching hot pink. Heats up really quick and according to her, glides much more smoother without the annoying hair pulling sensation she&#x27;s accustomed to with her old one. It&#x27;s the last hair straightener/curler she&#x27;ll ever own.......so she says.</li>
            <li> So this morning as I was thinking to myself wow this is a really great flat iron it&#x27;s lasted me 6 years now!.....about 3 seconds later it stopped working. It&#x27;s a great flat iron and I will probably buy the same one again, but it is an investment.</li>
            <li> curly headed girls dream come true!  best flat iron I have ever owned.  one swipe curly to straight! SIMPLY AHHHHHMAZZINNNNNGG!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 16 year old niece who has naturally curly hair (tight ringlet curly).  It works beautifully to straighten her hair.  I wasn&#x27;t even sure it was possible to straighten her hair because of how curly it is.  However, she has been using the product now for a month or so and now her hair is straight.  I don&#x27;t mean after using the product, I mean out of the shower...her hair is straight now.  I don&#x27;t think that is a good thing.  I&#x27;m sure she does, because now she doesn&#x27;t have to go through the process of straightening it everyday.  But now the new growth is going to be curly and the rest straight.  She even tried to scrunch it to make it curly and it wouldn&#x27;t work.  So just beware that this product may permanently straighten the portion of your hair that you use it on!</li>
            <li> Got this flat iron for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, she loves it. Has heat control, heats fast and she&#x27;s done. No problem with it- so far...</li>
            <li> It was nice while it worked...but it died after 9 months and I was suprised to find out that Turbo Ion Inc/Croc does not provide a warranty for this item when purchased from here.  But who could blame Croc, I would not want to stand behind a product that was a peice of junk either.  This was my second one; the first died a little after one year (it started smoking and crackling when you turned it on - can you say fire hazard).  If you want something that is going to last or actually has a warranty I would look for a different brand.</li>
            <li> Just got this today and was so excited to try it out. It straightened my curly hair with one glide and left it so shiney.</li>
            <li> Time is so important. This wonderful iron makes life so easy. Mostly I use with dry hair. Straightening made so easy and effortlessly. Perfect every time.</li>
            <li> I love the straightener it&#x27;s a good one leave my hair feeling very soft it works really well I have very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is the second Croc I have owned and I would never buy any other flat iron. My first one lasted a year of traveling around the country and being thrown in a gym bag constantly--and this is AFTER it was used for a year by my mom, passed down to my little sister who used it for another year, THEN finally passed down to me. The only reason it broke was because I tried to use it in Europe and it shorted out since I was stupid and didn&#x27;t use an adapter.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely thick and wavey hair and I can straighten my mane in under 20 min. People compliment my hair when it is straightened all the time and I ALWAYS recommend this flat iron. Definitely worth the money, it&#x27;s a must buy. I bought the pink one just to mix it up and have a little fun. It&#x27;s a little goofy and super girly but I still love it. I recommend the black one if you are looking for a more professional or sleek look.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She likes it a lot.  She loves the pink color and the durability.  I have ordered another one for my wife. This is strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for mydaughter for Christmas, and she love&#x27;s it! She think&#x27;s it&#x27;s the best! I bought her a Chi, but it quit working within an hour and I had to take it back. Before that she had a babybliss, which she liked very much. But the croc top&#x27;s them all in her opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener it will leave your hair straight and shiny</li>
            <li> I like the Croc straightener...I&#x27;ve had one before so was familiar.  It&#x27;s much better than it&#x27;s similarly priced competitor.  However, the first one I had stopped working within a year of purchase, for no apparent reason.  I HOPE this one does better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big CON on this purchase is that when you receive the item it says on the warranty that ONLY Crocs purchased in salons or their approved stores will be warrantied. NO ON-LINE PURCHASES WILL BE WARRANTIED!!!  I WISH that I had known this before I bought it on-line!  That really sucks and left me feeling &amp;#34;double dealt&amp;#34;.  That said, it was a better price on-line than purchaing in a salon, so a little bit is off-set, but only if it holds up for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, and she said it is the best flat iron she has ever had.  She loves the temperature control and her hair always looks great using this flat iron.  She is very pleased with the performance and quality of this product.</li>
            <li> This hair straightner is great. It heats up very fast, and it does a great job straightening hair. it also close easily therefore your hands are not tired from the gripping. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I opted to buy this Croc flat iron over the Keratin Complex Stealth flat iron because it was a little bit cheaper and appeared to be very similar to the Stealth (which I&#x27;ve tried several times) so I thought I&#x27;d give this wet or dry flat iron a try. I tried it on damp hair only to find that it still left my hair frizzy so the next time I tried on completely dry hair (as I would normally do with my other flat irons) and still found that it just didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth and sleek as some of it&#x27;s competitors. Even my much less expensive flat iron that&#x27;s a couple years old worked better than this one. It&#x27;s possible that it just didn&#x27;t work as well because I don&#x27;t think it was heating up to the right temps as I had to put mine on the highest setting to even get it to remotely straighten my hair. Either way a flat iron shouldn&#x27;t have heating issues after only a couple of uses. Needless to say I was very disappointed with the Croc and returned it. This iron may work well on thinner wavy hair but If you have thicker curly hair this flat iron is not for you. I recommend you spend the extra $$ or go with other trusted brands that are going to worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Great service. Love my croc. Does a fabulous job. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I surely don&#x60;t regret purchasing this product. Was what I expected and more!!  Will surely recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my TurboIon Croc! This is the very first time that I have splurged a bit on a more expensive iron &amp; let&#x27;s just say, I will NEVER waste $20 to $30 on a cheap iron ever again! My hair is smooth, super shiny and the straightest I have ever had it. My hair is normally coarse and wavy and I&#x27;ve been throwing it up for the past two years after having my two boys. I wanted to be able to wear my hair down and feel beautiful again, but didn&#x27;t have the time to blow dry and straighten and play \\&quot;Mommy\\&quot; all at the same time..so I just went without. Until now! No blow drying for me, just my Croc!  The best thing is.... when I go outside, my hair doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s style .... I never thought I&#x27;d say this but....Humidity is no longer my enemy! Woo Hoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say thank you enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pro&#x27;s:  EVERYTHING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cons:  NONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---Although there are no cons..I have left out a few possibly helpful facts---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: Light brown to sandy blonde : Long (Mid-back length) : Coarse : Wavy : Thick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I purchased my Croc a couple weeks back but have unfortunately only had a chance to use once so far. I used it on wet hair on \\&quot;max\\&quot; (450 degree) temp/heat and I smoked up the bathroom...literally! LOL ...Buuuttt...it did do an AMAZING job. ...Annndd..my hair seems to be just fine. So thank goodness, it didn&#x27;t fry my hair.... I did also use Hydraloc leave-in conditioner for a detangler, as I always do...so I&#x27;m thinking maybe this is why all the smoke? I don&#x27;t know, but I will be using again in the morning so I will be sure to leave a follow-up comment sometime thereafter. Although, I am not so sure that I should take the chance of using it on wet hair again. Another thing I also found when using on wet hair, is that although it leaves hair feeling silky smooth and the shiniest I have ever saw it, it is super flat with no volume. I am going to try a variety of products to see what works best with this iron on my hair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will follow-up accordingly! ... Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic flat iron. My sister handed hers down to me after having it for 2 years and it still works perfectly. I wanted to purchase another one as a gift to my mother for her birthday. I purchased it from the seller &amp;#34;Premier Beauty&amp;#34; and they sent me the wrong item TWICE. I spoke with Amazon and they said they would be removing this listing so it doesn&#x27;t happen again. Highly recommend the product, but not that seller.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Croc in December.  Absolutely loved it!  Didn&#x27;t use it every day and was very careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In May it just quit.</li>
            <li> Okay, I admit -- once upon a time, I used to be a sucker who would buy cheesy, crappily-made flat irons from mall kisoks. The saleperson would beckon to me and wave the flat iron in the air and offer to do a demo on my &#x27;do. Like a dummy, I would give in (instead of politely declining like a smart person) and allow the saleperson to do their magic on me. Once done, I would feel obligated to buy one of these damned things because for some odd reason, I would feel guilty -- yeah, my hair would be kinda sorta straight (after awhile), but these things are expensive and really poorly made. It&#x27;s really not a good habit to waste money on rubbish, but I did it TWICE and bought two crappy flat irons from the mall! Lesson learned -- mall flat irons suck. The heat doesn&#x27;t hold and there is only TWO settings -- on or off. I really can&#x27;t believe I spent over $100 each on those suckers. I could have used that money on Starbucks or something, what a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My epiphany finally came when my hairdresser who I&#x27;ve been going to for over 5 years now told me that she prefers Cros. I went to a beauty supply wholesale place and fell in love with my first Croc. I&#x27;m now on my third one and my mother is on her second. I straighten my hair every day and the Croc makes it a quick and easy job. Best of all, it&#x27;s a wet to dry, so you can straighten your damp hair instead of having to either wait for it to dry completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature goes up to 410 degrees and feels very sturdy and well made. My first two Crocs ended up dying on me, but I ended up using both for several years and have no regrets; I will keep buying these things until they are no longer being manufactured. When my mother came to visit me and tried my Croc, she had to have one too. I got this cute pink Croc for her for Christmas and she is loving it.</li>
            <li> this is a great iron for straighting your hair the only problem i have had&lt;br /&gt;is it will out of the blue shut off periodictly</li>
            <li> I have always used a CHI in the past and was a little nervous about trying something new but i had heard great things about Croc so when my CHI died i gave this a shot. I absolutely love it!! my hair feels healthier. It also straightens my hair perfectly but does not take away from the volume. I never use it on wet hair but with my dry hair it styles perfectly. Very Happy!</li>
            <li> Expected more from this iron! Sucks do not order!</li>
            <li> Well lets just start off by saying this WAS a excellent straightener while it lasted (10 months). Plugged it in this morning and it was heating up then all of the sudden it just went out. So i check the outlet and it worked just fine.  At this point I was kind of pi$$d cause I had 40 min till I had to be in for work and I spent a 100 on this junk. Used maybe 1 to 2 times a week but still not a lot of use for 10 months. If I had used it everyday for 10 months then maybe it was worth the 100. But on a positive note I think I will jump on the CHI bandwagon and see how it does. As far as this straightener goes if u have the money to blow then this is for you, looks good, very smooth, but doesn&#x27;t meet durability. So I give it 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/14/2013 Update&lt;br /&gt;  Hi follow amazoner&#x27;s, my girl wrote this review so I&#x27;m here to follow up on it. First off she didn&#x27;t buy this, I bought it for her birthday cause I&#x27;m such a awesome guy, well atleast until that day. I was unfortunate enough to be around when all this happen, I guess since I bought it I was the bad guy that day, or maybe I have a smart mouth, either way the blame was on me. So she went to work and I was off that day, I figured what the heck, I will open it up and take a look at it. So here is the problem, when you open it up and take it apart you will see a 360 degree clear swivel in the back where the black cord meets, you will notice two wires going to it. Check these wires carefully for any lose connections, most likely this will be the problem. Now all you got to do is solder both of the wires to where they broke off at. Simple huh? Honestly it was not hard at all. I&#x27;m sure you women have awesome guys too that will take this apart and fix it. So remember don&#x27;t hate him on the day it breaks, hes not to blame. lol</li>
