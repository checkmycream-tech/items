            <li>I have yet to find a good CC cream</li>
            <li>Olay&#x27;s CC cream is a good product for its price.</li>
            <li>just feels good.</li>

            <li>Good color and moisturizers</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had a sample that gave me a look I loved.  </li>
            <li>Good, but it expires in April 2015.</li>

            <li>Good moisturizer with a touch of color.</li>

            <li>This has worked great for evening out my skin and feeling light.</li>

            <li>This stuff is awesome, provides light coverage, with moisturizer, and a light sunscreen, while correcting and evening out tone.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it&#x27;s nice that she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about putting on makeup since this has the tint incorporated.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>This product matches my skin perfectly and gives my skin a very youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because my friend was using it and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Great products that are well priced - Olay wins!</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth and the color is good.</li>
            <li>It is a bit oily, but it has a nice shade :)</li>
            <li>The shipping was also great my product arrived right away.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth.</li>
            <li>It is a very light moisturizer that gives my face a more even color and tone.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make me more oily or matte.</li>
            <li>So many say they are a tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this produce on amazon.</li>
            <li>I used Garnier bb cream, but needed more and Olay CC cream provides it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it,  </li>
            <li>I added some face powder on top to set it in.</li>
            <li>I just love the convenience and savings I fined on Amazon.com  </li>
            <li>but the BB cream is better.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is also protecting my skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my hands as well...  :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I really love this product .  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer; instead of wearing makeup I use this instead.</li>
            <li>Olay is getting more and more of my business and why not?</li>
            <li>I love this Tinted Moisturizer but</li>
            <li>your better than this</li>
            <li>It graciously blurred my acne scars and left me with that perfect dewy look</li>
            <li>I really love the way it looks on....</li>
            <li>I noticed no difference after putting this on, except that my face looked more oily.</li>
            <li>It is light and effective.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things.</li>
            <li>Love the sunscreen that is in it.  </li>
            <li>I love  this product.</li>
            <li>all it is claimed to be and more.</li>
            <li>Love this makeup....</li>
            <li>so light!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I read that the latest thing is CC cream, and BB creams are on their way out.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite day cream.</li>
            <li>Love that it has sunscreen</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to see it on Amazon</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, hard to find and the price was good.</li>
            <li>Initially I said that this product doesn&#x27;t give very good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I am becoming an Oil of Olay believer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels great on the face, and doesn&#x27;t impact my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the light coverage and have seen a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>And it really protects my skin from the hot sun of this beautiful paradise.</li>
            <li>Easily dispenses by pump.</li>
            <li>Warning: it does come off on tissues and towels, but I would think that&#x27;s true of most, if not all, toned moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Amazon makes it available and easy.</li>
            <li>I am light skinned black and this is the perfect color for me in winter.</li>
            <li>Coverage is good yet feels so light and natural.  </li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>Recently, I was out of town and used a Revlon product instead and was so happy to return to this creamy mixture when I got home.</li>
            <li>Light coverage without bieng cakey n greasy</li>
            <li>it did not go on smooth at all</li>
            <li>For me, it went on so smoothly, blending together all of my freckles and lack of tone.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin hydrated and smooth looking</li>
            <li>It is like a light foundation....</li>
            <li>It does go on smoothly but even the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Fantastic moisture effect and minimizes pours.</li>
            <li>It is a quick, easy, one step application.</li>
            <li>I knew the smell was familiar.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this product after reading so many positive remarks.</li>
            <li>Probably great on women with dry skin...</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with fine lines and some darker/reddish coloring near my nose and under my eyes and this is the first of many I have tried that really seems to do what it says.</li>
            <li>I live in Baja and the local Walmart doesn&#x27;t carry my favorite make-up, so you can imagine how happy I was to find this on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>good enough for day to day use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a great product and works extremely well.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer piece is adequate.</li>
            <li>I do not notice much of a difference in my tone, however I purchased for the sunscreen, which seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer really feels smooth and helps even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>love the natural coverage</li>
            <li>I dont&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but is nice to use in a daily basis, let&#x27;s see if I can get use to it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, nice &amp; light on the skin.</li>
            <li>And the color was right for me.</li>
            <li>This gives the right amount of coverage without the heaviness.  </li>
            <li>just right for the fall, winter, and spring.</li>
            <li>I use daily and love the lightweight feel but nice coverage....can easily wear alone without other foundation</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and lasts all day, providing a very natural look with no caking or heaviness.  </li>
            <li>I like the product because it is a nice light moisturizer that gives me a little color and coverage without looking like a foundation.</li>
            <li>I have to apply this cream really quickly because for a moisturizer it drys up fast and leaves my skin even dryer than it was in the beginning.</li>
            <li>Perfect tinted moisturizer - covers little blemishes but is not heavy and looks natural!</li>
            <li>It has color which helps when you first wash face in the morning before you get makeup on.  </li>
            <li>First one I used that blended in well and didn&#x27;t look like cover up make up.  </li>
            <li>and I love my Total Effects as well.  </li>
            <li>Better than that, my skin seems to be actually healthier from using this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have even tried some higher priced products and also this product combined with Cover Girl, but none come close.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 5 days and actually saw a notable difference.</li>
            <li>and you are ready to go!  </li>
            <li>A short tube that you could easily manipulate.</li>
            <li>but there isn&#x27;t usually much color-this is really like a foundation when it comes to color.</li>
            <li>this cream is too much a a cakey feeling on the skin</li>
            <li>all the drugstores only have the light</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use this, I won&#x27;t use this, as the day went on, it made my face very uncomforable.  </li>
            <li>I had to get a darker color, as the last one I ordered was too light.</li>
            <li>I think for that reason, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>So I try to not blend it in too much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in my skin tone like when I use foundation and it seems to cause some reddening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update - after using this for some months I do see an improvement and really do like the way it blends my skin tones.</li>
            <li>The acne scars are much lighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an everyday makeup wearing kind of gal, but absolutely always receive compliments whenever I use this product.  </li>
            <li>The previous version was very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Straightforward and simple.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, over the weeks I have been using it the dark spots have minimized and some are gone all together.</li>
            <li>It covers up imperfections better, and if I put this over a dark spot, you&#x27;d still see it.</li>
            <li>Somehow the full size doesn&#x27;t seem to go on the same way as the sample.  </li>
            <li>I love that it gives slight coverage.</li>
            <li>Glad to find this facial product at a lower rate than Target or my local drug store.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>Olay cc cream was highly rated in a magazine survey and since I use Olay products I decided to try.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find the medium-to-deep tone, so I was happy to see it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rough, doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I figured that if I add a small amount to regular foundation, it works great, but otherwise it&#x27;s not enough coverage on</li>
            <li>As I understand it, this is the new version of Difinity Color Correcion.</li>
            <li>My nose is usually darker cuz of more exposure I guess, but now my skin tone has evened out.</li>
            <li>But, I first apply my regular Olay moisturizer, and then I apply this over that...</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering it off line because I could not find the medium to deep tone in the stores.</li>
            <li>Not quite as dark as the original medium/dark.  </li>
            <li>This new product, Olay CC Cream, left my face very shiny.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy,  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m natural color</li>
            <li>I also have combination skin that is sensitive.</li>
            <li>Still, this is what I use and this is a far lower price than retail stores.</li>
            <li>Completely burned all skin on my face</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin, leaves me looking completely natural, with just a touch of color.</li>
            <li>but people with sensitive skin beware</li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t heavy and cakey.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Medium to Deep\\&quot; is really \\&quot;medium to deep TAN\\&quot;, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early forties</li>
            <li>Btw I am 73 years old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient to use this cream in the mornings, in one product you get 3 things moisturizer, color base and sunscreen, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>You can pay other colors in the store but &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; is only available on line.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased so many different moisturizers over the years from super expensive to drug store ones.</li>
            <li>I use deep dark and it has helped to keep my skin clear, smooth and soft for several years.</li>
            <li>the only make up I use, looks natural and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I am in my late 50&#x27;s and this product keeps skin supple and doesn&#x27;t settle in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>You can also apply your regular makeup over this moisturizer, and hence, end up using less foundation...or wear it by itself on those days when full makeup is not necessary, or wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about Gabriel Union&#x27;s skin tone and medium dark was just a little too light for me.</li>
            <li>The only true blending cream with my hard to match complexion.  </li>

            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make me more oily or matte.</li>
            <li> So many say they are a tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this produce on amazon.</li>
            <li> I used Garnier bb cream, but needed more and Olay CC cream provides it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it,  </li>
            <li> I added some face powder on top to set it in.</li>
            <li> I just love the convenience and savings I fined on Amazon.com  </li>
            <li> but the BB cream is better.</li>
            <li> I also love that it is also protecting my skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my hands as well...  :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> I really love this product .  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer; instead of wearing makeup I use this instead.</li>
            <li> Olay is getting more and more of my business and why not?</li>
            <li> I love this Tinted Moisturizer but</li>
            <li> your better than this</li>
            <li> It graciously blurred my acne scars and left me with that perfect dewy look</li>
            <li> I really love the way it looks on....</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference after putting this on, except that my face looked more oily.</li>
            <li> It is light and effective.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things.</li>
            <li> Love the sunscreen that is in it.  </li>
            <li> I love  this product.</li>
            <li> all it is claimed to be and more.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup....</li>
            <li> so light!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I read that the latest thing is CC cream, and BB creams are on their way out.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite day cream.</li>
            <li> Love that it has sunscreen</li>
            <li> so I was very excited to see it on Amazon</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, hard to find and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Initially I said that this product doesn&#x27;t give very good coverage.  </li>
            <li> I am becoming an Oil of Olay believer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels great on the face, and doesn&#x27;t impact my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the light coverage and have seen a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> And it really protects my skin from the hot sun of this beautiful paradise.</li>
            <li> Easily dispenses by pump.</li>
            <li> Warning: it does come off on tissues and towels, but I would think that&#x27;s true of most, if not all, toned moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Amazon makes it available and easy.</li>
            <li> I am light skinned black and this is the perfect color for me in winter.</li>
            <li> Coverage is good yet feels so light and natural.  </li>
            <li> Light.</li>
            <li> Recently, I was out of town and used a Revlon product instead and was so happy to return to this creamy mixture when I got home.</li>
            <li> Light coverage without bieng cakey n greasy</li>
            <li> it did not go on smooth at all</li>
            <li> For me, it went on so smoothly, blending together all of my freckles and lack of tone.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin hydrated and smooth looking</li>
            <li> It is like a light foundation....</li>
            <li> It does go on smoothly but even the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisture effect and minimizes pours.</li>
            <li> It is a quick, easy, one step application.</li>
            <li> I knew the smell was familiar.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this product after reading so many positive remarks.</li>
            <li> Probably great on women with dry skin...</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with fine lines and some darker/reddish coloring near my nose and under my eyes and this is the first of many I have tried that really seems to do what it says.</li>
            <li> I live in Baja and the local Walmart doesn&#x27;t carry my favorite make-up, so you can imagine how happy I was to find this on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> good enough for day to day use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a great product and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer piece is adequate.</li>
            <li> I do not notice much of a difference in my tone, however I purchased for the sunscreen, which seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer really feels smooth and helps even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> love the natural coverage</li>
            <li> I dont&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but is nice to use in a daily basis, let&#x27;s see if I can get use to it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, nice &amp; light on the skin.</li>
            <li> And the color was right for me.</li>
            <li> This gives the right amount of coverage without the heaviness.  </li>
            <li> just right for the fall, winter, and spring.</li>
            <li> I use daily and love the lightweight feel but nice coverage....can easily wear alone without other foundation</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and lasts all day, providing a very natural look with no caking or heaviness.  </li>
            <li> I like the product because it is a nice light moisturizer that gives me a little color and coverage without looking like a foundation.</li>
            <li> I have to apply this cream really quickly because for a moisturizer it drys up fast and leaves my skin even dryer than it was in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Perfect tinted moisturizer - covers little blemishes but is not heavy and looks natural!</li>
            <li> It has color which helps when you first wash face in the morning before you get makeup on.  </li>
            <li> First one I used that blended in well and didn&#x27;t look like cover up make up.  </li>
            <li> and I love my Total Effects as well.  </li>
            <li> Better than that, my skin seems to be actually healthier from using this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have even tried some higher priced products and also this product combined with Cover Girl, but none come close.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 days and actually saw a notable difference.</li>
            <li> and you are ready to go!  </li>
            <li> A short tube that you could easily manipulate.</li>
            <li> but there isn&#x27;t usually much color-this is really like a foundation when it comes to color.</li>
            <li> this cream is too much a a cakey feeling on the skin</li>
            <li> all the drugstores only have the light</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this, I won&#x27;t use this, as the day went on, it made my face very uncomforable.  </li>
            <li> I had to get a darker color, as the last one I ordered was too light.</li>
            <li> I think for that reason, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> So I try to not blend it in too much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in my skin tone like when I use foundation and it seems to cause some reddening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update - after using this for some months I do see an improvement and really do like the way it blends my skin tones.</li>
            <li> The acne scars are much lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an everyday makeup wearing kind of gal, but absolutely always receive compliments whenever I use this product.  </li>
            <li> The previous version was very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Straightforward and simple.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, over the weeks I have been using it the dark spots have minimized and some are gone all together.</li>
            <li> It covers up imperfections better, and if I put this over a dark spot, you&#x27;d still see it.</li>
            <li> Somehow the full size doesn&#x27;t seem to go on the same way as the sample.  </li>
            <li> I love that it gives slight coverage.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this facial product at a lower rate than Target or my local drug store.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Olay cc cream was highly rated in a magazine survey and since I use Olay products I decided to try.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find the medium-to-deep tone, so I was happy to see it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rough, doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I figured that if I add a small amount to regular foundation, it works great, but otherwise it&#x27;s not enough coverage on</li>
            <li> As I understand it, this is the new version of Difinity Color Correcion.</li>
            <li> My nose is usually darker cuz of more exposure I guess, but now my skin tone has evened out.</li>
            <li> But, I first apply my regular Olay moisturizer, and then I apply this over that...</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering it off line because I could not find the medium to deep tone in the stores.</li>
            <li> Not quite as dark as the original medium/dark.  </li>
            <li> This new product, Olay CC Cream, left my face very shiny.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy,  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m natural color</li>
            <li> I also have combination skin that is sensitive.</li>
            <li> Still, this is what I use and this is a far lower price than retail stores.</li>
            <li> Completely burned all skin on my face</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin, leaves me looking completely natural, with just a touch of color.</li>
            <li> but people with sensitive skin beware</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t heavy and cakey.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Medium to Deep\\&quot; is really \\&quot;medium to deep TAN\\&quot;, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early forties</li>
            <li> Btw I am 73 years old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient to use this cream in the mornings, in one product you get 3 things moisturizer, color base and sunscreen, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> You can pay other colors in the store but &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; is only available on line.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased so many different moisturizers over the years from super expensive to drug store ones.</li>
            <li> I use deep dark and it has helped to keep my skin clear, smooth and soft for several years.</li>
            <li> the only make up I use, looks natural and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and this product keeps skin supple and doesn&#x27;t settle in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> You can also apply your regular makeup over this moisturizer, and hence, end up using less foundation...or wear it by itself on those days when full makeup is not necessary, or wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about Gabriel Union&#x27;s skin tone and medium dark was just a little too light for me.</li>
            <li> The only true blending cream with my hard to match complexion.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that when you first put it on, it&#x27;s a bit shiny for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> It looks like you are wearing a super thick coat of sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, it left a very greasy feel with a very shiny nose, cheeks, &amp; chin.</li>
            <li> I have minor facial imperfections</li>
            <li> The bottle will last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> I just haven&#x27;t seen any long term effects that make me think it&#x27;s changing my skin tone, but it does even out tone while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> And since it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of it for me now, this tube lasts a long time-just over 2 months for me.</li>
            <li> As a diabetic, my skin has a tendency to be quite dry.  </li>
            <li> : all the dark spots look the same with the cream on.</li>
            <li> I only wish Oil of Olay made this product in Medium-Dark and/or Dark tint for us ladies with darker complexions.</li>
            <li> And the price is far less than I was paying previously at Walmart when I lived in the states.  </li>
            <li> I use it all way down to my neck ( front and back) and it evens out my skin color this way.</li>
            <li> the price on here is less than our local stores and then with the coupon offered here..</li>
            <li> My skin is very, very dry</li>
            <li> Easy to apply (one step with the combination of base color, sunscreen  &amp; moisturizer) lasts all day, and looks natural.</li>
            <li> It has great coverage, smooths over the nasty rough stuff, and doesn&#x27;t get all muddy.  </li>
            <li> I need to be careful not to over use this product or I get pimples.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought Aveno tinted moisturizer and it was what I expected form this product.</li>
            <li> I use the darker shade which is harder to find in the stores</li>
            <li> I s extremely hard-to-find.</li>
            <li> It feels silky and a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Color was slightly darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I also buy it locally but it gets hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I buy the med to dark.</li>
            <li> I like the CC cream, but the color that I bought was too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> I will use these under my darker foundation or until my tan is too dark.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and use it as a combination tinted moisturizer/makeup base.  </li>
            <li> this cuts down on the streaking</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m forced to use it as quickly as possible in order not to waste it.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars if there was a shade slightly darker than this, because it will make you look greyish if you are Angela Bassett&#x27;s complexion.</li>
            <li> I like this product except that when you rub it in, it ends up with little dark pieces like eraser dust.  </li>
            <li> BTW, I&#x27;m all-American white and not fair skinned expect during a winter when I didn&#x27;t get a Florida tan during the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 50, still very active, and don&#x27;t like heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> A little too funeral parlor.</li>
            <li> Just a little blush</li>
            <li> My skin is a little brighter.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used primer since using this, but I do use a little concealer.</li>
            <li> A little blush and eye makeup</li>
            <li> I have never like foundation because it always feels and looks too heavy.</li>
            <li> I just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The lightest shade went well with my very pale, very pink complexion.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a little past &amp;#34;BB&amp;#34;....and onto &amp;#34;CC.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not very effective in tone correcting.</li>
            <li> I have blotchiness/acne issues, i dont really break out too bad anymore and usually wear no makeup.</li>
            <li> Leaves a faint white, unnatural coloration to my skin after rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> They elongated the tube, created a spiral of the cream for no reason at all, and made it incredibly hard to press the applicator.  </li>
            <li> but it makes my skin look dull.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin dull looking.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cc cream to use as a foundation with spf, but turns out this is so oily and thick</li>
            <li> Its so unhealthy with all these parabens in them, I mean come on Olay</li>
            <li> It is very very thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically impossible to find it (medium/ dark) in stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the coverage; almost like I have no foundation at all.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed :/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use a heavy base since I have nothing to hide.</li>
            <li> Whenever I try an expensive department store foundation I am disappointed and return to this.</li>
            <li> Bad choice.</li>
            <li> I use it under my base and when I have a tan</li>
            <li> is a bit orangey -- need to have a brown base tint.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked!</li>
            <li> But I had an awful reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Awful awful awful .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Three months ago I would have given this a five.  I have used this cream now for a number of months and I have loved it.  It has great coverage, smooths over the nasty rough stuff, and doesn&#x27;t get all muddy.  HOWEVER, and it&#x27;s a big HOWEVER, they just changed their packaging.  The previous version was very easy to apply.  A short tube that you could easily manipulate. Straightforward and simple.  Recently, however, they decided to do something fancy.  They elongated the tube, created a spiral of the cream for no reason at all, and made it incredibly hard to press the applicator.  It&#x27;s a pain.  I love the stuff.  OLAY, WHY DID YOU DO THIS?</li>
            <li> Have used for years. Light. Blends well.etc.</li>
            <li> Only two colors but the product is very sheer.  I am in my late 50&#x27;s and this product keeps skin supple and doesn&#x27;t settle in fine lines.  SPF15 as well.</li>
            <li> This new product, Olay CC Cream, left my face very shiny.  I would recommend Sephora&#x27;s CC cream, instead. Save your money, pass this up.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It goes on smoothly, is a perfect shade, and superficially evens my skin tone. If you were hoping for a skin correcting toner, I&#x27;d suggest going elsewhere - I just haven&#x27;t seen any long term effects that make me think it&#x27;s changing my skin tone, but it does even out tone while it&#x27;s on. Recently, I was out of town and used a Revlon product instead and was so happy to return to this creamy mixture when I got home. Warning: it does come off on tissues and towels, but I would think that&#x27;s true of most, if not all, toned moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used.  The only true blending cream with my hard to match complexion.  Greek and Italian skin tone.  Nothing matched until now!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Christina</li>
            <li> GREAT deal...thank you!</li>
            <li> Light coverage without bieng cakey n greasy</li>
            <li> Color was slightly darker than I expected. Spreads well and is creamy.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years. I use it under my base and when I have a tan it has enough coverage to be used alone.</li>
            <li> I do not notice much of a difference in my tone, however I purchased for the sunscreen, which seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about Gabriel Union&#x27;s skin tone and medium dark was just a little too light for me. I prefer to have a darker than a lighter product. I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me more oily or matte. I set it with a powder  I use in the summer when I&#x27;m a lil darker and it balances the lightness of the product. I&#x27;ve been using for a week and I&#x27;ve noticed a change in my tone. My nose is usually darker cuz of more exposure I guess, but now my skin tone has evened out. Can&#x27;t wait to see what a month would do</li>
            <li> Great coverage. This moisturizer really feels smooth and helps even out my skin tone. I have fair skin with fine lines and some darker/reddish coloring near my nose and under my eyes and this is the first of many I have tried that really seems to do what it says. So many say they are a tinted moisturizer but there isn&#x27;t usually much color-this is really like a foundation when it comes to color. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for six years. The store I was buying it from stopped carrying it. I am so glad I found this produce on amazon. It is a great product and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> This continues to be my go to for moisturizer.  Has a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> love the natural coverage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the coverage; almost like I have no foundation at all.  I can&#x27;t attest to the sunscreen because that is something I haven&#x27;t depended on yet.  Moisturizer piece is adequate.</li>
            <li> Coverage is great but I feel like my face turned red over time as this product began to burn and although I had an even skintone, I looked like a tomato.. I have yet to find a good CC cream so I&#x27;m sticking to my Pond&#x27;s BB Cream which does not burn and provides medium coverage.</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s CC cream is a good product for its price. I used Garnier bb cream, but needed more and Olay CC cream provides it. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Color comes out blotchy.</li>
            <li> this cream is too much a a cakey feeling on the skin it did not go on smooth at all</li>
            <li> It has color which helps when you first wash face in the morning before you get makeup on.  It also helps keep the shades blended when you add makeup.  It is not heavy,  just feels good.</li>
            <li> just for brown skin,but I&#x27;m natural color</li>
            <li> I love it,  It met my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a great lightweight tinted moisturizer with SPF 15 in it. This color I s extremely hard-to-find. CVS only carries the lighter colors so I was very excited to see it on Amazon and it&#x27;s cheaper than it is anywhere else I&#x27;ve seen it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 50, still very active, and don&#x27;t like heavy makeup. This stuff is awesome, provides light coverage, with moisturizer, and a light sunscreen, while correcting and evening out tone. I love it!</li>
            <li> I am light skinned black and this is the perfect color for me in winter. I don&#x27;t know how well it will look this summer though. This is the darkest it gets. I also have combination skin that is sensitive. This has worked great for evening out my skin and feeling light. I don&#x27;t wear make-up so this is as close as I get. I am becoming an Oil of Olay believer.</li>
            <li> I have used this Olay product for years and it is a great moisturizer. I use  it alone ( like my no make days or going to the gym ) and also under my make up. I use deep dark and it has helped to keep my skin clear, smooth and soft for several years. I use it all way down to my neck ( front and back) and it evens out my skin color this way. I also buy it locally but it gets hard to find in stores. Only thing is it is cheaper in local stores than on line. But this price is still better than some of those expensive facial moisturizers that you buy at department makeup counters. And since it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of it for me now, this tube lasts a long time-just over 2 months for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient to use this cream in the mornings, in one product you get 3 things moisturizer, color base and sunscreen, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and I could not beat the price.  So we are both happy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect tinted moisturizer.....</li>
            <li> because this is the only place I can find my color med. to deep. all the drugstores only have the light</li>
            <li> I love this product, over the weeks I have been using it the dark spots have minimized and some are gone all together.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this product after reading so many positive remarks. For me, it went on so smoothly, blending together all of my freckles and lack of tone. I added some face powder on top to set it in. Unfortunately for me, it left a very greasy feel with a very shiny nose, cheeks, &amp; chin. I can&#x27;t use this, I won&#x27;t use this, as the day went on, it made my face very uncomforable.  Do NOT purchase this product if you have greasy skin. Probably great on women with dry skin... As for me, I have neither.</li>
            <li> Using it for years.....Keeps my skin hydrated and smooth looking</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, hard to find and the price was good.</li>
            <li> I used it one time and found myself allergic to something in the cream.  Wish i could return for a refund</li>
            <li> I had to get a darker color, as the last one I ordered was too light. But, I first apply my regular Olay moisturizer, and then I apply this over that...this cuts down on the streaking one may get if you just apply this moisturizer by itself. It is like a light foundation....but without the clogging effects of foundation. You can also apply your regular makeup over this moisturizer, and hence, end up using less foundation...or wear it by itself on those days when full makeup is not necessary, or wanted.</li>
            <li> First one I used that blended in well and didn&#x27;t look like cover up make up.  And the color was right for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother and shipped it to her. She immediately tried it. She says since beginning to use this product, she notices a difference in her skin. Her complexion has improved and some spots on her face seem to have improved. Furthermore, it&#x27;s nice that she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about putting on makeup since this has the tint incorporated. The only thing is that she has to wear additional sunscreen with it.</li>
            <li> The best tint I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Its not the same as the medium to deep I&#x27;ve bought before,It is a shade lighter and doesn;t look quite as good.</li>
            <li> I live in Baja and the local Walmart doesn&#x27;t carry my favorite make-up, so you can imagine how happy I was to find this on Amazon.com.  And the price is far less than I was paying previously at Walmart when I lived in the states.  I just love the convenience and savings I fined on Amazon.com  Oh . . . and I love my Total Effects as well.  It&#x27;s the best tone correcting moisturizer I&#x27;ve found.  And it really protects my skin from the hot sun of this beautiful paradise.</li>
            <li> I use daily and love the lightweight feel but nice coverage....can easily wear alone without other foundation</li>
            <li> I like the product because it is a nice light moisturizer that gives me a little color and coverage without looking like a foundation.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Have used for years. Easy to apply (one step with the combination of base color, sunscreen  &amp; moisturizer) lasts all day, and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I like it but the BB cream is better. It covers up imperfections better, and if I put this over a dark spot, you&#x27;d still see it. But I do believe it has a timely result, but that can not be proven. I think for that reason, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave home without it...  I love that it gives slight coverage. I have never like foundation because it always feels and looks too heavy. This gives the right amount of coverage without the heaviness.  I also love that it is also protecting my skin from sun damage. I apply it to my hands as well...  :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...the price on here is less than our local stores and then with the coupon offered here..it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> I need to be careful not to over use this product or I get pimples.</li>
            <li> Great cream for the price. Good color and moisturizers well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had a sample that gave me a look I loved.  Somehow the full size doesn&#x27;t seem to go on the same way as the sample.  I figured that if I add a small amount to regular foundation, it works great, but otherwise it&#x27;s not enough coverage on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Good, but it expires in April 2015. 1 tube lasts me about a year so I&#x27;m forced to use it as quickly as possible in order not to waste it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend well. I have minor facial imperfections and I thought this would give me a matte finish but it makes my skin look dull. A little too funeral parlor.</li>
            <li> I really love this product .  This was my first time ordering it off line because I could not find the medium to deep tone in the stores. This product matches my skin perfectly and gives my skin a very youthful appearance. The shipping was also great my product arrived right away. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer; instead of wearing makeup I use this instead. I like the fact it also has a sunscreen in it. I buy the med to dark.</li>
            <li> I like the CC cream, but the color that I bought was too dark for me.  I did see an improvement in my skin. I can wear this as my foundation .</li>
            <li> As a diabetic, my skin has a tendency to be quite dry.  The Olay CC Cream immediately moisturizes my skin without leaving my skin greasy.  In addition, the foundation leaves my skin tone looking even toned and flawless.  I&#x27;m told I look \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;, \\&quot;younger\\&quot;, \\&quot;radiant\\&quot; and \\&quot;happy\\&quot; whenever I use it.  I&#x27;m not an everyday makeup wearing kind of gal, but absolutely always receive compliments whenever I use this product.  Highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Different formula.  As I understand it, this is the new version of Difinity Color Correcion. Not quite as dark as the original medium/dark.  In some lighting, it almost seems a bit orange-y.  Still, this is what I use and this is a far lower price than retail stores.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Do no need any makeup with this.  Just a little blush and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Completely burned all skin on my face</li>
            <li> My skin is very, very dry and when I put this on under my foundation my skin looks and feel moist.  I also like that it has sunscreen built in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked! I bought this thinking it would be good, but this is great! It evens out my skin, leaves me looking completely natural, with just a touch of color. Better than that, my skin seems to be actually healthier from using this moisturizer. I have problematic skin, so this is great news for me! Olay is getting more and more of my business and why not? Great products that are well priced - Olay wins!</li>
            <li> not what I expected..i didn&#x27;t want sun screen and that&#x27;s what it is</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this Tinted Moisturizer but Its so unhealthy with all these parabens in them, I mean come on Olay your better than this</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and use it as a combination tinted moisturizer/makeup base.  It is easy to use and lasts all day, providing a very natural look with no caking or heaviness.  I like that it has SPF 15 sunscreen.  It is difficult to find the medium-to-deep tone, so I was happy to see it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Bad choice. I just wasted my money. I have to apply this cream really quickly because for a moisturizer it drys up fast and leaves my skin even dryer than it was in the beginning. The tint isn&#x27;t all that great either. It leaves my skin dull looking.</li>
            <li> I like this product except that when you rub it in, it ends up with little dark pieces like eraser dust.  So I try to not blend it in too much.  It goes on nice and smooth and the color is good.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin breakout. It is very very thick.</li>
            <li> So, this won&#x27;t show up as a &amp;#34;verified&amp;#34; review because my mother purchased it and I just tried it out. The lightest shade went well with my very pale, very pink complexion. It graciously blurred my acne scars and left me with that perfect dewy look I was striving for. I really love the way it looks on.... But I had an awful reaction to it. Two days later the skin on my face is still blotchy, itchy, and burning. I have never had a reaction like this before. Idk what in it made my skin do this but people with sensitive skin beware</li>
            <li> I dont&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but is nice to use in a daily basis, let&#x27;s see if I can get use to it.</li>
            <li> I am changing my review.  Initially I said that this product doesn&#x27;t give very good coverage.  However, two pumps rather than one gives good coverage, good enough for day to day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on the face, and doesn&#x27;t impact my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that when you first put it on, it&#x27;s a bit shiny for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I have blotchiness/acne issues, i dont really break out too bad anymore and usually wear no makeup. I noticed no difference after putting this on, except that my face looked more oily. Gross. Really disappointed :/</li>
            <li> It is light and effective.  Corrects all the dullness and discolouration, giving the skin a wonderful glow.  I love it</li>
            <li> Total Effects Tone Correcting Moisturizer is the best of this type of product.  I have even tried some higher priced products and also this product combined with Cover Girl, but none come close. Coverage is good yet feels so light and natural.  My skin looks younger, feels healthier, and is well-mositurized.  I hope that Oil of Olay continues to make this product!</li>
            <li> This is great light cover-up.  One of my favorite things.</li>
            <li> Terrific produact and purchase experience!</li>
            <li> the only make up I use, looks natural and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Love the sunscreen that is in it.  Moisturizer and toner all in one.  It comes in different shades for different times of the year when you skin is tan - or not.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected. It&#x27;s rough, doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. Leaves a faint white, unnatural coloration to my skin after rubbing it in. I don&#x27;t find my complexion to have smoothed out: all the dark spots look the same with the cream on.</li>
            <li> I love  this product. It&#x27;s practically impossible to find it (medium/ dark) in stores.  Amazon makes it available and easy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, nice &amp; light on the skin. Cheaper on-line. Good moisturizer with a touch of color. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Effective...does what I need!</li>
            <li> Only make up I use.good product for the price.</li>
            <li> It is a bit oily, but it has a nice shade :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product. all it is claimed to be and more.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t heavy and cakey. I like the automatic availability. No shopping  or driving required.</li>
            <li> I have be using this product since in came on the market.  It is wonderful.  It evens out my skin and has just enough color to tint my face.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup....so light!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in my skin tone like when I use foundation and it seems to cause some reddening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - after using this for some months I do see an improvement and really do like the way it blends my skin tones.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I read that the latest thing is CC cream, and BB creams are on their way out. While I do not buy into fads, I wanted to see if I could reduce blemishes from acne that I still get in my mid-40s. I have been using this product for 5 days and actually saw a notable difference. (African-American, similar complexion as Gabriel Union.) The acne scars are much lighter. My skin is a little brighter. Cream without added makeup gives a dewy appearance, not greasy. Since it is lighter than I am, I do not slather it on, but I do not use moisturizer under it either. Would give it 5 stars if there was a shade slightly darker than this, because it will make you look greyish if you are Angela Bassett&#x27;s complexion. \\&quot;Medium to Deep\\&quot; is really \\&quot;medium to deep TAN\\&quot;, in my opinion. I haven&#x27;t used primer since using this, but I do use a little concealer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this moisturizer. I use it every day under my makeup in the winter and in the summer, the tint is perfect and makeup isn&#x27;t needed. It feels silky and a little bit goes a very long way. The bottle will last you for a long time. LOVE it. I recommend it to everyone I know. I&#x27;m in my early forties so I&#x27;m a little past &amp;#34;BB&amp;#34;....and onto &amp;#34;CC.&amp;#34; (What&#x27;s next??...peels??)</li>
            <li> It has TINGLE in it !!!! I knew the smell was familiar. If you don&#x27;t know what tingle is in tanning it makes your skin red and blushed. Most people don&#x27;t like it. Awful awful awful . I bought Aveno tinted moisturizer and it was what I expected form this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect tinted moisturizer - covers little blemishes but is not heavy and looks natural! I wear it all day - every day.</li>
            <li> Great Seller and Love the Product</li>
            <li> This is great for days I don&#x27;t feel like getting all made up.  It is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because my friend was using it and liked it.  You can pay other colors in the store but &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; is only available on line.  I ordered 2 to save on shipping.  It does go on smoothly but even the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; is a bit orangey -- need to have a brown base tint.  I will use these under my darker foundation or until my tan is too dark. BTW, I&#x27;m all-American white and not fair skinned expect during a winter when I didn&#x27;t get a Florida tan during the summer.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday. It&#x27;s my favorite day cream. I don&#x27;t have to use a heavy base since I have nothing to hide. This works wonders on skin and helps with anti aging wile I&#x27;m not even thinking about it. Love that it has sunscreen also so I use it all summer too.</li>
            <li> This is not a cc cream for foundation. It is actually a moisturizer with spf. I was looking for a cc cream to use as a foundation with spf, but turns out this is so oily and thick I cant find any use for it for a day out. It looks like you are wearing a super thick coat of sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Olay cc cream was highly rated in a magazine survey and since I use Olay products I decided to try. I love the light coverage and have seen a noticeable difference in my skin. I am hooked.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this facial product at a lower rate than Target or my local drug store. I only wish Oil of Olay made this product in Medium-Dark and/or Dark tint for us ladies with darker complexions. (This has no bearing on Amazon.com). I am bi-racial Af. Am. and White and find the Medium tint just right for the fall, winter, and spring. It is a very light moisturizer that gives my face a more even color and tone. A very good product. Easily dispenses by pump.</li>
            <li> Not very effective in tone correcting. A shame that I am stuck with this.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. Whenever I try an expensive department store foundation I am disappointed and return to this. It is a quick, easy, one step application. Has a sunscreen, moisturizer, and gives enough coverage that you don&#x27;t need anything else!! A little blush and eye makeup and you are ready to go!  Btw I am 73 years old.</li>
            <li> I have purchased so many different moisturizers over the years from super expensive to drug store ones. I purchased this over a year ago when reading some reviews in a magazine about the benefits of cc cream.  Amazing! I use the darker shade which is harder to find in the stores so Amazon always has it. Beautiful coverage and color. No stinky smell. Fantastic moisture effect and minimizes pours. Lightweight and great for the day. I don&#x27;t use it at night and would recommend another product that is not tinted.</li>
