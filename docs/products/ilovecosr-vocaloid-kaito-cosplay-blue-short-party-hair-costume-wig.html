            <li>its so pretty and perfect</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I own a lot of cosplay wigs.</li>
            <li>In the end I liked this wig and will wear it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this was a nice deal for the price I got it at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is nice though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice wig, but when you stand in bright light it has this shiny look to it.</li>
            <li>A bit darker than what&#x27;s shown, but still super great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed very easily</li>
            <li>Not as spiky as the picture, but I&#x27;m sure it could style up nicely.</li>
            <li>Beautiful wig, very well made with a nice skull cap liner on the inside.  </li>
            <li>i love it, the fabric is  very good, the seller is responsive and considerate,the wig is very well made PLUS</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and this wig came with a free wig cap, which was a great bonus!  </li>
            <li>and I was so happy with this being my first wig.</li>
            <li>and i love the color</li>
            <li>The wig came in a zip top bag in the ILoveCos box.</li>
            <li>and I gotten better.</li>
            <li>The wig is a lot better quality</li>
            <li>It hides my hair and is just cute.</li>
            <li>Its way better than I thought.</li>
            <li>Now, to wait for the Cosplay outfit of Kaito Shion. :)</li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>Depending on who you&#x27;re cosplaying, it may need a bit of styling, like most wigs you order.</li>
            <li>Not terribly shiny either.</li>
            <li>otherwise i love it c:</li>
            <li>This wig is super cute!</li>
            <li>For the price, the quality is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Its actually very spike-friendly and kind of sticks up on its own</li>
            <li>Very nice and very soft.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>Its like hair but isn&#x27;t and in the light its a brilliant blue.</li>
            <li>It fits my model&#x27;s head just fine.</li>
            <li>Super cute.</li>
            <li>Good fit for an adult.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality wig, but the actual wig was much darker than in the photo.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t worry too much about the color , what I noticed that in the bright light it become more brighter and in the soft light</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so it fluffs out and just looks good in general.</li>
            <li>Original plans I was gonna cosplay Kaito for my con</li>
            <li>pictures of the original before, and after I styled it a bit.</li>
            <li>Decent quality, good amount of hair, colour is pretty close to the picture, and you can&#x27;t really see the netting unless, probably, you have very light hair.</li>
            <li>It is a nice bright blue, fairly easy to style, soft, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was easy to style &amp; so much fun to wear.</li>
            <li>I was able to create it without much exposure.</li>
            <li>Only get this wig if you&#x27;re good with styling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and a nice color, just a tad bit darker than shown in the image.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li>My daughter has bought other wigs from this seller with great results</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just not as great as the impression I got from other reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was pretty quick, too!</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t expect it to come quickly</li>
            <li>The customer service is great, they offered me a partial refund so I can purchase another wig of the right color.</li>
            <li>i reccommend it, it&#x27;s not bad and perfect, its long enough you can cut and style it</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of just wearing it around in public since it&#x27;s still a nice wig.</li>
            <li>Felt it was teh right color.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I wish, for the price, that the quality were a little better with more hair to look &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; like the picture shows.</li>
            <li>Wow, I cannot believe they sent such a well-made, beautiful wig for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>This wig is very nice, it&#x27;s very soft and realistic looking, but a way darker blue than in the picture, so I can&#x27;t make it work for a cosplay of Lapis Lazuli from Steven Universe.</li>
            <li>It looks quite natural (besides being bright blue!)</li>
            <li>Very fast, considering it&#x27;s from China.</li>
            <li>However, the company is very easy to work with and I would certainly order from them again in the future.  </li>
            <li>The wig seems pretty sturdy (though, I haven&#x27;t worn it very much as of now) and you can&#x27;t see the mesh at all.  </li>
            <li>True to picture, fluffy and bright, great for cosplays, casual wear or special events.</li>
            <li>It was really pretty.</li>
            <li>So this was my first wig</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and looks okay.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally love it, especially that it&#x27;s the exact color.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s probably just my face being big, once more.</li>
            <li>, it looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I noticed at the top it was super rough.</li>
            <li>Came in super early!</li>
            <li>You will have to style it yourself to get a similar look to photo, but that&#x27;s pretty easy with hair products.</li>
            <li>I recieved this in about 2 weeks&#x27; time after I placed the order.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is really soft and it&#x27;s quite flexible, though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for full out spiking if you&#x27;re planning on styling it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hid it, so it&#x27;s not a big problem.</li>
            <li>I like it alot, in the dark its a deep navyish type blue, other than that its awesome, excited to style it, and also excited to wear it.</li>
            <li>It got here at a pretty decent time before the convention too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>I also found that it sheds, it doesn&#x27;t like being touched too much.</li>
            <li>Very snug.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the size with internal straps, but it already fit quite snugly on my head (23.5&amp;#34; circumference).  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and pretty looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much shorter in the back than expected and where the hair all meet at the top of the head, it looks very cheap and there&#x27;s not enough hair there to cover the area.  </li>
            <li>wig fits snugly and is very much like the picture - just not styled (comes similar to a long bob), which I expected (and honestly what I prefer because I enjoy styling wigs).</li>
            <li>Inside Out cosplay, trying to add a cow lick to the top exposed the netting.</li>
            <li>the color was nice but it was way fluffier than expected and hard to style but looks a lot better with a hat on</li>
            <li>If you have long hair it won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>It was pretty shiny but that could be easily fixed.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a way to make them lie down with practice.</li>
            <li>It is my first wig and the color seems a little bit darker, but it is still fine.  </li>
            <li>Cute little wig for Seahawks &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34;, although took a while to arrive.</li>
            <li>the little vocaloid card, is cute and it says a lot about u  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a thick wig, and for sure needs a little work to help define the shape and style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve brought a few online but was never as satisfied  with the quality as I was with this one.</li>
            <li>The wig was a good length, but is thin and you can see the netting if you look close.</li>
            <li>The bangs are VERY long, and even if you&#x27;re going for a character that has hair a bit longer than Kaito&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll most likely have to trim the bangs.</li>
            <li>The wig on its own is a BIT darker than this picture shows, but only a LITTLE.</li>
            <li>I was new to buying things online</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to try another wig company to get a new wig-</li>
            <li>Fluffy, short, the layers are nice</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very soft.</li>
            <li>maybe a higher review if the wig was made higher quality and a bit longer like the other posts.</li>
            <li>is soft, the color is like the picture, and feels like hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been straightening it and trying to smooth it down but nothing Works.</li>
            <li>The wig itself was styled nicely but a little too long.</li>
            <li>The Inside of the wig is very uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t fit nicely on my head.</li>
            <li>I was kind of disappointed it was messed up at the top of the wig.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this wig if you have long hair, however, unless you are able to manage to get your hair into a thin extra layer on the top of your head.</li>
            <li>Much darker and not the same cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really soft and well made&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>what I needed this worked well, but for longevity or repeated usage I&#x27;d consider one that was in a professional range.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it is very snug, considering how big my head is.</li>
            <li>I personally won&#x27;t need to be styling, though, as I&#x27;ve bought this because of the reasonable price /</li>
            <li>so you have plenty of length to work with as far as styling goes.  </li>
            <li>It has a decent amount of layering and can be styled relatively simply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Colors the same but needs a lot of work to it to make it complete</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really look the way it is on the picture, other then that I like it</li>
            <li>Not dark enough for the picture to be misleading/discourage buying it for the color it displays.</li>
            <li>It is easy to style, and It came a few weeks earlier than expected, so</li>
            <li>, i got a a few hair nets included( i got short hair but its still a plus for those long-haired clients) though have to wait a while but its totaly worth it.  </li>

            <li> and I was so happy with this being my first wig.</li>
            <li> and i love the color</li>
            <li> The wig came in a zip top bag in the ILoveCos box.</li>
            <li> and I gotten better.</li>
            <li> The wig is a lot better quality</li>
            <li> It hides my hair and is just cute.</li>
            <li> Its way better than I thought.</li>
            <li> Now, to wait for the Cosplay outfit of Kaito Shion. :)</li>
            <li> I love this wig.</li>
            <li> Depending on who you&#x27;re cosplaying, it may need a bit of styling, like most wigs you order.</li>
            <li> Not terribly shiny either.</li>
            <li> otherwise i love it c:</li>
            <li> This wig is super cute!</li>
            <li> For the price, the quality is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Its actually very spike-friendly and kind of sticks up on its own</li>
            <li> Very nice and very soft.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Its like hair but isn&#x27;t and in the light its a brilliant blue.</li>
            <li> It fits my model&#x27;s head just fine.</li>
            <li> Super cute.</li>
            <li> Good fit for an adult.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality wig, but the actual wig was much darker than in the photo.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t worry too much about the color , what I noticed that in the bright light it become more brighter and in the soft light</li>
            <li> The quality is amazing and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so it fluffs out and just looks good in general.</li>
            <li> Original plans I was gonna cosplay Kaito for my con</li>
            <li> pictures of the original before, and after I styled it a bit.</li>
            <li> Decent quality, good amount of hair, colour is pretty close to the picture, and you can&#x27;t really see the netting unless, probably, you have very light hair.</li>
            <li> It is a nice bright blue, fairly easy to style, soft, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was easy to style &amp; so much fun to wear.</li>
            <li> I was able to create it without much exposure.</li>
            <li> Only get this wig if you&#x27;re good with styling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and a nice color, just a tad bit darker than shown in the image.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li> My daughter has bought other wigs from this seller with great results</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not as great as the impression I got from other reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was pretty quick, too!</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect it to come quickly</li>
            <li> The customer service is great, they offered me a partial refund so I can purchase another wig of the right color.</li>
            <li> i reccommend it, it&#x27;s not bad and perfect, its long enough you can cut and style it</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of just wearing it around in public since it&#x27;s still a nice wig.</li>
            <li> Felt it was teh right color.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I wish, for the price, that the quality were a little better with more hair to look &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Wow, I cannot believe they sent such a well-made, beautiful wig for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> This wig is very nice, it&#x27;s very soft and realistic looking, but a way darker blue than in the picture, so I can&#x27;t make it work for a cosplay of Lapis Lazuli from Steven Universe.</li>
            <li> It looks quite natural (besides being bright blue!)</li>
            <li> Very fast, considering it&#x27;s from China.</li>
            <li> However, the company is very easy to work with and I would certainly order from them again in the future.  </li>
            <li> The wig seems pretty sturdy (though, I haven&#x27;t worn it very much as of now) and you can&#x27;t see the mesh at all.  </li>
            <li> True to picture, fluffy and bright, great for cosplays, casual wear or special events.</li>
            <li> It was really pretty.</li>
            <li> So this was my first wig</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive and looks okay.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally love it, especially that it&#x27;s the exact color.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably just my face being big, once more.</li>
            <li> , it looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I noticed at the top it was super rough.</li>
            <li> Came in super early!</li>
            <li> You will have to style it yourself to get a similar look to photo, but that&#x27;s pretty easy with hair products.</li>
            <li> I recieved this in about 2 weeks&#x27; time after I placed the order.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is really soft and it&#x27;s quite flexible, though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for full out spiking if you&#x27;re planning on styling it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hid it, so it&#x27;s not a big problem.</li>
            <li> I like it alot, in the dark its a deep navyish type blue, other than that its awesome, excited to style it, and also excited to wear it.</li>
            <li> It got here at a pretty decent time before the convention too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> I also found that it sheds, it doesn&#x27;t like being touched too much.</li>
            <li> Very snug.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the size with internal straps, but it already fit quite snugly on my head (23.5&amp;#34; circumference).  </li>
            <li> It is very soft and pretty looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much shorter in the back than expected and where the hair all meet at the top of the head, it looks very cheap and there&#x27;s not enough hair there to cover the area.  </li>
            <li> wig fits snugly and is very much like the picture - just not styled (comes similar to a long bob), which I expected (and honestly what I prefer because I enjoy styling wigs).</li>
            <li> Inside Out cosplay, trying to add a cow lick to the top exposed the netting.</li>
            <li> the color was nice but it was way fluffier than expected and hard to style but looks a lot better with a hat on</li>
            <li> If you have long hair it won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> It was pretty shiny but that could be easily fixed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a way to make them lie down with practice.</li>
            <li> It is my first wig and the color seems a little bit darker, but it is still fine.  </li>
            <li> Cute little wig for Seahawks &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34;, although took a while to arrive.</li>
            <li> the little vocaloid card, is cute and it says a lot about u  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a thick wig, and for sure needs a little work to help define the shape and style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve brought a few online but was never as satisfied  with the quality as I was with this one.</li>
            <li> The wig was a good length, but is thin and you can see the netting if you look close.</li>
            <li> The bangs are VERY long, and even if you&#x27;re going for a character that has hair a bit longer than Kaito&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll most likely have to trim the bangs.</li>
            <li> The wig on its own is a BIT darker than this picture shows, but only a LITTLE.</li>
            <li> I was new to buying things online</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to try another wig company to get a new wig-</li>
            <li> Fluffy, short, the layers are nice</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very soft.</li>
            <li> maybe a higher review if the wig was made higher quality and a bit longer like the other posts.</li>
            <li> is soft, the color is like the picture, and feels like hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening it and trying to smooth it down but nothing Works.</li>
            <li> The wig itself was styled nicely but a little too long.</li>
            <li> The Inside of the wig is very uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t fit nicely on my head.</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed it was messed up at the top of the wig.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this wig if you have long hair, however, unless you are able to manage to get your hair into a thin extra layer on the top of your head.</li>
            <li> Much darker and not the same cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really soft and well made&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> what I needed this worked well, but for longevity or repeated usage I&#x27;d consider one that was in a professional range.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it is very snug, considering how big my head is.</li>
            <li> I personally won&#x27;t need to be styling, though, as I&#x27;ve bought this because of the reasonable price /</li>
            <li> so you have plenty of length to work with as far as styling goes.  </li>
            <li> It has a decent amount of layering and can be styled relatively simply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Colors the same but needs a lot of work to it to make it complete</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really look the way it is on the picture, other then that I like it</li>
            <li> Not dark enough for the picture to be misleading/discourage buying it for the color it displays.</li>
            <li> It is easy to style, and It came a few weeks earlier than expected, so</li>
            <li> , i got a a few hair nets included( i got short hair but its still a plus for those long-haired clients) though have to wait a while but its totaly worth it.  </li>
            <li> the sides near the front went all the way down to my shoulders.</li>
            <li> My friend, who&#x27;s a professional cosplayer, agrees that the hair is really long and recommends I cut it a little.</li>
            <li> I think that a style that requires volume and dimension would work better for this wig instead of crazy gravity defying hair styles.</li>
            <li> Though the hair is really long and gets in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Also it took a really long time to get here</li>
            <li> If I had to say something negative is that a few strands of hair falls out once in a while, but I think that&#x27;s my own fault because I&#x27;m a bit rough even when handling delicate things.</li>
            <li> The bangs are very LONG and UNSTYLED</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an average size female (s/m) and</li>
            <li> In fact I previously ordered a wig specifically made for cosplaying Rei and this wig might as well be the same wig.</li>
            <li> I have to note: the shade of blue is a slight bit darker.</li>
            <li> So much darker than in the picture, and it has a very awkward shape so it will not lay right, leaving your hairline exposed and an awkward pocket at the back of the hair, and if you pull it so it actually lines up on the front of your head, the top wig is to far forward and looks unrealistic, and then the hair at your neck is exposed, wigcap or not.</li>
            <li> A little bit short,</li>
            <li> The only thing I was afraid of was the netting exposure, but that&#x27;s only if someone came up and really wanted to examine and criticize the wig.</li>
            <li> The wig came as expected.</li>
            <li> Also it comes in only a few days!</li>
            <li> I got some fall out in small clumps, but I don&#x27;t think that necessarily effected the look.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as clumpy or fluffy as the picture.  </li>
            <li> It felt very rough.</li>
            <li> the color is nothing like the picture, its too dark.</li>
            <li> It is not styled like the shown, and the bangs were oddly longer than most base bangs.</li>
            <li> However, it took less than two weeks to arrive - over a week before Christmas.</li>
            <li> There are also slots for horns or ears to poke through, which means the straps or connectors could be easily hidden beneath the wig.</li>
            <li> The picture is after the wig has been cut and slightly styled</li>
            <li> I have black hair and have never had anyone immediately notice it&#x27;s a wig.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit longer, and it curls out in the sides slightly.</li>
            <li> Also you can see the black wig cap through it a bit, but it makes it look like highlights.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> not sure why being asked to review this item since the order was cancelled.  </li>
            <li> about this wig is that it&#x27;s quite small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way too small for my head.  </li>
            <li> Was too small.</li>
            <li> Styling proved to be difficult due to the thin layers.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s really thin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m kinda disappointed that its so dark because I bought it expecting the color in the picture.</li>
            <li> It sticks up in some weird places</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know maybe I got the wrong wig but</li>
            <li> And unfortunately I am bad at styling wigs so this is bad for me.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not my worst purchase.</li>

            <li> I ordered this wig as a Christmas gift, knowing that the estimated delivery date would be in January since the product comes from China. However, it took less than two weeks to arrive - over a week before Christmas. Score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig fits snugly and is very much like the picture - just not styled (comes similar to a long bob), which I expected (and honestly what I prefer because I enjoy styling wigs). And there&#x27;s definitely enough to work with to style it like the picture or similarly. It feels very nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, good price, good shipping, good buy.</li>
            <li> Cute little wig for Seahawks &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34;, although took a while to arrive.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality wig, but the actual wig was much darker than in the photo.</li>
            <li> Its a great quality but the color is nothing like the picture, its too dark. Its almost like its not even the same wig. I bought it for a 2D cosplay (from gorillaz) and was expecting the color in the picture. The one I received would be great for Rei Ryugazaki (from Free!). In fact I previously ordered a wig specifically made for cosplaying Rei and this wig might as well be the same wig. I&#x27;m not too picky on color but I&#x27;m kinda disappointed that its so dark because I bought it expecting the color in the picture.</li>
            <li> good quality wig for this price, worked very nicely for my costume</li>
            <li> Great wig! Only problem is its darker than the picture provided.</li>
            <li> Not styled like this but still a good wig. Felt it was teh right color.</li>
            <li> This wig was amazing, perfect for cosplaying as my character Nikita! It is a nice bright blue, fairly easy to style, soft, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it, it even came with the hairnet, so that makes it even better.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was pretty quick, too!</li>
            <li> i was planning to buy this wig&lt;br /&gt;but my question is does the wig come already styled?&lt;br /&gt;is it the same as the picture shown</li>
            <li> Amazing wig! It is well made and beautiful! Good fit for an adult.</li>
            <li> Did not look like the picture. Much darker and not the same cut.</li>
            <li> Its a beautiful wig and i love the color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much shorter in the back than expected and where the hair all meet at the top of the head, it looks very cheap and there&#x27;s not enough hair there to cover the area.  I wish, for the price, that the quality were a little better with more hair to look &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> great quality and just as it looks in the picture</li>
            <li> Needs styling if it&#x27;s going to be used for Kaito but a good wig.</li>
            <li> Colors the same but needs a lot of work to it to make it complete</li>
            <li> It is great! absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> It was really pretty. I own a lot of cosplay wigs. I&#x27;ve brought a few online but was never as satisfied  with the quality as I was with this one. I really is a wonderful wig and the shipping was a lot faster them it said.</li>
            <li> The wig surprisingly keeps it shape. Really good quality even comes with a hairnet. Though the hair is really long and gets in my eyes. My friend, who&#x27;s a professional cosplayer, agrees that the hair is really long and recommends I cut it a little. Still a good wig though, and at a fair price too. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The wig came in a zip top bag in the ILoveCos box. Included a wig cap, which all wig purchases should include. The wig was a good length, but is thin and you can see the netting if you look close. Styling proved to be difficult due to the thin layers. I also found that it sheds, it doesn&#x27;t like being touched too much. I was using this for a Joy Inside Out cosplay, trying to add a cow lick to the top exposed the netting. I was able to create it without much exposure. I think that a style that requires volume and dimension would work better for this wig instead of crazy gravity defying hair styles. The fit was perfect and and it didn&#x27;t slide or feel like it cut off circulation. The only thing I was afraid of was the netting exposure, but that&#x27;s only if someone came up and really wanted to examine and criticize the wig. In the end I liked this wig and will wear it again.</li>
            <li> I was new to buying things online and I gotten better. So this was my first wig and I was so happy with this being my first wig. The quality is amazing and I highly recommend. The color is great. If I had to say something negative is that a few strands of hair falls out once in a while, but I think that&#x27;s my own fault because I&#x27;m a bit rough even when handling delicate things. ^-^ Overall it&#x27;s amazing and you have no worries about buying this product. Also it comes in only a few days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected it to be. Fluffy, short, the layers are nice so it fluffs out and just looks good in general. I have to note: the shade of blue is a slight bit darker. It&#x27;s not that noticeable though. The wig is a lot better quality then I thought it would be. It hides my hair and is just cute. If you&#x27;re contemplating on getting this wig, get it. Like- ORDER IT NOW it&#x27;s really great. Just. Do it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to feel about it. Its really short and I&#x27;ve been fighting with it. I noticed at the top it was super rough. It wasn&#x27;t very soft. It felt very rough. I&#x27;ve been straightening it and trying to smooth it down but nothing Works. The Inside of the wig is very uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t fit nicely on my head. Although it&#x27;s not my worst purchase. I just felt like I got the runt. Original plans I was gonna cosplay Kaito for my con which is this Saturday- I guess I&#x27;ll have to ditch the wig. I&#x27;ll have to try another wig company to get a new wig- maybe a higher review if the wig was made higher quality and a bit longer like the other posts. :/</li>
            <li> not sure why being asked to review this item since the order was cancelled.  However, the company is very easy to work with and I would certainly order from them again in the future.  And I think this wig is very cute!  My daughter has bought other wigs from this seller with great results</li>
            <li> I am planning on using this (it needs some styling done) for an upcoming cosplay shoot. It fits my model&#x27;s head just fine. There are also slots for horns or ears to poke through, which means the straps or connectors could be easily hidden beneath the wig.</li>
            <li> True to picture, fluffy and bright, great for cosplays, casual wear or special events. Amazing price, so happy with this.</li>
            <li> I recieved this in about 2 weeks&#x27; time after I placed the order.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is really soft and it&#x27;s quite flexible, though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for full out spiking if you&#x27;re planning on styling it that way.&lt;br /&gt;Cons about this wig is that it&#x27;s quite small. It was pretty shiny but that could be easily fixed. The back was a bit too short too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this was a nice deal for the price I got it at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s pictures of the original before, and after I styled it a bit.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and pretty looking. It is not styled like the shown, and the bangs were oddly longer than most base bangs. It is easy to style, and It came a few weeks earlier than expected, so yay. The picture is after the wig has been cut and slightly styled</li>
            <li> The wig itself was styled nicely but a little too long. I had to cut it. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> The wig came as expected. It has a decent amount of layering and can be styled relatively simply. It is a good wig for the cost and survived a night of intensive dancing. It doesn&#x27;t shed very easily so i&#x27;d recommend this if you need a wig.</li>
            <li> Great wig! Great price</li>
            <li> Amazing !!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this for a fairy tail cosplay and I lovvvved it&lt;br /&gt;It is really soft and well made&lt;br /&gt;And the color is just like the picture&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t worry too much about the color , what I noticed that in the bright light it become more brighter and in the soft light it looks a bit darker</li>
            <li> Looks Great and is very comfortable</li>
            <li> It sticks up in some weird places but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a way to make them lie down with practice.</li>
            <li> The price is right. It&#x27;s not expensive and looks okay.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a thick wig, and for sure needs a little work to help define the shape and style. I got some fall out in small clumps, but I don&#x27;t think that necessarily effected the look.&lt;br /&gt;For what I needed this worked well, but for longevity or repeated usage I&#x27;d consider one that was in a professional range. But, it&#x27;s not bad... it&#x27;s just not as great as the impression I got from other reviews.</li>
            <li> For the price, the quality is pretty good.  It&#x27;s not nearly as clumpy or fluffy as the picture.  I&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars because it&#x27;s tiny.  I&#x27;m an average size female (s/m) and it&#x27;s way too small for my head.  I imagine this is a kids wig.</li>
            <li> Got this for my Ayato Kirishima (Tokyo Ghoul) cosplay. Its way better than I thought. Its actually very spike-friendly and kind of sticks up on its own so if I ever need it for another cosplay that requires im happy to have that option. It got here at a pretty decent time before the convention too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!-NOTE-!!! The wig on its own is a BIT darker than this picture shows, but only a LITTLE. Not dark enough for the picture to be misleading/discourage buying it for the color it displays.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig, very well made with a nice skull cap liner on the inside.  So happy and with the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Decent quality, good amount of hair, colour is pretty close to the picture, and you can&#x27;t really see the netting unless, probably, you have very light hair. I have black hair and have never had anyone immediately notice it&#x27;s a wig.</li>
            <li> Awesome wig. It was easy to style &amp; so much fun to wear. Super cute. Looks how you think it would from the picture.</li>
            <li> So much darker than in the picture, and it has a very awkward shape so it will not lay right, leaving your hairline exposed and an awkward pocket at the back of the hair, and if you pull it so it actually lines up on the front of your head, the top wig is to far forward and looks unrealistic, and then the hair at your neck is exposed, wigcap or not.</li>
            <li> i love it, the fabric is  very good, the seller is responsive and considerate,the wig is very well made PLUS, i got a a few hair nets included( i got short hair but its still a plus for those long-haired clients) though have to wait a while but its totaly worth it.  Thank u meilifang and i hope u the best,  P.S  the little vocaloid card, is cute and it says a lot about u  (its speak we are considerate of our buyers) again  meilifang , i hope u all the best!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the wig!! I have a con in a week and thankfully it arrived on time to I&#x27;m happy!~ ^^&lt;br /&gt;It may take a while to arrive but it&#x27;s totally worth the wait(plus the free wig cap is awesome)! I&#x27;m definitely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This wig is great. Not as spiky as the picture, but I&#x27;m sure it could style up nicely. It looks quite natural (besides being bright blue!) and lays well. Would recommend to anyone who needs an amine touch</li>
            <li> this wig is so awesome!! is soft, the color is like the picture, and feels like hair! the hair cut is very sexy to, so if you wanted to buy it, DO IT!</li>
            <li> Got this in three weeks ahead. Very fast, considering it&#x27;s from China. Got this today, and it&#x27;s been 19 days. I personally love it, especially that it&#x27;s the exact color. It&#x27;s not styled how the picture is, but hey! Leaves room for preference. Honestly, it is very snug, considering how big my head is. I don&#x27;t recommend this wig if you have long hair, however, unless you are able to manage to get your hair into a thin extra layer on the top of your head. Very snug. A little bit short, but that&#x27;s probably just my face being big, once more. For the price, it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s really good quality and fits nicely. Now, to wait for the Cosplay outfit of Kaito Shion. :)</li>
            <li> This is a better-quality item than the price point would imply.</li>
            <li> I love it! You will have to style it yourself to get a similar look to photo, but that&#x27;s pretty easy with hair products. I got extensions to go along with that color.</li>
            <li> Was too small. If you have long hair it won&#x27;t fit. Also it&#x27;s really thin.</li>
            <li> I like it alot, in the dark its a deep navyish type blue, other than that its awesome, excited to style it, and also excited to wear it. Its like hair but isn&#x27;t and in the light its a brilliant blue.</li>
            <li> This wig is very nice, it&#x27;s very soft and realistic looking, but a way darker blue than in the picture, so I can&#x27;t make it work for a cosplay of Lapis Lazuli from Steven Universe. I&#x27;m thinking of just wearing it around in public since it&#x27;s still a nice wig. The customer service is great, they offered me a partial refund so I can purchase another wig of the right color.</li>
            <li> This wig is super cute! I was kind of disappointed it was messed up at the top of the wig. Sort of unbrushed and tangled. Since I&#x27;m wearing a beanie over it, it&#x27;s not a big issue. Other than that, it&#x27;s awesome. (:</li>
            <li> For the price and quality, it will do the job. It is my first wig and the color seems a little bit darker, but it is still fine.  The wig cap I got wasn&#x27;t good though, so I will have to go purchase another one!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this purchase, and would recommend it. Excellent quality, well made, would give it as a gift with confidence.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my Ayato cosplay! Just need a bit of trimming and you&#x27;re good to go! I love this wig.</li>
            <li> The only thing that looked like the picture was the color. I don&#x27;t know maybe I got the wrong wig but the sides near the front went all the way down to my shoulders. And unfortunately I am bad at styling wigs so this is bad for me. Only get this wig if you&#x27;re good with styling. The color is nice though. Also it took a really long time to get here so don&#x27;t expect it to come quickly, order ahead of time.</li>
            <li> the color was nice but it was way fluffier than expected and hard to style but looks a lot better with a hat on</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Top quality and excellent service . Thank you</li>
            <li> Great wig! Came in super early! Depending on who you&#x27;re cosplaying, it may need a bit of styling, like most wigs you order. It&#x27;s a bit longer, and it curls out in the sides slightly. The bangs are VERY long, and even if you&#x27;re going for a character that has hair a bit longer than Kaito&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll most likely have to trim the bangs. A bit darker than what&#x27;s shown, but still super great. I personally won&#x27;t need to be styling, though, as I&#x27;ve bought this because of the reasonable price / I just wanted a blue wig that I could wear.</li>
            <li> Wow, I cannot believe they sent such a well-made, beautiful wig for such a cheap price. Very high quality. What you see is what you get, it looks exactly like the picture. Love it!!</li>
            <li> its so pretty and perfect i reccommend it, it&#x27;s not bad and perfect, its long enough you can cut and style it however you want. the color&#x27;s like shown.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Haven&#x27;t tried any heat styling or washing. Not terribly shiny either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig, but when you stand in bright light it has this shiny look to it. Also you can see the black wig cap through it a bit, but it makes it look like highlights. It&#x27;s easy to hid it, so it&#x27;s not a big problem. It&#x27;s soft and a nice color, just a tad bit darker than shown in the image.</li>
            <li> Very nice and very soft.  The bangs are very LONG and UNSTYLED so you have plenty of length to work with as far as styling goes.  The bangs go to the end of my nose.  The wig seems pretty sturdy (though, I haven&#x27;t worn it very much as of now) and you can&#x27;t see the mesh at all.  You can adjust the size with internal straps, but it already fit quite snugly on my head (23.5&amp;#34; circumference).  Shipping was fast and this wig came with a free wig cap, which was a great bonus!  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Just Needed a bit styling&lt;br /&gt;But otherwise i love it c:</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really look the way it is on the picture, other then that I like it</li>
